The major objectives of investing in the banking sector are to provide financial services to the economy and earn compensatory returns on capital employed. The evolution of banking in Nigeria has been brought to fore in order to study deep into the history of banking and bring out the challenges that led to the various crisis the industry has been passing through within the past few years. In some times past, the banking industry was affected as a result of the belief of shareholders, stakeholders, managers and others where unethical practices were portrayed (Adekunle and Asaolu, 2013).\n\nBanks are established for the purpose of provided various financial services to the general public. Their intermediation role through financial reporting, credit facility and information is a catalyst for business activities in an economy. Consequently, banks credit for productive endeavours provides the public and real sector with necessary financial resources needed to accelerate the nation’s growth and economic sustainability. Their credit function enhances the ability of investors to exploit desired profitable ventures (Kargi, 2011).\n\nThe main drive of ethical practice and ethical values is the upholding of professionalism and good practice. Ethical practice in the business world according to Micewski and Troy (2006) is not holistic, but is a context that considers any phenomenon that influences ones behaviour. In most organisations in the world, the largest ethical practice in the accounting process is accountability, integrity and how an employee can abide to existing rules and regulation in the organisation (Gomez, 2002). The breach of ethical rules in the practice of corporate financial reporting is not fair to users and such action can jeopardize the main objective of the financial reports (Gowthorpe and Amat, 2005). Brinkmann (2002) defined ethics as a discipline in which matter of right and wrong, good and evil, virtue and vice are methodically examined. Ethics looks at human behaviour, moral principles and the attempt to distinguish good from bad. When trying to identify common issues being dealt with within the business environment, professional bodies’ codes of ethics is the right place to look. These codes represent what one considers as reflection of business ethics. Codes of ethics should mainly address the particularities of high risk activities and are built on the collective conscience of a profession as a proof for the group’s acknowledgment of the moral dimension. According to Smith and Smith (2003), ethical practice provide the foundation on which a civilized society exists. For the financial institutions, the retention of public confidence through the enthronement of good corporate governance remains of almost importance given the role of the industry in the mobilization of fund, the allocation of credit to the deficit sectors of the economy, the payment and settlement system and the implementation of monetary policy.\n\n1.2       Statement of the Problem\n\nThere is no gainsaying that the present economy deserves a sound, stable and better banking performance following the causative factors, such as unethical and unprofessional practices, poor management quality among others which contributed to low level of bank performance and sometimes lead to failure of bank. Banks and other financial intermediaries play the important role of channeling funds from savers to borrowers. The traditional role of a bank is lending and loans make up the bulk of their assets.  Bank failures in Nigeria and other emerging economies have been attributed to different practices on the ethical ground. Ethical practices are rules of behaviour exhibited by managers, shareholders, workers and stakeholders to decide what is right and wrong in the normal course of business to the growth and financial stability of an organisation and to promote the financial markets integrity and economic efficiency of the business (Ogbona and Ebimobowei, 2012). This practice is important for producing quality and reliable financial reports to investors, potential investors and all stakeholders. An ethical dilemma has, overtime bedeviled the Nigerian banking industry couple with poor system in the organisation. Inaccurate/poor reporting of financial performance to shareholders, the government and the public have eroded the level of confidence of these stakeholders (Chen and Pan, 2012). The lack of proper accountability and transparency in the production of financial returns has also eroded the confidence of investors and the public - leading to lack of accountability, independence, fairness and transparency. There is sufficient empirical evidence that poor financial reporting manifested in banks is as a result of neglect of good ethical considerations which led to lack of transparency, poor accountability, fraud, insider abuse, high levels of credit risk, poor quality loans, limited and or inadequate capitalization, operational inefficiencies, higher incidences of non-performing loans, higher levels of liquidity risk, and so on which in the overall affected financial reporting system (Kargi, 2011).  Although, these are mentioned as constraints affecting banks’ financial statement, they are based on a few studies and non-elaborate methods to generate sufficient and valid conclusions. This study therefore becomes an extension of the few studies undertaken with a view to generating more and further information based on empirical evidence on deposit money banks, however, this study sought to examine the effect of ethical practices on the financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria.\n\n1.3       Objectives of the Study\n\nThe general objective of this study is to examine the effect of ethical practices on the financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria.\n\nThe specific objectives are to;\n\nexamine the effect of integrity and reputation on the financial reporting of deposit money banks  in Nigeria.\nexamine the effect of accountability and honesty on the financial reporting of deposit money banks  in Nigeria.\nassess the effect of fairness on the financial reporting of deposit money banks  in Nigeria.\ndetermine the effect of Law abiding on the Financial reporting of deposit money banks  in Nigeria.\nestablish the effect of loyalty on the financial reporting of deposit money banks  in Nigeria.\n1.4       Research Questions\n\nWhat is the effect of integrity and reputation on financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria?\nHow do accountability and honesty affect the financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria?\nDoes fairness have effect on financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria?\nHow does law abiding affects the financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria?\nWhat is the effect staff loyalty on financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria?\n1.6       Significance of the Study\n\nGood ethical practice provides fundamental information of financial statement to a wide range of use to policy makers in both public and private sectors of the economy banks inclusive – shareholders, management, government, creditors and society at large.
