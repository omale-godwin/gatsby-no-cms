In this work, I shall look at the type of language use in olokun in Edo language, attempt shall be made to look at the different types of language used by the oraclist in divination and the use of proverbs when communicating in Edo language. <br/>    The language of olokun has been neglected before now and it has not been given much attention by scholars or language students when analyzing language. the people believe that the language is known, spoken and understood by the oraclist alone, it is therefore regarded as a language which is designed and cultivated by the oraclist. However, the attitude toward the study of the language use of olokun is not exclusive to the Edo alone, it is also developed by other language communities where oracle is practiced. <br/>    In this work, I shall discuss this language use with critical analysis so as to correct the wrong impression people have about the language use and also to enlighten the native and non-native on the effect and significance of this language in divination. <br/>    Furthermore, effort shall be made to present this language as employed by the oraclist to know and tell about yesterday, today and tomorrow. I assume that at the end of this work, the native (Bini) and non native will be able to understood much of what is being communicated by the oraclist when performing his duty. <br/>    This work shall be divided into three chapter: In chapter one, the introduction and the Edo people, this chapter shall also include the purpose of study, the origin of olokun deity, the definition  of olokun and the oraclist followed by method of data collection and significance of study.   <br/>    In chapter two, I shall look at the literature review, the different types of oracle and their deities include their origin. <br/>    In chapter three, I shall discuss the data analysis, the language of olokun, I shall also look at folktale in the language of olokun follow by the proverbs in the language. <br/>    This chapter will also include ‘Nature’ in the language of olokun. This will closely followed by the conclusion. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction             <br/>1.1.    The Edo People                <br/>1.2.    The Purpose of Study        <br/>1.3.    Origin of Olokun                     <br/>1.4.    Definition of Olokun (Deity)        <br/>1.5.    The Oraclist                 <br/>1.6.    Method of Data Collection         <br/>1.7.    Significant of Study             <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Literature Review             <br/>2.1    Different Types of Oracle and their Deities Origin, <br/>Nature and the Priest             <br/>2.1.1    Oracle without Deity            <br/>2.1.1.1 Oguega or Ominigbon            <br/>2.1.1.2 Ewawa                     <br/>2.1.1.3 Ifievbe (Art of Throwing Kola)         <br/>2.1.1.4 Oracle with Deity                        <br/>2.1.1.5 Eziza                    <br/>2.1.1.6 Oronmila                         <br/>2.1.1.7 Ogun                    <br/>2.1.1.8 Human Deities or Hero Deities        <br/>2.1.1.9 Ovia                         <br/>2.1.1.10 Okhuare                         <br/>2.1.1.11 Imiaro                     <br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>3.0    Data Analysis (Introduction)         <br/>3.1    The Language of Olokun             <br/>3.1.1    Morphological Analysis                     <br/>3.1.2    Syntactic Analysis             <br/>3.1.3    Semantic Analysis                 <br/>3.2    Folktale in the Language of olokun             <br/>3.3    The use of the Language of olokun             <br/>3.4    ‘Nature’ in the language of olokun         <br/>    Conclusion                         <br/>    Bibliography                 <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>This work focuses on the language use in the worship of some of our local deities in Edo. Attempt shall be made to examine carefully the types of language employed in the worship of ‘Olokun’. <br/>It is true in the religious belief of the people that a situation where there is no vision to fortell their future, the people perish. As it is true with Christendom and Biblical times, so it is true with the people of Edo. In order to avoid predicament that may arise out of lack of vision, the Edo people have ‘Olokun’ (oracles) for insight into the unknown. This is mainly due to the realization that one has to avoid the troubles that accompany life itself. The Edo, therefore, regard ‘olokun’ (oracle) as a major belief and religious object in their community. <br/>The Edo believe that through the ‘olokun’ (oracle) the will of Osanòbuà (Almighty God) that of the ‘lesser gods’ and that of the ancestors are made known in the lives and affairs of men. The ‘olokun’ is regarded as one of the most influential activities of mankind, for it gathers the ‘high’ and ‘low’ from all works of life and faith in its worship. <br/>‘olokun’ (oracle) are played by many people in different parts of the world and so the language has been in existence which is known to the prationers. However, this language is restricted in communication or as a mode of expression in any language community, hence it is not easily understood by the non-initiated. Proverb on the other hand are part of Edo means of communication. Proverbs are mostly used and is understood by older people. <br/>According to chief priest, Ogbemudia Aiwansoba (personal communication) “proverbs are like ingredients to make the soup sweet or palatable for a good meal”. The Edo believe that before you are able to drive the meaning of a statement home successfully you have to employed proverbs. <br/>Generally, in terms of usage, Wilson J. (1970) has this to say: “A justification for the study of proverbs maybe found in its usefulness for psychology, folklore, the history and for literary studies to help to establish a text or interprets a meaning” (page 8). This by implication, gives us an insight to the importance and role of proverb in the language use in worship of ‘olokun’ in Edo. <br/>1.1    THE EDO PEOPLE <br/>    The Edo occupy the geographical area now known as Benin which was the conglomeration of little towns that spread into most of the area of the then Bendel  state. Edo found herself in a unique geographical position of occupying mid-way between what the early Europeans referred to as the ‘Yoruba country and Ibo country. <br/>    The people of the kingdom are called Bini-the language they speak is called ‘Edo’  language. It belongs to the kwa group of language which is under Niger-Congo family. But generally the name ‘Edo’ is used to refer to the people and the language they speak. <br/>1.2    THE PURPOSE OF STUDY     <br/>    The purpose of this project work is to look for the type of language used in ‘olokun’. It is generally believed that language is the basic means of communication. <br/>    According to the Oxford Concise Dictionary of linguistics Vol. 2 (page 215) ”language is the phenomenon of vocal and written communication among human beings generally, again as in ordinary usage”. Whichever way one looks at language, it boils down to communication. <br/>    Language servers as the basic means of maintaining interpersonal relationship. We use language to express our selves, that is language can be employed to effect one’s desire to line with the communicators need. Some forms of language are peculiar to some profession. This is not a variant of any discret or language entity but is characterized by codes which are exclusive to the prationers  e.g. medical field, oracle etc. <br/>    The language use in the worship of olokun which is my main concern in this study is distinct and unique in their sense of usages. It takes a lot of training to know and understand the language of ‘olokun’. According to priest Ogbemudia Aiwansoba (personal communication) “the oraclist has to learn the language of olokun to be able to know which message the oracle has for his client”. As a matter to fact, there is a noticeable difference between the language of the diviner and that of the olokun itself. Hence the oraclist uses everyday language to explain the letter. However, the language is not easy to know and understand, it involves a great deal of knowledge to be able to read the code  or symbols and give correct interpretation of what the olokun says. <br/>    According to Emovon (1984) “as part of his training, he (oraclist) memorizes the two hundred and fifty six (256) symbols and must be able to relate each of a folktale, a deep level translation and be able to interpret them in a plain language” page 15). In the same vein, the language used in proverbs is different from normal or plain language we are exposed to in the same language community. The use of proverbs in communication will not be effective, especially when you do not have a good command of the language in question. most of these proverbs have historical antecedents which are known and understood by the native speakers of the language. <br/>    The language of olokun (oracle) seems to have the same effect in terms of usage. This is due to the fact that most of the terms used by oraclist in divination are more of proverbs. It is a sub-way of bringing to the notice of the client what the oracle has for him in relation to a particular situation. <br/>    The language of olokun is not spoken without meaning. Effort shall be made to give a semantic analysis of the different symbols involved and how these symbols are co-ordinated (morphological and syntactically) to form a language. <br/>1.3    ORIGIN OF OLOKUN<br/>    Olokun is one of the heavenly bodies created by Osanobua (Almighty God) who came down to earth and established as deity. ‘olokun’ as a name is referred to the gods and goddesses that came from the water-world, which the worshippers called ‘Òbá na àmén’ (king of the sea) and ‘òlòri’ na ámén’ (Queen of the sea). The worshippers believe  there exist a world outside this earth, that the existence of everything on the earth originated from and all things that is been made used of on earth came from those places, they see the world as heaven created by ‘Almighty God’ where there is peace and happiness. <br/>    In my persona research, I found that olokun is a god of male and female deity. This is the general consensus about the nature of olokun in Edo. They (Edo people) believed olokun is not a goddess or female deity alone olokun according to Edo traditional mythology was the first son of Osanobua (Almighty God) who was above his father,” ‘Ábié Omo nò s’ Òmwán, Èrhámwén Òsá na bié òlòkun’. It is not a curse for a child to rise above his father ‘Omo sowwan ere ihen’. It is believed that it is part of every woman to do it when attaining womanhood and some  men who have it. It is believe by the worshippers that it is part of their destiny, olokun is seen to communicate with worshippers through the voice of the bell, which is called Aza (bell) and also communicate with the act of the divination system of codes, songs, poem and incantation of language use. <br/>    The reason why some people or scholar believed it to be a goddess are female deity was that women worship it  more than the men. This is due to moral value of the deity in respect of his kindness. By delegation of power, he gives children, money and comfortability a lots and women agitate more for these things than their male counterpart. <br/>    Bradbury (1973) also acknowledge the fact that olokun is a god or male deity. He went further to say that olokun is the god of the sea which have bearing to river Ethiope and the centre of worship is situated at Urhonigbe Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State. <br/>    According to priest Ogbemudia Aiwansoba (personal communication) pointed out that when olokun came to the earth, the first place their settlement was located was in a place called ‘Umutu’ in Edo State, from there to Urhonigbe in Orhionmwon local government area in of Edo state, it was from there it spread out to other places in Benin City example ‘Oredo’.<br/>    The priest of this deity is known as Ohen olokun (olokun priest). An oraclist is associated with the deity, use divination material which consist of cowries ‘Ikpigho’, Bronze seed ‘Ise eronmwon’, native chalk ‘orhue’, boat ‘oko’, Obele paddle, drum Ema’ ‘Ukuse maracas,, fan ‘ezuzu’, bell Aza’, Origbe’, hand bead and legs, ‘Iro’ small round carved wood like plate, bead worn round the neck ‘ivie’. <br/>    Finally, this deity could be worshipped by the whole community as a god but it is particularly worship by individual nowadays. <br/>1.3    DEFINITION OF OLOKUN (DEITY) <br/>    The olokun (deity) has been defined as various ways by different scholars, but all boils down to the same meaning. These different definitions are as a  result of cultural differences and beliefs in society. <br/>    I shall start by looking at the dictionary definition of what oracle is all about. Oracle in ancient Greek, according to Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary of Current English, vol.6 states, “It is a place where people could go to ask the gods for advice or information about the future”. ‘Divination’ by the same dictionary is “ the act of finding out and saying what will happen in the future”. It is obvious from the definition above that, whatever version is taken as the meaning of olokun (oracle), it as serves the function of probing into the unknown. <br/>    Traditionally, oracle in Edo culture, according to priest Ogbemudia Aiwansoba (personal communication) is the material use by either an oraclist or native doctor to foretell the future. The process is known as ‘iha no fi’ or ‘ubomwen’ (playing an olokun oracle). According to priest Ogbemudia Aiwansoba personal communication ‘olokun (oracle) in Edo culture means the process of looking for something unknown. However,  under this circumstances, we must proceed form the starting of a definition derived intuitively from general knowledge of Edo culture. Thus, we can safely define oracle (olokun) as means of knowing the past, the present and the future, and the solution to the problem of mankind. This definition is an established fact of the general consensus of what olokun oracle means in Edo. Irrespective of faith or disposition of foreign way of life, are to be found in the foot stool of olokun at any time when the need arises. As the olokun (oracle) serves as a means of carrying ideas or messages from the ancestor, the gods and Osanobua (Almighty God) to the living, so also it serve as a mediator or intermediary between the living and the dead. <br/>    To better understand the role of the olokun in religious lives of the Edo, one has to understand the dual nature of man, that is the physical and spiritual. The physical serves as a background for the spiritual and elevates it to the level of deity. In this sense, the olokun (oracle) becomes ominipotent anytime it come into the world  of the living. The Edo hold the view that through olokun (oracle) One’s curiosity over so many things that are happening around us which are resolved and the solution in most cares are provided. <br/>    According to Aimu Emovon, in his article ‘Ominigbon, divination “To Edo people life is an uncharted sea where an individual needs to be guided by the unseen hands of the gods in  order to succeed. As his needs vary and as he believes that each god is assigned a particular function in his life, he recourses to the gods for help as help and guidance are frequent whether in    looking for a site for his house or farm, inn deciding whom to accept as an in-law or in seeking to restore health to a sick member of his family (page 12)” He went further to say that …  more and more (Edo (Bini) people today some Christians and non-Christians alike seek the help of divination priest before they decide on any matter of importance. <br/>    I have come to understand during my research on this study that olokun is an indispensible thing in the culture and religious lives of Edo people. And its position, value and significance cannot be over emphasized. <br/>1.4    THE ORACLIST<br/>    The oraclist known as Obo in Edo is one who practices oraclist divination. They are honoured in the society because it is one of the most respected professions of Edo people. Any individual who is an oraclist is reverend. He is seen as one who is above the ordinary individual, he knows about the operation of the ancestral world and the various herbs and their uses, positive and negative. He sees through the act of man either for good or evil. He is capable of influencing activities that are being hatched in the psychic plane in whatever direction he wants it to go. Because of his knowledge, he is respected by good as well as the bad people. In most cases it is the innocent one that consults him in time of difficulty. <br/>    “In the good old days, native doctors and warriors were the most popular of all classes of people in Benin. They were also the most feared, honoured and respected by all. Any young man who wanted to make a name for himself would take up the art of medicine studying” (Egharevb, (1936) list in the reference. He also asserts in the same text that, “some curative doctors practice both medicine and divination art together …”. According to Emovon (1984) in his reason why divination priest were so honoured and respected was for the fact that it took (and it still takes), a lot of training, time and practice for one to be called a divination priest. <br/>    According to priest Ogbemudia Aiwansoba (personal communication)” the Oraclist is the bridge between the deity and its client, or between the spirit world and that of the living”. During my personal research, I found out that the general idea about the oraclist is that he serves as a middle man between the deity and the person that has come to consult. He takes the request to the spirit world and brings reply from the same to the client. As part of his profession, he also deals with the living, dead and spirits. He can also be a medicine man (curative) and diviner at the same time. Though medicine men and oraclists are often referred to as Obo (native doctors), their training and duties quite different.<br/>    The main duties of an oraclist is to link human beings with the living dead and the spirits. Though  his messages are received from the other world and he gives interpretation concerning causes, nature and possible remedies to one’s misfortune. They are agents for unveiling mysteries of human life and it creates sense of secrecy about their duties. <br/>    Finally, the oraclists are honoured and respected in any society or community because of the nature of their profession. People  see them as mediators between the physical and the spirit worlds, which add to their respect, status and dignity  in  the eye of the people. Therefore, people resort to them for both private and public  affairs. <br/>1.5    METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION<br/>    In collecting data for this work, I did a field work and also looked at the work earlier done on this study. I concentrated much on field work for the bulk of the data this is because the works that have been done in this topic were very few and rare. <br/>    However, I believed that research through field work and written text will help in producing an authentic  and accurate work. During the course of data collection, I focused attention on the nature of language use in the olokun  generally, the materials used method of consultation, the deities and most importantly, the language use in olokun deity. I carried out interviews among different oraclists we have in Edo and non-oraclists but who have very versed in Edo literature and tradition. <br/>    My primary data collection was done by written note and also taking care of non-verbal aspect of communication in divination, it also includes live recording of divination between oraclist and the client. <br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANT OF STUDY <br/>    The major significance of study is the creation of beauty in the culture of the people which generate pleasure in the manner in which a thing is said that characterizes olokun deity. Hence it is believed that one who is exposed to the teaching of olokun deity will be able to contribute to the store of knowledge and experience, one will be able to entertain with the divination he has learnt. <br/>    Another significance of study is its communication of thoughts, ideas, or experience for it is said that the love of olokun in Edo traditional culture must be an affairs of the head, the ideas communicated are generated by different kind of experiences which could be private, public or universe. <br/>    Lastly, it serves as a means of social cultural documentation, historical philosophical documentation and expression of religious experiences.   <br/><br/>\n\nLANGUAGE USE IN THE WORSHIP OF SOME OF OUR LOCAL DEITIES: CASE STUDY OF OLOKUN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LANGUAGE USE IN THE WORSHIP OF SOME OF OUR LOCAL DEITIES: CASE STUDY OF OLOKUN", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECTS OF CODE MIXING ON HAUSA-ENGLISH LANGUAGE BILINGUALS<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The main aim and objectives of this research were to identify the implication for code-mixing, and the reason for using code-mixing in Hausa-English bilinguals.

So if a speaker met two different code on language in his utterance, then it should be asked first who he is.<br/>In this manner, the specific characteristics of the speaker are among others, his social background, level of education and solidarity of region. However all of these specific characteristics will often colour his code-mixing on the other hands the language unction determines how far the language used by speaker given an opportunity to mix codes, because when a speaker of his utterance achieves is extremely determined by his language choice.<br/>Ronald Wardhaugh (1998:99) refer to code as the particular dialect or language that an individual chooses to use on any occasion. Wardhaugh further state that a code  is a system of communication between two or more parties. The code a speaker choose to use in any occasion will thus indicate how he/she expect other to perceived. Mixing is the act of inter-changing from one code to another in a particular discourse.<br/>Code mixing usually occurs in bilingual or multilingual community or society and the function (meaning) of the language cannot be clearly separated. This code mixing is used when the conversant use both language together to the extent that they change from one language other in the course of a single utterance (Wardhaugh 1986:103).<br/>In Code mixing the main codes or basic code has its own function and meaning, other codes, however are only the pieces, without function and meaning as a code.<br/>Igboanusi (2002:30) submit that while it as true that most bilingual situation, the two language in context are complementary in the sense that they are equally mix to enable communication base on any one language in a context. It is also true that in Nigeria situation language mixing is unidirectional i.e. most time only English language interferes with the mother tongue-oriented speech.<br/>Code mixing has two features namely dependency feature and the language or variant element that insert in other language have no more function. Dependency feature marked by the relationship between the language rule and function. The role means who use the language and function meant what will be reached by the speaker with his or her utterance. If the speaker mixes his or her code or language, then it must be asked the factors such as: who the speaker: social background, the level of education, religion, etc. A speaker who masters many languages will have chance to mix code more than other speaker who only speakers who only master one language.<br/>The second feature that the language or variant element inserted in other language have no more function. It can be classified into two lines. The first is inner Code mixing that is originated from the nature language will its all variation for instance Hausa mixed with Nupe.<br/>The second is outer Code mixing that mix a foreign language with native language such as English language mixed with Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa language. For instance Hausa - English mix:<br/>However there is a universal motivation for Code mixing language varieties not until recently, Code mixing was seen as evidence of internal mental confusion. The inability to separate two language sufficiently to warrant the description of true bilingual which is motivated by certain linguistic and socio-linguistics factor.<br/>The role of English in the teaching and learning perpriery, the bilingual/multilingual setting in Nigeria and the trend of globalization is contributing tremendously in the way English is influencing Hausa so the states quo give rise to a frequent manifestation of various language contact phenomena such as - code - switching, borrowing, loan, interference, Code mixing, etc. within the spontaneous conversion of Hausa bilingual in Nigeria and in Diaspora. It reached the extend that the bilingual speaker can hardly maintain a conversion without Code mixing between Hausa language and other language especially English.<br/>On Code mixing as a language contact phenomenon which appear in various formal and informal contact of the bilingual speaker such as social contact and situations include official meeting, public functions, classroom interaction. Competent speaker in two or more language often found themselves Code mixing between the language in single sentence or speech to express their intent and share interactive meaning even though the bilingual at times may not be aware that they repeatedly mixed between the available code within their utterances.<br/> 1.0.1 HAUSA LANGUAGE AND THE PEOPLE<br/>Hausa a branch of Afro-asiatic language of the Chadic group families the largest number of speakers spoken as a first language by almost 35 million people speak and comparatively over one hundred million people non-native speaker who demonstrate a varying degree of competence in the language. Nigeria and other African countries like Niger Republic, Chad, has developed Hausa into lingua France.<br/>Hausa has been categorized into classical and modern Hausa. The classical Hausa here refers to Hausa language and literary style which has been greatly influenced by Arabic and Islamic convictions opposed to modern Hausa which has been notable inclined to western civilization and ethics through the activity of English language and local language within Nigeria in Nigeria.<br/>The Hausa people are diverse but culturally homo-generous based primarily in Sahelian and Sudana, Dara area of Northern Nigeria. Other Hausa have also moved to large coastal cities in the region such as Lagos, Port-Harcourt, and other parts of Nigeria. However most Hausa live in small villages or town in Nigeria, where they grow crops, raise livestock including cattle and engage in trade. The Hausa aristocracy had historically develop an equestrian based culture and a status symbol of traditional nobility in Hausa society.<br/>Hausa is used as the language of instruction at the elementary level in school in northern Nigeria and Hausa is available as a course of study in Northern Nigeria universities beside several high degree (master and PhD). are offered in Hausa in various universities in the Diaspora (URS, US, Germany). Hausa is also used in various social media network around the world.<br/>Clothing: The Hausa people have a restricted dress code related to their religions beliefs the men are easily recognizable because of their elaborate dress which is large flowing gown known as \"Babhan riga and a rob called a \"Jalabia and Jhann\". The men also wear colourful embroidered caps known as 'Hula'. Depending on their location and occupation.<br/>The women can be identified by wrappers called Zalm made with colourful cloth atampa accompanied by a matching blouse, head tie and shawl.<br/>Food: The most common food that the Hausa people prepare consist of grains, such as sorghum, millet, rice, or maize, which are group into flour for a variety of different kinds of dishes. This food is popularly known as \"tuwo\" in the Hausa language. Usually, breakfast consists of cakes made from wheat flour soaked for a day fried and served with sugar known as funkaso. Both of these can be served with porridge and sugar known as kunu or koko. Lunch or dinner usually feature a heavy porridge with soup and stew known as tuwo da miya. The soup and stew are prepared with ground or chopped tomatoes, onions, and a local pepper sauce called daffaoo. Beans, peanuts and milk are also served as a complementary protein diet for the Hausa people. The most famous of all food is most likely suya, a spicy shish herbal, like steward meat which is a popular food item in various part of Nigeria and is enjoyed as a delicacy in much of West African and balangu of gasshu. A dried version of suya is called \"killishi\".<br/>Both..............

Developing some level of competence both in written and spoken English became necessary to secure employment especially in the civil service. The importance of English became over emphasized to the detriment of our indigenous language in the case of English in Hausa land was so much valued because if portrays one is educated in the modern way that a competent user of English was accorded so much respect and recognition among his people this desire to show that one is learned in the modern way lead to frequent code mixing.<br/>1.1.3CONCEPT OF CODE MIXING<br/>Code mixing refers to any admixtures of linguistics element of two or more language systems. In the same utterance of various level, phonological, lexical, grammatical, syntactic, and orthographical in essence. Code mixing may be more adequately seen as occurring as a kind of intra-sentential switching.<br/>Caron (2002) in his paper \"zaor - Hausa - English, code mixing\" examine how a minority language that is healthy is used in two different contexts. <br/>An urban context with educated speakers who are fluent in two main language of the area (English and Hausa).<br/>A rural context with speakers who hardly speaks a words of pidgin English but are quite fluent in Hausa with the interest of revealing the process at work in borrowing and grammaticalization.<br/>1.0.4 BILINGUALISM<br/>Is commonly defined as the use of at least two language by an individual (Asha 2004). It is a fluctuating system in children and adults where by use of and proficiency in two language may change depending on the opportunities to use the language and exposure to other users of the language. The bilingual speaker has at least two codes in his/her verbal purposes in a given sociolinguistic context. The sociolinguistics context determines when and why it is appropriate to use one code or the other and when is appropriate to combine both for some definable function.<br/>The code of the bilingual include at least in the case of former British colonies in Nigeria for example, the vernacular and the former transplanted language. Poplach (1982) defines it as the ordinary or everyday language and Kachru (1982:27) define vernacular as the mother tongue thus the bilingual language should be viewed as constituting a functional hierarchy in which both the transplant code and the vernacular have very specific role to play in Hausa context, the transplanted code e.g. (English and Hausa) occupies the top line in the hierarchy. Thus it is usually perceived as more prestigious than the code at the bottom line the vernacular as a consequence of such a hierarchy. The vernacular uses more linguistic items from transplanted code.<br/>1.1.5 CODE MIXING AND PRAGMATIC<br/>Studies of pragmatic aspect of code-mixing have basically been concern with issues such as the following:<br/>a)    What are the factors that contribute to the surface manifestation of code mixing and the domain or settings. Why do bilingual tend to mix the language available to them.<br/>b)    It has been argued in the literature that code mixing in bilingual speech can be triggered by various factor. Some of these are linguistic, while others are extra-linguistic (e.g Gumper 1982 Karch 1933) linguistic factor have to do with the bilingual individual himself and the language available to him those factor include, for example the bilingual attitude towards the code at his/her disposal.<br/>    Extra-linguistic factor include the participant (i.e. the person (i.e. the person involved in the interaction) the topic ( i.e. the subject of the interaction (e.g. grades, football, Halloween, etc.) and the setting (i.e. the place the interaction took place e.g. church, school, home.<br/>    Domain for code mixing<br/>    By domains for code mixing refers to the social setting in which the bilingual lives and in which  he carries out his daily activities.<br/>1.1.6 CODE MIXING AND PSYCHOLINGUISTIC<br/>    Has been concerned with deterring first, whether code mixed utterances take longer to process than monolingual utterances. Second how code mixed utterances are generated.<br/>    With respect to the first issue earlier studies propose that the processing of code mixing take longer time while recent studies disagree that it does not. It has been observed that earlier studies were biased because they used haphazardly arranged code mixing utterance to meet the investigator's hypothesis concerning this topic.<br/>1.1.7CODE MIXING AND SYNTACTIC<br/>    Syntax is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well formed sentence in a language. From a syntactic point of view Code mixing has mainly been concerned with determining whether code mixing is random or rule governed and if code is rule governed, what is the nature of restriction which govern its occurrence. In bilingual speech related to this issue in determining whether there universal constraint on code mixing while many studies agree that code mixing cannot random and that there are constraint on where a code mix can or cannot occur in a code mixed sentence. there seem to be no census at all regarding the characterization and quantification of such constraint. As a consequence, there has been a liferation of constraints on code mixing for the last fifteen years age.<br/>I.2.    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>    In the area where Hausa is spoken as lingual franca (Nigeria) this research seeks to examine the phenomena of code mixing properly therefore identify the reason or factor responsible for code mixing in Hausa - English language. Recent studies has overtime revealed the gaps in Hausa language  which most times prompt the speaker to resort to bridging those gaps with English terminologies.<br/>•    What are the form, meaning, and reasons of using code mixing and the English code found in Hausa lexicon.<br/>•    What situation do an Hausa bilingual use code (formal and informal) and the types of code and pattern of code mixing.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>    The purpose of the research is to the study of sociolinguistic and linguistic with regard to the effect of code mixing of English - Hausa language<br/>1.    It presents and explain the phenomenon of code mixing and to identify the reason and context in which code mixing is used in Hausa - English sentence and the factor responsible.<br/>2.    It analyses and describe the forms, meaning and reason of using code mixing and the English code found in Hausa lexicon.<br/>3.    To analyze the speech of Hausa - English bilingual in formal and informal situation, identify the types of pattern of mixing in the situation, and examining whether the mixing of the two language (Hausa and English( depend on the contrasting syntactic property of the language involved.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE AND JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY<br/>    The study is of great importance to the study of social linguistic, student of English and the Hausa community. Because it seeks to examine the factors, contribution, and both the negative and positive effect of code mixing of Hausa - English bilingual. The significance of this study is to encourage the language teacher to do more in encouraging students to communicate in one language at a time, this I believe will help to reduce the incidence of code mixing among the Hausa English bilingual as well as the development of Hausa language and also develop competence in English language.<br/>    It will also encourage the Hausa lexicographers on working diligently to fulfil the lexical gap created by science and technology.<br/>1.5    METHODOLOGY<br/>    This study adopts the primary and secondary method of data collection, the primary method is used to collect data from respondents. And the secondary method of data collection is used to collect data from textbooks, journals etc. The primary data collection which is oral, interview and participatory observation. The secondary method would be carried out in the library. The method that will be used in this research will not be that employed in teaching, broadcasting, Motor Park, and daily communication uses in the day to day activities of an Hausa- English bilingual.<br/>    Hausa language is the mother tongue of the researcher thus data collection involve my knowledge of Hausa language with other competent Hausa - English bilingual. The data to be used for this study will be tape recording and later transcribed into writing <br/>    The occurrence of code mixing shall be noted in the speech of ten to fifteen individuals who are Hausa - English bilingual, young and old, female and male, educated and uneducated persons. The data shall be collected over a period of two week, two persons per day at different location, formal occasion, conversation with friends and at the motor parks. Discussion among different groups like university students, college of education student, traders, Hausa home video etc.<br/>    Instances of code mixing would also be noted down immediately they are heard. Some respondents were interviewed on why they code mix.<br/>1.6 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS<br/>    This work will adopt sociolinguistic approach of code mixing among Hausa/English bilingual. We would be making use of Hoffman (1962) types and reason for code-mixing and additional reason giving by Saville - Troike (1968:690).<br/><br/>\n\nEFFECTS OF CODE MIXING ON HAUSA-ENGLISH LANGUAGE BILINGUALS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF CODE MIXING ON HAUSA-ENGLISH LANGUAGE BILINGUALS", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE PHENOMENA OF TENSE AND ASPECT IN ILAJE OF YORUBA <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b> <br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION <br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>    The concept of time is universal because the units of time are extra-linguistic i.e they exist independently of the grammar of any language. In other words the expression of time in language is universal, whereas the means of expressing time is language specifics. Hence each language employs different linguistic means to express time. <br/>    Generally, the writer or speaker of a language may apply lexical means to express time, he or she may apply temporal adverbs, adjectives, substantive preposition, conjunctions, particles and adverbs or grammatical three and aspect and other syntactical means. <br/>    According to Syons (1968), the term tense has its origin in Latin. The Latin word for tense is tempus, while the term aspect is a dramatic of the Russian word “vid” though he did not give the meaning of vid in English. He explains that vid” was used for first time to refer to the difference between perfective and imperfective. In he changes of the verbs form a Russia and other Slavonic languages. The goes further to say that the perfective is completion, while imperfective means to be in progress. Aspect and tense are both seen as formal property of the verb. Tense refers to the absolute location of an event or action in time, either the present or t the past. In most  languages, it is marked by inflection of the verb. Aspect on the other hand refers to how an event or action is to be viewed with respect to time. Tense and aspect are properties of the verb. It is in view of this that most scholar hold the view that aspect always include tense. Most literature limit the interpretation of aspect of the basic distinction between events that are yet to be concluded at speech time and those that have come to a close at the time of speaking. <br/>    Carric (1976), posits that aspect is conceptually and morphologically more varied across different languages. The grammatical aspect of a verbs always, define the temporal flow in the described events or data. Huddleston and Pullum (2002: 117) succinctly state that “the term aspect applies to a system where the basic meanings, have to do with the internal temporal constituent of the situation. “Aspect has to do with a kind of perspectivizing of the internal temporal structure of the situation described by the verb relation to the point of initiation of speech. Bull (1968) uses terms like the beginning, middle and the good of an event to describe such internal, temporal structure. He calls it aspect of any event. According to Dr. Yuka “Tense and aspect are two important constitutions of the inflectional mode of any natural language. Vater (1994: 18-28) “psychologically time is a crucial concept of humans, since everything we often experience is in some way related to time even though we do not often perceive time intentionally. We measure everything we do in temporal units such as years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds and so on. He further adds that the perception of certain phases of time depends on a reference point. That is something happened in the past requires a definition of the present moment without which no past would exist. <br/>    Jeseperson (1970) states that it is of vital importance to make a distinction between “time” and event”. According to him, time is common to all mankind and it is independent of language. He is of the opinion  that tense varies from language to language and it is the linguistic expression of time relation. He explains that this may be marked morphologically. Although the words so used may also be used to perform other grammatical functions in some other circumstances. <br/>    In this study, an attempt is made to show the grammatical means by which tense and aspect are expressed in Ilaje-dialect as well as the relationship between them. The markers of tense and aspect in the language will also be identified. <br/>YORUBA SOUND SYSTEM<br/>    Yoruba has eighteen consonants, seven oral vowels and it also has five nasal vowels. (Bamgbose, 1991) the Ilaje dialect in addition to having these eighteen consonants also has the sound “gwa”. “A     mi     gwa     gari” (we are eating gari)<br/>    Ilaje makes use of the standard Yoruba orthography. <br/>    Even when it is asserted that Ilaje uses the Standard Yoruba orthography, the way in which they speak and write differ from the standard Yoruba. Though, there is a great interference of lexical item, the sentence below show this in detail Ilaje.   <br/>As noted in the chart above, Ilaje does not use the post alveolar fricative unlike the standard Yoruba. They (Ilaje) however have the labialized velar voiced stop [gw] e.g in gwa, ‘draw’. <br/>    Another similarity in the sound system of the standard Yoruba and Ilaje, perhaps a justification of Ilaje as a dialect of the former is t he fact the latter uses the same number vowels, both oral and nasal vowels.  <br/>TONE SYSTEM<br/>    Yoruba is a tonal language with three tones high, mid, low. The high tone is indicated by an acute accent. The mid tone is not marked and the low tone is marked with a grave tone. These three tones also featured in Ilaje distinctively. Every syllable must have at least one tone. A syllable containing long vowel can have two tones. <br/>Every syllable must have at least one tone, a syllable containing a long vowel can have tones. These three level of tones also features distinctively in Ilaje dialect. <br/>1.1    ILAJE PEOPLE AND THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION <br/>    Ilaje dialect is one of the dialects of Yoruba The Ilaje local government was created out of the defunct Ilaje.Ese-Odo local government area on October 1996, by the federal government. According to Ayelagba (1986), the Ilaje local government consists of over hundred towns and villages covering an area of 3,000 square kilometers. It shares boundary, the south by Atlantic Ocean and in the west by Ogun state in the East by Delta state. The people’s main occupation is fishing.<br/>1.2    ORTHOGRAPHIC SYSTEM OF ILAJE<br/>    The Ilaje dialect lacks any standard orthographic system. Words are only written with the assumption of the standard Yoruba and the observance of the necessary sound added to the standard Yoruba word. For example, the Yoruba word for eat “mu” as in mu gari – eat gari, the ilaje form will be “gwa” gari. <br/>    The speakers are conscious of this variation in speaking and in writing. There are no number of sounds documented for construction.  However, they do have a considerable number of sounds when placed against Standard Yoruba. For example the dialect lacks the following sounds, [v], [z], [x], They maintain the number of consonant sound in Standard Yoruba. It also shares the same number of vowels, both oral and nasalized vowels. They have a rich borrowing system from the standard Yoruba language. The Ilaje are proficient in the way and manner in which they form words based on the situation. <br/>    In writing the Ilaje people basically make use of Standard Yoruba. It should however be noted that although the Ilaje dialect differ slightly from the standard Yoruba, they are both mutually intelligible.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>    This work is devoted to examining a number of things. They include, <br/>The examination of tense and aspect system in Ilaje dialect. <br/>The examination of the internal structure of the verb. <br/>How tense and aspect are generated in Ilaje dialect. <br/>The forms of the occurrence of these phenomena – tense and aspect <br/>Tense category that will be treated in this work include. <br/>Past  tense <br/>Present tense <br/>Future tense <br/>In expressing aspect, the forms to be examined will include, <br/>Perfect aspect <br/>Imperfective aspect <br/>1.4    METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION<br/>    The source of data for this study was majorly provided by my father, Rev. Caleb Oke, a native speaker of the dialect. I also employed the competence of my friend in the dialect for this study. These two informants have good command of the dialect. <br/>    The data was supplemented by published materials on tense and aspect in Yoruba and dialects especially the Kwa languages. <br/><br/> \n\nTHE PHENOMENA OF TENSE AND ASPECT IN ILAJE OF YORUBA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PHENOMENA OF TENSE AND ASPECT IN ILAJE OF YORUBA ", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM OF UMUCHU DIALECT AND STANDARD IGBO LANGUAGE <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> This study presents a comparative analysis of the sound system of Umuchu dialect and Standard Igbo Language with the objective of Comparing and  finding the similarities and difference and also identifying the mutual intelligibility of the dialect and language. This paper examines what constitute their similarities and differences that make the dialect a variant of Igbo language. A comparative method was adopted for this study. Date were collected form competent speakers of the dialect and language using the Ibadan 400 wordlist of basic items. The classification of the dialect and language sound system (Consonant, Vowel and tones) are carried out in order to determine the patterns of differences and similarities. Since major sound change were discovered in the lexical items of the language and dialect. The systematic substitution of sounds also constitute another major findings observed between the dialect and language. We have been able to establish in this study that there exist a very strong relationship between the dialect and the language with the discovery of some common lexical items. We however, discovered that the dialect and language are mutually intelligible. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction<br/>Umuchu dialect and its speakers<br/>Igbo language and its speakers <br/>Statement of problem<br/>Purpose of study<br/>Significance of study<br/>Scope of study<br/>Limitation of study<br/>Research questions<br/>Methodology<br/>CHAPTER TWO: REVIEW OF RELEVANT LITERATURE<br/>2.0     Introduction<br/>2.1     Dialect and standard<br/>2.2     Studies on Igbo dialect and language<br/>2.2     Sound system<br/>2.2.1 Studies on sound system of dialects and languages<br/>2.3     Comparative studies across language<br/>CHAPTER THREE: THEORETICAL FRAME WORK<br/>3.0     Introduction<br/>3.1    Analysis of the Framework<br/>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS<br/>4.0     Introduction<br/>4.1     Sound System of Umuchu Dialect<br/>4.1.1 Consonant System of Umuchu Dialect<br/>4.1.2 Vowel System of Umuchu Dialect<br/>4.1.3 Tonal system of Umuchu Dialect<br/>4.2     Sound system of standard Igbo<br/>4.2.1 Consonant system of standard Igbo<br/>4.2.2    Vowel system of standard Igbo<br/>4.2.3 Tonal system of standard Igbo<br/>4.3     Comparative Analysis<br/>4.3.1 Comparative Analysis of consonant system of Umuchu dialect and <br/>    standard Igbo<br/>4.3.2 Comparative analysis of vowel system of Umuchu dialect and <br/>    standard Igbo<br/>4.3.3 Comparative analysis of tonal system of Umuchu dialect and <br/>    standard Igbo <br/>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY OF FINDING AND CONCLUSION<br/>5.0     Findings in Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo<br/>5.1     Discussion of findings.<br/>5.2    Summary <br/>5.3     Conclusion <br/>Appendix<br/>References<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>    Generally, the study of Igbo language has received renewed interest and attention from scholars. The renewed interest has been a cheering development especially in the increasing period of demand and expectation from the Igbo community. In the advancement in information technology, linguistics studies need to move with the time and Igbo language in particular need not stay behind. <br/>    Language is a system of communication which is used by people of a given locality. Language makes it possible for man to transfer knowledge across in space and time. It serves not only as the principal medium that Germans communicate with, but also a means of socialization it links people together and bind them with their cultures. In fact, without language, people will not be identified. <br/>    Igbo language is one of the three recognized vernacular known as WAZOBIA, (Nwadike, 2005). Igbo language is important to an Igbo speaking individual for communication, transaction, teaching as well as learning. It is spoken in many parts of Igbo communities comprising Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, Imo and River States of Nigeria. Igbo language has the major forms, the standard and non-standard variety. The non-standard variety is known as dialect. Dialect according to Hartman and Stork (1971; 65-66) is a regional or social variety differing in pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary from the standard language which is in itself a favoured dialect. A dialect is chiefly distinguished from other dialects of the same language by features of linguistic structure. “grammar (specially morphology and syntax), vocabulary and pronunciation. Although some linguistic include phonological features such as vowels, consonants and intonation among the dimensions of the dialects. In the sound system of American English for example, some speakers pronounce ‘greasy’ with an ‘s’ sound while others pronounce it with a ‘z’ sound. <br/>    The standard variety can be regarded as one of the dialects of a given language, though one that has attracted special prestige. Standard language arise when a certain dialect begins to be used in a written form, normally throughout a broader area than that of the dialect itself. The way in which this language is used, for example in administrative matters, literature and economic life leads to the minimization of linguistic variation. In most developed countries, the majority of the population has an active speaking, writing at least passive understanding of the standard language. <br/>    Ikekeonwu (1980) grouped the Igbo dialects into five clusters according to both phonological and grammatical criterion. They are, Niger Igbo, Inland West Igbo, Inland East Igbo,  Wawaa Igbo/Northern Igbo and Riverian Igbo. Each clusters has up to thirty dialects. <br/>    Therefore, this study sets to describe the sound system of Umuchu dialect of Igbo as compared to the sound system of standard Igbo.  A comparative study of this nature sets to identify the similarities and the difference in the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo sound system with the aim of determining the relationship between them. <br/>1.1    UMUCHU DIALECT AND ITS SPEAKERS<br/>    Umuchu dialect is one of the dialects of Igbo. It is classified under Aguata in Ikekeonwu (1986) dialect classification. The dialect has a unique linguistic feature. <br/>    Umuchu is a broader town between Anambra and Imo states of Nigeria. It is bounded on the south western extremely of the present Aguata local government area of Anambra state. It is bounded on the south of Arondizuogu, Umuakoma and Akokwa in Ideato south local government area of Imo state, while on the north and northwest by Achina and Enugu, Umuomaku respectively. In the West by Uga and Amesi and in the east by Umuomaku, Umunze and Agho-mule river.<br/>    The Umuchu is made up of three major traditional village groups called Ihetenato, Amanassa, and Okpu-na-Achalla. The major  occupation of the people of Unuchu are farming and trading.<br/>1.2    IGBO LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERS<br/>    According to Hartermann (1952) and Greenberg (1966), Igbo language is a member of the Niger-Congo family of language. Igbo language is therefore under the Kwa group of language of the Niger Congo branch of the Niger-Kordofanian language group. Igbo language belong to the rain forest culture group thereby enlisting itself as is component  of the Kwa group of language in accordance with Williamson’s classification of Nigerian languages. <br/>    Igbo language is spoken by over a million people mainly found in the south-east geo political zones of Nigeria in states like Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo. They are also found in some parts of Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta state. They are made of several clans which is nearly impossible and quite unnecessary too to list them all. <br/>    Igbo language which is spoken in the own forest region occupying a vast area of land bounded by the Edold group which include Bini, Esan, Etsako and others.Eastwards towards the Cameroonian boarder by the Yako, Eka, Ibibio, Anang, Bolagi, Ejaghem and Bakwara language group. As previously explained, Igbo people are located in most of the country’s eastern states, when naming the vast area of its spread we have Anioma, Oshimili, Ukwuani in Delta state referred to as Delta Ibo. It is pertinent to note  here that this geographical spread have contributed in no small measure to determining how each dialect filtered into each other. By this it is expected that two dialects which are in close proximity than others tend to be more similar to each other than with others. A lot has been done on the Igbo language which include a standard orthography, sound systems etc. The Igbo family tree is shown below. <br/>Niger Kordofanian <br/>Niger – Congo                            Kordofania<br/>1.3    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>    Language is a very vital tool in the life of every individual and the society at large. Language has different variations which are called dialects. Major attention has been on the languages, giving lesser attention to the variants of these particular languages. As a result of this, most variants or dialects has not been properly studied. <br/>    Most speakers of a dialect cannot properly analyse the machinery  of their dialects and cannot attest the differences and similarities of their dialect and the standard form of the dialect. Most speakers assume that all dialects or variants of a language are all the same in all ramification with the standard language because there is a mutual linguistics understanding when speaking them. This points brings to limelight a very important questions, which is how one can know the difference that exist between a dialect of a language and the standard form of that dialect.<br/>1.4    PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>    This study looks at the sound system analysis on the variation of Umuchu dialect of Igbo language and standard Igbo. The main goal is to identify, analyse and establish the functional sounds in the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo. This work by no means look out for the similarities and differences identified between the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo to discover whether they are mutually intelligible. This research in no small measure contribute to the knowledge of the sound system of the dialect and language. It is also hoped that it will give vitality to the dialect and help the present generation to develop their proficiency in reading and writing their dialect. <br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>    Every Research carried out has its benefit both to the researcher and the readers of the work. Therefore, this study will be helpful to both the scholars and readers of the study. <br/>    It will be of great benefit to scholars who would like to go on a further research. The documentation of this work will help to preserve the Umuchu dialect and Igbo language in general. <br/>    It will be of great help to the researcher by broadening the mind of the researchers in the understanding of the sound system of the Umuchu dialect and Igbo language at large. <br/>    Teachers and students who will teach or study Igbo language will  find this very beneficial.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>    This study on the comparative study of the sound system of the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo captures identifiable sounds in the  dialect and language bringing out the vowel and consonant sounds, and also the tones. <br/>    All the attested sounds captured in the language will be compared to determine the mutual intelligibility between the Umuchu dialect and the standard Igbo. <br/>1.7    LIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>    The greatest limitation in this study is finance. Finance needed in carrying out a standard research is not always easy for a student. One actually need lots of funds to source for credible information and data. <br/>    Time was also a huge problem as the researcher was made to work under a given period of time.<br/>1.8    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>    The following questions are posed to serve as a guide for the research. <br/>What are the vowels and consonant sounds present in the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo?<br/>What are the tones present in the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo?<br/>Are there any similarities and differences between the <br/>Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo?<br/>Are the Umuchu dialect and standard igbo mutually intelligible?<br/>1.9        METHODOLOGY<br/>    This part of the study focuses on the research methodology. The data are gotten from native speakers using the Ibadan 400 worldlest where 200 words was choosen and transcribed and also tone marked. Therefore, the phonemes of the language are identified and the vowel and consonant phonetic charts are drawn for the  dialect and language under  investigation. The sound patterning (i.e. how the sounds are combined to form words will be looked at). <br/><br/>\n\nCOMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM OF UMUCHU DIALECT AND STANDARD IGBO LANGUAGE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM OF UMUCHU DIALECT AND STANDARD IGBO LANGUAGE ", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ATTITUDE OF BENIN YOUTHS TOWARDS LANGUAGE PREFERENCE IN COMMUNICATION: NIGERIA PIDGIN ENGLISH AND EDO LANGUAGE<br/> CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Background to the Study<br/>    Language attitude is a personal or collective disposition, feelings and behaviors towards a particular language or a language variety. This attitude may be positive or negative. Crystal (1997:215) define attitude “as the feelings people have about their own language or the languages of others.” Attitude towards a language is not directly attitude towards the language but a reflection of attitude from the speaker of the language on the language. Attitudinal studies aid in identifying how people of one language group new the personal character and social status of speakers of another language and how they form association about other language. <br/>    Language is generally accepted as a means by which people in a community interact and express feelings, thoughts and intentions. Societies rely on language and languages rely on the society. Hence, there must be a relationship that exists between language and society. <br/>    The power of language mainly lies on political reason, whether or not it is an official language of the state as most of the official languages are used in formal settings, such as in education or official document. These usages empower the official languages and while at the same time degraded the unofficial ones. <br/>    In the context of our living place, Benin City, speaking of ‘Youths in Benin Pidgin English’ one might immediately think of the local official language of Edo. However, Edo language is not the only local language of Benin; actually Benin has quite a number of languages. <br/>    Youths in Benin Pidgin English is a contact language and like contact languages comes into being under conditions of interaction among people of different linguistics backgrounds. Pidgins usually evolve from the fusion of foreign languages and indigenous languages. Crystal 1997 explained that most of the present day pidgins grew up along the trade routes of the world especially in those parts where British, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch built up their empire. Linguists like Akmajian and others like Elugbe, Omakor (1991) observed that pidgin usually thrive in multi-lingua part of the world. Such communities are made up of different ethnic groups with different language that are not understood by other groups. Hence, in Benin City, pidgin language is found to be useful the people in contact find they cannot do without it. The pidgin becomes a common language. <br/>The origin of Nigeria Pidgin English (henceforth NPE) is traceable to the contact between the coastal peoples of Nigeria and the Europeans. Egbokhare (2006:6) observes that the first contact was made by the Portuguese around 1469. The Dutch followed about 1593, but soon faded away to be replaced by the English from 1650 onwards. Elugbe and Omamor (1991:3) claim that some form of Portuguese pidgin must have been spoken along the coast. This must have been short-lived with the ousting of the Portuguese by the French, the Dutch and the English. Among these groups, the British impact was more enduring and resulted in the development of an English-based pidgin along the Youths in Benin coast.<br/>The same reasons that led to the evolution of NPE have popularized it in Nigeria. Urbanization, trade and other contact situations within the country have led to the spread of NPE. The language has become a lingua franca not only in a multiethnic Niger Delta, but in the whole of Nigeria. The multiethnicity of barracks and urban centres has also helped in transporting the language inland. The result is that we now have varieties of pidgin based roughly on the ethnic groups and geographical locations. Elugbe and Omamor (1991) observe that it has creolized in the Warri and Sapele areas of the Niger Delta.<br/>Mafeni (1971:97) says that NP comprises a base language-English, which has been and continues to be modified by indigenous languages.<br/>The present profile of NP is that of a lingua franca, building linguistic and communicative bridges among the 400 or so ethnic groups in Nigeria.<br/>NPE can be regarded as ‘a child of necessity’ and a language of convenience. This is because of its use as a contact language and its communicative value among our many ethnic groups. Starting from the coastal regions, it has metamorphosed into a lingua franca, penetrating inland to the nooks and crannies of Nigeria.<br/>1.2    METHODOLOGY<br/>This study employed the primary source of data collection. A questionnaire was designed to elicit responses from members of the public. There was also the direct interview of some respondents in the New Benin, and Rongroad area of Oredo Local Government of Benin metropolis with the aid of a digital tape recorder. <br/>    Since the population of the people of Benin is much, the simple random sampling technique will be adopted in selecting one hundred (100) respondents both male and female. The responses of the participants shall be manually coded and analyzed in frequency table. <br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>    The purposes of the study are:                           <br/>To know the attitude of Youths in Benin especially those residing in Benin towards Youths in Benin Pidgin English. <br/>To know if Youths in Benin Pidgin English can be used as a formal medium of communication in Edo state and consequently other states in Nigeria. <br/>To examine the contribution of Youths in Benin Pidgin English towards teaching and learning in schools (primary and secondary). <br/>To know if Youths in Benin Pidgin English is a threat to the vitality of the indigenous Edo language. <br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY AND JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY <br/>    This study is very important because the results can go a long way to establishing the official state of Youths in Benin Pidgin English as a formal language in Edo state. This work will be of great relevance and a reference point to students of linguistics and it will highlight some issues in language planning and language vitality. It will be a guide for the federal government in planning for effective educational system in the school curriculum.<br/><br/>\n\nATTITUDE OF BENIN YOUTHS TOWARDS LANGUAGE PREFERENCE IN COMMUNICATION:

The Recorded speech of ten selected native speakers of Hausa was used. Students who were native speakers of Hausa were sampled. Phonological approach was used using snowball sampling technique. It was discovered that phonological features of Hausa such as substitution, under-differentiation, spelling pronunciation, epenthesis and simplification, of consonant cluster were the common features found in the oral English of the samples. The English of the samples has been affected by their L1.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong>        <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>To investigate on the level of phonological interference in the speech of Hausa-English bilingual, particularly among the Hausa speakers of English demands extra effort and great attention. This is because, it is observed that this problem is the result of the linguistic features found in their indigenous languages which are transferred to the sound system of the English language. Their English phonetics reflects the structure of the sound system of their mother tongue (Osisanwo, 2009).</p> <p>Phonology is the study of the sound system of a Language. It is the study of the properties of the sound system of a given language. It is the systematic study of how the speech sound (Osisanwo, 2009).</p> <p>Hyman (1975:1) cited by Osisanwo (2009:3) says that, the goal of phonology is to study the properties of the sound system which speakers must learn and internalize in order to use their language for the purpose of communication. To Oyebade (1998:2) ‘phonology is the scientific study of the arbitrary vocal symbol used in human speech and the pattern into which these symbols produce intelligent, meaningful utterances’. To sum it up, Akmajian et al (2008:109) said: ‘phonology is the subfield of linguistics that studies the structure and patterning of sound in human language’. Speakers of Nigerian English are still facing a lot of pronunciation problems as a result of their L1 influence on their spoken English (Alabi, 2007)</p> </div>                                                         \n\nAN INVESTIGATION ON THE LEVEL OF PHONOLOGICAL INTERFERENCE IN THE SPEECH OF HAUSA-ENGLISH BILINGUAL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION ON THE LEVEL OF PHONOLOGICAL INTERFERENCE IN THE SPEECH OF HAUSA-ENGLISH BILINGUAL", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>The impact of reportorial techniques on reading audience of Akwa Ibom Broadcasting Corporation</b></p> <div><b><br/></b></div> <div><p><b>Chapter One: Introduction</b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1    </b><b>Background of the study</b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Information dissemination is a vital tool for awareness creation and development in every human society, whether such a society is traditional or modern in nature. Information is usually disseminated to the members of the public who are considered as the target audience in form of news broadcasting, which is made possible by different media organizations comprising of print and electronic media.</p> <p>       News broadcasting, as a medium of information dissemination is made possible, through active involvement of news writers and reporters who play major roles in different perspectives depending on the type of event to be reported at that point in time. Reporters ensure that they adopt and apply effective reportorial techniques to make their report  accurate, unbiased and timely to meet the expectations of the members of the public who are the target reading audience. </p> <p>       This research will focus on the impact of reportorial   techniques on the reading audience. This area of study is of interest to me because of my desire to determine the media-audience relationship by understanding the feelings, impression and perception, of members of the public who are considered to be the reading audience.</p> <p>                Generally, reporting is saddled with the responsibility of informing, educating and updating the members of the public who are the target reading audience, about news and events happening internationally, nationally, and locally. Reports are classified in different categories based on the situation and event to be reported on. The types of reports include: science and technology reports, political reports, police and crime reports, accident and disaster reports, environment reports etc. </p> <p>Reporters make effective use of different reportorial techniques in order to report appropriately, based on the categories mentioned above and this eventually leads to specialization in such area of reporting.  For reporters to specialize in specific area of reporting, there must meet one or two requirements, and as well comply strictly to the reportorial techniques of such type of report. </p> <p>The duty of the reporter through the guidance of basic reportorial techniques, is to report the news for newspapers, magazines, websites, television, and radio. Reporters, spend a lot of time in the field, conducting interviews and investigating stories to enable them present a finished information for the consumption of the reading audience. The work of reporters is often fast paced, with constant demands to meet deadlines and to be the first reporter to publish a news story on a particular subject in other to satisfy the expectations of their target reading audience. </p> <p>        In his opinion, Rogers,(2001) observed that, for success to be achieved by meeting this huge responsibility that confronts the reporter, there is need for reporters to identify and adopt effective reportorial techniques in other to impact tremendously on the reading audience based on the category of report.  The way people receive and learn about news varies based on many factors depending on the type of news, who is presenting the news and how such a reporter present the news . It depends on what they find most easily accessible and what they have access to. </p> <p>        Rogers, (2001), further identified effective reportorial techniques as basic methods that enables a reporter to be more effective and thorough in reporting such methods include; getting detail information relevant to the story, double-checking to ensure accuracy, avoidance of biasness on controversial subject or the subject of a dispute. Robinson, (2011), further highlighted the following; truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity, impartiality, fairness and public accountability as standards, reporters should apply to the acquisition of newsworthy information and its subsequent dissemination to the public. In this study, the researcher, intends to investigate techniques of reporting and the effect it would have on the reading audience.</p> <p><b>1.2 Purpose of the study </b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of reportorial techniques on the reading audience.

The purpose of the study is to establish the role of investigative journalism in conflict resolution. The research design used in this study is the survey research design. Samples were made from the population through the random sampling techniques. This technique was used in selecting Cross River  Newspaper corporation (CHRONICLE) Calabar among all media houses in Nigeria. Both  primary and secondary data were used in the study. Findings made from the data analysis carried out  reveals  that, there is a major difference between investigative reporting and hard news reportage, investigative journalism is a means of conflict resolution. Therefore, Journalist in every media organization should ensure the adoption of indept inquiry before reporting any information to the public.    </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>Chapter One: Introduction</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1 Background To The Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>One of the major duties of a journalist is to be a civic watchdog and achieving this often demands investigation and in-depth work. Thus, in a way, all stories are investigative stories because they require research, digging, interviewing and writing. All reporters are investigators who are trained to ask questions, uncover information and write the most complete stories possible. Nevertheless, some reporters concentrate solely on investigations of wrongdoings. They deal with reporter adversary relationships that are usually not found in beat reporting or other in-depth coverage. Their aim is to ferret out well-guarded information from often hostile sources. This gives them chance to be creative, to become part of their reader’s emotional lives and sometimes  to uncover an injustice and correct it.</p> <p>According to Burns,(2002),the  major difference between investigative journalism  and hard news reportage is that investigative journalism  is presented in an in-depth form rather than a feature or hard news form. The characteristic demands that investigative reportage involves more research and thus more time to write. This becomes very important because of the sensitive role investigative journalism plays in conflict resolution, unlike hard news, which is presented in a pyramid form whereby the most important items are presented in the first few sentences which may sometimes result escalation of conflict situation instead of resolving it (Harcup, 2008). </p> <p>This research work is therefore focused on investigative journalism as a means of conflict resolution in Cross River  Newspaper corporation (CHRONICLE) Calabar. This of course is a very sensitive matter, which will demand extensive verification of evidence of all the facts, eyewitness accounts and   interviews presented for or against a group of people to ensure accuracy.</p> <p>Levin, (2000), asserted that Investigative journalism  on the other hand seeks to find information about a news event that may not be apparent to the public but may lead to revelations that the organization or people involved may not wish to be put in the public domain. As such, it gives a further insight into news and it is often linked to campaigns by the media organizations  for better protection of the rights of people from individuals, organizations or authorities. It may involve probing investigation by the newspaper through which evidence of neglect may be found and published in support of the victims of such conflict situation. </p> <p>In his opinion, Ajibade,  (2003) asserted that, though presented in an in-depth form, investigative journalism is unlike many other forms of feature and even in-depth reportage found in print and presented through the broadcast media. The major differences being the themes and aims behind the write-ups.                                                            </p> <p>The aim behind these forms of reportage is the writer’s search for information in relation to the selected themes in order to further educate and bring to bear the consequences behind these themes to the everyday lives of a selected audience. </p> <p><b>1.2 Statement Of Problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>There are claims that investigative journalism has been in the decline since its haydays in the 1970s , and many investigations are now more concerned with entertainment than information (Harcup,2009). However, investigative journalism as practised in Nigeria is ineffective as it is constrained by several problems despite its bright prospects. More often than not, journalists publish half truth, distorted stories and outright falsehood without indepth investigation, thereby making rumours ,unsubstantiated claims and emotions the bedrock of information gathering. </p> <p>Investigative reporting reveals scandals, shames and corrupt individuals. It uncovers secrets somebody wants to keep hidden. The journalists are also given the image of brave and individualistic reporters, alerted by tip-offs, bringing down a powerful and corrupt figure. Such images also tend to suggest investigative reporters should focus only on the very biggest stories such as presidents taking multimillion bribes from oil companies, or rigging elections. These are misconceptions, which must be corrected. This study intends to address the fact that Investigative journalism is not just about investigating secrets that are locked up through laws and concealment. It involves the role of journalists in uncovering social, economic or cultural developments too recent to have been identified by experts, hidden by received wisdom and masked by media sensationalism as this is a means of resolving most prolonged conflicts.</p> <p><b>1.3 objectives of the study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The purpose of this study  is  to examine investigative journalism  as a means of conflict resolution.

This was the first time when a form of media was “broadcast” to a wider audience.</p> <p>       The first dated printed book known is the “Diamond sutra”, printed in China in 868 AD, although it is clear that books were printed earlier.</p> <p>       Movable day type was invented in 1041 in China. However, due to the slow spread of literacy to the masses in China, and the relations high cost of paper there, the earliest printed mass medium was probably European popular prints from about 1400.</p> <p>       Although those were produced in urge numbers, very few early examples survives, and even more known to be printed before about 1600 have not survived. The term “mass media” was coined with the creation of print media, which is notable for the first example of mass media, as we use the term today.</p> <p>       This form of media started in Europe in the middle ages.</p> <p>Johannes Gutenberg’s invention of the of the printing press allowed the mass production of books to sweep the nation. He printed the first book on a printing press with movable type in 1453.</p> <p>       The Gutenberg Bible, one of the book he published, was translated into many different languages and printed through out the continent. The invention of the printing press in the late 15th century gave rise to some of  the first forms of mass communication by enabling the publication of books and newspaper on a scale much larger than was  previously possible. The invention also transformed the way the world received print materials, although books remained too expensive really to be called a mass medium for at least a century after that. Newspapers developed from about 1612, with the first example in English in 1620; but they look until the 19th century to reach a mass audience directly. The first high circulation, newspapers arose in London in the early 1800s, such as the times, and were made possible by the invention of high speed rotary steam printing presses, and railroads which allowed large-scale distribution over wide geographical areas.</p> <p>       The increase in circulation, however, led to a decline in  feedback and interactivity from the readership, making newspapers a more one- way medium, the phrase“the media began to be used in the 1920s. the notion of “mass media” was generally restricted to print media up until the post-second world war, when radio, television, and video were introduced. The audio-visual facilities became very popular because they provided information and entertainment, because the colour and sound engaged the viewers/listeners and because it was easier for the general public to passively watch TV or listen to the radio times, the internet became the latest and more popular mass medium. Information has become readily available because of the websites and easily accessible through search engines.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>       One can do many activities at the same time, such as playing games, listening to music and networking, irrespective of location. Whilst other forms of mass media are restricted in the type of information they can offer, the internet comprises a large percentage of the sum of human knowledge through such things as google books. Modern day mass media consist of the internet, mobile phones, blogs, podcasts, and RSS feeds.</p> <p>       During the 20th century the growth of mass media was given by technologies such as printing, record pressing and film duplication allowed the duplication of books, newspapers and movies at low prices urge audiences. Radio and television allowed the electronic duplication of information for the first time.</p> <p>       Mass media had the economics of linear reduplication: A single work could make money. An example of Riel and Neil’s sold, and as volumes went up, unit further, vast fortunes were to be made in mass media. In a democratic society, the media can serve the electorate about issues regarding government and co-operate entities (see media influence). Some consider the concentration media ownership to be a threat to democracy.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF MASS MEDIA IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF MASS MEDIA IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>                                   <strong>A LINGUISTIC STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF THE CAMPAIGN   SPEECHES OF TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN THE 2011                               </strong></p> <p><strong>                                                 ELECTIONS</strong></p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>                         INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL BACKGROUND.</p> <p>1.0   PREAMBLE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>This chapter contains the background to the study, a brief profile of the presidential candidates in this study, a brief over view of political campaigns in Nigeria, statement of the problem, research questions, aim, and objectives of the study, justification of the study, scope, and delimitation of the study. Therefore, this chapter provides an insight into the study.</p> <p>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>The ability to communicate effectively is the hallmark of all known politicians wherefore the use of English as an international language has made more people aware of the immense power of words in politics and communication.</p> <p>Thus, Kamalu and Agangan (2007:35) state that language plays an important role in manifesting political wills and accompanying political actions; this is the case with political campaign, especially in Nigeria where campaign affects the electorate who are on the receiving end. Language is therefore used in a unique way; to achieve set goals and objectives. Consequently, campaign speeches are largely dependent on language which is the focus of this study.</p> <p> Language provides the individual with a tool for the exploration and analysis of his conceptual ideas and this is what has distinguished and given man his unique position in the world. This is why Isa (2004:1) maintains that one of the most important functions of human language is its role as a means of communication or interaction between members of the society. She further notes that language helps man to establish social relations and other forms of networks which only language can facilitate and which obviously makes man superior to other animals lacking in the instrumentality of language.</p> <p> Sapir (1927:7) in Abaya (2009:195), Oladayo (2011:38), and Anifowoshe (2006:11) define language as purely non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions, and desires by means of a system of voluntarily produced symbols. According to Harris (1979:53) language is the means by which political ideas are transmitted to the community and that the strength of language in politicking are enormous.</p> <p>However, language conveys different kinds of information relating not only to the speaker’s beliefs but also his identity and relationship with his listeners and hearers which re-enforce that language is vital to human experience. In other words, language serves as an important tool through which effective interaction, mobilization for national development and transformation are achieved.</p> <p>Hence, Ayeni-Akeke (2008: 83), submits that “political life, like other aspects of social existence, is made possible by the ability to communicate.” He argues that “communication underlies the dynamics of political life.” In order to buttress this view, Pie (1978:2) in Joshua (2003: 109), points out that “politics exists not only to push parties and candidates but covers also the pushing of ideas and point of view.” So, politics involves a series of connected activities designed to bring result. These include: campaign, advertising, canvassing, lawn sign, and so on. Behind these bits and pieces of political power games, is language which ‘is an important aspect to political campaign and an interesting vessel of post election communication’ (patriorstatesman).</p> <p>The language of political campaign speeches usually comprises of the use of foreign phrases known as political jargons, three part statements, use of rhetorical questions and pronouns to influence and impress the target audience. There is a large use of quotations and adequate use of repetitions. The mode is manipulative, persuasive and the language is ideologically embedded. (myspeechlab.com)</p> <p>The inability of the electorate to grasp the extent to which politicians use language in order to manipulate, persuade and deceive them into winning their vote is the concern of this study. This is because understanding a language could be difficult without examining fully how such a language is being put to use. Hence, Amodu (2010:1) observes that for a long time, particularly from the early 40s to the late 70s, the study of language concentrated more on the language form, at the expense of how language functions as the case is in functional linguistics and pragmatics. He goes on to say that scholars are gradually shifting ground from paying attention on language structure to studying how language can be functionally used in the society especially if the language has been developed. This reveals that interest in language for communication should be viewed as a good step forward from the narrower and still popular focus on language as grammar. This is not to undermine the importance of the study of language structure but it is an acknowledgement of the fact that the study of how language is being used is now receiving a greater attention and in a new dimension.</p> <p>By studying language in circumstances where all its functions and variations are taken into consideration, it is possible to learn more about how perceptions, convictions, and identities are influenced by language. More so, words   and expressions are used or omitted to affect meaning in different ways. In political speeches during election campaigns, ideas and ideologies need to be conveyed through language so that they are agreed upon by the receivers as well as by others who may read or hear parts of the speech afterwards in the media. Thus, citizens of democratic countries have the option to go to the ballot boxes on election days and vote for one person or one party. Whether their decision goes along with a political conviction or not, it is most likely based on communication through language. Black, (2005) in Kulo,(2009:1) states that within all types of political system, from autocratic, through oligarchic to democratic, leaders have relied on the spoken word to convince others of the benefits that arise from their leadership. The study attempts to unravel the features of language that are peculiar to the speeches of the presidential candidates using the linguistic stylistic approach.</p> <p>Aristotle in Anifowose and Enemuo (1991:1) mentions that “man is by nature a political animal.” By this, he means that the essence of social existence is politics and that two or more men interacting with one another are invariably involved in a political relationship. Therefore, it is evident that both language and politics intersect at the point of interaction. Similarly, Merk (1967:13) cited in Anifowose and Enumuo (1991:1) argues that politics is the “art of influencing, manipulating, and controlling others; which are all indubitable functions of language in verbal communication.</p> <p>Moreover, political speeches are composed by a team of professional speech writers, who are educated in the use of persuasive language. Beard, (2001:18) in Kulo (2009:1) throws more light, that adding rhetorical devices to a pre-composed speech may be of crucial importance to election results. He adds that a political speech is not necessarily a success because of correctness or truth rather politicians use language in presenting valued arguments to achieve their aims of winning votes. To examine the most prominent linguistic/stylistic features of language is a cardinal focus of the research.</p> <p>1.2         A BRIEF PROFILE OF THE CONTESTANTS.</p> <p>Many presidential candidates publicly declared their intentions but we shall look at two for this study.</p> <p>General Muhammadu Buhari was born on December, 1942 in Daura, Katsina state in the North West zone, Nigeria. He became Nigeria’s Head of State on December 31, 1983. He was over thrown on August 27, 1985. His administration introduced the “War Against Indiscipline” (WAI) campaign which, despite its highhandedness, it still landed to have created the most orderly conduct in both public and private life of the country since independence.</p> <p>Before becoming head of state, Buhari had been chairman of the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation, minister of petroleum and natural resource and governor of north eastern state of Nigeria. He was also chairman of Petroleum (special) Trust Fund under General Sani Abacha; since 2003, Buhari has sought to become Nigeria’s civilian president, without success. He contested in the 2003 and 2007 presidential elections under the platform of the All Nigerian People’s Party, losing out on both occasions to the Peoples Democratic Party candidates. He fell out of the leadership of the All Nigerian People’s Party and succeeded in pulling out with him some of the supporters of the party which formed the Congress for Progressive Change. He was ratified as the presidential candidate of the party in 2011 elections. He declared that CPC is ready “to get the PDP off the backs of Nigerians and hammers on the need for change. (starAfrica.com/en/news)</p> <p>Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan was born on Nov 20, 1957 in Otuoke, Bayelsa state south-south zone, Nigeria. He is a Ph.D. holder in hydrobiology and fisheries. He was appointed as Science Inspector of Education; Rivers state Ministry of Education between 1983 and 1993. He took up employment as a lecturer in the State College of Education. He was appointed Assistant Director of the defunct Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission. His desire to better the lot of the people motivated him to go into politics in 1998. Simplicity, charisma, quiet strength, and determination made him an ideal running mate to chief D.S.P, Alamieyeseigha on the Bayelsa PDP gubernatorial ticket. They won the elections and he served as a deputy governor from 1999 to 11, December 2000. But on 12, December 2005, he became the <strong>substantive </strong>governor of Bayelsa state. After that, fate once again beckoned on him to a higher height. As he was busy preparing for a re-election as a state governor, the PDP, nominated him as a running mate to the presidential candidate, Alhaji Umaru Yar’Adua. On May 29, 2007; he was inaugurated as Nigeria’s Vice- President.</p> <p>In February 9, 2010, Dr. Jonathan assumed office as Nigeria’s Acting President by virtue of a National Assembly’s resolution empowering him following President Yar’Adua’s long absence for Medical attention in Saudi Arabia. Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan was sworn in on May 6, 2010 as President, Commander-in-chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p> <p>In April, 2011 the incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan was re-elected as President, Commander-in-chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and with a transformation agenda. (http://www.goodluckjonathanfor2011.com)</p> <p>1.3   AN OVERVIEW OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS IN NIGERIA</p> <p>A campaign is a series of actions that are intended to achieve a particular result, especially in politics or business. Oota (2011:1) adds that campaigns are exciting events where oratory is on display and love shared though sometimes thugs and other violent characters may be out to unleash mayhem on innocent party supporters.</p> <p>The Nigerian saga of political campaigns, which has great bearing on our contemporary situation, has its roots in the pre-independence era with the formation of political parties. Appadorai (2003:282) states that a political party is an organised group of citizens who hold similar political opinions and who work to get control of the government in order that the policies in which they are interested may be carried into effect. Since the Pre-Independence and First Republic of 1959 and 1964 respectively, political parties have participated in political campaigns which prepared them for the general elections. But, political parties have had their ideological differences, which were reflected in their manifestos. Mohammed J. (2004:144-145), (Ogbodo, 2011:109), (Mohammed, A. 2004:143).</p> <p>Thereafter, other successive elections in Nigeria were the 1979, 1983, 1993, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011. Each of these elections was not without vibrant political campaigns by the various parties that aspired to rule the country. Some of these were transition elections organized by military regimes that had to hand over power to a democratic civilian government (1979,1993 and 1999) while the elections held in 1964, 1983, 2003, 2007 and 2011 were organized by incumbent civilian governments whose offices and positions were also in contest. (Sekibo, 2010), (Ogbodo, 2011:140).</p> <p>In the 2011 elections which is the period under study, there were 63 political parties but a total of 54 submitted candidates for various elective positions (Ogbodo, 2011:162) and (Corcoran 2011). This is against the 9 political parties that participated in the 1959 and 1964 general elections. However, this set the stage for a tougher presidential campaign, for no fewer than 21 political parties presented candidates for the elections. Prominent among the 21 political parties are: Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), Labour Party (LP), Democratic People’s Alliance (DPA), and All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). This, therefore, made the political atmosphere in Nigeria to become undoubtedly charged and political campaigns took centre stage. Ogbodo, (2011:162) observes that instead of parties competing to better the lot of the electorate, it has become warfare with each party trying to defeat and if possible eliminate the opponents.</p> <p>The contest for who occupies the exalted office of the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is certainly democratic (Oota, 2011:1). However, one of the major avenues which the electorate’s minds were prepared for the elections was through the political campaigns of these various presidential candidates. This was also the same avenue whereby these presidential candidates sold their party manifestos and (also) made their campaign promises to the electorate. The people then took out time to watch their candidates exhibit their understanding of the economy, security and their welfare in terms of programmes and policies.</p> <p>1.4 TYPES OF CAMPAIGNS</p> <p>There are different kinds of campaigns, some of which are political campaign, advertising campaign, and military campaign.</p> <p>Political campaign is vote-seeking activities: a series of events, for example rallies and speeches that are intended to persuade voters to vote for a specific politician or party (Encarta 2009). Also, Ayeni-Akeke, (2008:83) adds that political campaign is an important exertion in presenting or marketing a candidate for an elective office. In other words, it is an organized effort which seeks to influence the decision making process within a specific group. The message of the campaign contains the ideas that the candidate wants to share with the voters. The message often consists of several talking points about policy. These points summarize the main idea of campaign and are repeated frequently in order to create a lasting impression with the voters. The objective of every campaign speech is to convince the electorate that they have the blueprint for tackling the numerous challenges facing the country. For example, in Nigeria issues like power generation and distribution, job creation, the nation’s general economic revival, industrial development, repositioning of the education sector, revival of health sector delivery, security situation in the land and the fight against corruption featured prominently as they indeed dominated the campaign speeches of the presidential candidates. As such, language use in political campaigns has certain characteristics which differentiate it from other varieties of language use. For instance, certain words are repeated, the objective being to condition the minds of the electorate. However, it is noted that some of the features of language use are without timelines and specific strategies for actualization.</p> <p>Talking point is a succinct statement designed to persuasively support one side taken on an issue. Such statements can either be free standing or created as retorts to the opposition’s talking points and are frequently used in public relations, particularly in areas heavy in debate such as politics and marketing (Wikipedia).</p> <p>However, in many elections, the opposition party will try to get candidate “off message” by bringing up policy or personal questions that are not related to the talking points. Most campaigns prefer to keep the message broad in order to attract the most potential voters. Unfortunately, a message        that is too narrow can alienate voters or show the candidate down with explaining details. For example in the 2008 American presidential election John McCain originally used a message that focused on his patriotism and political experience. “Country First”; later the message was charged to shift attention to his role as “The Original Maverick” within the political establishment. Barack Obama ran on a consistent, simple message of ‘change’ throughout his campaign. In other words, if the message is created carefully, it will assure the candidate victory at the polls.</p> <p>In addition, in modern politics, the most high profile political campaigns are focused on candidates for head of state or head of government, often a President or Prime-Minister (Wikipedia). This was the situation in Nigeria in the 2011 presidential campaign.</p> <p>Kessel, (1998:79) observes those substandard differences that exist between nomination politics and electoral politics. He says nomination campaigns are aimed at getting delegates but electoral campaigns are aimed at winning votes and are party wide and nationwide. This takes off fully after the acceptance speech, division is put aside, and the party is transformed into a victory rally. He further explains that the presidential candidate is joined by the vice presidential candidate, and both are joined by their families. Other party leaders, those who have held key positions and others who have sought the nominations themselves, make appearances at the presidential campaigns to symbolize the party wide support to be given the nominee.</p> <p>Also important is that campaign in politics has assumed a complex dimension in recent years due to the major breakthrough in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Unlike the campaigns in the past, advances in media technology have streamlined the process, thereby giving candidates more options to reach even larger groups of constituents with very little physical effort.</p> <p>This claim is further supported by Oota, (2011:1) that in advanced democracies, particularly in the United States of America, oration and conduct at debates and rallies are some of the benchmarks used to gauge the popularity of all those seeking political offices. Suffice it to say that packaging of campaigns in terms of slogans and contacts are also the main key in advanced democracies and this window of popularity and acceptability was well explored by the current president of the USA, Barack Obama through his grassroots mobilization of the people. We can say that to some extent the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Nigeria, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan employed a similar campaign pattern, as in the neighbour to neighbour campaign advertisement and the frequent sophisticated electronic campaign.</p> <p>Advertising campaign is another form of campaign which is similar to political campaign in terms of its language use. It is a planned and organized series of actions intended to achieve a specific goal, especially fighting for or against something or raising people’s awareness of something. Wright (1983:8) remarks that advertising is a powerful communication force and a vital marketing tool helping to sell goods and services, image and ideas. Similarly, Roderick (1980:4) defines advertising as “a message specified by its originator, carried by a communication system intended to influence and/or inform an unknown audience.</p> <p>However, military campaign tends to address a series of military or terrorist operations taking place in one area over a period, intended to achieve a specific objective. It is related to the political campaign in terms of military coup speeches and military heads of state’s speeches as the purpose is political and having some elements of political language (Abaya 2008:2).</p> <p>Finally, there is a common thought unit on the definitions of political, advertising, and military campaigns that is geared towards achieving a specific goal. The study of the presidential campaign speeches is concerned with the political campaign speech types, to seek votes.In particular, the linguistic stylistic analysis of the speeches of the presidential candidates of the two opposing parties, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Gen. Muhammadu Buhari Rtd. of Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), will be carried out.</p> <p>1.5 STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM</p> <p> Political campaign speeches are one of the major avenues through which the contestants vying for the various political positions in their parties and the government of the country win votes. The speeches of these candidates are conveyed through the most effective tool of communication which is language, to achieve their objectives. Apart from making attempts to garner vote and to canvass for supports, political aspirants try to make themselves understood by their listeners. Often times, misconceptions arise because of the electorate’s level of education, their linguistic background, and the complex nature of language; these phenomena at times result in the aspirants loss of massive support, as the major tool the aspirants rely on is language. In view of this, there is the need to critically examine the speeches of the presidential aspirants in the 2011 election in Nigeria; since meanings are not just in the lexical entities that make up a sentence but to a very large extent, determined by the syntactic casing that houses an utterance and the context of the expression. Furthermore, Leckie-Tarry (1995:5) observes that understanding language must take into account not only the nature of the text, but also the discursive processes by which text is produced and interpreted in this regard, the speeches. Bearing this in mind, the study seeks to investigate the structure/nature of the campaign speeches that generated the specific semantic configuration that emerged and the contexts that enhanced this meaning outcome which was directed at achieving specific goals (objectives) by these politicians.</p> <p>This study is therefore an attempt to answer the following questions:</p> <p>a.                 How does the language use of these presidential candidates reflect their idiosyncratic nature?</p> <p>b.                 What role does context play in these presidential campaign speeches and how do the speeches vary in different contexts?</p> <p>c.                  Which rhetorical and linguistic devices are most prominent in these presidential campaign speeches?</p> <p>d.                 What common linguistic/stylistic traits are prevalent in these speeches?</p> <p>1.6 AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>It is an indubitable fact that campaign speech is an important tool employed by politicians to express views and feelings to the public with the sole intention of reshaping and redirecting the electorates’ opinions to agree with their manifesto. Hence, campaign speeches are generally full of persuasion, manipulation, deception, lies, hyperbole, and ambiguity which are conveyed through a deliberate choice of words.</p> <p>This study examines the presidential campaign speeches of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) flag bearer, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) flag bearer, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) in the 2011 elections. It critically examines these presidential speeches within the scope of linguistic stylistics. Specifically, the research intends to achieve the following objectives:</p> <p>a. To show that the language use of these presidential candidates reflect their idiosyncratic nature.</p> <p>b. To project that context plays a dominant role in presidential campaign speeches.</p> <p>c. To critically explore the rhetorical and linguistic devices that are prominent in these presidential campaign speeches.</p> <p>d. To determine the common linguistic/stylistic features or traits that are prevalent in the speeches of these candidates.</p> <p>1.7     JUSTIFICATION FOR THE STUDY</p> <p>Nigeria has witnessed one civilian government after the other since independence and the campaign speeches made by the various presidential candidates helped to determine who ruled the country at each point in time. However, the electorate was not cognizant of the linguistic stylistic significance of the campaign speeches. Therefore, there is need for this study to broaden their understanding of the varying linguistic stylistic features of the speeches. Its findings are of benefit to students of language and those who want to take part in politics, to re-awaken the consciousness of Nigerian politicians to the use of language and suggest a better way of using language to carry people along. The study is significant to the extent that though several researches have been carried out in pragmatics, critical discourse analysis  and linguistic stylistic analysis of political speeches in such areas as the language of politics, propaganda in politics, the language of political campaigns in the print media, military coup speeches, advertisement and religion, just to mention a few, hardly is there any of such research effort specifically on linguistic stylistic analysis of  Nigerian presidential campaign speeches  of 2011 elections.</p> <p>1.8     SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research does not constitute a linguistic stylistic analysis of the campaign speeches of the 21 presidential candidates that contested the 2011 elections but, focuses on the candidates from two major opposing parties namely: Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and General Mohammed Buhari rtd; Congress for Progressive Change (CPC). The choice of these parties is based on the fact that these   major parties (PDP, CPC,) have captured the majority of the electorate in the country, though CPC is more of a regional party, however, the PDP has a national outlook.</p> <p>The study looks at the 2011 elections so as to make the research more current and reliable. The focus of this work is the linguistic stylistic study of the campaign speeches. It is difficult to study all the campaign speeches of the presidential candidates. As a result, the study has been restricted   to some selected speeches in the north-west and north –central zones. A total of eight (8) speeches for both candidates are examined in this research. Relevant portions of the selected speeches are extracted and analysed from the perspective of the adopted linguistic framework, which is the systemic functional linguistic approach.</p>\n\n A LINGUISTIC STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF THE CAMPAIGN   SPEECHES OF TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN THE 2011 ELECTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  A LINGUISTIC STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF THE CAMPAIGN   SPEECHES OF TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN THE 2011 ELECTIONS", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN IN WIVES REVOLE AND OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER I: Introduction</strong></p> <p>1.1     <strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The In sourcing and/or Outsourcing decision is referred to in purchasing as sourcing policy decision and it is one of the most important decision points for any organization because it has a multiple and web like effect on the life of the organization.</p> <p>Managers of businesses most especially manufacturing organizations faces a series of important and determining questions which must be answered correctly if the organization is to succeed in midst of competition.</p> <p>The Purchasing Manager must first address the question of which product or service best fits the needs of the organization and should the organization produce (make or insource) what is consumed or buy from outside suppliers? The questions arising from this is that, if they decide to buy from outside suppliers, will the organization buy from a single supplier (single source) or from several suppliers (multiple source); even when that is answered, the questions will still be, should we buy directly from manufacturers or use intermediaries or may be, the organization should both insource and outsource simultaneously.</p> <p>However, before an organization can come to any decision as to whether to make what it consume in-house or to buy from outside suppliers (outsourced) several factors such as financial consideration, cost consideration, core competence consideration and a way they will have to be critically analyzed to see how they will affect the organization productivity.</p> <p>Outsourcing therefore, is a purchasing policy where outside suppliers are engaged to supply an organization with its materials requirements.</p> <p>Insourcing on this other hand signifies a situation where what the organization needs, it produces and consumes. Several factors as already indicated will need to be explained before an organization could come to any of these sourcing policy decisions. These shall be the fulcrum of this study.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>In an attempt to enhance their competitiveness, organizations are increasingly turning to outsourcing. The argument is that outsourcing is a way of achieving strategic goals, reduce cost, improve customers satisfaction and to provide other efficiencies and effectiveness (overall productivity).</p> <p>However, NOCACO has long been using outsourcing in the realization of its needed materials, yet with the supposed advantages of outsourcing. The organization has experience a tremendous fall in productivity, cost of doing business has become almost exorbitant, quality has been falling and market shares and sales have also fallen.</p> <p>Another issue that calls for concern is that, the organization has been using single sourcing policy which sometimes causes delays in the supply of necessary materials used for production. The question that emanates from these issues for this study is that, should the organization continue with the outsourcing policy and examine other factors or considers insourcing policy? Or should the organization insource and outsource at the same time?</p> <p>1.3     <strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The researched is aimed at setting the effect of insourcing or outsourcing decision on the productivity of Northern Cable Processing and Manufacturing Company (NOCACO) Kaduna.</p> <p>The main objective is built around a number of specific objectives, among these are:</p> <p>i)                   To determine the process the organization follow in outsourcing of contracts.</p> <p>ii)                To identify criteria for insourcing or outsourcing.</p> <p>iii)              To examine the benefits of insourcing or outsourcing.</p> <p>iv)              To identify the cost involved in Insourcing or outsourcing decision.</p> <p>v)                To determine the effect of insource and outsource on productivity.</p> <p>1.4     <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research work is of immense significance.</p> <p>First, the researcher will benefit from this study as it is a basic requirement in partial fulfillment of the award of Higher National Diploma (HND) in Purchasing and Supply Management in Kaduna Polytechnic; and without which the researcher cannot graduate.</p> <p>Again, as a store of knowledge, the research will serve as a guide for other researchers who may want to do a further study on the same problem. It will also benefit the organization understudied, to help it make a better choices as to whether to insource an activity or outsource it. The general public will also benefit from the explanation of this five principle, other manufacturers and service providers will also find it handy and helpful in deciding on the questions whether to insource or outsourced; and the implications for each decision taken.</p> <p>1.5     <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The exercise is centered on the effect of Insourcing and Outsourcing on the Productivity of Northern Cable Processing and Manufacturing Company (NOCACO), Kaduna located at B12 Maichibi Road, Kakuri, Kaduna South. The focus will be on purchasing, store and production departments of the organization.</p> <p>1.6     <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>i)                   What are the processes the organization follows in outsourcing of contracts?</p> <p>ii)                 What are the criteria used for outsourcing or insourcing?</p> <p>iii)              What are the benefits of outsourcing or insourcing?</p> <p>iv)              What are the cost involved in insourcing or outsourcing?</p> <p>v)                 What are the effect of insource or outsource decision on productivity?</p> <p>1.7     <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Sourcing: </strong>This is a purchasing procedure through which buyers seek, survey and evaluate suppliers and determine policies relating to those who will most suitably meet the requirement of the buying organization.</p> <p><strong>Insourcing:</strong> This is the process by which an organization takes responsibility for providing services and conducting its operations in-house or in other locations but by its own staff.</p> <p><strong>Outsourcing:</strong> This is the process by which an organization contract out services and operations that are usually conducted in-house to other firms that can do them better, cheaper and faster.</p> <p><strong>Single Sourcing Policy:</strong> This describes a situation where the buyer places all orders with one single supplier.</p> <p><strong>Dual/Multiple Sourcing:</strong> This also describes a situation where the buyer shares the order among two or more suppliers.</p> <p><strong>Policy:</strong> This is a management guide that cause managers to take action in certain ways, by exposing the organization’s official strategies and attitude to various forms of behavior.</p> <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> This describes a person or company that can agree to supply or release goods or services to a buyer.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> Anything that can be offered to the market for attention, acquisition, use or consumption that might satisfy needs.</p> <p><strong>Quality:</strong> This is the totality of features and characteristics of a product that bears on the ability of the product to satisfy stated or implied needs.</p> <p><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> This is the ability of an organization to add more value for its customers than its rivals and thereby attain a position of relative advantage.</p> <p><strong>Distinctive Competence:</strong> These are those capabilities that are unique to an organization and which gives it competitive advantage over its rivals and also gives them, above normal economic performance.</p> <p><strong>Core Competencies:</strong> Are the activities that are central to the firms’ mission in which the organization excels, compared to other firms.</p> <p><strong>Production:</strong> This directly refers to the rate of units produced in terms of machines, labour, materials or any other effective basis.</p> <p><strong>Productivity:</strong> This is the attitude of the mine. It is a mentality of progress of the constant improvement of that which exists. It is the process of harnessing the capacity to increase production by ensuring proper and efficient use of all types of resources.</p> <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> This implies using minimum amount of resources to reach the goals. That is, doing things right.</p> <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> This means pursuing and reading the appropriate goals. In other words, doing the right thing.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> This is the amount of expenditure incurred on a given item.</p>\n\nPORTRAYAL OF WOMEN IN WIVES REVOLE AND OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN IN WIVES REVOLE AND OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>TENSE ERRORS IN ENGLISH ESSAYS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS</strong></p> <p><strong>  CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background of the Study </strong></p> <p>This research work deals with tense errors in English essays of Secondary School.

In the absence of a population census, a rough estimate would put their population at over 500,000.</p> <p>          Yukuben is however a generally accepted term (oxonomy) for an area, an ethnic group and a language located mainly at the eastern edge of Nigeria (but also in the neighbouring part of Cameroon). The name Yukuben was derived from Jukun (the language of Takum) which serves as lingua franca in Taraba. The speakers call themselves Yukuben, and the language is locally called Uhumkiji.</p> <p>          Today, the Yukuben is widely spread across such states as Kaduna, Yola etc. in Nigeria and also in North West regions in Cameroon. The speakers are also found in every part of the country, and in many African countries such as Niger, Cameroon, to mention a few.</p> <p>(Source: Lewis M. Paul (ed) 2009, “Yukuben a language of Nigeria”)</p> <p><strong>1.1     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF YUKUBEN</strong></p> <p>          According to oral tradition, the Yukubens originated from Iden in the north neighbouring Cameroon. A large part moved down to their present location on the plains at the foot of some hills namely Kichieni, Sabo, Iya, Kehensin, Oluko, Kalakir and Ito during the British colonization. Since Cameroon was colonized by the French, there was a boundary that separated both countries and the people.</p> <p>         Their oral history also has it that the Kuteb once tried to invade the Jukuns, but the Jukuns fought back and were victorious. Then, the Kuteb tried another plot on Yukuben sometime around 1992. Failingly, the Kuteb went back to fight the Jukun again, who eventually put an end to their will of invasion.</p> <p>          Oral tradition also has it that presently there is no king title in Takum since there is no proven superiority nor is there a conclusive agreement between the Jukun and Kuteb. King in Jukun is called Kuru and Okue in Kuteb. Though, history has it that the Jukuns once proposed the king be called ‘chief’ instead of both contradicting names, but the Kuteb claimed the name ‘chief’ was foreign and unacceptable.</p> <p>          However, oral tradition states that the Yukuben, being able to drive the Kuteb away afforded them the opportunity of owning their kingdom and having their king title as the “Udeng Uquen of Uhumkji land”.</p> <p><strong>1.2            </strong><strong>SOCIO-LINGUISTIC PROFILE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2.0  THE YUKUBEN SPEAKERS</strong></p> <p>          The speakers of Yukuben call themselves Uhumkiji and call their language Yukuben (“spiritual being”). The origin of the name can be traced to a time during the slave trade, when a rebellious slave from Uhumkiji refused to work and was being tortured. Suddenly, bees emerged from nowhere, stung and scared everybody away. Following this scenario, slaves and slave traders gave the name Yukuben (“child of a witch”) to the slave and people from Uhumkiji generally.</p> <p>          Most Yukuben speakers, including the younger generations are multilingual; using Yukuben, Hausa, Kuteb, Jukun and in rear cases English. English language is the medium of instruction in schools, while Yukuben is used as a second language. The older generation are not quite as fluent in English as the younger generation, who through education; hold positions in the administration and the public service, including the police.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1  POPULATION OF THE YUKUBENS</strong></p> <p>          Going by the Joshua Project figure in 2010, the Yukuben speakers are estimated to be about 23,000 in Nigeria and 25,000 in all countries. My respondent on this language however argues that the Yukuben population will by now be more than five hundred thousand (500,000). This can be justified considering the fact that Yukuben speakers are spread across the country and most have settled in different regions.</p> <p>          Yukuben speakers are found in any part of the country where farming exists. This is based on the fact that most of the Yukubens are farmers with thousands of settlements in different parts of the country. For example, a large population of the Yukubens is found occupying a large area in Kaduna state, Adamawa state and many other Northern states in Nigeria. Even in the west; Yukubens are found in large population in states like Ondo, Osun etc. as farmers.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2  YUKUBEN DIALECTS AND NOMENCLATURE</strong></p> <p>          There are three distinct dialect of Yukuben, recognized according to the main villages or towns where each dialect is spoken. The dialects are: Lisa, Shibun and Fete. Also, there are other languages spoken within the Sabongida Yukuben which belong to other ethnic groups.  These languages are Lufu, Malam-she and Kapia, the three being Jukun languages, then Genuwa, Acha, kpampo and Lisam form Kuteb.</p> <p>          There are alternative names to Yukuben and they are: Ayikiben, Balaabe, Boritsu, Nyikobe, Nyikuben, Oohum, Uhumkiji, Uuhum, Uuhum-Gigi, and Gohum. These names are given to them by different ethnic groups in an attempt to address them. However, the two popular names with which they are always addressed as are Yukuben and Uhumkiji.</p> <p><strong>1.3     SOCIO-CULTURAL PROFILE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3.1  RELIGION</strong></p> <p>          The Yukubens are Christians with cases of Traditional Religion which according to them is taken as part of the culture of the land. Since Christianity came later, the people believe that their Traditional Religion (Idol worshiping) should not be stopped. They still worship some idols which they believe protects them from witchcraft and burglary. Some of these idols are: Oohgum, Khima (god of thunder), Bahmbie etc.</p> <p>          During the British colonization, Christianity was introduced by missionaries and some of the people abandoned their original clan cults for a reformed form of Christianity (CRCN: Christianity Reform Church of Nigeria), and many other denominations.</p> <p>          It is their belief that all the Yukuben sons and daughter must be Christians of good faith, and should have no reason to change their religion. This is evident in the fact that no single mosque is found in Sabongida Yukuben. It is therefore likely that a Yukuben indigene may not hear or know any Muslim prayer or salutation in his or her lifetime . However, influence based on trade, marriage, education, and some other social factors between the Yukubens and Muslim Hausas, may in no time introduce Islam to the Yukubens.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2  OCCUPATION</strong></p> <p>          Except for the educated Yukubens, who occupy positions in administration, police and in educational sector, most Yukubens are farmers. This would account for the reason why they are found more in different settlements in all parts of the country.</p> <p>          The major crop is guinea-corn, which they call “Ihin”. They also grow crops such as peanuts, maize, rice, cassava, soya beans, palm, cocoa, cola nut and different varieties of vegetables. They also engage in hunting, carpentry, basketry, gourd carving etc.</p> <p><strong>1.3.3  MARRIAGE</strong></p> <p>          There is a formal family introduction of the male and female families. Then, the male or groom’s family present palm oil (in a calabash) and a fowl (cock) to the in-laws. Other gifts, usually bush meats like grass cutter may be presented.</p> <p>          After the approval by the bride’s family, a wedding date is chosen. On the wedding day, the groom’s family provides locally bade beer (‘Besen, also called ‘Burukutu’) mixed with honey. Then, the attendants drink, dance and celebrate.</p> <p><strong>1.3.4  GOVERNANCE</strong></p> <p>          The Yukubens have a king title. The king is called the ‘Udeng Uquen’ of Uhumkji land. At the level of the family, the husband is the head of each home. Each extended family also has a chief who is the head of compound.</p> <p><strong>1.3.5  TRADITION AND FESTIVALS</strong></p> <p>                   Yukuben culture is highly enriched with traditional practices, which are often reflected in their various festivals at different times and seasons. The most common and celebrated festival among the Yukubens is the annual “Kukyib Festival” which is festival for appeasing the gods. This masquerade festival is considered the biggest celebration in the land.</p> <p>          Another big celebration is the circumcision. The festival is called “Kukyib Kamang” among them. This circumcision is only observed for the men as sign or a celebration that ushers the boys (between the age 10-15) into adulthood. Other celebrations include death, marriage, chieftaincy, coronation etc.</p> <p>          Yukubens’s mode of dressing is similar to that of Jukun. In the olden days, women use leaf to cover their private parts while men use bark of the tree, called ‘Isang’ among them. A Yukuben female child or woman kneels down to greet, the same way the Yoruba’s do, while a Yukuben male child or man will only squat while greeting.</p> <p>          Yukubens also have a number of cultural food like Tuwo (bunna). The major drink in the land is called Besen (Burukutu).</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>          <strong>GENETIC CLASSIFICATION OF YUKUBEN</strong></p> <p>                                                 AFRICA</p> <p>      </p> <p>  AFRO-ASIATIC     NILO-SAHARA                            NIGER-KORDOFANIAN          KHOISAN</p> <p>      </p> <p>                                                                NIGER- CONGO                                       KORDOFANIAN</p> <p>      </p> <p>WEST-ATLANTIC     MANDE         GUR       KWA      BENUE-CONGO   ADAMAWA       HANGIAN</p> <p>      </p> <p>                                                         PLATEAU      JUKUNOID           CROSS- RIVER        BANTOID</p> <p>                                                                                      <strong>YUKUBEN</strong></p> <p>                                                SOURCE: WILLIAMSON (1982)</p> <p><strong>1.5     SCOPE AND ORGANISATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>          This work comprises five chapters in all. Chapter one covers the general background and introduction of the study, quits to historical background, and their socio-cultural profile like, occupation, religion, population, tradition, culture and festivals etc. The chapter also contains the languages genetic classification, theoretical framework, data collection and analysis.</p> <p>          Chapter two focuses on the basic phonological concepts like sounds inventory, which comprises consonants and vowels together with tonal and syllable inventory, sound distribution and distinctive features.</p> <p>          Chapter three centres on the phonological processes that are attested in the language. It explains such processes as in the language like labialization, nasalization, homorganic assimilation, vowel harmony etc.</p> <p>          Chapter four deals with the tonal/syllable processes as attested in the language while chapter five covers the summary and conclusion of the study.</p> <p><strong>1.6     THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK – GENERATIVE PHONOLOGY</strong></p> <p>          Generative phonology, as in Chomsky and Halle (1968), will be used in this study of Yukuben phonology. The basic goal of generative phonology is to express the link between sound and meaning (Chomsky 1965). It gives the rule of how the mind perceives sounds and how those sounds are produced with the interpretation of utterances. Generative phonology accounts for linguistic intuition, accent, speech error and language acquisition among others.</p> <p>          Generative phonology is one of the most recently used optimality theory. In 1959, Chomsky and Halle worked on generative phonology with knowledge of the sequential constraints, which are responsible for the fact of speakers in language to have a sense of sounds like in their native language. Generative phonology is the description on how phonological rules can be converted into phonological representation and the capturing of the distinctive sounds in contrast in a language (Hyman 1975:19).</p> <p>          Generative phonology focuses on grammar as consisting a set of finite rules operating upon a finite vocabulary, and capable of generating an infinite set of sentences. According to Lyons (1970), the rules and structures generated through generative phonology are like syntax, “recursive”. For instance, one could say;</p> <p>‘This is the man that married the girl that wrote the book    that was stolen by my friend that lives in London’.</p> <p>One could therefore say that a generative syntax or phonology explains the grammar that is capable of generating an infinite number of recursive rules of operating upon a finite vocabulary.</p> <p><strong>1.6.1  THE STRUCTURE OF GENERATIVE PHONOLOGY</strong></p> <p>         According to Hyman (1975:80), phonological structure is an abstract phonemic representation, which postulates the rules that are derived from various surface realizations. In postulating the underlying form at the systematic phonemic level from which surface alternatives have systematic relationship termed linguistically significant generalizations, there are three representations in GP, they are highlighted and explained below:</p> <p>          <strong>UNDERLYING REPRESENTATION (UR)</strong></p> <p>          Underlying representation is the non-predictable parts of words. It is a form with abstract representation existing in the linguistic competence of a native speaker.</p> <p>          <strong>PHONOLOGICAL RULES</strong></p> <p>          Phonological rules are predictable rules. According to Hyman (1975), they are derivational sequence of items from an underlying level to a phonetic level.</p> <p>Example of phonological rule is the rule that inserts a vowel to break a sequence of consonant (consonant cluster) in Yoruba. It cab be written thus:</p> <p>i.e.     Ø                  V/C               C</p> <p>          Ø                   [+syll.] / [+cons]                       [+cons]</p> <p>          <strong>PHONETIC REPRESENTATIONS</strong></p> <p>According to Hyman (1975), it represents possible pronunciation of forms in the realization of speech and at the surface level.</p> <p><strong>1.7     DATA COLLECTION</strong></p> <p>          The data for this research will be collected using “Language Informant” to elicit data. The Ibadan word list of four hundred (400) basic lexical items will be used in data collection.</p> <p>          The method of the collection is through direct interviews with the informants (language helper) alongside the usage of the Ibadan word list, which contain items that are illuminating and capable of making a linguistically significant generalization.</p> <p>          The information concerning the two informants used in this research are given below:</p> <p>          <strong>Informant 1</strong></p> <p>NAME:       Augustin Bako</p> <p>AGE:          35yrs</p> <p>LANGUAGE SPOKEN:         Yukuben, Hausa, Yoruba, Jukun, English</p> <p>RELIGION:          Christianity</p> <p>YEARS LIVED IN YUKUBEN: 35 yrs</p> <p>OCCUPATION:   Security Man</p> <p>ADDRESS:          No. 1 Sabongida Yukuben, Takum Local Government, Taraba State.</p> <p>MARITAL STATUS:    Married</p> <p><strong>Informant 2</strong></p> <p>NAME:       Bako Adamu</p> <p>AGE:          90yrs</p> <p>LANGUAGE SPOKEN:         Yukuben, Hausa, Jukun, Kuteb</p> <p>RELIGION:          Christianity</p> <p>YEARS LIVED IN YUKUBEN: 80yrs</p> <p>OCCUPATION:   Forest Guard (retired)</p> <p>ADDRESS:          No.4 Sabongida Yukuben, Takum Local Government Taraba State.</p> <p>MARITAL STATUS: Married          </p> <p><strong>1.8     DATA ANALYASIS</strong></p> <p>          With the view of capturing linguistically significant generalizations of the language under study, the analysis of the corpus will be carried out by transcribing all linguistic corpus collected accurately, in order to discover the stands that are attested in the language, in addition to some other suprasegmental features. The data will be organized to bring out all inventories of the distinctive phonemes and their features.</p> <p>          The distribution of the data is also determined alongside the syllable structure, phonological processes and tonal processes.</p>\n\nASPECT OF THE PHONOLOGY OF YUKUBEN          <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASPECT OF THE PHONOLOGY OF YUKUBEN          ", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ASPECTS  OF MIGILI  MORPHOLOGY</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0              </strong> <strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong> </p> <p>Language is the universal fabric that holds every individual of a community together.  An instrument, used by man for communication within his environment, without which there would be no meaningful relationship between the human world.  Language can also be referred to as the medium through which ideas, thoughts, and other forms of human communication are expressed or carried out.</p> <p>In the metal compartment where all possible, meaningful and acceptable words are formed, there are certain rules that must be followed or certain conditions met before any word can be viewed as acceptable in any language.  The branch of linguistics that studies the compatibility of such combinations and proposes the rules for their formation is called MORPHOLOGY. The basic concept of this branch is the morpheme, the smallest meaningful unit in grammar which may constitute a word or part of a word.</p> <p>Every language has its own set of morphological rules which are strictly adhered to by members of its community. Such members , (Native speakers) share a great deal of unconscious knowledge about their language which helps in the acquisition of their first language with little or no formal instructions.  In connection to morphology, the Migili language has been duely investigated with a view to finding/revealing the aspects of its morphological set up.  The Migili people are a tribal group found in Agyaragu local government, Lafia, Nasarawa State.  The first chapter of this research centers on areas such as the historical background of the Migili people, their socio-cultural profile, occupation, religion, festival, mode of dressing, marriage, genetic classification. Several other aspects will be reviewed in the latter chapters of the project work.  </p> <p><strong>1.1     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF MIGILI   </strong></p> <p>      In an interview with the town chief (ZHE Migili) who is he traditional ruler and an autocrat, two major facts were revealed.  One of them is the fact that the name of the language popularly known as Mijili is incorrect rather it is formally known as Migili.  The second fact duely noted by him is that the Migili people are not part of the Hausa tribe as they have been mistakenly identified by many.</p> <p>The Migili tribe has a long history which dates back to the old Kwararafa Kingdom in Taraba State.  The Kwararafa kingdom comprised of different ethnic groups such as Eggon, Algo, Idoma, and the Gomai. Each tribe took turns in occupying leadership positions of the kingdom and a heir was selected from the royal home of each ethic group.  But things changed when it was time for Akuka, a Migili descendant who was next in line to ascend the throne . Akuka was plotted against hence he could not become the next leader.  This sparked up a lot of negative reactions from the Migili people as well as some other tribes who viewed such an action as unjust, a way through which they were deprived because of their small population.  Together with all members of the tribe, Akuka moved down to a place called Ukari where they settled down for a while and later moved to Agyaragu in Lafia, Nasarawa State where they reside presently.</p> <p>Today, the Migili people are known as settlers in Obi, Agyaragu local government, Lafia, Nasarawa State, Nigeria.  They can still be found  in other places such as Minna, Abuja, Kubadha in Kaduna, Zuba e.t.c.The major population of about 18,000 people constitute about 96% of Obi Agyaragu local government area.</p> <p><strong>1.2     SOCIO – CULTURAL PROFILE</strong></p> <p>The Migili language is rich in both its social and cultural aspects. Some of these aspects are their festival, religion, marriage, occupation e.t.c</p> <p><strong>1.2.1  OCCUPATION</strong></p> <p>The Migili people are predominantly farmers. This occupation ranges from young to old, male and female.  They produce a lot of crops but their major cash product is yam.  Yams are produced for transportation to different parts of the country and they also engage in inter – village sales with their neighbours who do not produce the types of crops that they do.  Migili people also grow crop such as melon, beans, guinea corn, rice and millet. </p> <p><strong>1.2.2  FESTIVAL</strong></p> <p>There are two major festival celebrated by the Migili.  These festivals are very important aspects of their culture as they expose their heritage and ancestral endowments.  First is the farming season in which every farmer within the village premises is involved.  During this farming season, they move from one indigenes farm to another in large groups cultivating, clearing and planting different types of crops for one another.  After this has been done, a date is set to celebrate the harvest of these crops and this leads to the second festival which is the Odu festival.</p> <p>The Odu festival is celebrated village – wide in Miligi.  This is a period of harvesting of crops, celebration of the harvest, exchange of pleasantries and entertainment in the village square.  During the festival, the Odu masquerade which represents their ancestral values is dressed in a colourful attire with which it displays great dancing steps to the amusement and applause of the villagers.</p> <p>Another festival that is celebrated in the village is the demise of an elderly indigene.  This is done with a type of dance called Abeni.</p> <p><strong>1.2.3  RELIGION</strong></p> <p>Before the arrival of the missionary, the Migili people were ardent traditionalists. They worshipped their ancestors some of which are Odu and Aleku.  They had separate seasons at which sacrifices were made and worshipped them with dancing and entertainment.  But things gradually began to change after the missionaries arrived thus most of them were converted to Christians, though a small population remain strictly traditional worshippers while some are Muslims.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4  MARRIAGE</strong></p> <p>Marriage as an entity was approached from the early stages of childhood amongst the Migili people. Before the Missionary arrived, intercultural marriage was forbidden amongst them with serious consequences or punishment allotted the violation of such law.  Marriage between indigenes was formally approached, by the father of the suitor, who informs the mother of the admired girl of his intention.  Once an agreement has been reached, the first payment is made to confirm the betrothal of the female child who continues to live with her parents until the due age has been reached.  The male child (suitor) then pays his first installment of her dowry and engages in farming activities for his in-laws once every year.  But today the order of things have changed and marriage within and outside the tribe is now by choice hence enhancing inter-cultural relationship. </p> <p><strong>1.2.5  MODE OF DRESSING</strong></p> <p>The Migili dressing mode displays their cultural heritage, though their dressing is quite similar to that of the Hausa.  Women wear short vests that expose their belly and long skirts that cover their legs, then they adorn their hands, forehead, lips and ankles with beads and bracelets.  An interesting feature about their dressing is the plaiting of hair by both male and female indigenes. Though a bit of civilization has been introduced into their culture, hence influencing their dressing, a typical Migili indigene would still appear in colourful beads and bracelets. </p> <p><strong>1.3     GENETIC CLASSIFICATION</strong></p> <p>This is the arrangement of languages into their different categories according to their relationship with other members of their category.</p> <p>                                                      <strong>NIGER</strong><strong> KORDOFANIAN</strong></p> <p>  NIGER CONGO                                                                                                             KORDOFANIAN</p> <p>      </p> <p>Mande           Atlantic Congo</p> <p>      </p> <p>Atlantic                  Ijoid           Volta Congo</p> <p>      </p> <p>    Kru                      Kwa             North Volta Congo                 Benue Congo</p> <p>      </p> <p>Akpe       Platoid     Defoid          Edoid      Nupoid     Idomoid   ukumoid     Igboid    Cross river   Bantoid</p> <p>      </p> <p>Tarokoid</p> <p>Beremic      Southern     Adunic     Alumic         Ninzic       West          East             North</p> <p>      </p> <p>Yeskwa         Ayongie           Koro         Hyame               Jiju             Tyap             Irigwe</p> <p> </p> <div> <p>Adapted from Roger Blench (2006)</p> </div><p>    </p> <p>   Koro Zuba             Koro Ija             Jijilic             Koro-Makamei            <strong>KORO MIGILI</strong>                koro Lafiya</p> <p><strong>1.4     SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>As earlier mentioned, the purpose of the research project is to closely and carefully examine the Migili language and hence, expose its morphological aspects.  Investigation would be carried out on the various morphological processes attested by the language. Various steps, theories and methods would be used and considered in the analysis and exemplification of the morphemes and their processes.  Also, an accurate compilation of the alphabet in the language has been carried out in order to justify the compilation of the data and its analysis thereof.     </p> <p><strong>1.5     ORGANISATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This long essay has been divided into five different chapters, each containing certain aspect of the research work.  Below is a highlight of the chapters and their contents;(i) Chapter one deals with general introduction into the background of the study, the historical background and  socio – cultural profile;</p> <p>(ii)     Chapter two deals with literature review on the chosen aspect of the research work;</p> <p>(iii)    Chapter three deals with the presentation and analysis of data on the chosen work;</p> <p>(iv)    Chapter four centers on the processes involved in the branch of study;</p> <p>(v)             Chapter five deals with summary of the work done, observation, conclusion and recommendation of references.</p> <p><strong>1.6          </strong><strong>   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>In the execution of this research, both the informant and introspective methods/approach have been adopted for data collection.

This term refer to the feelings of the members of a society or a social group that they are united and identified with others who speak the same language and that they contrast with or are separated from those who do not.</p> <p>Language from another perspective is a system of signals including voice sounds, gesture or written symbols which encodes and decodes information(wikipedia). Language is an instrument of socialization. This includes among others greetings, political expressions and the likes (Yussuf, 2009).</p> <p><strong>1.1          </strong><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.1 THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADIM</strong></p> <p>There is no consensus among the people of Adim as to where their Ancestors came from. Some people believe that their forefathers came from Otum Usa, while others believe that they had always lived where they find themselves today and that they did not come from anywhere else. Many elderly people accept the tradition that their origin is located around the area known as Otum Usa settlement in Ebom-Ebijiakara, the eastern bank of the Cross River in the present Abi Local Government Area and that their ancestors dispersed from the region and first settled in Orum-Ugom along old Abredang Road.</p> <p><strong>1.1.2 MIGRATION AND PATTERN OF SETTLEMENT</strong></p> <p>The community which came to be known as Adim in Biase Local Government Area consists of five desperate groups. Those claiming that their origin is from Isobo Area, those claiming origin from Old Otum Usa settlement and those who believe that the people of Adim migrated from the Calabar Estuary (Eyong, 2005).</p> <p><strong>1.1.2.1       ISOBO AREA ORIGIN</strong></p> <p>The tradition from Agwagwune avers that some Adim people were originally Igbos in the present Abi Local Government Area who came from Isobo area. This source further claim that the ancestors of these people were driven out of their original home by a more powerful group and this development sent this inhabitant on a process of migration. In this process, the Adim people came in contact with the Agwagwune during the headship of Onun Eo Oti. Arising from generosity of this leader, the Adim people were given a place of land to settle on.</p> <p>The source further disclosed that on settling in this present location, the Agwagwune people gave them a name ‘Adimi mo Abba’, which literarily translates as ‘people pressed to the ground’. This name was given to them because of their defeat in a battle in their former settlement at Isobo.</p> <p>However, this tradition is still far from being true.</p> <p><strong>1.1.2.2                 OTUM-USA ORIGIN</strong></p> <p>My informant, Chief Eni Eko claimed that Adim migrated from a place called Otum-Usa meaning old settlements. Otum-Usa in Adim dialect is referred to as Orum Inuk. It was situated between Usumulong and former settlement of Ebom Ebijiakara both in Bahumono clan in the present Abi Local Government Area.</p> <p>The informant asserted that a Bahumono man killed one Adim woman and the people of Adim wanted to retaliate. This development brought about a strained relationship between the Adim people and the Bahumono people. This situation forced the people of Adim to flee from Otum-Usa and moved in southwards direction and eventually arrived at the present site and established a small settlement. These settlements were Inuk-Ogama-Igeme, Inamoka, Arumigom, Onile-ejak, Ogwa, Orum-iton and Ogwe.</p> <p>Some other people believed that the eruption of a fight following the murder of an Adim woman was not the reason for their migration from Bahumono area, rather, they attributed the cause of their fight to the struggle to acquire more lands and more fishing ponds. Yet others claimed that apart from this petty quarrelling and fighting, other likely cause of their movement was on grounds of famine and epidemic. Since the people were always fighting, less emphasis was placed on agriculture, leading to famine which was consistently epidemic.</p> <p>Another major proponent of this view is Dr. Ajah Ekpeni Obia who asserted that the name Adim was a corrupt form, colonial coinage of Arum, original tongue and shortened form of ‘Arumerume’. He claimed that the people called Arumerume comprise of five distinct groups of families or clans sharing a common history of tribe, migration and unification. These ancestral families were Arum. Different from the whole community which came to bear the same name(Eyong, 2005).</p> <p>Evidence also pointed to the fact that in the cause of migration of the semi-bantu (Ekoi) people up the Cross River Estuary, these families of Arumerume first settled in a place called Otum-Usa in the present Abi Local Government Area. Otum Usa was located on a highland situated to the eastern bank of Cross River and sandwiched between Usumutong and former Ebom-Ejiakark homeland. He argued further that the desire to search for fertile plains that could support agriculture propelled the people to migrate down hill and southeast towards the present settlement of Adim.</p> <p>According to Dr. Obia, the family of Arum led by Onun Echu Otala Ogbuenyi duba first settled in a place called Orum-Ugom. This group or family had its own unique cultural and leadership structures. Originally, there were about eleven households or villages that form Arum clan. Amongst the renowned societies and deities of this ancient clan were Abu-Ukpan, Oduba and Iyase. This was the largest and strongest economically and militarily. That was why its name gradually became the common identity for the emergent union.</p> <p>He opined that other four groups or families migrated later, after being assured of the habitable land by the pioneer group. The Emomolo group led by Onun Owor Ewelu settled at Onoli-Ejak and so on.</p> <p>Another tradition explains that the people of Adim are the Ekoi tribe which migrate from Cameroun during the great Exodus of 15th century AD. They had come along with Umon Island on the Cross River. The source further disclosed that as a result of the incessant invasion by the neighbouring villages like Agwagwune, Ablep, Ugep and Abini, the people of Adim resolved to unite in order to face their enemies and to guard against total extermination. One of such invasion was the combined attack of Ugep people from the north and Agwagwune.</p> <p><strong>FIGURE 1.0</strong></p> <p><strong><em>(The history and development of Adim”,</em></strong><strong> Raphael o. Eyong , 2005)</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.2.3                 CALABAR ESTUARY ORIGIN</strong></p> <p>An informant asserts that Adim people first settled in Abakpa or qua area of Calabar. That war and the search for food and new homes caused them to migrate with Umon people by canoe, up the cross river. First, they settled with Umon people at Umon Island on the Cross River. They left the Island for two main reasons:</p> <p>a)       The Island could no longer accommodate the growing population and</p> <p>b)      The war between Umon and the Efiks over trade monopoly in the upper region of the cross river.</p> <p>This assertion was confirmed by MR. DONALD M. McFarland in his book, Calabar, The Church of Scotland Mission 1846-1946, London, p,45.</p> <p>In 1846, the Mission Company had watched King Eyamba set out on an expedition to carry war into the Umon country. An albino was sacrificed to the river god to ensure success. This expedition really scattered many units of people who formerly occupied the island. My informant, Mr. Ben Ikwa argued in favour of his tradition. According to him, when the people of Adim came up to cross river, they settled with the people of Ikun and Etono in Ubaghara clan, west of the cross river. They later crossed the river to the eastern side and came to the present site of Orum-Ugom (<strong>Agwagwune</strong>). They saw that there were no inhabitants in Orum-Ugom, but the area was very marshy in the interior. They found the Orum-Iton, an area full of raffia palms in the course of time. That is the present location of Adim which was called ‘Akana’, meaning no dispute. This is to say that there was no unit opposed the idea of the formation of the united force against their enemies. Later the name was changed to Arum Igiliga. The name was likened to a life stick called Egiliga singular to Igiliga. Egiliga’s symbolism is likened to it’s thorny back which makes it difficult to carry or easily handled.</p> <p>It is on record that the site chosen had some basic characteristics which attracted the people; as it was a hill which made it militarily strategic and had water within a radius of one kilometre. The union was indeed a federation with each federating unit or clan retaining as much of her unique cultural trait and institutions as possible.</p> <p><strong>1.3    SOCIO-CULTURAL PROFILE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3.1           MARRIAGE INSTITUTION</strong></p> <p>In Adim, the concept of marriage is well institutionalized as a social affair. In those days, parents made choices of whom their sons or daughters should marry. They may have contracted this since childhood of the would-be partners. The first approach is for the parents of the boy to present some token coconut, a bunch of indigo and a piece of cloth not more than one yard to the parent of the girl. The girl will then be betrothed to the boy. The presentation will be done during the new yam festival. They may or not have reached school age when the contact was made on their behalf. Both boy and girl grow up with this but if the proposed partners had a violent objection to the union, it will be possible to break off the agreement.</p> <p>Another tradition discloses that when a boy saw himself fit to enter into marriage contract, he had to tell his father who would guide him into choice making. If the girl he intended to seek her hand in marriage was approved by the father and mother, then the father had to go with him to his would-be father in-law with a keg of fresh palm wine for the traditional asking ceremony. If this wine was accepted, he will be expected to start sleeping in his in-law’s house but not allowed to sleep on the same bed with the girl.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2           AGE GRADE SYSTEM IN ADIM</strong></p> <p>The institution of age grade (Egop) played a very important role. It consists of persons born with approximately three years of one another. It is said to be a social group based on grade. Age grade is the advancement of boys and girls to adult status by ritual equivalent to confirmation where those initiated at the same time constitute a definite company. Hence, every man or woman belongs to an age grade. Basically, there used to be four male age grades named after the four days in one native week of Ekes, Ibums, Igbegbets and Ikpos in Adim. As members, (new initiates) of a junior age grade rose in rank, they passed through many stages like Egop Ewala, Egop Otu until they are finally initiated into an age grade proper.</p> <p>The importance of age grade cannot be overemphasized. The social aspects of the village life depended entirely on the age grade. For instance, they were responsible for discharging such social services as clearing of bush paths, collecting community levies, guarding the community at both day and night against external attacks, some aspects of administrative duties and other related social services.</p> <p><strong>1.3.3           THE ECONOMY</strong></p> <p>The standard living of any community is a reflection of their economy based on the management of the variety of their resources. Although, most men and women were engaged in farming, there was a marked division in the type of work they performed. Men did most of the cleanings. They cleared the bush and other sundry activities that go with farm cultivation.</p> <p>Apart from farming, the people practised other economic activities like hunting, fishing, trapping of animals; small scale animal husbandry and livestock keeping of goats, pigs, etc. Fowls were also raised to supply eggs and chicken.</p> <p>The local crafts practised in Adim were carving, smithing and weaving. Carving and smithing were mainly the occupation of men while women specialized in weaving industry.</p> <p><strong>1.3.4           BELIEVE PATTERN</strong></p> <p>The people of Adim believe in the existence of a supreme being called Obasi-golok Ekpeyong. The believe in the continuity of life and a community of interest between the living and the dead and the generation yet unborn was fundamental to the religious life of people of Adim</p> <p>The belief of the people in life after death was portrayed in the system of burying the traditional head (Onum) and titled men in the society. On the death of Onum or any titled man in the society, some of the properties (including his matchet, snuff box, sleeping mat, etc.) will be buried along with him. Human heads, particularly those of slaves or strangers were buried alongside with the dead man. The significance of this practice lies in the belief that the dead would make use of these items buried along with him in the world to come. The people also believe in the existence of many gods of inferior dignity compared to the supreme deity. Some lineages or compounds possess their own gods in the form of a stone or tree. In these compounds especially Onun-eko, Onunegor, Igbase, Ete-Inyangbe, Ekpet and Etigale usually make sacrifices of goat, fowl and yam to these lesser deities from time to time.</p> <p>In the process of sacrificial offerings, prayers for good tidings such as bountiful harvest, long life and increased population were made. The smaller gods were regarded as subjects of the chief deity and were seen as mediators between the chief deity and mankind. The people believe that they could communicate with the Supreme Being by offering sacrifices to the smaller gods who were clearly visible to them. The spirits of the ancestors were usually invoked by the pouring of liberation. In the process, prayers and thanks are offered to the ancestors calling on them to convert their message and demands to the Almighty God (the Supreme Being).</p> <p><strong>FIGURE 1.1</strong></p> <p><strong>(<em>The history and development of Adim</em>, Raphael o. Eyong)</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3.5 TYPES OF CURRENCIES USED IN ADIM UP TO EARLY 20TH CENTURY.</strong></p> <p>The use of copper rod as a medium of exchange was less cumbersome and more convenient than the barter system.</p> <p>Another type of currency that was widely used not only in Adim but Biase area in the Nineteenth century was Manilla currency. In Adim, the manilla was called ’Okpogo’. It was believed that the Ibibio traders, possibly from Itu, introduced the Manilla currency in Biase area. Manilla was whitesh in colour and the standard size of a Manilla was about 15cm. Eighty Manillas was equivalent to one pound.</p> <p>Other Manillas in circulation included the snake Manilla weighing (5 ½) and the king Manilla weighed (6lbs). Four Manilas were equivalent to one Shilling. In the colonial years of the 20th century, the colonial masters began to regard these different currencies as anachronistic, inefficient and cumbersome in nature. Consequent upon this, in 1897, Sir Ralph Moor, who was in charge of the protectorate of southern Nigeria between 1896 and 1903, saw the problem associated with these currencies in counting and carrying such currencies about. About 30 Shillings worth of Manilas is a load for one person. For these reasons, he strongly believed that the continuous use of these currencies would retard the expansion of trade in southern Nigeria and Biase area. He therefore perceived the necessity for handy and easily managed currency and was determined to change the existing currencies as quickly as possible (Eyong, 2005).</p> <p>After several attempts and opposition, Moor finally introduced a coinage type of currency and so on 1st December 1902, the native currency (Copper and Brass rods) was abolished from circulation. The popularization of a coin currency took a native step forward. With the instruction of Penny and a tenth of Penny pieces in 1908.</p> <p>Some of these currencies were one white Shilling with a person’s head inscribe on the coin and the white penny with a hole in the middle. After some time, a brown Shilling was introduced. On the one side of the brown shilling was inscribed the effigy of George VI of England, wearing a crown on his head. On the other side were inscribed a palm tree, the figure 1947 and the words, ‘British West Africa’, Twelve penny made a shilling. These currencies were used until the Pounds, Shillings and Pence (£: s: d) came into circulation in Biase in about 1950.</p> <p><strong>FIGURE 1.2</strong></p> <p><strong>(<em>The history and development of Adim</em>, Raphael o.

Adim lies in the Northern part of the forest belt of Southern Nigeria. Adim shares boundary with Ugep in the North and Idomi in the east, both in Yakkur Local Government Area.</p> <p>       Adim is the official name of the language and the native speakers also call themselves Adim. Another name for Adim language is Orun or Arun. Adim speakers are widely spread across the other areas with Cross-river State of Nigeria such as Calabar, Ekoni, Yakhur and Idomi. In this chapter will be focusing on the historical background,socio-cultural profile, scope and organization of the study, theoretical framework and the genetic classification of Adim language.</p> <p><strong>1.1               </strong><strong>Historical Background </strong></p> <p>According to oral tradition as related by my informants, the Adim people migrated from a village called Edem Omere Akapa as a result of war and threat from the neighboring  village. The first place the Adim people settled after migrating from Edem Omere Akapa was Idomi, an area confronted with hills, some left while others stayed back. The second place they settled after Idomi was Ugep, some spread to Adim while some were found in Ekoni. All of these places are in the present Cross-river State.</p> <p>       The Adim people were together until the advent of the British Colonial masters who came to introduce them to western education that then opened the gate for civilization. The Adim people share many things in common with some other tribes around them, such as the Yakkur, Abi, Idómi, and Ekoni.  </p> <p><strong>1.2               </strong><strong>Socio-cultural profile</strong></p> <p>        According to Yule (1975:239), “Sociolinguistics is the interrelationship between language and society”. It studies how society influences the use of language.In his own definition, Olaoye (2002:98) states that, “Sociolinguistics deals with the study various social, political, cultural, and linguistic situationwithin a given speech community that gives how language choice and use reveal the values, cultural beliefs and practices of the community”. This shows that cultural beliefs, ways of life etc. cannot be separated from language. In other words, language and culture are inseparable.</p> <p>Most Adim people including the younger generation are bilingual, using Adim locally and Efik regionally. Efik is the medium of instruction in schools, especially Primary schools, while English is learnt as a second language. The older like the younger generations are fluent in Efik. Through western education, the younger generation holds position in the administrative and public service, which in turn make them tri-lingual, using Adim, Efik and English languages. While we may refer to the younger generation as being tri-lingual we will refer to the older generation as being bilingual, we can hardly find someone who is monolingual among Adim speakers; they all communicate in at least two languages. Adim is basically used as a means of communication.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1    </strong><strong>Dressing</strong></p> <p>       The Adim people have different outfits for different special occasion. They have traditional attires that are very rich, but with the advent of modernization, they also put on modern clothes.</p> <p>       In the primitive age, men used animal skin to cover their private parts, while women used leaves and animal skin to cover their private parts. They used leaves to cover their private parts in front. Uniquely, they always make signs on the animal skin in order to attract young men.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2    </strong><strong>Religion</strong></p> <p>       Initially the Adim native speakers were idol worshippers before the arrival of white missionaries, who introduced Christianity to the Adim people. One of the gods they worshipped is called Obolose which means “god of the land”. The first church in Adim was built in the early 70’s as a PresbyterianChurch after which other churches such as Catholics, Assembly of God were built. In the mid 80’s Islamic religion was introduced. Presently(90%) of them are Christians while the remaining (10%) are either Muslim or Idol worshippers.</p> <p><strong>1.2.3    </strong><strong>Occupation</strong></p> <p>        The occupation of the Adim people includes farming, hunting, gold-smiting e.g palm oil production, garri making, and production of groundnut. However, their major occupation is farming.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4    </strong><strong>Festival</strong></p> <p>        Since majority of the speakers are Christians and Muslims, their festivals also go in line with the various religions they belong.Traditional festivals are gradually fading out while some had gone into extinction. There are two major types of festivals celebrated by the Adim people namely; Iwon-erok “Yam festival” and they also celebrate masquerade festival.Ètàngata and loboare the names of the few masquerades they have in Adim village.</p> <p><strong>1.2.5    </strong><strong>Marriage</strong></p> <p>In Adim tradition, a keg of palm wine is the only item taken along when going to ask for a girl’s hand in marriage. After the decision has been made, the groom goes to pay bride price and takes along some other things such as kola nut, palm oil, yam and garri which will be given to the bride’s parent.</p> <p>        Before the wedding ceremony takes place, the bride would be kept in the fattening room where she will be fed with all kinds food to make her look more beautiful and attractive to her husband on the wedding day and also to make her ready for the challenges in her matrimonial home.</p> <p>        Polygamy is allowed in Adim village, but their major practice is monogamy.</p> <p><strong>1.2.6    </strong><strong>Administration</strong></p> <p>        Traditionally, the leader is “Obolopon”. He has absolute authority over the people and he is unquestionable. He controls the administrative aspect of the community and settles disputes. The council of eldersis called kèpol. “Ókpéibìlì” is the name of the high priest in Adim village. The secret societies that guide against external attack in Adim village are Abu secret society, Okuwa secret society and Egup secret society.</p> <p><strong>1.3   </strong><strong>Scope and Organization of the study</strong></p> <p> This long essay aims at studying aspects of Adim phonology. The sound inventory of the language, the phonological process and tonal patterns attested in language. This research work is divided into five(5) chapters.</p> <p>Chapter one provides general information on the language and its speakers. Also, the chapter contains the socio-cultural profile of the people and the genetic classification of the language under study. A brief discussion of the theoretical frame work used in the work as well the methodology adopted for data collection and analysis is included in this chapter.</p> <p>      Chapter two discusses the sound system of the language as well as the tonal and syllable structures. In chapter three, our attention and focus was on the tonal processes attested in the Adim language with their distributional patterns. In chapter four we discussed the phonological processes.</p> <p>      Chapter five summarizes and concludes the work: We also give some recommendation and observation. </p> <p><strong>1.4   </strong><strong>    Theoretical framework</strong></p> <p>The theoretical frame work used for this research is Generative Phonology as propounded and explicated in Chomsky and Halle (1968).</p> <p>      According to Chomsky and Halle (1968:5), “Generative phonology views speech as sequences of discrete segments which are complexes of a particular set of phonetic features and the simultaneous and sequential combination of these features and constraints”.</p> <p>      Generative phonology is apart of the linguistics theory which is called “Transformational Generative Grammar(TG)” formulated by Chomsky (1957) to address the inadequacies observed in classical (Taxonomic)theory of phonological description (Fisher Jorgenson (1976:174). Generative phonology gives the rule of generative phonology to express the relationship between sound and meaning. It is pertinent to point out that generative phonology accounts for some language phenomena like linguistic intuition, foreign accent, speech error and others.</p> <p>      Hyman (1975:19) describes generative phonology as the description of how phonological rules can be converted into phonological representation and to capture the distinctive sound in contrast in a language.</p> <p>      Lyons(1979:18) opines that, the rules and structures generated through generative phonology are “recursive”. Therefore, one can conclude that generative phonology explains the grammar that is structured by means of a finite number of recursive rules operating up on a finite vocabulary.</p> <p>      Recursiveness, according to Saheed (2003:10), “is a situation whereby we have a repetitive embedding and coordination syntactic structure in languages”.</p> <p>      According to Chomsky(1965:7-9) recursiveness is one of the very major achievements of generative grammar in which limited set of rules are used by the native speaker to create infinite number of sentences from a finite sentence through the rule called transformational rule. </p> <p><strong>1.5   </strong><strong>    Generative Phonology</strong></p> <p>Hyman (1915:80) says a phonological structure isan abstract phonemic representation which postulates the rules that are derived from various surface forms. It postulates the underlying forms at the systematic phonemic level from which such have systematic relationship termed “Linguistically Significant Generalization”. The structure is of three basic levels, these are, Underlying representation (PR).</p> <p><strong>1.5.1    </strong><strong>Underlying Representation</strong></p> <p>According to Oyebade (1998:13) “underlying representation is the non-predictable, non-rule derived part of words”. It is a form with abstract representation existing in the linguistic competence of all utterances and it exists in the mental dictionary. At this level, items with variant meanings have identical representation. For instance, the different forms of negation prefix in English likeŋ-(ŋkɔrɛkt), im-(impossible), in-(intolerable), il-(illegal), ir-(irregular) have the same meaning, Oyebade (1998).</p> <p><strong>1.5.2    </strong><strong>Phonetic Representation</strong></p> <p>Kantoszwich (1994:8) states that the phonetic level indicates “how the lexical items are to be realized in speech”. It is at the level after phonological rules have been applied to the underlying representation.</p> <p>      According to Hyman (1975:19), “phonetic representation represents possible pronunciation of forms in the realization of speech and the surface level”. Generative phonology considers phonetics representation as a level that is some what trivial and not worth too much attention, except, perhaps, justification of the proposed underlying representation (Oyebade 1998:21).</p> <p><strong>1.5.3    </strong><strong>Phonological Rules</strong></p> <p>These are directives which map underling forms unto the surface forms. They show the derivational sequence or path of an item in its journey from the underlying level to the phonetic level (Oyebade1998:15).</p> <p>      As Hyman (1975:26) points out, they are derivational sequences of phonetic level. Phonological rules are predictablerules; examples of phonological rules are the rules that assimilate a nasal segment to the place of articulation of the following segments e.g</p> <p>n → m  ─ b :[+ nas ] →    + ant                  +ant</p> <p>­ cor ­ con</p> <p>n → n t :[+ nas ]  →  + ant             +ant </p> <p>­cor                              ­cor     </p> <p>                  n→ n         g : [ + nas ] →  + ant +ant</p> <p> ­ cor                    ­cor</p> <p>            These rules can be captured by one rule:-</p> <p> [± nas ] →    α ant α ant</p> <p>β cor           β cor</p> <p><strong>1.6   </strong><strong>       Distinctive   Features</strong></p> <p>Distinctive features are “sets of [articulatory and acoustic] features  sufficient to define and distinguish one from the other, the great majority of speech sounds used in the languages of the world ”(Halle and Clement 1983:6). The theory of phonological features is concerned with the discovery of generalization about the phonological behavior of phonological segment, both in isolation, in sequence or as a member of a system. There are two major criteria that potential features must meet to be admitted as distinctive features, they are:</p> <p>(i)    Phonetic Specific ability</p> <p>(ii) Morphophonemic relevance (Oyebade, 1998:25)</p> <p>The features are used in describing all linguistic phenomena occurring in languages. Some of the features are: labial, anterior, nasal and syllabic.</p> <p><strong>1.7   </strong><strong>       Data  Collection</strong></p> <p>The data for this research work was collected through the help of language helper (informant method). The 400 wordlist of basic items was used for this exercise. We also used the frame technique. This is a template that shows different structural position which a word can occur. This goes beyond looking at words in isolation. It was used to get relevant information that cannot be gotten by means of lexical items only. Thus, it helped in making illuminating significant generalization. The information concerning the informant in this research is given below:</p> <p>NAME:Mr. Edet Usánì Éyòng</p> <p>ADDRESS: Sam Ethan Air force Base, Ikeja, Lagos.</p> <p>RELIGON: Christianity</p> <p>OCCUPATION:Air force</p> <p>LANGUAGE SPOKEN: Adim </p> <p>MARITAL STATUS: Married</p> <p>AGE: 51 Years</p> <p>YEARS LIVED IN ADIM TOWN: 20/21 Years</p> <p><strong>1.8       Data   Analysis</strong></p> <p>With the view of capturing linguistically significant generation in the language, the analysis of the corpus will be carried out by transcribing the entire linguistic corpus collected accurately in order to discover the sounds that are attested in the language in addition to some other supra-segmental features in the language. This data will be organized to bring out all inventories of the distinctive phonemes and their features.</p> <p>The classification of this data can be done through parts of speech, nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, prepositions, pronouns, determiners and conjunctions found in Adim language.</p> <p> The distribution of the data is also determined alongside the syllable structure,tonal processes and also the phonological processes.</p> <p><strong>1.9</strong><strong>   Genetic  Classification</strong></p> <p>. These similarities are either phonetically, phonologically, semantically or syntactically. The genetic classification of languages makes two things obvious; that language are indeed related to each other i.e they share the same ancestor and how these languages are interrelated are shown in the form of a branching diagram.</p> <p>          Adim language is a Cross-river language which is a Benue-Congo language family under Niger-Congo language family.Genetic classification is the grouping of languages into families based on shared similarities in their features.</p> <p>             NIGER -KORDOFANIAN</p> <p>                Niger- Congo      Kordofanian</p> <p>Mande     Gur    Kwa   Adamawa   Benue CongoWest Atlantic                                      </p> <p> BantuPlateau Benue CongoCross- River  Jokonous Benue Congo    </p> <p>    Cross River    Delta CrossUpper CrossLower Cross</p> <p>            έkónì          Yakkur         Idómì           Adim</p> <p>Source:    Greenberg (1970:306) and Kenneth Katzner (1995: 7)</p> <p>Fig 1.0</p>\n\nASPECTS OF ADIM PHONOLOGY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASPECTS OF ADIM PHONOLOGY", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ASPECTS OF BURA NOUN PHRASE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0    GENERAL BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY  </strong></p> <p>        This research work is based on the aspects of noun Bura noun phrase. The study forms an important aspect of the syntax of the language. By syntax, we mean the branch of linguistic analysis which involves the arrangement of words to form grammatical sentences a rule governed way. It should be noted that there are many aspects of syntax, but this research will focus on the noun phrase of Bura language.</p> <p>       A phrase could be described as group of words that forms an integral part  a sentence. There are different types of phrasal categories, for example Noun, Verb, Prepositional, Adverbial, Adjectival phrases etc.  Each phrasal category is named after the lexical category that   heads the phrase.  For  instance,  a verb heads a verb phrase, a preposition heads a prepositional phrase. </p> <p>       In this chapter, we will carry out a survey of the historical background of the language, socio­linguistic profile under which we shall describe the occupation, marriage, religion, festivals, culture and beliefs, language status and the genetic classification of the language. Government and Binding theory is used as a theoretical   frame work the analysis of the study. </p> <p><strong>1.1         HISTORICAL BACKGROUND </strong></p> <p>        The pabir and bura are ethnically different, but both speak the bura language. They are the major tribes Biu and Askira L.G.A'S of Borno state and Gombi L.G.A of Adamawa state. The population of bura people in Borno state is about 230,000 and there are about 46,000 speakers of the language in Adamawa state.(.N.P.C 2005). </p> <p>        The Bura's lived north of Biu before being attacked by yata-ra-wara around the 16th century. The few people yamta brought with him intermarried with the Bura's and built the Biu dynasty into a kingdom. Those descendants of yamta's group were called Pabir or (babur),this is why the Pabir and Bura's differ considerably in culture appearance until today, The Pabir are the ruling class among e Bura people and the Bura villages pay tribute to the Emir of Biu, the Bura's still resent the Pabirs.</p> <p><strong> 1.2 SOCIOCULTURAL PROFILE</strong></p> <p>        The following could be observed among the Bura's. The language bura is seen means of communication in the market and is also used in teaching in primary schools. The Bura's found in Biu and Askira L.G.A'S in Borno state and Gombi L.G.A in Adamawa state. Their main language is Bura but they also speak Hausa, Chibok, Fulfude and a few speak Marghi.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1CULTURAL HIGHLIGHTS   </strong></p> <p>        The Bura people did not circumcised their boys until the practice was introduced around the 1920's. Boys are circumcised around the age of 7. When a female child is born, a suitor may propose by throwing a leafy branch of a certain tree in her mother's kut. If he is accepted, he gives gifts as the girl grows up. He works on her father's farm and makes zana matting for them. When she reaches marriage age he captures her and bring her to his house, then the remaining part of the bride price is settled and arrangements for the marriage ceremony are concluded.</p> <p>         The bride is usually expected to produce a white cloth stained with the proof of her virginity and it may be displayed with pride, her parents will be ashamed if she is not a virgin.</p> <p>           Another form of courtship/marriage is for a boy to look over the girls while they are collecting firewood or fetching water, when he sees the one he likes he asks her to marry him and if she agrees, he gets about 8 or 10 strong fellows to capture her and bring her to his house then the marriage ceremony is arranged. As a sign of respect, a man does not eat with his parents-in-laws, when an old person dies he/she is buried on the second day, when everyone has gathered in the evening. The grave is wide circular shaft at the top, about knee deep then a smaller round shaft is dug from the bottom of this into a loor of cavity. There is a traditional dancing for seven days after the burial, and if the deceased was an important person it last 14days, during which rituals are performed. There is dancing with beating of drum and things belonging to the deceased that show who he was are displayed, such as his/her tools and weapons. This is done till date, sometimes professional mourners are invited on one of the mourning days, the Fuinchambwi dance is done. The male dancers jump from the roof of the hut of the deceased back again until the roof destroyed. After this the date is fixed for the last mourning or sadaka, which is held about 6 months later but usually during dry season.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2      CHIEFTANCY </strong></p> <p>          Originally the Bura's had no central government, now the Emir of Biu appoints the district heads (Ajia) who then approve he appointments of the village heads (Lawans). Today both titles belong to certain families. The village heads appoints the ward heads (Bulamas) over small villages and wards of larger ones. Anyone who has leadership ability ca chosen as a Bulama. </p> <p><strong>1.2.3      RELIGION</strong></p> <p>             The Bura had their traditional religion before Islam came around 1920 and Christianity later in the 1920's.Today these three religions can found among the Bura's.</p> <p>         In traditional religion the Supreme Being is called Hyel or Hyel-taku, they approach Hyel through Haptu. Hyel they claim created everything, but a Haptu is a personal god who takes care of the individual. The Haptu have shrines where people worship and offer sacrifices. The gods are represented by various objects such as water (a lake or river), stones, mountains or forest. Usually there is an attendant or priiest through whom consultations is made of the Haptu. Most sacrifices are on saturdays so it is a special day. some gods are for particular clans, and there is no unified form of traditional religion for the whole tribe. One of the Haptu(gods) is Dlaminpr Kampeka,a large being living in space. His chief priest is called Mthakur Haptu, there is a Mthakur Haptu in each village.</p> <p>         The most common of the gods is represented by a covered pot kept by a family head. At the beginning end of the dry season in times of stress, he offers a chicken to the pot for the health of his household. The practice of traditional religion has now largely disintegrated before Islam and Christianity. However witchcraft is still done. The belief that ancestors becomes when they die and still influence what happens in the world has not really died out.</p> <p>         The total number of Bura Christians is under 60, 000, the percentage of Christians is actually less than 20%, though more may be nominal adherents. A rough estimate of the religious percentage is as follows: Muslims-78%, Christians-20%, Traditionalists-2%. </p> <p>         There is a certain amount of understanding between the Muslims and Christians which prevents too much religious tension in the tribe, but this does mean Muslims do not persecute relatives converted to Christianity.  </p> <p><strong>1.2.4         OCCUPATION</strong></p> <p>            The people of Bura are mainly agriculturalists as they engage themselves in planting of crops like maize, guinea corn, groundnut and rice. Among them there are also weavers, fishermen, hunters, woodcarvers etc.</p> <p><strong>Fig. 1.2.4 Fishing Occupation of Bura People<br/> 1.2.5            FESTIVAL  </strong></p> <p>       Since the Bura people are mainly engaged in farming all their festivals are farming related, as they organize harvest festivals before fresh harvests are eaten. </p> <p>         An example is the maize harvest festival performed before fresh corn can be eaten, it is believed that it is sacriligious to eat an harvest before the harvest festival, hence all farmers adhere to this law.            </p> <p><strong>Fig. 1.2.5 Maize Harvest Festival of Bura People</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2.6  CULTURE</strong></p> <p>      The bura people have a rich culture, preserved and handed down from generation to generation. They are simple country people, they believe in justice, modesty, equity and fairness. They are accommodating and live in peace with their neighbours. Talking about their mode of greeting they greet more or less like Hausa's they bend down or kneel down to greet each other. </p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>                                 <strong>GENETIC CLASSIFICATION</strong></p> <p>                                                   Africa                                     <strong>fig. 1.3</strong></p> <p>                                                  Afro-Asiatic</p> <p>Egyptian     Semitic    Cushitic      Omitic            Berber                Chadic</p> <p>West  Chadic  Biu Mandara        East Chadic                               Masa      </p> <p>Tera group    Kotoko group    Bura group            Tligi group       Mandara group Matakaru group  Bata group  Suko group         </p> <p>      </p> <p>Chibak     Kiba      Bura (pabir)     Kiba             Mangi              Putai                    </p> <p><em>  Source: Comrie, B.

This work aims at giving a detail syntactic analysis of the Noun of Bura language.</p> <p>         This  work  attempts to discuss the arrangement or combination of words to form phrases, clauses and sentences in Bura. This description will also focus and some of the peculiar features of the language. </p> <p>     This  research work consist of five chapters. Chapter one deals with the introductory aspect of the work,  that is the sociolinguistic profiles of the dialect, its historical background, socio-cultural profile, genetic classification, scope and organization of the study, theoretical framework. The second chapter centers on the basic syntactic concepts, where we intend to analyze the phrase structure rules as well as the lexical categories and sentence types based on Government and Binding theory.</p> <p>      The third chapter will examine the noun phrase of  Bura, areas as noun phrase position, noun phrase function, complementizers and the noun phrase construction. </p> <p>      The chapter four centers on all the levels of linguistics analysis in the language, that is the transformation processes. Chapter five will present the summary as well as the conclusion on the entire work.</p> <p><strong>1.5              THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  </strong></p> <p>       Theoretical framework adopted in this work Government and Binding theory(G.B theory). This Government and Binding theory was proposed by an American linguist named Noam Chomsky in (1981),as a reaction to transformational generative grammar to account for all and only the representations that underline the grammatical sentence in a language.</p> <p>        Government and Binding theory is modular deductive theory of grammar. Proponents of G.B often maintained that there is no such thing as roles of language. But only the principles and parameters whose values can only vary from one language to the other do exist with specified units. </p> <p>       Chomsky (1995:15-16) remarks as follows, 'The principles and parameters approach held that language have no rule in anything like familiar sense transformation and no theoretically significant grammatical construction, except taxonomic artifacts'. There are universal participles and finite array of options as to how such principles apply (parameter) but no language particular roles. </p> <p>        It is also worthy to note that though Government and Binding theory is a common label of this model of syntax, it is misleading because it gives undue prominence to the two elements of Government and Binding, whose status was not fundamentally superior to the other sub-theories like x-bar, theta, case e.t.c. Hence, the 'principles and parameters theory has come to be seen as a closer to it essence.</p> <p><strong> 1.5       DATA COLLECTION</strong></p> <p>        The method employed for data collection is the bilingual elicitation approach, involving English and Bura language. The data were elicited with the use of the Ibadan four hundred wordlist, which consist of basic list simple words. </p> <p>        Apart from the 400 wordlist, phrases and sentences in English were translated to Bura, by a Bura native speaker. The data collected were subjected to analysis. </p> <p>        Oral interviews were conducted in English language and answers were given in Bura language by my informant. The answers to this questions were used in the syntactic analysis of Bura language. </p> <p>Below are the full details of my informant </p> <p>            Name: Abdulahi Ahmed </p> <p>            Age: 42 years old.</p> <p>        My informant is a native speaker of Bura language.He is from Gombi local government area in Adamawa state. My informant speaks the following language: English, Hausa and Bura. </p> <p>            But due to the busy schedule of my informant at the time in which this research work is been carried out  was unable to provide all required informations needed to complete this work, hence additional information was seeked by the researcher online leading to the discovery of a Bura dictionary prepared following a workshop in Jos, 24-25 April, 2009 and represents a major shift in terms of orthography and definitions etc. as prepared by Roger blench of www.rogerblench.info/RBOP.htm E-mail trogerblench@yahoo.co.uk </p> <p><strong>1.7             DATA ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p>      In this research work,the data was collected form my informant both in writing and recording an audio cassette then the analysis of the data collected was carried out using Government and Binding theory of syntax as proposed by Chomsky (1986). This research work will be  </p> <p>limited to the aspect of noun phrase.The informant used was fluent in the language, his fluency and competence formed the basis of his choice as my informant.</p> <p><strong>1.8          BRIEF REVIEW OF CHOSEN FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>        Government and Binding theory refers to theory of syntax propounded by Chomsky (1981,1982,1986). This theory is a radical revision of his earlier (1965,1987) theories was revised in a minimalist programme for linguistic theory (1993).</p> <p>       The name refers to central sub theories of the theory.                 Government can be referred to as an abstract syntactic relation and Binding deal with the referents or pronoun R-expression.</p> <p>         G.B was the first to be base on the principle and parameters mode of language, which also underlines the later development of the minimalist programme. Government and Binding is a theory of universal grammar, which is one system of all the principle that are common to all human languages (Haegeman 1991:13) It is otherwise known as principle and parameter the in the sense that .GB, the grammar is a continuos interaction between components and sub theories embedding different principles and parameters (cook 1988:31). It has two levels of representation related by transformation rule move alpha. </p> <p>         Move  alpha is stipulated by movement, that is the syntactic level is elaborated by the concept of movement (cook 1988:30). G.B requires two levels of syntactic representation. The deep structure (D-structure) which is the level at which we obtain all information on the words and their combination, it consists of base rules, lexical rules, strict sub-categorization, selectional restrictions, phrase structure rules (yusuf 1997:68). </p> <p>It is the level at which elements in the sentence are in their original location (cook 1988:30).</p> <p>         We also have the surface structure level ( S-structure) which is the level at which some components in the sentence have been moved. The s-structure is clearly generated from the D-structure by the application of movement rules. There is relationship between deep structure and the surface structure, they are related by movement.</p> <p><strong>1.9        THE SUB-THEORIES OF G.B </strong></p> <p>       Chomsky postulates a set of interacting sub-theories each of which deals with some control area of grammatical enquiry. Each of these may be subject to parametric variation. That is to say, it is assumed that the grammar of languages vary in only finitely many ways with respect the domain covered by sub-theory. All these -theories of G.B theory operates in a modular form, this theory itself is referred to as modular deductive theory of grammar. The sub-theory assumed are the following.               </p> <p>i.     X- bar theory </p> <p>ii.    Theta theory </p> <p>iii.   case theory </p> <p>iv.  Binding theory </p> <p>v.    Bounding theory </p> <p>vi.  Control theory  </p> <p>     vii.  Government theory                                                                                                                </p> <p><strong> 1.9.1       X-BAR THEORY</strong></p> <p>      X-Bar syntax replaces large numbers of idiosyncratic rules with general principles. It captures properties of all phrases and its bases on lexicon. The principle is that a phrase always contains a head of the same type. </p> <p>        It defines the possible phrase structure configuration of language in general. The control notion is that each of the major lexical categories  (Noun, Verb, Preposition and Adjectives), is the head of structure is dominated by a (phrase, Verb: verb phrase e.t.c) for example Noun phrase (NP) is headed by a Noun. It comes after possible constituents in the example below.</p> <p>               ‘That house’                    </p> <p>                      NP                                <strong>Fig. 1.9.1</strong></p> <p>             Spec       N’                            </p> <p>                Det       N                 </p> <p>               That    house</p> <p>               X-bar encompasses projection principle which shows how head moves to its maximal projection. It projects the characteristics of lexical entries into the syntax which link the D-structure to S-structure an LF to the lexicon by specifying the possible context in which a particular lexical item can occur   projection from the head to the maximal is shown below.</p> <p>            XP- Maximal projection </p> <p>            X'- Intermediate </p> <p>            X - The head</p> <p>            All NPs have the same two bar level structures even if specifiers and complementizers are not actually present putting the levels of specifier and complement together, the structure of a phrase consist of two levels, arbituary using particular specifier and complement positions.  </p> <p>                           X\"                                              <strong>Fig. 1.9.1.2</strong></p> <p>                Specified             X’                                                                                                                                                           </p> <p>                                  X                 Complement     </p> <p>             G.B claims that these two level are necessary for all types of phrase.

It introduces us to the background of the speakers of the language which includes their culture and beliefs.</p> <p>          Also, a brief explanation of the scope of the study, Method of Data Collection, Genetic Classification and the Theoretical framework used in carrying out the research on the language are discussed.</p> <p>          This research is aimed at describing the Bura Negation. Bura is a language Spoken in two (2) local government areas in Borno State. The two local governments’ areas are Biu and Shani respectively. The Bura people are about 250,000 in population.</p> <p><strong>1.1.    Historical Background</strong></p> <p>According to oral history, Bura speakers were believed to had their origin from the Northern part of Nigeria in Borno State. The State shares border with Niger Republic, Chad Republic and Cameroon Republic and Common boundaries with Adamawa, Gombe and Yobe States.</p> <p>          The Bura lived north of Biu before being attacked by Yamta – ra – wala around 16th Century. The few people Yemta brought with him intermarried with the Bura and built up the Biu dynasty into a kingdom. Those descended from Yemta’s group were called Pabir (Babur), this is why Pabir and Bura differ considerably in culture and appearance. </p> <p>          Until today, the Pabir are the ruling class among the Bura, and all the Bura villages pay tribute to the Emir of Biu. The Bura still resent the Pabir.</p> <p>          Apart from Bura they also speak Hausa, Chibok and Marghi and also few of Fulflde. The Bura speakers are approximately over 250,000. The Pabir and Bura are the major tribes in Biu and Shani Local Government Areas of Borno State.</p> <p><strong>The Map of Bura Communities is shown below</strong>:</p> <p><strong> 1.2   Socio- cultural Profile</strong></p> <p>          This center on the socio-cultural background of Bura people in terms of their occupation, Religion, festivals and ceremonies. The following information the socio-cultural profile of Bura people was collected through oral source.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1 Marriage System</strong></p> <p>          Bura has a way of marriage policy when a female child is born, a suitor may propose by throwing a leafy branch of a certain tree into the mother’s hut. If he is accepted, he gives gifts as the girl grows up. He works on her father’s farm and makes Zana matting for them when she reaches marriage able age, he organizes his friends to capture her and bring her to his house. Then the remaining part of the bride price is settled, which is not a insists amount and arrangements for the marriage ceremony are concluded.</p> <p>          Also, thing   that are normally given in the ceremony is basically kolanut, salt and a white linen. The bride is usually expected to produce a white cloth stained with the proof of her virginity and it may be displayed with pride. Her parents will be ashamed if she is not a virgin.</p> <p>          As a sign of respect, a man does not eat with his parents-in –law.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2   Festivals</strong></p> <p>          The only festival held in Bura is the maize harvest festival and is performed before fresh corn can be eaten. Bura man who has lost a father or mother selects three heads of corn, usually from his first fruits, dresses it carefully and puts it on a tray which he sets by his head at night. </p> <p><strong>1.2.3 Chieftaincy</strong></p> <p>            Originally the Bura had no central Government. Now the Emir of Biu appoints the districts head (Ajia) who then approve the appointments of the village heads (Lawans).Today both these titles belong to certain families. The village heads appoint the ward heads (Bulamas) over small villages and wards of larger ones. Anyone who has leadership ability can be chosen as a Bulama.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4  Religion</strong></p> <p>          The   Bura had their traditional religion before Islam came around 1920 and Christianity later came in the 1920’s. Today these three religions can all be found among the Bura. The traditional religion is called Hyel or Hyel- taku, but Naptu is a personal god who takes cares of individual. The gods are represented by various objects such as water, stones, mountains or forests. Most sacrifices to gods are made on Saturday, so it is a special day, the chief priest is called Mythmaker Haptu</p> <p>Christianity was introduced through the missionaries The proportion of Christians is small compared to the entire population.</p> <p>Despite the  presence of churches in many towns and villages, lslam is still the predominant religion among the Bura. A rough estimate of the religious percentages is as follows: - Muslims 78% Christians 20% and Traditional 20%. Many Christians are nominal and many are not free from immorality.</p> <p><strong>1.2.5  Occupation</strong></p> <p>          The main occupation of the bura people is farming. Minority of the people are subsidized farmers, though commercial farming is also practiced. The major crops are maize, guinea corn, groundnut and rice.</p> <p><strong>1.2.6 Burial Rites</strong></p> <p>          Bura people celebrate death, when an old person dies, he or she is buried on the second day when everyone has gathered in the evening. The corpse of a chief is buried seated, but other people re laid flat on the floor of the cavity. There is traditional dancing for seven days after the burial and if the deceased was an important person, it lasts for 14days.</p> <p>          On one of the mourning days the Fulnchambwi dance is done. The male dancers jump from the ground to the roof of the hut of the deceased and back again until the roof is destroyed. After this the date is fixed for the last mourning or sadaka, which is held about six (6) months later, but usually during the dry season.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Genetic Classification</strong></p> <p>                    This essence of a genetic classification of a language is to trace the origin of the language and show it relationship with the other language.</p> <p>           Bura language belong to the Afro-Asiatic Family which is shown by the family tree below</p> <p>Source “Comrie, B. (ed) (1987)</p> <p><strong>1.4   Scope and Organization of the Body</strong></p> <p>             The main objective of this project is to study in details the type of negation strategies that exist in Bura language. Negation in Bura will be an sentence negation, auxiliary negation, imperative negation and interrogation negation. We shall also study in respect to transformation processes which involve modifications of constituents.</p> <p>        This long easy is divided into five chapters, the first chapter is the introduction chapter which contains the general introduction of the research work, the historical background of the Bura people, social-cultural profile, genetic classification, collection and analysis of data and the theoretical framework employed.</p> <p>        Chapter Two presents a phonological review of Bura language and the basic syntactic concepts like phrase structure rules, basic word order, lexical categories and sentences types. Chapter Three is on the negation in Bura language, while chapter four introduces us to transformational processes like focus construction, relativization. Chapter five summarizes and concludes the work.</p> <p><strong>1.5   Theoretical Framework</strong></p> <p>          The theoretical framework to be employed in this research is Government and Binding theory (GB). GB theory is a model of grammar propounded and developed by Noam Chomsky. This is done with the aim of covering Universal Grammar (UG) that is, the system or principles, conditions and rule that are elements or properties of all human languages.</p> <p>     In essence, negation as an aspect of syntax will be analyzed under the GB theoretical framework.</p> <p><strong>1.6      Data Collection</strong></p> <p>          The method of data collection is contact method or informant method. We collected linguistic data for this study by making use of language informants who are native speaker of Bura language. The data were collected through the use of frame technique and the Ibadan word list of 400 basic items. Below are pieces of information about the informants.</p> <p>1.     <strong>NAME</strong>: Ezekiel Simon Shelai</p> <p><strong>SEX:</strong>     Male                                                                          </p> <p><strong>AGE:</strong>39 years</p> <p><strong>OCCUPATION:</strong> Lecturing</p> <p><strong>NO OF YEARS SPENT IN BURA</strong>: 26years</p> <p><strong>OTHER LANGUAGE SPOKEN</strong>: English, Hausa and Chibok.</p> <p>2.     <strong>NAME</strong>: Mr. Bashir</p> <p><strong>SEX: </strong>Male</p> <p><strong>AGE:</strong>36 years</p> <p><strong>OCCUPATION</strong>: Civil Servant</p> <p><strong>NUMBER OF YEARS SPENT IN BURA</strong>: 21 years</p> <p><strong>OTHER LANGUAGES SPOKEN</strong>: English and Kanuri</p> <p><strong>1.7            </strong><strong>  Data Analysis</strong></p> <p>To ensure an efficient data analysis in this research, all data received are accurately transcribed. The morphemes that made up the phrases and sentences are also carefully glossed. The data collected are worked upon according to how the native speakers use it without imposing any extraneous rules or norm of correctness.</p> <p><strong>1.8                        </strong><strong>  Review of the Chosen Framework</strong></p> <p>The framework adopted in research is the Government and Binding (GB) theory. This is the theory that captures the similarities which exists between different categories of lexical phrases by assigning the same structure to them rather than having different phrase structure rules for VPs, NPs etc </p> <p>          Government and Binding theory deals with transformation. According to Radford (1988:419), transformation is the rule that deal with the act of changing the structure of one sentences to another structure through the concept of movement known as move alpha (move-α). This theory (GB) was developed to correct the lapses in Transformational Generative Grammar. </p> <p>        Cook (1988: 66), the theory of Government and Binding is an interlocking arrangement of principles and sub theories which interact in many different ways. </p> <p><strong>The Modular Theory of Grammar.</strong></p> <p>                          </p> <div> <p>PROJECTION  PRINCIPLE</p> </div><p>                    </p> <p> </p> <div> <p>CASE THEORY</p> <p>(Case filter)</p> </div><p>    </p> <p>Sells (1985: 25) and cook (1988: 33).</p> <p>           In the diagram above, no part can be considered in isolation from the rest. Government and Binding theory posit seven sub-theories of theory of grammar. The structures generated at various levels are constrained by a set of theories, which define the kind of relationship possible within a grammar. </p> <p>    These sub-theories of Government and Binding theory are given below:</p> <p>i.                     X- Bar Theory</p> <p>ii.                                                                                           Theta (θ) Theory</p> <p>iii.                                                                                   </p>\n\nASPECTS OF BURA NEGATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASPECTS OF BURA NEGATION", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ASPECTS OF GUNGANCHI VERB PHRASE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>      The main focus of this research work is a discussion on the verb phrase of Gunganchi language. This chapter therefore aims at introducing the work by discussing some historical facts about the Gunganchi people and the language itself. Justification for the study as well as the scope of the work is examined in this chapter. The chapter will also give information on the genetic classification of Gunganchi language and then attempt a brief review of our chosen framework, the government and binding theory.</p> <p><strong>1.1            </strong><strong>GENERAL BACKGROUND OF THE LANGUAGE</strong></p> <p>      Kebbi State, the home of Argungu international fishing and cultural festival came into existence as a political entity on the 27th August 1991. It was carved out of the former Sokoto State with its headquarters in Birnin kebbi. From available source given by informant, Kebbi State spreads alluringly over a vast expanse of land of approximately 36.229 square kilometres representing 3.9% of the total land area of Nigeria.</p> <p>In this wonderful endowed land lives a population of 3,238,628 (2006 census) people bounded by a long winding history and inspired by memories of spectacular accomplishment. At present, the state is made up of four emirates (Gwandu, Argungu, Yauri and Zuru) which are further divided into 21 local government areas: Birnin Kebbi, Ngaske, Yauri, Sakabo, Zuru, Dandi etc.</p> <p>    Kebbi State has diverse ethnic groups. The dominant amidst them are: Hausa, Fulani, Kabawa and the Gunganwa. The distributions of these ethnic groups show that the Gunganwa (speakers of Gunganchi) are found in Yauri local government. (Informant)</p> <p><strong>1.2            </strong><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE SPEAKERS</strong></p> <p>    The Gunganwa also known as the Bareshe people by their </p> <p>Hausa neighbours hail from Yauri Local government area of </p> <p>Kebbi State. This local government area has a total population of seventy four thousand nine hundred and sixteen people (74,916). They are only found in Yauri local government and call themselves ‘Guresha amidst’. History has it that they came from an island called “gungun” which means water and “Ganwa” which means people that are surrounded by water.</p> <p><strong>1.3            </strong><strong>SOCIO – CULTURAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>      Every community has its distinct way of life. The way people eat, what they wear, their mode of marriage, etc. differ in various societies. The Gunganchi people don’t have an exception as they also have their own cultural values just like every other community.</p> <p>     Gunganchi as a language is the mother tongue in Yauri local government area of Kebbi State. It has neighbouring tribes like hun – saare, Lopa and Hausa.</p> <p><strong>1.3.1    </strong><strong>OCCUPATION</strong></p> <p>    Gunganchi people are dominantly farmers and pre-dominantly fishermen. They practice both subsistence and commercial form of farming but they major on cultivation of land and growing of crops for the sustainability of their households. They also engage themselves in fishing using cage called “suuru” and they use ‘Hauwuyu’ for farming but now they have started using hoes, cutlasses etc. They farm and fish depending on the season and their major crops are guinea corn, beans, rice and onions. They are also noted for canoe – making.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2    </strong><strong> RELIGION</strong></p> <p>    Following the 1804 Fulani Jihad, the Gunganchi people are mostly Muslims. They also have few pagans and idol worshippers. According to the informant, research has shown that 70% of the Gunganchi people are Muslims while 29% are traditional worshippers and 1% practice Christianity. Despite these ethnic diversities and religious differences, the Gunganchi people live in peace with one another.  </p> <p><strong>1.3.3    </strong><strong>ADMINISTRATION</strong></p> <p>     Gunganchi people adopt the emirate system like their </p> <p>neighbouring community. Their location is a multi ethnic area consisting of Lopa, Yauri, Laru etc. and the palace of the emir is in Yehwa, but the Gunganchi people are the first settlers in Yauri. Hereditary succession is not adopted in this emirate and the Emir is appointed based on the fact that he must be elderly, famous and respected among the people. </p> <p>     Turbaning is done for the new emir amidst celebration with burukutu (a local drink made from millet). The Emir rules the territory with local chiefs called Sariki. However, the local government chairman holds the executive function of the Yauri Local Government Area and other governmental works are executed by the Kebbi State Government.</p> <p><strong>1.3.4    </strong><strong>FESTIVAL</strong></p> <p>     Their major festivals that are celebrated with pomp and pageantry are Idembe which is the millet festival and Anipo festival. During the Anipo festival, animals like goat are sacrificed. These festivals bring all Gunganchi speaking communities together.</p> <p><strong>1.3.5    </strong><strong>MARRIAGE AND BURIAL RITE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3.5.1 MARRIAGE</strong></p> <p>Marriage in Gunganchi community is a bit complex especially for men. In Gunganchi community when a man signals his intention of marriage to a lady, the man’s parents inform the lady’s parents. Before the lady’s parents agree to such proposal, the man must farm for his in-law for an unspecified duration. He farms until the parents of the lady become satisfied. After the farming they formally announce their intension and a date is fixed for the wedding.</p> <p>On the wedding day the man’s family go with guinea corn because no bride price is needed. The marriage is based on Islamic rites and the marriage ceremony is fun and full of merry making. The Gunganchi people also encourage inter marriage most especially with Hausas.</p> <p><strong>1.3.5.2 BURIAL RITES</strong></p> <p>     During a Gunganchi burial ceremony, the corpse is lowered into the ground and covered with leaves. Like most tribes the death of an aged person is celebrated and that of the young person is mourned. Sudden or unusual death is usually investigated and the oracle is consulted to find out the cause of the death. The killer of the deceased is said to be killed by the spirit of the dead. The oracle that are consulted are the Gigo (true God) and Ujigo (god of thunder and iron). This is a traditional rite performed on the dead.</p> <p><strong>1.3.6    </strong><strong>CULTURE</strong></p> <p>      The Gunganchi people are highly cultural people. This </p> <p>reflects in their normal ways of life which will be discussed below.</p> <p><strong>1.3.6.1 CLOTHING</strong></p> <p>      Before the present day of westernization and civilization the Gunganchi people cloth themselves with animal skin. They make various styles from these animal skins. They now make use of ‘banbariga’ (traditional dress for the man) and loose clothing with local embroidery tied around the woman’s body to wade off the sun. There are also heavy tribal marks on the woman’s face and tattoo on the legs during wedding ceremonies. However some of them still make use of animal skins till date.</p> <p><strong>1.3.6.2 FOOD</strong></p> <p>      The Gunganchi people take guinea corn pap as their best food. They like guinea corn that most of them prefer keeping it than selling it in the market. Guinea corn pap is served at occasions like wedding, naming and during other festive periods. Burukutu (local gin) is their favourite drink and is served during their leisure time.</p> <p><strong>1.3.6.3 NAMING CEREMONY</strong></p> <p>      When a child is born, he is named after seven days. His hair is shaved and after ten years the child is circumcised.</p> <p><strong>1.3.7. EDUCATION</strong></p> <p>      Before the advent of western education, the people have a way of teaching morals and skills within their community to their children. They hereby teach and impact knowledge to their children right from birth. Hence when western education came it was warmly embraced by the Gunganchi people. However Gunganchi language was also used in teaching Islamic studies to their children.</p> <p><strong>1.3.8 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>   In this study an attempt is made to identify the following;</p> <p>     1 The pattern and arrangement of words in Gunganchi     language, i.e. word order;</p> <p>2       The lexical categories of Gunganchi language</p> <p>3       The transformational processes in Gunganchi language</p> <p>4       Combination of words to form phrases and sentences in Gunganchi language</p> <p>5        Rules that apply to structure of phrase in the language; and</p> <p>6        Classification of verbs in Gunganchi language.</p> <p><strong>1.4 GENETIC CLASSIFICATION</strong></p> <p>      Murit Ruhlen states that “The idea that groups of languages that share certain systematic resemblances have inherited those similarities from a common origin in the basis of genetic classification.</p> <p>A genetic classification thus makes two statements. Firstly it affirms that certain languages are in fact related to each other (i.e. share a common ancestor). Secondly, it specifies how the languages are inter-related in the form of a branching diagram. </p> <p>      Gunganchi language falls under the Niger-Kordofanian </p> <p>language family.

The Government and Binding (GB) theory will be examined and a detailed analysis of case theory will be carried out. There are five chapters in all.</p> <p>      Chapter one introduces the topic of the study, the language of study and the people. It gives a historical as well as socio- cultural account of the speakers including the genetic classification of the language.</p> <p>      A review of literature is carried out in the same chapter. Some earlier theories of grammar are examined in this chapter. The Government and Binding theory, which is the theoretical frame work used with its modules are discussed in details.</p> <p>     Chapter two examines the phonological concepts and basic syntactic concepts of the language. It also discusses the sound inventory, tonal and syllable inventories of the language as well as the lexical categories.</p> <p>The structures of Gunganchi verb phrase as well as verb classification are accounted for in the next chapter.</p> <p>    Chapter four explains the transformational processes that occur in Gunganchi language. Finally in chapter five, a summary of the entire research, observation and recommendation are offered. The research will come to an end in the same chapter and the list of references is attached.</p> <p><strong>1.6   THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>     The theoretical framework used for this research is the Government and Binding (GB) theory otherwise known as principles and parameters theory. In the following sections of this chapter, attempts will be made to examine the details of the modules of this theory like case theory, theta theory, Binding theory and Government theory. A brief survey of some earlier theories of grammar will also be carried out.</p> <p>1.7<strong>DATA COLLECTION</strong></p> <p>       The method of data collection used in this project is the </p> <p>contact/informant method. Linguistic data was collected for this study by making use of language informant who is a native speaker of Gunganchi language. The data was collected through the use of frame technique and the Ibadan word – list of 400 basic items.</p> <p>     Below are pieces of information about the informant:</p> <p>Name: CORPORAL LABBO ALKALI</p> <p>SEX: MALE</p> <p>AGE: 40</p> <p>OCCUPATION: SOLDIER</p> <p>NO OF YEARS SPENT IN GUNGANCHI: 20 Years</p> <p>OTHER LANGUAGES SPOKEN: HAUSA AND ENGLISH</p> <p><strong>1.8 DATA ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p>      To ensure an efficient data analysis in this research, all data received are accurately transcribed. The morphemes that made up the phrases and sentences are also carefully glossed. </p> <p>     The data collected are worked upon according to how the native speakers use it without imposing any extraneous rules or norm of correctness.</p> <p><strong>The sub – theories of GB theory</strong></p> <p>      As mentioned earlier, these sub – theories interplay and dictate what can be moved from where (extraction site) and to where (landing site). The modules account for ungrammaticality resulting from violations of rules and conditions. These modules include case theory, theta theory, binding theory, government theory, control theory and bounding theory. The relationship between one sub – theory and the other is shown below</p> <p><strong>               MODULAR THEORY OF GRAMMAR</strong></p> <p>X – BAR THEORY                                             Projection Principle </p> <p>D – STRUCUTRE                                               Lexicon </p> <p>Move – α                                                   θ – Theory </p> <p>Bounding                                               (O criterion) </p> <p> </p> <div> <p>S – Structure</p> </div><p> </p> <p> </p> <div> <p>Logical form</p> </div><p> </p> <p> Phonetic Form               </p> <p>FIG 1.1: MODULAR THEORY OF GRAMMAR</p> <p>Sells (1985:25) and Cook (1988:33) </p> <p>     In the diagram above, no part can be considered in isolation from the rest. Government and Binding theory posits seven sub – theories of the theory of grammar. The structure generated at various levels is constrained by a set of theories, which define the kind of relationships possible within a grammar. The sub – theories of Government and Binding theory are:</p> <p>i.                   X – BAR THEORY</p> <p>ii.                 THETA THEORY</p> <p>iii.              CASE THEORY</p> <p>iv.              BINDING THEORY</p> <p>v.                 BOUNDING THEORY</p> <p>vi.              GOVERNMENT THEORY</p> <p>vii.            CONTROL THEORY</p> <p><strong>1.8.1   X – BAR THEORY</strong></p> <p>      X – bar theory is part of the grammar that regulates and brings out what is common in the structure of phrase. Cook (1988:94) says:</p> <p>          “In the X – theory, the phrase structure is a comparatively simple system derived from a few principles and the setting of certain parameters.”</p> <p>       A phrase always contains a head in X – bar theory thereby showing hierarchy among the constituents. Heads are terminal nodes that dominate words.</p> <p>      According to Haegerman (1991:105), two levels of projection are distinguished in X – bar theory. These are the specifier and complement positions respectively.</p> <p>X ”</p> <p>(Specifier)                 X ’</p> <p>X               (complement) </p> <p>            FIG 1.2: X-Bar theory (Radford 2002:229)                                           </p> <p> X ’’ above ranges over all phrasal categories like Noun phrases, verb phrases, adjectival phrases, prepositional phrases, inflectional phrases and complementizer phrases.</p> <p>     X’ on the other hand stands for x and its complement where applicable. ‘X’ is a category variable that stands for any major word – level category like Noun, verb, adjective and preposition.</p> <p>     Specifier and complement represent grammatical functions or relations; they have a status similar to terms such as ‘subject’ or ‘object’. They are optional constituents for some phrases but obligatory for some others (Radford 2002:229).</p> <p>     The Gunganchi phrase structure is as outlined below:</p> <p>CP → C’       specifier</p> <p>IP → I’         specifier</p> <p>NP → N’     specifier</p> <p>VP → V’      specifier</p> <p>AP → Adj    specifier</p> <p>PP → P        specifier</p> <p>Examples</p> <p>1.     denya       aba</p> <p>That          child </p> <p>NP</p> <p> NI             Spec </p> <p>N              denya </p> <p>aba  </p> <p>                                        ‘denya aba’ </p> <p>FIG 1.2.1</p> <p>2.     irea ikùnuà</p> <p>eat beans </p> <p>‘ate beans’</p> <p>VP</p> <p>Spec                   VI</p> <p>V                  NP</p> <p>      Irea                 Ikùnuà</p> <p>FIG 1.2.2</p> <p>3.     Lú     úkulù</p>\n\nASPECTS OF GUNGANCHI VERB PHRASE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASPECTS OF GUNGANCHI VERB PHRASE", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ASPECTS OF </strong><strong>GUNGANCI MORPHOLOGY</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>The chapter introduces us to the general background, historical background, socio-cultural profile and genetic classification of the Gùngáwá people. It also includes the scope and organization of study, theoretical framework, data analysis and a review of the chosen framework.</p> <p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>General Background</strong></p> <p>Introduction to the History of Gùngáwá People and Language.</p> <p>            Gùngáwá is an adopted name for the Bàrèshe people by their Hausa neighbors which means Island dwellers because of their nearest to rivers and lakes.</p> <p>            The people call themselves Bàrèshe, Tsureja or Yáúráwa but officially called Gùngáwá. The names of the language are Gùngáwá, Gùngácí.</p> <p>The Gùngáwá people are mostly found in Northern part of Kebbi State, and around Islands in extreme Sokoto State few of them were also in Niger State especially Kontangora area and Borgu Local Government Area and a recent funding in Kaiama Local Government Area of Kwara State.</p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>Historical Background</strong></p> <p>The tribe Gùngáwá or Bàrèshe can be found in the Northern part of Nigeria in Southern Kebbi State (Yàúrí Local Government) few of them are also in Borgu Local Government Area and North of Borgu in Niger State.</p> <p>The Gùngáwá are mostly concentrated in Kebbi State in Yàúrí Local Government. The Gùngáwá people are the original inhabitants of Yàúrí according to Muazu Bagudu a native of the town.</p> <p>A source had that the Gùngáwá were decendents of  17th century warrior called Kisira or Kachin who allied himself with the Hausa Soldiers to gain territory in the extreme North who eventually settled with his co-fighters in present Yàúrí town.</p> <p>Another source told us of their trace to a songay warrior who came from Mali to seek territorial control and their eventual settlement (with his supporters) in Yàúrí and parts of Lopa and Laru (Gùngáwá neighboring areas).</p> <p>According to Apollos Aagamalafiya, a native of Gùngáwá from Rèkúbọlọ area in Yàúrí belief that the Gùngáwá people came from Kabuwa that they are hunters from Katsina State.</p> <p>He (Apollos) explained further that some say they are from Shagana, Kambari, Kabbawa or Sarkawa. These are mixed up tribes that constitute the Yàúrí emirate.</p> <p>As regard this histories, the actual place of origin is not clear, and it remain debatable among Gùngáwá people. Although, the Gùnganci language is closely related with that of the Lopa and Laru people in term of lexical items and Noun Affixes. No matter how related these people might be with the Gùngáwá tribe; however, they (Gùngáwá) still remain divergent in historical root.</p> <p><strong>Present Gùngáwá People</strong></p> <p>As explained ealier, the Gùngáwá are the original inhabitants of Yàúrí. They fled to the nearby Island of the Niger State in the mid 19 century and eventually return to a new site called Yelwa or Gungu in Yàúri.</p> <p>            During the British regime, the status of Yauri as an emirate and of Yelwa as the seat of the Emir of Yàúrí were confirmed (Hogben 1966: 259), both Yàúrí and Yelwa have become hausarized as a result of contact with Hausa People (especially through marriage).</p> <p>            The British create an emirate because of the multi ethnic groups in Yàúrí however; the Gungu district of Yàúrí Local Government is now the centre of the Gùngáwá population.</p> <p>            The Gùngáwá live in Islets and shores of the Niger above Busa until the creation of lake Kainji in 1974 which disrupt their settlement and living outside Illo and Shabanda in Kebbi State.</p> <p><strong>Population of Gùngáwá People</strong></p> <p>            The Gùngáwá people were about 40 to 60 thousand in population about 60% lives in Yàúrí in Kebbi State, 35% lives outside Yàúrí town, 9% in Kontogora, North of Busa and Borgu Local Government and 1% in Kaima area in Kwara State. The population of the speakers in Yàúrí is referred to as Yàúrawá or Reshewa’.</p> <p>            According to Apollos, Queen Amina of Zaria called them Yàúrawá but generally they are called Gùngáwá.</p> <p>            Among the Gùngáwá in diaspora, they sometimes call themselves Bárèshe (plural) or Úrèshe (singular).</p> <p>            Those that live in the riverside fields were onions, and for their canoe building and fishing along the Niger are called Sórko or Sórókó. They may be related to the Bozo of Mali, a western Mande group who are professional fishermen.</p> <p>            However, Sórókó is now a name used to designate professional fishermen on the Niger river.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Socio-cultural Profile of the Gùngáwá People</strong></p> <p>            The Gùngáwá has a social and cultural background that is unique and typical of an African values especially in the area of marriage, profession and communal work.</p> <p>            Also, the Gùngáwá wrestling performed in the central plain ground at Yelwa district did not only attract the peoples and passersby alone but an avenue for tourism.</p> <p>            Also, they make their way of live so simple according to Muazu but very similar to the Hausas, their lifestyle is centered on the Emirate system.</p> <p>            At this junction, the socio-cultural background of the Gùngáwá people shall include their social, cultural, and political system it will also include their profession or occupation, marriage, naming, clothing, foods, festival, religions, burial ceremony.</p> <p>            The sociolinguistic aspect shall include language use and attitude, language shift and the status of the language ( Gúngáncí ).</p> <p><strong>Sociol Life</strong></p> <p>            The Gùngáwá lives a life similar to the Hausa as a result of long time contact, only in the aspect of occupation they differ.</p> <p>            The Gùngáwá wear loose rope and relax with friends communal work is peculiar among them on their farms. They create a round seat when eating especially at leisure joints or during festival celebration, naming, wedding or sallah.</p> <p>            Their market is a social avenue where idle chatting and trading activities take place. They are grounds for making friends and dating according to Muazu Bagudu.</p> <p>            The markets are exhibition centre where mats, canoes, and fish caught were display for prospective buyers. They are craftman according to Muazu.</p> <p><strong>Culture</strong></p> <p>            The Gùngáwá people are highly cultural people this reflects in their greetings, clothing, profession and boldly adornment, like heavy tribal marks on the women face and leg tatooing during wedding ceremony. However, the following are aspects of their cultural life.</p> <p><strong>Occupation</strong></p> <p>            The Gùngáwá people are mostly farmers, their chief crops include guinea corn, beans, onions, they are also fishermen who use suru and Hauwuya to catch fish. They are subsistence farmers (they eat most of their farm produce), they make canoes and mat.</p> <p><strong>Marriage</strong></p> <p>            Marriage is a bit complex. The boy seas a lady and inform his own parent about the lady. The boy’s parent inform the lady’s parent of their son interests in their daughter, before consent is given, the boy must inform his in-law to be before final consent is given.</p> <p>            However, the farming duration is not specified. After the farming period is over, the in-law formally notify their relatives of their daughter relationship with the boy and it became an awareness to other who may further show interest on the lady, later the wedding day is chosen.</p> <p>            The marriage and engagement is based on Islamic rites. The bride price (Zadaki) according to Muazu Bagudu is paid which is the guinea corn.</p> <p>            The marriage ceremony is fun and full of merry making. Guinea corn  palp is served in the morning,rice with fish soup and Bùrùkùtù (local gin) at dusk. They normally seat round eating, the Gùngáwá people also intermarry with the Hausas. It was initially a one man one wife, but now they can marry more than two wives.</p> <p><strong>Naming</strong></p> <p>A child is born and named after seven days his hair is shaved and 10 years later the child is circumcised. corn food or rice food are served during the naming ceremony.</p> <p><strong>Clothing</strong></p> <p>            The Gùngáwá people wears animal skin in the olden days but now Babanriga is their traditional dress for the men while loose covered clothing with local embroidery and scarf or Hijab for women is tie around their body to wade off the sun.</p> <p>            Heavy tribal marks are characterized by the Gùngáwá women who occupy almost their face.</p> <p><strong>Foods</strong></p> <p>            The Gùngáwá like Guinea corn palp. It is their food, almost all of them prefer eating it (Guinea corn foods) than selling it in the market. Guinea corn palp is served in occasions like wedding, naming and festival period.</p> <p>            Also bùrùkùtù (local gin) is their favourite drink served at their leisure or relaxation time.</p> <p><strong>Festivals</strong></p> <p>            They celebrates the Idembe festival (Millet festival) and Anipo festival. During the festival animal blood like goat or bush meat are sacrifice to their high god called ‘Ujigo’ – god of thunder.</p> <p><strong>Religions</strong></p> <p>            Most of the Gúngáncí speakers are Muslims about 70% are Muslim, 30% traditional and less than 1% are Christian.</p> <p><strong>Burial Practice</strong></p> <p>            Corpse are laid bare naked into the ground both youth and old. They are covered with leaves like other tribes do.</p> <p>            Aged people are celebrated and young people are mourned sudden or unusual deaths are investigated, an oracle is consulted for the cause of the death. The killer is killed by the deceased spirit. Oracle Consulted is Újígó. This practice is peculiar with old indigenous Gúngáwá people.</p> <p><strong>Political System and Administration</strong></p> <p>            They adopted the emirate system like the Hausas because Yàúrí is a multiethnic area consisting of Lopa, Laru, Gùngáwá, Yàúrí Kambari, Dukkanchi peoples that coexist with them.</p> <p>            The palace of the Emir is in Yelwa (The Gùngáwá   are the first settlers in Yàúrí). The British colonization gave the recognition of Yàúrí Emirate and Gungu (Island) district of Yàúrí Local Government is now the centre of Gùngáwá population.</p> <p>            Succession is not by heredity, the Emir is appointed (although, the first Emir of Yàúrí is Gùngáwá).</p> <p>            The Emir to be must be elderly, famous and respected among the ethnic groups that made up Yàúrí and turbaning is done for the new Emir with celebration and plenty búrúkútú.</p> <p>            The Emir rules the territory with local chiefs called “Sariki” in areas like Toro, Banha, Zamari, Rekubolo, Jalabubu, Gungunsariki etc.</p> <p>            However, Local Government Chairman has been holding the executive function of the Yàúrí area now and other Governmental works are executed by the Kebbi State Government.</p> <p>            Most Gùngáwá people are bilingual in  Gúngáncí  and Hausa but majority speaks Hausa (especially the Youths) at home only the few old people at home speaks  Gúngáncí  living the status of the language to be endangered.</p> <p>            The language of the emirate is Hausa with high prestige.</p> <p><strong>Language Use</strong></p> <p>1.         Youth use Hausa rather than  Gúngáncí .</p> <p>2.         Educated people prefer Hausa to  Gúngáncí .</p> <p>3.         Muslim clerics encourage the use of Hausa than  Gúngáncí .</p> <p>4.         Parent do not use  Gúngáncí  more frequent as before so children    pick Hausa      than  Gúngáncí .</p> <p>5.         Peer group use more Hausa in their conversation discussions, marketing etc.</p> <p><strong>Language Attitude</strong></p> <p>            Before we left the people, many of them consider a change of attitude many are encouraged and started using their language to their children many are asking for literacy books and classes for their villages, most of the Youths are happy to be called Báràshe unlike before and hoping start a literacy classes if books are provided.</p> <p><strong>1.5       Genetic Classification of  Gúngáncí  Language</strong></p> <p>             Gúngáncí belongs to the Niger Congo language family which is a constituent of the Niger Kordofinia phylum. It also consists of a single group of two languages.</p> <p>These are shown on the tree diagram below:</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>AFRO ASIATIC       NIGER KORDOFINIA       NILOSAHARAN      KHOISAN</strong></p> <p>Genetic Classification of  Gúngáncí  language based on Ross Jones Classification (1992)</p> <p><strong>1.6       Scope and Organization of Study</strong></p> <p>            This research work is organized into five chapters. It is an attempt to describe the morphological aspect of  Gúngáncí  language.</p> <p>Chapter one consist of the general background of the  Gúngáncí  speakers, historical background, socio-cultural background, genetic classification, scope and organization of study, theoretical framework, data collection, data analysis, and brief review of the chosen frame work.</p> <p>            Chapter two presents basic phonological and morphological concepts of Gúngáncí. That is, morphology, morphemes types of morphemes, language typologies, structural position of morpheme etc.</p> <p>            Chapter three centers on the morphology of Gúngáncí language.</p> <p>            Chapter four centres on morphological processes or word formation processes in Gúngáncí language.</p> <p>            Chapter five will include summary, conclusion and references.</p> <p><strong>1.7       Theoretical Framework</strong></p> <p>            The theoretical framework that will be employ is morphology; and morpheme as the unit for analyzing the internal structure of words in the language.</p> <p>            The morphological processes will be discussed. Basically in this work, the discussion will be restricted to the morphological aspect of  Gúngáncí  and the focus of the study is the  Gúngáncí  language spoken in Kebbi State.</p> <p><strong>1.8       Data Collection and Data Analysis</strong></p> <p>            Our means of data collection in the work was through Ibadan 400 word list of basic lexical items and the use of frame techniques.</p> <p>            The assistance of a language helpers or informants was sought and these made our data collection less difficult.</p> <p>            The method of data collection was contact method or informant method. The informants are multi-lingual as they speak Gúngáncí language fluently and also Hausa, English, Pidgin English, Gwandu.</p> <p>            The Ibadan 400 word list of basic lexical items and some basic frame technique were use to elicit information from our informants and their responses were tape recorded and transcribed.</p> <p>            Below are some data on my informants.</p> <p><strong>INFORMANT ONE</strong></p> <p>Name:                          Muazu Bagudu</p> <p>Occupation:                 Soldier</p> <p>Age:                            24</p> <p>Sex:                             Male</p> <p>Years spent in Home Town:   23 years</p> <p><strong>INFORMANT TWO</strong></p> <p>Name:                          Nasiru Ibrahim</p> <p>Occupation:                 Driving</p> <p>Age:                            29</p> <p>Sex:                             Male</p> <p>Years spent in Home Town:   26 years</p> <p><strong>1.9       Brief Review of the Chosen Framework</strong></p> <p>            There are various frameworks to the study of morphology as proposed by different scholars because different language has different morphological analysis. These known morphological analysis will be employed to break down words into meaningful segments and those that will be suitable for this long essay will be as follows.</p> <p><strong>Morpheme Based Morphology</strong></p> <p>            This is also known as item and arrangement (Hockett 1954), that is, word forms are arranged morpheme by morpheme. It is also deal with other of structures and how to break work down into their components.</p> <p><strong>Lexeme Based Morphology</strong></p> <p>            This is also known as item and process (Bloomfield 1933) it means instead of analyzing a word form as a set morpheme arranged in sequence, a word form is said to be the result of applying rules that alter a word form or stem in order to produce a new one, for example an inflectional rule that change word category (derivational rule).</p> <p><strong>Analysis and Synthesis</strong></p> <p>            This also has to do with breaking words down especially for language linguist has never encountered nor having a written form.</p> <p>            The synthesis approach is associated with the theory than methodology, that is, theory of construction.</p> <p>             Therefore, by this analytic approach its principles shall be employed known as principles of morphemic identification.<strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>The chapter introduces us to the general background, historical background, socio-cultural profile and genetic classification of the Gùngáwá people.

The boy’s parent inform the lady’s parent of their son interests in their daughter, before consent is given, the boy must inform his in-law to be before final consent is given.</p> <p>            However, the farming duration is not specified. After the farming period is over, the in-law formally notify their relatives of their daughter relationship with the boy and it became an awareness to other who may further show interest on the lady, later the wedding day is chosen.</p> <p>            The marriage and engagement is based on Islamic rites. The bride price (Zadaki) according to Muazu Bagudu is paid which is the guinea corn.</p> <p>            The marriage ceremony is fun and full of merry making. Guinea corn  palp is served in the morning,rice with fish soup and Bùrùkùtù (local gin) at dusk. They normally seat round eating, the Gùngáwá people also intermarry with the Hausas. It was initially a one man one wife, but now they can marry more than two wives.</p> <p><strong>Naming</strong></p> <p>A child is born and named after seven days his hair is shaved and 10 years later the child is circumcised. corn food or rice food are served during the naming ceremony.</p> <p><strong>Clothing</strong></p> <p>            The Gùngáwá people wears animal skin in the olden days but now Babanriga is their traditional dress for the men while loose covered clothing with local embroidery and scarf or Hijab for women is tie around their body to wade off the sun.</p> <p>            Heavy tribal marks are characterized by the Gùngáwá women who occupy almost their face.</p> <p><strong>Foods</strong></p> <p>            The Gùngáwá like Guinea corn palp. It is their food, almost all of them prefer eating it (Guinea corn foods) than selling it in the market. Guinea corn palp is served in occasions like wedding, naming and festival period.</p> <p>            Also bùrùkùtù (local gin) is their favourite drink served at their leisure or relaxation time.</p> <p><strong>Festivals</strong></p> <p>            They celebrates the Idembe festival (Millet festival) and Anipo festival. During the festival animal blood like goat or bush meat are sacrifice to their high god called ‘Ujigo’ – god of thunder.</p> <p><strong>Religions</strong></p> <p>            Most of the Gúngáncí speakers are Muslims about 70% are Muslim, 30% traditional and less than 1% are Christian.</p> <p><strong>Burial Practice</strong></p> <p>            Corpse are laid bare naked into the ground both youth and old. They are covered with leaves like other tribes do.</p> <p>            Aged people are celebrated and young people are mourned sudden or unusual deaths are investigated, an oracle is consulted for the cause of the death.

It also introduces us to the sociolinguistic of the speakers of the language which includes their culture and beliefs. Again in this chapter, a brief explanation of the scope of the study, method of data collection, genetic classification and theoretical framework used in analyzing the Atsam Verb phrase are discussed.This study focuses on the Atsam Verb phrase. According to the Oral tradition, Atsam is a language spoken in Kauru Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Atsam is also known as Tsam while the people speaking the language are called Atsam.</p> <p><strong>1.1       </strong><strong>Historical Background.</strong></p> <p>The Oral tradition has it that Atsam is an ethnic group in Northern Nigeria which is Kaduna. They are predominantly found in Kaduna, Plateu and Nasarawa States and Federal Capital Territory, this same tradition states that there was a lack of sufficient data as regards the study of language all because the languages of Kaduna are undoubtedly minority languages and as such, understudied.</p> <p>The Atsam people were forced to migrate from one place to another and they are dominated by Hausa people meaning that the Hausa populations are more than Atsam population. The Atsam people were endangered because of pressure from Hausa and that has been the lingua franca in the North of the country. However, locally the language remains in use.</p> <p><strong>1.2       </strong><strong>Sociolinguistic Profile.</strong></p> <p>According to the oral tradition, the Atsam people like some other tribes have their own unique ways of living and they are discussed below.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1  </strong><strong>Marriage System.</strong></p> <p>In the Oral tradition, Atsam have their own way of marriage system which is a process carried out by the both parent of the boy and the girl, there will be an agreement between the two of them since when the children are still at their childhood stage till when they are grown up, but in most cases, the Groom will be more older than the Bride, an appropriate date for the marriage ceremony will set as soon as the bride began her puberty stage but now, the ancient procedure has changed because of civilization.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2  </strong><strong>Religion.</strong></p> <p>The Oral tradition states it that Atsam people consider religion as of great significance in their lives, they make use of two religions in their community namely: Christianity and Islam. There is however, a third religion which is gradually dying off due to increase awareness in the two main religions. This third religion is the traditional religion popularly known as ‘dodo’ in the area and there are few of such followers of traditional belief at present.</p> <p><strong>1.2.3  </strong><strong>Occupation.</strong></p> <p>The oral tradition has it that the main occupation of Atsam people includes subsistence farming, craft making, bee keeping, fishing, and petty trading. Traditionally, Atsam people are predominantly farmers, through there are few who are engage in other income generating ventures. But 8% of the populations are farmers depending on farming as their means to livelihood.</p> <p>They also engage in craft making as a source of income, popular crafts making include; baskets, wooden, handle of simple farm tools such as hoes, cutlasses and shovels. Certain group of people in the area in bee keeping for the production of honey and the present of rivers at Kifffin Chawai, and Talo also enhance them in fishing as a source of income while petty trading are mostly done by women, but their of nowadays are now joining their female counter parts.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4  </strong><strong>Administrative Setting.</strong></p> <p>According to the oral tradition of Atsam, the chief popularly known as Res-Tsam is the overall ruler in Atsam land. The announcement of laws that ensures peaceful co-existence and the maintenance of law and order within the chiefdom rest on his shoulders. He also performs the functions of lobbing government in bringing development programmes to the chiefdom.</p> <p>Traditionally, the chief’s palace is located at Damakasuwa Chawai which is the headquarters for central administration with six districts. These districts include: Damakasuwa that covers villages as Kichiguya, Rafingora, Mangul and Kisari. The second District is Zambina with its headquarters at Ungwan Makama Chawai; it covers villages as Badurum, Kurmi Riga and Rana. The third district is Faden Chawai, and it covers villages as Kibobi, Talo and Riban. The fourth Pari with its headquarter at Kiffin Chawai, and it covers villages as Kiffin and Pari.</p> <p>The fifth district is Kamaru with its headquarter at Kizakor and it covers villages as Kamaru, Kihoba, Kuyanboro and Kizakoro, the sixth district is Bakin Kogi. These districts heads are, however, supported by a number of village Heads within their domains. The village Heads also reports to the district heads and the Ward Head is popularly known as Mai’angwa in their tradition.</p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>Genetic Classification of Atsam.</strong></p> <p>The idea that groups of languages that share certain systematic resemblances have inherited those similarities from a common origin is the basis for genetic classifications.</p> <p>Ruhlen (1987) describes Genetic classification as a form of a tree diagram showing the origin of a language from a common ancestor, and it is related to each other genetically to other languages. Atsam language belongs to the platoid group of languages under Benue-Congo group of Niger-Congo phylum of Niger-Kordofanian language family of African languages. </p> <p>The language family is represented below:</p> <p>                             <strong>AFRICA</strong></p> <p>                                                                                                 </p> <div> <p>Fantsuam    Gong          Kore           Atsam           Tyap        Piti Atsam    Jjuu       </p> </div><p>    </p> <p>Adapted from (Blench, 1992:94).</p> <p><strong>1.3.1  </strong><strong>Geographical Location Of Atsam</strong></p> <p>Today, the Atsam Community are in Kauru Local Government of Kaduna State and they are also in Lare, Zangon Kataf and also in PlateuState. Zangon Kataf is about 5 kilometers distance from Atsam.</p> <p>          Apart from the Atsam people, there are other neighboring communities that can speak Atsam language like Hausa people, Pari people and Rahama Chawai, people that are living in Atsam, Kataf and Zango.</p> <p>          The populations of Atsam people are about 30,000 as of the 2006 census.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.4       </strong><strong>Scope and Organization of the study.</strong></p> <p>This project research describes the Atsam Verb Phrase. Its examines the structure of verb phrase in Atsam language and the processes involved in the verb phrase constructions. This processes and examples are analyzed using the model of Government and Binding theory. This research work is organized into five chapters.</p> <p>Chapter one introduces the general and the historical background. Also in this chapter, the sociolinguistic profile of the people and genetic classification of the language are presented, it gives a brief discussion of the theoretical frame work adopted in the long essay and explains the mode of data collection and the analysis.</p> <p>Chapter two discusses the basic syntactic concepts, like phrase structure rules, lexical categories basic word order as well as the types of sentence in Atsam language.</p> <p>Chapter three focuses on the Atsam Verb phrase which is the main target of this research. In chapter four, we discussed the transformational processes that involve verb phrases in Atsam language.</p> <p>Chapter five gives the summary of the work with recommendations and the conclusion of the study.</p> <p><strong>1.5       </strong><strong>Theoretical Framework.</strong></p> <p>Theories have been set up for analyzing language data to enhance a systematic account of the linguistic presentation of knowledge of a native speaker of a language, such theories are used in theoretical frame work for analysis of data in a language. These include: Traditional or classical Grammar, Transformational Generative Grammar, Government and Binding Theory, Structural or Taxonomic Grammar, Systemic Grammar and Minimalist Programme. The framework used in analyzing Atsam language data is Government and Binding Theory, which is otherwise known as principles and parameters theory, also referred to as modular deductive theory of grammar. It has been chosen because it shows the structure of different phrases in all the languages. It tries to capture similarities in all languages by assigning the same structure to them.</p> <p><strong>1.6       </strong><strong>Data Collection.</strong></p> <p>The data collected for this research work was through the help of an informant, a complete native speaker of Atsam language, with the use of ‘Ibadan list of 400 basic items’. The list covers the vocabulary items of parts of the body and food items, among others. Frame technique was also used in collecting various phrases in the language. This method enables us to study the word order system as well as to syntactic processes in Atsam language. Tape recorded was used as a back up to these methodologies and the informant Mr. Magaji Sunday, a native of Kauru in KadunaState.</p> <p><strong>1.7       </strong><strong>Data Analysis</strong></p> <p>Data analysis is the implementation of discovery what it entails in the language under study and it is based on the production of forms by the speaker.</p> <p>This work will be analyzing the data using the model of “Government and Binding Theory” with its sub-theories by exemplifying Verb Phrases and the transformations.</p> <p><strong>1.8    Brief Review of the Government and Binding Theory</strong></p> <p>This theory is an off-shoot of traditional or classical grammar (Sanusi, 1996:19). According to cook (1988:30), Government and Binding theory elaborates syntactic levels through the concept of movement. This theory explains the universal Grammar as introduced by Chomsky (1981). Government and Binding theory is a modular deductive theory of grammar that posits multiple levels of representation related by a transformation rule called “move alpha (a)” (Radford, 1988:401).</p> <p>          The modules of grammar is also known as sub-theories, they are related in a modular form and sub-theories of Government and Binding theory are: X – bar theory, Binding theory, Bounding theory and Control theory, these sub-theories embodies the different principles and parameters (Cook, 1988:159). The interrelationship of sub-theories of Government and Binding Theory:</p> <p>                   <strong>X-BAR THEORY</strong></p> <p>                   </p> <div> <p>DEEP STRUCTURE</p> </div><p>            </p> <div> <p>PROJECTION PRINCIPLE</p> </div><p>           </p> <p>(Adapted from sells (1985) and Cook (1988)).</p> <p><strong>1.8.1 The X-Bar Theory (X-Theory)</strong></p> <p>The X-bar theory was first introduced in his grammatical analysis by Chomsky (1970), in his article entitled ‘Remarks on Nomination’. The X-bar theory is designed to formalize the tradition notion called ‘head’ of a construction and constraint to range of possible phrase structures rules. The heart of the system is the recognition that the lexical categories: Noun, Verb, Adjective, Preposition are the heads and the project of other phrasal nodes Np, Vp, Adjp, and Pp respectively.</p> <p> </p> <div> <p>XII</p> </div><p>    </p> <p>          According to Ayankogbe (2002:21), X-bar theory is essentially a theory of syntactic categories: according to which for any category X, there is fixed hierarchy of units. As proposed in Chomsky (1986). X-bar convention states that every maximal projection has a specifier of XP position with one Intermediate bar projection serving as the XP’s core. This core consists of head (XO) and the complement, which is maximal projection in itself.</p> <p> </p> <div> <p>XI</p> </div><p>      </p>\n\nTHE ATSAM VERB PHRASE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ATSAM VERB PHRASE", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE KÀNÍNGKÓN NOUN PHRASE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>. General Background</strong>     </p> <p>      This research work focuses on the Noun phrase of Kaningkon language. However, this chapter introduces us to the language understudy, Kaningkon language. It also introduces us to the socio-cultural profile of the speakers of the language; the culture and beliefs, occupation, mode of greetings, the common foods of the people and the geographical location of the language.  </p> <p>      This chapter will also examine the scope and organization of the work, Method of data collection, Data Analysis, Genetic classification and the theoretical framework chosen for the analysis of the research.</p> <p><strong>1.1. Historical Background</strong></p> <p>      Kaningkon language has several other alternate names like; Kaningdom Nindem, Kaninkon, Kaninkon-Nindem, Ninkyob-Nindem and Ninkyop. Kaningkon language is one of the languages spoken in jema’a local government area of Kaduna state, Nigeria ( Ethnologue, 2009). The towns where the language is spoken in jema’a local government include the following; Gértì,  Àgúáférí, Bàkín-Kogí, Béíshòp, Gósíkà, Àmèrè, Nìndèm and Zànkán. The speakers of kaningkon language are about 12,000 as at 2008 (Ethnologue, 2009).  Oral tradition has it that the speakers of the language are normally referred to as Ninkyop among themselves, which means rich person. Kaningkon people are said to have migrated from a place called Àngòláfò in the present day Katsina state of Nigeria. They are settled today in villages in Jema’a local government of Kaduna state, Nigeria. The villages include; Gértì, Àgúáférí, Bàkín-Kogí, Béíshòp, Gósíkà, Nìndèm, Àmèrè and Zànkán</p> <p>      Despite the fact that they are scattered in different villages, they still see themselves as one. They have a festival called Dunde Ninkyop that they usually celebrate together up till date. They are always proud to be referred to as Ninkyop </p> <p>      The speakers are still proud of their language and tribe. However, the language is not normally used in the church where there are other languages. It is not also being used as a means of instruction in both primary and post primary schools. The lingua franca is Hausa language.</p> <p>1.2. <strong>Geographical location        </strong>                                                      </p> <p>          Kaningkon is spoken in Jema’a local government of Kaduna state, Nigeria. Jema’a local government is located in Kaduna state  between the latitude of 9° 11°and 9° 30°N and on the longitude of 8°  00° and 8° 30°E. Kaningkon is located in the southwestern part of Jema’a local government.  Kaningkon shared boundary with Kagoma in the south, Maigizo in the east, Godogodo in the west, kafanchan in the north and Nassarawa state in the south. Below is the Jema’a local government map showing Kaningkon.     </p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p> <strong>Fig 1.1:</strong>     MAP OF JEMA’A LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOWING                        KANINGKON </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <strong><em>    Source</em></strong>:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jema’a</p> <p><strong>1.3. Socio-cultural Profile.</strong></p> <p>      This unit shall focus on the socio-cultural profile of Kaningkon people. These shall include; the festival, marriage ceremony, occupation, mode of dressing, mode of greeting, administration, food and tourism attraction.</p> <p><strong>1.3.1. The festival of the Kaningkon people</strong></p> <p>      The oral tradition also reveals that the only festival common to the Kaningkon people is called Dúndè Ninkyop. This festival started in the year 1999 after the crisis that claimed a lot of lives. The crisis occurred among the Kaningkon people in April, 1999. According to oral tradition Dúndè Ninkyóp is celebrated every year to appease god. It is used to seek forgiveness over the sin of the 1999 crisis.</p> <p>      The ceremony lasted for three days. It usually started on the last Friday of April with fasting and prayer. On Saturday there will be prayer session followed by cultural dancing. The Saturday celebration will end with feasting among the celebrants and well wishers. On Sunday which is the third day, everybody will go to church for prayer and thanksgiving, because they are predominantly Christians. This festival usually attracts people from in and outside the country. Governors, senators, business men and women, even the president are usually the guests. </p> <p>  Prior to the 1999 crisis, the festival that are rampart are chieftaincy title, coronation, funeral ceremony and marriage ceremony.</p> <p>1.3.2. <strong>Administration among the Kaningkon people</strong></p> <p>      The head of the Kaningkon is called Tum Ninkyóp. He is one of the autonomous chiefdom in Kaduna state. He is supported by chiefs.</p> <p><strong>1.3.3. Religion of the Kaningkon people.</strong></p> <p>       The religion that is common to the Kaningkon people is Christianity.</p> <p><strong>1.3.4. Mode of dressing </strong></p> <p>      The dressing of the Kaningkon people is unique. This is because for a Kaningkon man to be completely dressed, he must put on a cap, a short sleeve and a nicker.</p> <p><strong>1.3.5. Marriage ceremony among Kaningkon people</strong></p> <p>  Just like any other African people, there is dating and courtship period among the Kaningkon people. Oral tradition has it that, the most interesting aspect of their marriage is the traditional aspect of the marriage.</p> <p>   The groom’s family will pay dowries to the bride’s family when the groom announces his intention to marry a particular girl. The dowries include; goats, fowls and wine. The elders will be invited from both the bride’s and groom’s family to pray for the couple. Traditional dance will then follow. They will thereafter proceed to the church for prayer and thanksgiving.</p> <p><strong>1.3.6. Occupation of the Kaningkon people</strong></p> <p>     The dominant occupation of the Kaningkon people is farming. The farming is for both subsistence and commercial purpose. Every members of the family is involved in the farm work.</p> <p>     The major crop they grow include rógo (cassava), chó (corn), pitat (guinea corn), and dóya (yam).</p> <p><strong>1.3.7. Greetings among the Kaningkon people.</strong></p> <p>            The mode of greetings of the Kaningkon people is honorific in nature. The younger people will kneel for the elders when they are greeting them. Some of their greetings are.</p> <p>Wáà súnà          ‘good morning’</p> <p>Yáà nsórí            ‘good afternoon’</p> <p><strong>1.3.8. Common food among Kaningkon people.</strong></p> <p>       The common food that the Kaningkon people cherished most is ‘Túo’. This is made from chó (corn) flour.</p> <p>Other foods include rógo (cassava), pitat (guinea corn) and dóya (yam). These foods are grown in large quantity in the area.</p> <p><strong>1.3.9. Tourist attractions of Kaningkon people.</strong></p> <p>       The only tourist attraction that usually brings people from far and near to Kaningkon kingdom is called Dúndè Nínkyòp. The celebration of Dúndè Nínkyòp attracts people from all works of life to their kingdom. Governors, senators, top government workers, business men and women are always the guests. It also attracts people from outside Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4. Sociolinguistic profile of Kaningkon language</strong></p> <p>Oha (2009) defines sociolinguistics as the study of the relationship between language and society, of language variation, and of attitudes about language. Kaningkon language is one of the several languages spoken in Jema’a local government of Kaduna state, Nigeria. The language is being used among the native speakers within themselves. The attitude of the native speakers towards the language is positive. The language is the language of communication in any social gathering that involves only the Kaningkon people. Such gatherings include political gathering, village meeting, naming ceremony, funeral ceremony and so on. The language is socially active within the native speakers. This is the only hope that is saving the language from death.</p> <p>      However, wherever the language has contact with other languages like Ayu, Yeskwa, Anib, Fyem languages and so on, in the same local government, the preferred language is usually Hausa which is their lingual Franca. Kaningkon language does not have wider coverage. That is, it does not extend beyond the region (Jema’a local government of Kaduna state, Nigeria).</p> <p><strong>  1.5. Genetic Classification of Kaningkon Language</strong></p> <p>         Genetic relationship is the usual term for the relationship which exists between languages that are members of the same language family (Wikipedia, 2008). Kaningkon language belongs to Southwestern Platoid language under the Benue-Congo a sub-family of Niger-Congo language family (Blench, 1998). This can be diagrammatically represented thus:</p> <p><br/></p> <p>                                                       AFRICA</p> <p>     Niger-Congo               Khoisa                  Nilo-saharan           Afroasiatic    </p> <p>West        mande            kru      Benue-Congo   Adamawa          Kwa                 Gur</p> <p>                                                                                       Eastern</p> <p> Junkunoid                   Platoid                            Bantoid                            Cross- river</p> <p> Tarokoid</p> <p>                          Southern  Western  Northern    North       Eastern     Southwestern</p> <p>                                                                                   Eastern</p> <p>             Legeri          Ningye      KANINGKON            Che            Hasha         Sanga   </p> <p><strong><em>   Fig 1.2   Adapted from Blench (1998).           </em></strong></p> <p><strong>1.6. Scope and organization of the study</strong></p> <p>This research work focuses on the noun phrase of Kaningkon language. The whole work shall consist of five chapters in all. The chapters are divided as follows.</p> <p>      Chapter one shall focus on the introduction to the work. Under this chapter, we shall examine the general background, the historical background, geographical location, sociocultural profile and the genetic classification of the language. The chapter shall further examine the scope and organization of the study, the theoretical framework, data collection and analysis. We shall also review briefly, the chosen theoretical framework.</p> <p>      Chapter two shall focus on the basic phonological and syntactical concepts of Kaningkon language. Under these, we shall be examining the sound inventory and syllable structure of the language. We shall also look at syntactic concepts like phrase structure rules, lexical categories, phrasal categories, basic word orders and sentences.</p> <p>      Chapter three shall examine the noun phrase of Kaningkon language which is the focus of this work. We shall examine the position of noun within the Noun phrase, such as the modification of Noun phrase by adjective, determiner and preposition. The chapter shall also look at the syntactic roles of Noun phrase in a sentence.</p> <p>      In chapter four, we shall focus on the transformation processes such relativisation, negation, question formation and reflexivisation.</p> <p>      Chapter five shall give the summary and conclusion of the work. This chapter shall also include the recommendation that is relevant to the development of the language.</p> <p><strong>1.7. Theoretical framework </strong></p> <p>      According to Sanusi(1996:18 ), some of the earlier formal theories of grammar that have been developed and used as methodological tools for analyzing language data include the following; Traditional or Classic Grammar, Structural or Taxonomic Grammar, Systemic Grammar, Transformational Generative Grammar (TGG) and Government and Binding (GB) theory. Such theories are used as theoretical framework or methodological tools for analyzing language data (Sanusi, 1996)</p> <p>      The Government and Binding (GB) theory shall be used in this work to analyze the noun phrase of Kaningkon language. Government and Binding theory is chosen because; it seeks to capture the similarities between different categories of lexical phrases by assigning the same structure to them (Cheryl, 1999:5). We shall examine the Government and Binding theory in details subsequently</p> <p><strong>1.8. Data Collection</strong></p> <p>    There are two types of data collection, the informant method and introspective method (Sanusi, 1996:15). The method used in collecting data for this work is informant method. Informant method is a method whereby a native speaker of the language under study provides relevant linguistic information about his language (Sanusi, 1996:15). Our informant is Mr. Williams, Emmanuel. He is a native of Àmèrè in Jema’a local government of Kaduna state, Nigeria. He is thirty years old. He spent nineteen years in his home town. He works with Nigerian police force in Ilorin.</p> <p>      We make use of ‘Ibadan wordlist of 400basic items’. In addition to this, frame technique was also used. Frame technique is a technical word for sentences prepared in English to get syntactical structure of the language understudy (crystal, 2008). Unstructured oral interview were also used in collecting data. This is to enable us get detail information about the sociocultural profile of the language.</p> <p><strong>1.9. Data analysis</strong></p> <p>      The data in this work were taken from the informant and analysed using the Government and Binding theory. The Kaningkon noun phrase will be critically analysed using the theory mentioned above.</p> <p><strong>1.10. Brief review of the chosen framework.</strong></p> <p>Government and binding theory has been chosen as the framework for the analysis of Kaningkon noun phrase. Government and Binding (GB) theory was introduced by Chomsky (1981). The theory explains the universal Grammar. Udofot (2009:146) explains that Government and Binding theory is an advanced form of universal grammar. According to Udofot (2009), it is a more generalized model of grammar. It studies the grammar of languages in general, not individual language grammar.</p> <p>          According to Radford (1988:401), Government and Binding theory is a modular deductive theory of grammar that posits multiple levels of representation related by a transformational ‘move alpha’ (move α). Cheryl (1999:5) claims that GB seeks to capture the similarities between different categories of lexical phrases by assigning the same structure to them. According to Udofot (2009:149), as a result of the organization of GB into modules, GB is said to have modular character.</p> <p>      Government and Binding theory is organized into sub-theories more technically known as modules. Horrocks (1987:29) opines that, the core grammar of a given language is derived from the interaction of sub-theories of universal grammar. These sub-theories are inter-related that each of them can account for grammaticality and ungrammaticality of any sentence. </p> <p>    The sub theories (modules) of Government and Binding theories are; x-bar (x') theory, bounding theory, government theory, theta theory (θ-theory), case theory, binding theory and control theory. We can graphically represent the interaction between the sub-theories of Government and Binding as follow, as adapted by Yusuf (1998:23) from sell (1985) and cook (1988).</p> <p><br/></p> <p>                                        <strong>  X- Bar theory</strong></p> <p> </p> <div> <p>              D-STRUCTURE</p> </div><p> </p> <div> <p>Case filter</p> </div><p> </p> <div> <p>S- STRUCTURE</p> </div><p> </p> <div> <p>PHONETIC FORM</p> </div><p> </p> <div> <p>LOGICAL FORM</p> </div><p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Projection</strong></p> <p><strong>                                     D - STRUCTURE           </strong><strong>principle</strong></p> <p><strong>                                      Move </strong><strong>α                       </strong><strong>LEXICON</strong></p> <p><strong>                                 (</strong>Bounding<strong>)</strong></p> <p><strong> Case theory          S – STRUC                   ϴ-</strong><strong>THEORY</strong></p> <p><strong>Case filter                </strong>ECP                                                              (ϴ- Criterion)</p> <p>                                                   CONTROL </p> <p>                                                          BINDING</p> <p><strong><em>Fig 1.3.  Modules of grammar :( adapted from sells (1985) and cook (1988)).</em></strong></p> <p>We shall briefly explain these modules as follow:</p> <p><strong>1.10.1. The x-Bar Theory (X'-Theory)</strong></p> <p>       Akmajian et al (2008:215) says that the basic idea of x-bar is that phrasal categories (eg VP, PP, NP, AP) all have heads that belong to the same category as the phrasal category. The core of the x-bar theory is the acknowledgement of the lexical categories such as Noun, Verb, Prepositions, Adjective, as the head of phrase. This head projects to their phrasal categories like Noun phrase (NP), Verb phrase (VP), Prepositional phrase (PP), Adjective phrase (AP). The head of the projection is zero (X°). Heads are terminal nodes. They dominate words.</p> <p>    Haegeman (1994:105) explains that X' theory distinguishes two further levels of projection. Complements combines with X to form X' projection; adjuncts combines with X' to form X' projections. Specifier combines with the topmost X' to form the maximal projection XP (Haegeman, 1994:105).</p> <p>  In X' theory node will continue to reduce from phrasal category to give the final satellites on the node.                   </p> <p>                                                   XP</p> <p>                                 Spec                             X'</p> <p>                                                    X'                             Adjunct</p> <p>                               X°                       Complement</p> <p><strong><em> Fig 1: Adapted from Yusuf (1998:33).</em></strong></p> <p>      In the above schemata, X can be taken as the variable, which represents the lexical category (such as noun, verb, preposition etc), XP is the maximal projection that stands for the lexical categories, noun, verb, adjective or preposition which are the head of their phrases. XP projects to specifier and X’. X’ projects to X' and an adjunct. And finally projects to X° (zero bar) and complement. The XP is the maximal projection, while the X’ is the intermediate projection and the Xº is the zero bar level which is the lexical category.  We can exemplify this using a Noun phrase in Kaningkon language.</p> <p>1.   [ róm se gɔgɔgɔ ].</p> <p>Man  art   tall. </p> <p>‘The tall man’.</p> <p>                               NP</p> <p>                  Spec                                              N'                 </p> <p>                   Det                                N                            Adj p</p> <p>                                                                  Det                     Adj '</p> <p>           Ø                               róm               se                         gɔgɔgɔ</p> <p>                                             Man             the                          tall</p> <p>‘The tall man’.</p> <p>      In the above example, N' [róm] ‘man’ head the phrase and Adjp is its adjunct.</p> <p>     In Transformational Generative Grammar (TGG), the phrase structure rule is.</p> <p> S→ NP AUX VP</p> <p>But under X-bar, a sub-theory of Government and Binding theory, the phrase structure rule is as follow.</p> <p>   CP→ Spec C'</p> <p>  C' → C IP</p> <p>  IP→ Spec I'</p> <p>  I' → I VP   </p> <p> VP → Spec V'</p> <p> V' → V (NP)(PP)(Adv P)  (Lamidi, 2000).</p> <p><strong>    1.10.2. The Theta Theory (θ- Theory)</strong></p> <p>     Okolo (2008:78) says that the function of θ- theory is to explain how syntactic structure determines the assignment of θ-role to a particular constituent of a sentence. In other words, θ-theory shows θ-roles as assigned to the argument of a sentence. A θ-role assigned to a constituent within the predicate (verb phrase) is called internal θ-role while a θ-role assigned to the subject of a sentence or outside the predicate (verb phrase) is called an external θ-role (Cheryl, 1999). The internal θ-role is an internal argument while the external θ-role is an external argument. The role assigned to a noun by the verb is the thematic relation between the noun and the verb. Argument is the noun phrase in a sentence, the subject noun phrase and the object noun phrase. The Object Noun Phrase is the Direct and the Indirect object. For example,</p> <p>  [ róm zá sir mu kàsúwá ].</p> <p>   Man buy yam in market.</p> <p>  ‘The man bought yam in the market’.</p> <p>                         [ róm zá sir mu            kàsúwá ]</p> <p>              Subject   direct object   indirect object.</p> <p>     The following are the common theta roles; Agent, Patient, Source, Instrument, Goal, Locative, Theme, Benefactive and Experiencer (Yusuf, 1998).</p> <p>A.  <strong>Agent</strong>: the agent θ-role is an actor that performs the action in a sentence eg.</p> <p>     [ aúdù wῦ  jŏn ].</p> <p>     Aúdù  kill goat.</p> <p>  ‘Aúdù killed the goat’.</p> <p>Aúdù is the actor (agent) in the above sentence.</p> <p>B.  <strong>Patient</strong>: the patient role suffers the action in the sentence. Eg.</p> <p>                        [ bàlá ru ɣwamù ].</p> <p>                         Bàlá beat wife.</p> <p>                      ‘bàlá beats his wife’</p> <p>           [ ɣwamù ] ‘Wife’, suffers the action.</p> <p>C.  <strong>Source</strong>: this is the entity from which motion takes place.</p> <p>   [bàlá ru ɣwamù pε jɔ∫ɔ ].</p> <p> Bàlá beat wife at meet.</p> <p>‘Bàlá beat his wife at the meeting’.</p> <p>[ jɔ∫ɔ] ‘Meeting’ is the entity from which the motion took place.</p> <p>D.  <strong>Instrument</strong>: this is the object with which an action is performed.</p> <p>   [ verom wῦ jŏn to zig ]</p> <p>   Boy  kill goat with knife.</p> <p> ‘The boy killed the goat with knife’.</p> <p>[zig] ‘Knife’ is the instrument in the above example.</p> <p>E.  <strong>Goal</strong>: this is the entity towards which motion takes place.</p> <p>[ járo tà wáse sε<strong>ᵑ </strong>].</p> <p>Yáro give him basket.</p> <p>‘Yáro gave him the basket’.</p> <p>[ sε<strong>ᵑ</strong>] ‘Basket’ is the goal in the sentence.</p> <p><strong>      F.</strong> <strong>Benefactive</strong>: benefactive is assigned to an object in whose favour an event takes place.</p> <p>   [ róm zá mi fufum ].</p> <p>  Husband buy me flower.</p>\n\nTHE KÀNÍNGKÓN NOUN PHRASE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE KÀNÍNGKÓN NOUN PHRASE", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>THE KOFYAR NOUN PHRASE</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     General Background</strong></p> <p>Language is the fabrics that ties every member of the society together, which serves as an instrument used by man, for specific and distinguishable purpose. </p> <p>          Indeed the focus of this research is to shed light, on how noun phrases are formed in Kofyar language.

However, the Ibadan four hundred words list, and some sentence, construction, are used to extract necessary information. From the language speaker, the method of collection, was through direct translation from English to Kofyar language.</p> <p>However bi-lingual approach was used because, the informants speaks more than two language, which includes English, Kofyar and Hausa Language more so the informant are native speaker of Kofyar Language.</p> <p><strong>1.7     Data Analysis</strong></p> <p>In order to have accurate analysis, for this research Ibadan four hundred word list, with equivalent meaning in Kofyar language was used. Also the frame technique used in this research is framing sentence, in English and translated to Kofyar language, with the assistance of an information.</p> <p>          This enable the researcher to determine, the actual underlying form, of a word, constituent and possible syntactic classes to which each word belong to in Kofyar, language.</p> <p><strong>1.8     Review of the Chosen Framework</strong></p> <p>Government and binding theory (GB) will be the analysis of noun phrase, in Kofyar language.

Also, it introduces to us the genetic classification of Mernyang, scope and organization of the study, including the theoretical framework. Method of data collection and analysis, as well as the review of the chosen framework are also examined. This study focuses on the aspects of Mernyang Noun Phrase. Mernyang is a language spoken in Qua’anpan local government of Plateau state.</p> <p>Therefore, the areas covered in this study are the sound, tonal and syllable inventories of the language, as well as some syntactic concepts such as phrase structure rules, basic word order, lexical categories and sentence types. Also, transformational processes, which are focusing, question formation and relativization are discussed.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       </strong><strong>Historical Background</strong></p> <p>Going by oral tradition, the Mernyang people originated from a man known as ‘Dafyar’. Dafyar and his sister, Nade, left Dala in Kano and settled in ‘Kopfubum’ near the present day Kofyar. Since then, Dafyar and his offspring, which were fourteen (14) in number have scattered all over Plateau State. One of the sons of Dafyar known as ‘Darep Soekoeto’ founded the ‘Kwa’ settlement where the speakers of Mernyang language are concentrated today. Since then, Darep had been giving birth to children who are also producing sons and daughters. The current total population of the speakers of Mernyang is 10,000 (Nigeria census, 2005).</p> <p>The speakers are officially known as the pan people, including their language, but locally referred to as Mernyang.</p> <p>The diagram below shows the geographical location of the Mernyang people on the map of Qua’anpan local government.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.2       </strong><strong>Socio-cultural profile</strong></p> <p>Going by oral tradition, the speakers of Mernyang language have their own unique way of life that are discussed below:</p> <p><strong>1.2.1  </strong><strong>Marriage System</strong></p> <p>Following oral tradition, the marriage system of the people is stage by stage. At first, the boy will take two jars of ‘Brukutu’ to the girl’s parents in order to seek their hands in marriage. After this, the parents of the boy would be asked to supply the following items: goat, chicken, palm oil, salt, magi and benny seed. Once these items are accepted the boy is free to take his wife home.</p> <p>The last stage involves conducting the marriage ceremony either in the church or mosque depending on the religions of the couple.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2  </strong><strong>Festivals</strong></p> <p>Going by oral history, there are two major festivals observed among the speakers. The first one is known as the ‘pan’ day, which is done once in a year. During this event, a lot of social dances and musical presentations are done, among which are sual, koem, feer etc.</p> <p>The second festival is observed by the districts. Each district has its peculiar way of celebrating its own. Also, a lot of social activities are put in place in order to entertain the audience.</p> <p><strong>1.2.3  </strong><strong>Religion</strong></p> <p>Following oral tradition, idol worshipping was the only religion of the people in the past. But, today, Christianity and Islam are practised. There are few Christians and the existence of festival celebrations.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4  </strong><strong>Occupation</strong></p> <p>Following oral tradition, the major occupation of Mernyang people is farming. They plant millet and guinea corn which are the main sources of their foods. However, others still engage in fishing and hunting as their occupations.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.2.5  </strong><strong>Mode of dressing</strong></p><p> The speakers of Mernyang language are typically dressed in their native ‘agbada’ with the popular ‘aburo’ cap. Their women are mostly dressed in their ‘iro’ and ‘buba’ with ‘gele’ </p> <p><strong>1.2.6  </strong><strong>Food</strong></p> <p>Going by oral tradition, the favourite foods of the people are millet and guinea corn. Their common food is known as ‘chugum’ made from millet and guinea corn and grounded with other items. Their favourite drink is ‘brukutu’</p> <p><strong>1.2.7  </strong><strong>Mode of kingship</strong></p> <p>The traditional system of rulership among the Mernyang is by monarchy. The choice of who becomes the next king is usually determined by election from the royal family. The king makers have to test the competence of the elected candidate and make him the next king who then becomes the paramount ruler of the land.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>Genetic classification</strong></p> <p>Greenberg (1966:8) maintains that African languages belong to various families, and there are four main groups namely, Niger-Kordofanian, Nilo-sahara, Afro-Asiatic and khoisan.</p> <p>The Mernyang language is classified under the Benue Congo, belonging to the group of plateau.

The work is divided into five chapters.</p> <p>The first chapter introduces the general background of the study as well as the history and socio-cultural profile of the people. Also, genetic classification of Mernyang, scope and organization of study, including the brief review of the chosen framework were discussed. The chapter also focuses on the method of data collection and analysis.</p> <p>The second chapter examines some phonological concepts such as sound, tonal and syllable inventories of Mernyang.

This is because it tries to capture similarities among different phrases by assigning to them the same structure. The Government and Binding theory model is examined in detail in section 1.9</p> <p><strong>1.6       </strong><strong>Data collection</strong></p> <p>The data for this research work was collected using the informant method, with the use of Ibadan word list of 400 basic items as well as the frame technique. The frame technique consists of phrasal and sentential constructions in English, which were directly translated to Mernyang language.</p> <p>Below are brief information about the informants used:</p> <p><strong>Informant 1</strong></p> <p>Name:                                     Mr. Amos Datugun</p> <p>Home town and residence:  Kwa</p> <p>Native language:                            Mernyang</p> <p>Other languages:                  English and Hausa</p> <p>Age:                                        40 years</p> <p><strong>Informant 2</strong></p> <p>Name:                                     Mr. Daman Naankam</p> <p>Home town and residence:  Kwa</p> <p>Native language:                            Mernyang</p> <p>Other languages:                            English and Hausa</p> <p>Age:                                        48 years</p> <p><strong>1.7       </strong><strong>Data analysis</strong></p> <p>The analysis of the data obtained was based on the Ibadan word list of 400 basic items and the frame technique.</p> <p>Therefore, the data will be analysed using the “Government and Binding” model i.e. the different structures of Noun Phrase and their transformations would be exemplified using the different sub-theories of GB.</p> <p><strong>1.8       </strong><strong>Brief review of the Government and Binding Theory</strong></p> <p>Haegeman (1991:13) regarded Government and Binding theory as a theory of universal grammar, which is the system of all the principles that are common to all the languages. GB theory is otherwise known as principles and parameters theory. In GB theory, the grammar is a continuous interaction between components and sub-theories embodying different principles and parameters (Cook, 1988:31).</p> <p>According to Cook (1988:30), “Government and Binding theory elaborates syntactic levels through the concept of movement”. Radford (1988) describes Government and Binding theory as a modular deductive theory of grammar that posits multiple levels pf representation related by a transformational rule called “move alpha(  )”.</p> <p>Also, Sanusi (1996) says that, GB theory greatly eliminates proliferation of transformational rules, like: passive, affix-hopping, verb-number agreement, question formation, equi-NP deletion, raising, permutation, insertion etc.</p> <p>Government and Binding theory operates through the seven modules of grammar, which include X-bar theory, theta theory, case theory, government theory, binding theory, bounding theory and control theory. These sub-theories, according to Horrocks (1987:29), “are interrelated that each of them can account for grammaticality and ungrammaticality of any sentence”.</p> <p>The diagram below shows the interrelationship among the sub-theories of Government and Binding theory.</p> <p> </p> <div> <p>PROJECTION</p> <p>PRINCIPLE</p> </div><p>    X-BAR THEORY </p> <p>                              </p> <p> </p> <div> <p>LEXICON</p> </div><p>    D-STRUCTURE </p> <p>                   </p> <p>     Move – α</p> <p> </p> <div> <p>Ө - THEORY </p> <p>(Ө - CRITERION)</p> </div><p>    </p> <p>                       (Bounding)</p> <p>Case theory</p><p> (case filter)                               S-STRUCTURE </p> <p>ECP</p> <p>CONTROL</p> <p>BINDING</p> <p>PHONETIC FORM                         LOGICAL FORM</p><p> <strong>Figure 2: Modules of Grammar</strong> </p> <p>(Adapted from Sells (1985) and Cook (1988)).</p> <p><strong>1.8.1  </strong><strong>X-bar theory</strong></p> <p>According to Welbelbum (1995:18), “the X-bar theory is the central module of the principles and parameters approach in syntax”. The X-bar theory is designed to formalize the traditional notion called ‘head’ of a construction and to constrain the range of possible phrase structure rules. It is the part of grammar regulating the structure of a phrase (Haegeman, 1994).</p> <p>The central core of X-bar theory is the recognition of the fact that (most) phrasal constituents have ‘heads’ upon which the other elements of the constituents in question are dependent (Horrocks, 1987:63).</p> <p>As proposed by Chomsky (1970), the X-bar theory convention states that every maximal projection has a specifier of XP position with the intermediate bar projection serving as the XP’s core. The core consists of the head (X0) and the complement, which can be maximal projection in itself.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>                   X11</p> <p>                   </p>\n\nTHE MERNYANG NOUN PHRASE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE MERNYANG NOUN PHRASE", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>VERB PHRASE IN KURAMA</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is on the aspect of the syntax of Kurama language. By Syntax we mean the branch of linguistic analysis which involves the branch of linguistic analysis which involves the arrangement of words to form grammatical sentences in a rule governed way.</p> <p>Syntax is also the study of the way in which different meaningful units of language can be constructed and combined to form larger units such as sentences and the interrelationships of  the these larger constructions. According to Yishai Tobin (1990) it should be noted that there are many aspects of syntax but this research work will specifically focus on the verb phrase of Kurama Language.</p> <p>A phrase could be described as a group of words that form an integral part of a sentence. There are different types of phrasal categories, for example; Verb, Noun, Prepositional, Adjectival, Adverbial Phrases e.t.c. Each phrasal category is headed by its name. A Verb Phrase is headed by a Verb which may also have many satellites.</p> <p>         In this chapter, we will look at the historical background of the language, sociolinguistic profile under which we shall discuss the marriage, religion, mode of dressing, occupation, festival, language status, the location as well as genetic classification of the language. The research methodology used is the frametechnique while government and binding theory is used to analyze Kurama verb phrase.</p> <p><strong>1.1        </strong><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF KURAMA PEOPLE</strong></p> <p>The tribe known generally as Kurama, but who call themselves the Akurmi (singular Bukurmi) or the north and the North-West of the Katab in the Zaria provinces. They number between 11,000 and 12,000 persons, and are administered by the Emir of Zaria.</p> <p>         They claim a traditional collection with Kano, and in proof of this claim assert that the Kurmi market at Kano derived its name from them (Viz the Akurmi). The more learned among them that is those most influenced by contact with the Muslims, profess to be able to trace the wanderings of the tribe back to the time when they dwelt at Medina.</p> <p>         There in the early days of Islam the tribe was partially exterminated as a punishment for their habit of giving false measures of corn. The more honourable among them were allowed to depart, and came to Bornu, where they dwelt for 730 years.</p> <p>         Thereafter they proceeded to Kano, and occupied the Dala district of  the city for 431 years, being driven out by the Kutumbawa, some say for refusing to accept Islam, others for refusing to give their daughters in marriage to the Kutumbawa who were not prepared to perform the marriage rites.</p> <p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>SOCIOLINGUISTIC PROFILE</strong></p> <p>The language (Kurama) is used as a means of communication in the market and it is also used in teaching primary school. The language is spoken in many town in Kaduna and Kano States, some of which are; Ikara, Saminaka, Tudunwada etc.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1    MARRIAGE</strong></p> <p>         The normal mode of obtaining a wife among the Kurama people is through agricultural service whereby the husband to be will labour on the farm for the father of the bride. The man will also make cash available and other payment to the girl’s parent or guardians.</p> <p>A bride price of 40,000 - 60,000 cowries, one basket of rice, one pot of honey, these gifts were given during the concluding or final rites. Intermarriage with close relatives of the mother is prohibited by tribal custom.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2    RELIGION</strong></p> <p>Muhammadanism is spreading and those who have not embraced it practice a lackadaisical form of ancestor worship in which, as so often among the Semi-Bantu speaking tribes.</p> <p><strong>1.2.3    MODE OF DRESSING</strong></p> <p>Dressing is an important aspect of any culture. Your dressing will speak for you that is the tribe that you belong to.</p> <p>The Kurama people dress according to oral history, like the Hausas.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4    LANGUAGE STATUS</strong></p> <p>Kurama language is spoken in the northern part of Nigeria. The population of the speakers in Nigeria as at 2000 is 40,300.</p> <p>         The Kurama language is a language within the sub groupings of the Benue - Congo group of languages, which are in turn the largest branch of the Niger-Congo language family. The language is indigenous to Nigeria, with a little over 40,000 speakers (2000 estimate).</p> <p>Kurama speakers are found in the central Northern Nigeria states of Kaduna and Kano.</p> <p>The alternative names for the language are; Akurmi, Akurumi, Azumu, Bagwama, Bukurumi, Tikurami (by non-native speaker)</p> <p>The language is spoken in Saminaka and Ikara local government area of Kaduna state and Tudunwada Local Government Area of Kano State. “Akurumi” the people, “Tukurami” the language and “Bukurumi” is the speaker.</p> <p><strong>1.2.5    OCCUPATION</strong></p> <p>         The people of Kurama are mainly Agriculturist. They plant crops like Maize, Beans, Millets, Guineacorn, Yam, Melon, Wheat (Alkama) and Vegetables. Some of them  engage in bush hunting and craft making like mats, image, and skin (for shoes and bags).</p> <p><strong>1.3    GENECTIC CLASSIFICATION</strong></p> <p>         Genetic classification is based on the assumption that the language have diverse from common ancestors. This method used in classifying language genetically is based on resemblance found in language.</p> <p>         Kurama language is from the largest language family in Africa, that is, Niger Kordofanian.</p> <p><strong>AFRICAN LANGUAGES</strong></p> <p>                   </p> <p>Afro Asiatic                Niger Kordofanian                  Nilo Saharan               Khoisan</p> <p>      </p> <p>                        Niger Congo                                                               Kordofanian</p> <p>West Atlantic       Mande    Gur    Kwa   Adamawa Eastern     Beune          Bantu</p> <p>\\</p> <p>                                    Bantoid           Jukunoid         Cross River     Plateau</p> <p>      </p> <p>                                    Gyena     Taura    Chawai                    Northern          Central</p> <p>                                                                  (Group)                 (Group)           (Group)</p> <p>      </p> <p>                                    Rumaya           Gure                Ruruwa           Bunu   Kurama</p> <p>Source: Derek, Fivaz(1977) African Languages’</p> <p><strong>1.4    DATA COLLECTION</strong></p> <p>         The method of linguistic data collection used in this work for the purpose of obtaining illustrating data is through the use of an informant whose name is Mr. Yohanna Yusuf, a native of Yarkasua in Kaduna state and he is 25years old. Ibadan 400 wordlist was used to obtain data. We also made use of frametechnique.</p> <p>         Frametechnique could be described as the syntactical analysis of language data, using sentences and not just morphemes like wordlist. In frametechnique, words are not considered in isolation.</p> <p>         Wordlist could be described as the medium through which a researcher or investigator collect information on the language being studied through the help of an informant or language helper. The use of wordlist appears to be the quickest form of obtaining linguistic data. By it application, a linguist is able to obtain both phonetic and phonemic consonant and vowels in that language.</p> <p><strong>1.5    DATA ANALYSIS  </strong></p> <p>         It should be noted that the statistic of the data collected has a linguistic significance to this work, with the use of Ibadan 400 wordlist; we were able to collect to two hundred and forty-nine (249) Nouns, one hundred and twenty-eight (128) verbs and, twenty two (22) adjectives with the help of the native speaker. Twenty sentences were collected which includes verb phrase which comprises of transitive and intransitive verbs.</p> <p><strong>1.6    BRIEF REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT AND BINDING THEORY</strong></p> <p>         The theory was made known by a popular American linguist called Noam Chomsky just to eradicate the lapses discovered in the structural grammar. He published a book in (1957) titled “Syntactic structures” which established the idea of generative grammar itself.  Another greater research was made by him which led him to the publication of a book known as “Aspects” it is really called “Standard theory” in (1965) purposely to make a clear distinction between the deep and the surface structures. “Deep structures” is an abstract level of structural organization which deals with meaning while   “surface structures” is thereby dealing with the phonetic or spoken form of every sentence (Horrocks, 1987:2, Cook 1988:28)</p> <p>         During the 1970s, this led to the extended standard theory referring to the types of rules that were employed which now developed into the Government and Binding theory named after” Lectures on Government and binding “Chomsky 1981a, Cook 1988:1) G.B Theory/Model is a Chomsky overall theory involving abstract and difficult sub theories, creating a new simplicity and capturing the internal and universal knowledge of language using small numbers of properties. The following are the sub-theories of Government and binding theory:</p> <p>1.                  X- bar Theory</p> <p>2.                  Bounding Theory</p> <p>3.                  Case Theory</p> <p>4.                  Control Theory</p> <p>5.                  Theta Theory</p> <p>6.                  Binding Theory</p> <p>7.                   Government Theory</p> <p>         The above sub-theory of G.B will be explained respectively purposely to know the importance of each and how they are applied.</p> <p><strong>1.6.1        </strong><strong>X-BAR THEORY </strong></p> <p>         Lamidi (2000:150) states that x-bar theory is based on the theory of phrase structure. It defines the nature of the type of syntactic categories available to any language. The central notion of x-bar theory is that each of the major lexical categories (Noun, Verb, Preposition and Adjective is the head of the same category (Noun; NP, Verb; VP, Preposition; PP, Adjective; AP). In essence, X-bar theory defines possible phrase structure configuration in language for instance, the phrase.</p> <p>         “A new bag”</p> <p>            lijaun  asawa</p> <p>            bag     new</p> <p>          “Eat the food”</p> <p>            Ùlíyá   apúwuniya</p> <p>            Eat       food.</p> <p>         In the above phrases, “a large bag” consists of a head “bag” while “eat the food” consist of a head “eat”. Horrocks (1987) also states that the core of x- bar theory is the recognition of the fact that most phrases have head upon which other elements in the constituents are dependent. The x-bar theory projects from the core projection level to the maximal projection level. This is called Projection Principle.</p> <p><strong>1.6.2    PROJECTION PRINCIPLE</strong></p> <p>         Chomsky (1981:29) says “representation at each syntactic level is projected from the lexicon, in that they observe the subcategorization proper of lexical properties to be projected to all level of syntactic representation for instance, a lexical item projects from its zero bar level to one (single) bar level which is optional, then to double bar level. The zero bar level is referred to as the core projection level, the single bar level is referred to as the Intermediate Projection Level and the double bar level is referred to as the Maximal Projection Level. The illustration is shown below.</p> <p>X11 Maximal Projection level</p> <p>                                                            X1 Intermediate Projection</p> <p>                                                Level</p> <p>                                                            X0 Core Projection level</p> <p>         Horrocks (1987:99) states that x-bar theory tells us that a lexical head (X) and its complements form a constituent (Xi) and that any specifier of this form with a high level of constituent (Xii) thus:</p> <p>                                                            X11</p> <p>                                                Spec                X1</p> <p>                                                            X0                  Comp</p> <p><strong>1.6.3    CASE THEORY</strong></p> <p>         Case theory regulates the distribution of phonetically realized NPs by assigning abstract case to them. It deals with the principle of case assignment to constituents. Chomsky assumes that all NPs with lexical contents are assigned (abstract) case is assigned by a set of case assigners to the governed. Horrrocks (1987:103) says the basic idea is that case assigned under the government for instance the choice of case is determined by the governor. In any sentence, that is, lexical head X may be said to govern its sister, in X-bar and certain lexical heads also have power to case mark certain of their compliment. Thus, NP subject is assigned nominative by INFL, (Tense, Agr), Verb assigns accusative case to object of the verb while preposition assigns case to its object.</p> <p>         The relationship between the empty position (trace) and its binder is deemed to be Transformational in the example below:</p> <p>         Book comes outside everyday on top Francis and John</p> <p>        “A book comes out everyday about Francis and john”.</p> <p>        In this example, a distinct type of A-binding associated with the right heads movement of the PP modifier of “a book” known informally as “extra position from NP”</p> <p>The following sentence can be taken as an example.</p> <p>                Sheu  inwẹh            Audu  mandẹ</p> <p>                Sheu    kill   Audu goat</p> <p>                     “Sheu killed the goat for Audu”.</p> <p>                                                IP</p> <p>                               Spec                     11</p> <p>                                 NP          Tense (Past)VP </p> <p>                                  N1                               V1</p> <p>                                  N                          V                  NP</p> <p>                                 Sheu                                             N1</p> <p>                                   Nominative                          N         N</p> <p>                                                            inweh       Audu   Mande</p> <p>                                                            Kill                       Goat</p> <p>      </p> <p>ACC</p> <p>         The subject Sheu, being the subject gets Nom (nominative case) from (INFL+TENSE), verb assigns Accusative case to the object Audu.</p> <p><strong>1.6.4        </strong><strong>THETA THEORY</strong></p> <p>         Theta theory deals with the functional relationship between a predicate and its arguments. It is concerned with the assignment of what Chomsky calls “thematic roles” such as agent, patient (or theme), beneficiary e.t.c.

It is also important for the regulation of every community </p> <p>The main focus of this research is to shed more light on how noun phrase is found in yiwom language. Therefore, the first chapter of this research focuses on the historical of yiwom language, genetic classification, the scope and organization of the study analysis, the theoretical framework, data collection, data analysis, and also the review of the chosen framework which is government and binding theory.</p> <p>This branch of linguistics is concerned with how words are combined to form phrases and sentences in a rule governed manner.</p> <p><strong>1.1       </strong><strong>HISTORICAL  BACKGROUND </strong></p> <p>The yiwom speaking people are also known as Garkawa, Gerkachi and Gerka and Gurka. Heil yiwom is what they call their town but the fulanis call them Gerkawa. it is a unit in the  South East corner of the present milkang Local Government Area and is bounded in the North and East by the Langtang section of yergam, South East by the way of Dampar South by Inshar and West by the Lalin section of montol. </p> <p>The yiwom people have been in their present home for upwards of two hundred years. The pitop came to the area first and provide itself a stockaded town at a place called Hakbap. The Rohta followed second and settled in kiel-hiel at Rohta-Hills, North of Hielyoum. Other families arrived in large detachments one after the other and took refuge at Kiel-Hiel. Rohta rock was fortified and was capable of withstanding siege,</p> <p>As at the middle of nineteenth century, the families came from their hills to live in their present homes. The former at Rohta , the later at pitop.</p> <p>According to legends preserved by both sections, their ancestors sprang from the ground. The Rotha maintain that they are from river Guinan in the hills, while the paptop said that theirs emerged from the earth. </p> <p>The word “Youm” in the Youm dialect means “leaves”. The analogy being: as trees grows out of the ground, so their ancestors came into being. The name “Gerkawa” was given to them by the Fulani/Hausa traders owing to their military prowess and stubbornness. The name was derived from “Gagararru” which in the course of time become “Gerka” and “Bergarka” and finally Gerkawa. </p> <p>Legend points to the fact that all the families mentioned and who call themselves yiwom or Gerkawa were of Jukun stock that migrated after the breakup of kwararrafa empire (West of Bunkudi) and wandered until the settle down in Gerkawa town.</p> <p><strong>1.2       </strong><strong>GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION</strong></p> <p>The home of the yioum speaker is situated in the south east of the present milkang local government area formerly at Shendam and Langtang. </p> <p>It is found in co-ordinates 90000 North and 9035 East and 90 North and 9.5830 East. It covers an area of approximately 139 Km2 with 285.3 square meter </p> <p>Its time zone is WAT (UTCH). In the year 2000, an estimated 14,100 people spoke the language primarily in Plateau state. </p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>SOCIO CULTURE PROFILE </strong></p> <p>The yiwom people have homogenous cultural values especially in respect of Occupation, Religion, Marriage, Mode of dressing, Mode of leadership, festival and of course circumcision.</p> <p>Before talking on their socio cultural profile, one thing that I must say is that Yiwom is a Chadic language of the Afro-Asiatic family spoken by Gerkawa people of Plateau state, Nigeria. The yiwom people have several clans such as Rohta, Killah, Balbro, Pitop, Talim, Lahlil, Pensong, Gwar-Gimgim, Bal’Nlah, Longkrom and wai clan. Each clan has its own priest (Bankumkrom).</p> <p><strong>1.3.1      </strong><strong>RELIGION</strong></p> <p>They practice all kinds of religion including Christianity, Islamic and Animism. Children are first taught how to use their mother tongue to pray and later will now teach them Goemai and Jukun. </p> <p>Anything that contradict their belief in the religion will be dealt with severally for example, crime, stealing, and adultery are punishable offence in their religions. Also, in formers days, a person abused of witch craft is burnt alive. So as a result of hot believe in what their religion teaches them this make people within their locality to fear them to the extent that any battle they embark in through their beliefs in their religion was conquered.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2      </strong><strong>OCCUPATION</strong></p> <p>The major occupation of the yiwom people are animal husbandry and trading. Their farm product include: yam, cassava , maize and guinea corn. Farm is rooted in their cultural ethnics as the farmers purify themselves and abstain from immoral behaviour before planting or else what they have planted will not germinate  </p> <p><strong>1.3.3      </strong><strong>MARRIAGE</strong></p> <p>            In Gerkawa custom, there are 3 modes of conducting their marriage ceremony. They are:</p> <p>a.         <strong><em>Marriage by System of Exchange</em></strong>: In this case, the wife and offsprings virtually becomes the properly of the husband but with the passage of time, such things have been erased from their culture.</p> <p>b.         <strong><em>By</em></strong> <strong><em>Payment of Small Customary Bride Price</em></strong>: Under the small bride price system, It was easy for a woman to change her husband before the sixth month of their marriage.</p> <p>c.         <strong>Cousin Marriage: </strong>This is referred to as the best form of marriage in the sense that they keep wealth within the family. The second and the most important reason is that divorce is not permissible and therefore any marriage done will be permanent. The person that co-ordinate the marriage programme is called “Nwo” which  means “the person sent by God”. And what they called God  in their language is Na’an”. </p> <p><strong>1.3.4      </strong><strong>BURIAL </strong></p> <p>               In yiwom community, if someone dies, women will gather in the house of the deceased while men will go on arranging and preparing how to buy the casket they will use to bury that person.</p> <p>               Notably, the burial grounds are always in a spherical shaped form like a well. It is only on the mortal that the dead is being washed believing that the mortal is blessed because if is used in the process of their food. As men are carrying the corpse to the grave, the women will be preparing food. A goat will be slaughtered in a standing position and the skin will be used to cover the dead. If the deceased is a female, some of her jewelries will be buried with her. The food cooked during their burial ceremonies are called gyana-Nfirika.</p> <p><strong>1.3.5      </strong><strong>MODE OF LEADERSHIP</strong></p> <p>               Governance among the yiwom people is anchored on a council of elders including a head of chiefs and a youth in the community, making communication easy. The council of elders does the same in the community.</p> <p><strong>1.4       </strong><strong>GENETIC CLASSIFICATION</strong></p> <p>            According to Greenberg (1966:8) says African language belongs to various families and there are four main groups namely : Niger Kodofanian, Nilo Sahara, Afro-Asiatic and Khiosan.</p> <p>               The yiwom language is a chadic language of the Afro-asiatic language family.</p> <p>               Languages are classified like what I have explained above and they are also genetically related just like humans beings.</p> <p>               Yiwom language is spoken among the Gerkawa people of plateau state of Nigeria and the speakers were estimated in the year 2000 to be 14,100 in number.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>Daigram</strong></p> </div> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.5       </strong><strong>SCOPE AND ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY. </strong></p> <p>            The general overview of this research work discuses noun phrase in yiwom language.

However, the Ibadan 400 word list of basic items and some sentences construction are use to extract necessary information from language speakers. The method of collection was through direct translation of English to Yiwom language </p> <p>            However, multilingual approach was used because the informants, who are native speaker of Yiwom speaks more than two languages which includes: English, Foron  and Yiwom language.                        </p> <p>            Mr. Michael Trumbek and his wife, Mrs. Grace Trumbek are my language helpers they are both teachers in Khilafilor Nursery and Primary School. I also went to CAPRO research office and I was given a book titled CAPRO indeed. An ethnic survey in Yiwom language in Plateau State. I was also given a linguistic seminar and the institute of linguistics University of Ibadan, Jos computer written by Shimizu, Kiyoshi (1975)</p> <p><strong>1.7       </strong><strong>DATA ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p>               In order to have accurate analysis for this research, Ibadan 400 word list with an equivalent  meaning in Yiwom language was used.</p> <p>               Also, the frame techniques used in this research is forming of sentences in English and translating the sentences to Yiwom language with the assistance of an informant. This enables me to determine the actual underlying form of a word constituent and possible syntactic classes to which each word belongs to in Yiwom language</p> <p><strong>1.8       </strong><strong>REVIEW OF THE CHOSEN FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>            For this research to achieve the set of goals, the theory to be adopted is government and binding theory in the analysis of the noun phrase in Yiwom language.</p> <p>               Now, government are binding theory (GB) will be used in the analysis of noun phrase in Yiwom language. This theory is a modular posits multiple levels of Representation related by the transformational rule (move alpha)</p> <p>               However, it is more advanced theory of universal drama (Sanusi, 1991;19-21)</p> <p>            Sanusi (1996), explains again that GB theory greatly eliminate proliferation of transformational rules, like passive , affix hopping, verb number agreement, question formation, equip-NP-Deletion, raising permutation, insertion e.t.c. Government are binding theory operates through the modules of grammar like government , case, theta and X-Bar.</p> <p><strong>1.8.1      </strong><strong>SUB-THEORIES OF GOVERNMENT AND BINDING         THEORY</strong></p> <p>               Horrocks (1987, 100) states that, the core grammar   of a given language is derived from the interaction of Sub-theories of universal grammar. These sub-theories are inter-related that each of them can account for grammaticality and ungrammaticality of any sentences. These sub-theories are:</p> <p>1)        X-bar theory</p> <p>2)        Case theory</p> <p>3)        Government theory</p> <p>4)        Theta theory</p> <p>         There are still others like:</p> <p>1)        Bounding theory</p> <p>2)        Control theory</p> <p>         But I will be talking on the first four theories. The above listed sub-theories are ungrammatically represented below to show the interrelationship among them.  </p> <p><strong>1.8.1.1</strong></p> <p>      </p> <p><strong><br/> X-BAR THEORY </strong></p> <p>Based on appropriate analysis for the research work, X Bar is the theory to be adopted for comprehensive analysis.</p> <p>Cook (1988:94) explains that, X-bar Syntax reveals large number of idiosyncratic ‘rule’ with general principles, it captures properties of all phrases not just those of a certain types and it bases the syntax on lexical categories that links with entries in the lexicon </p> <p>Webelbum (1995:18) explains that, X-bar theory is the central module of the principle and parameter approach in syntax </p> <p>The X-bar theory brings out what is common in the structure of phrase. A phrase in X-bar syntax always contain at least a head as well  as others constituents (cook 1988:94).</p> <p>The head of projection is zero projection (X). heads are terminal modes, they dominate words X-bar theory distinguished two level of projection compliment combines with X to form X” (X-X,);YP adjust combine with X projection (X-X, YP). The specified combines with the topmost X’ to form the maximum projection (XP Spec; X’)</p> <p>                   </p> <p><br/></p> <p>Due to the fact that X-bar brings out, what is common in the structure, X-bar theory will be the applicable to be used in the analysis of Yiwom noun phrase </p> <p><strong>1.8.1.2             </strong><strong>THETA (θ)THEORY </strong></p> <p>This centers on assigning ‘thematic’ roles to sentential constituents. The Greek  letter ‘theta’ is a form of shortening for thematic </p> <p>According to Chomsky, thematic roles means “to what have been referred to as semantic roles in the proceeding sections, roles such as agent, patient (or theme), beneficiary e.t.c. These are assumed to be assigned to the complements of lexical items as a lexical property.</p> <p>Horrock, G (1993;102) uses the entry for put as an example and explains that the NP complement is assigned to the complement is assigned the role of location. It is also assumed that the majority of verbs ‘θ mark’ the subject position of sentences containing theme.</p> <p>Thus, the subject NP of a sentence containing put is assigned the agent role. A predicate argument is denoted by any constituent assigned a θ-role by definition.</p> <p>The main principle of θ-theory is the θ-criterion which its requirements in the unique assignment of each thematic role, this indicates that each constituent denoting an argument is assigned just θ-role and each θ-role is assigned for just one argument denoting constituent. </p> <p><strong>1.8.1.3             </strong><strong>CASE-THEORY</strong></p> <p>This deals with the principles of case assignment to constituents. Kirsten (1991; 496) explains that case theory regulates the distribution of phonetically realized NPs by assigning abstract case to them.</p> <p>According to Horrocks, G (1993103), the basic idea is that case is assigned under government; the choice of case is determined by the governor in any given example. Government is a traditional notion which involves the delimitation of the sphere of influence of a particular category with respect to adjacent categories.</p> <p>A lexical head X may be said to govern its sisters in X-bar, and certain lexical heads also have the power to case-mark certain of their complements.</p> <p>Thus, inflection assigns nomative case to subject NP, verb assign accusative case to object NP, while preposition assigns oblique case to its object.</p> <p>One of most important principles of case theory is that case filter, which states that any s-structure that contains in NP with lexical content but no case is ungrammatical.</p> <p>Kirsten (1991; 407) formally represented case filter as </p> <p><strong>1.8.1.4             </strong><strong>GOVERNMENT THEORY</strong></p> <p>This deals with the syntactic relationship between the governor i.e. the head, and the governed i.e. its complement </p> <p>Government theory also defines the relationship in other sub-theories of government and binding theory.</p> <p>With respects to government theory, α governs β    if and only if:</p> <p>1.    α  and β   naturally c-command each other </p> <p>2.     α is a governor (e.g. noun, verb, preposition, adjective)</p> <p>3.    α   governs β    , then governs the specified of β</p>\n\nTHE YIWOM NOUN PHRASE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE YIWOM NOUN PHRASE", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE VERB PHRASE OF KOFYAR LANGUAGE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0              </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION    </strong></p> <p>            This study focuses on the verb phrase of kofyar. Kofyar is a dialect of “sura” that can be found in the northern part of plateau state in a local government called Qua’an pan. The kofyar are a population in the middle belt of Nigeria numbering around 50,000.</p> <p>They are majorly known as ‘KOFYARA’ among the speakers but in the local government they are known as “PAN”. It is also spoken in a part of Nassarawa State.</p> <p><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>GENERAL BACKGROUND   </strong></p> <p><strong>COLONIAL BACK GROUND  </strong></p> <p>Kofyar population comprises of three different tribes as designated by british colonial officers and the tribes are the Doemark, Merniang and kwalla. The three groups have a common language, economic pattern and origin myth and had formed into a union called the kofyar federation in 1940’s. They have therefore been referred to as a single group by the anthropologist.</p> <p>When they were first met by early British colonial authorities, they lived in the rugged hills in the south eastern corner of the Jos plateau and in settlements around plateau state. They remained at peace with Britain officers until 1930, when a young assistant district officer named Barlow was killed in the hill village of Latok by a rock thrown on his head. After this the resident were forced out of the hills making them spread themselves in different places in plateau state.</p> <p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND   </strong></p> <p>Kofyar means the home state of the ancestor has grown. There are two kofyar in Qua’an pan local government area, they are kofyar payar and kofyar doemak, the only difference between these two kofyar is the distance. The name of the originator is Dafyar which means a child has grown. He descended from the eastern part of Nigeria.</p> <p>When he left for the eastern part of the country he moved with tribes like the Angas, Mahvul, Ankwe, Gwai and the Bokous. When were moving they came straight to Daika in Mangul Local Government, Plateau State. At that point, they had a disagreement, the Bokous and the panchi left and headed towards another direction. The kofyar headed towards Garam, at Garam they had another disagreement on the issue of chieftaincy.</p> <p>Mean while, Dafyar had a brother named Daram, they both moved from Garam to chip, in chip, Dafyar left Daram, Dafyar left and settled in kofyar payer. He gave birth to so many children among which were a set of twin called Dajan and Dajin, Dajan went to namu and Dajin stayed in Doemak meaning my movement ends here. The offspring of Dafyar comprised his sons and grandsons or even great grand sons and so on. Oral tradition has for long mentioned the fourteen who have been popular due to the settlements that grew in the wake of their earlier locations. These offspring’s whose location have created urban and semi urban settlements are as presented below.</p> <p><strong>TABLE 1.2LOCATIONS OF KOFYAR OFFSPRING      </strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>S/N</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>NAME</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>SETTLEMENT</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>APPROXIMATE ROUTE DISTANCE FROM KOFYAR </strong></p><p> </p> <p>1</p><p> </p> <p>Chikirpe</p><p> </p> <p>Kwang</p><p> </p> <p>6km</p><p> </p> <p>2</p><p> </p> <p>Dajan</p><p> </p> <p>Jepjan</p><p> </p> <p>23km</p><p> </p> <p>3</p><p> </p> <p>Dajin</p><p> </p> <p>Dummak</p><p> </p> <p>3km</p><p> </p> <p>4</p><p> </p> <p>Dawam</p><p> </p> <p>Lardang</p><p> </p> <p>5km</p><p> </p> <p>5</p><p> </p> <p>Jefut</p><p> </p> <p>Jaknoeng</p><p> </p> <p>11km</p><p> </p> <p>6</p><p> </p> <p>Jipal</p><p> </p> <p>Koeper</p><p> </p> <p>8km</p><p> </p> <p>7</p><p> </p> <p>Koenzuan</p><p> </p> <p>Fujing</p><p> </p> <p>6km</p><p> </p> <p>8</p><p> </p> <p>Kopgwai</p><p> </p> <p>Muduut</p><p> </p> <p>6km</p><p> </p> <p>9</p><p> </p> <p>Longme</p><p> </p> <p>Bogot</p><p> </p> <p>5km</p><p> </p> <p>10</p><p> </p> <p>Nugaan</p><p> </p> <p>Miket</p><p> </p> <p>2km</p><p> </p> <p>11</p><p> </p> <p>Rundum</p><p> </p> <p>Zukal</p><p> </p> <p>8km</p><p> </p> <p>12</p><p> </p> <p>Soekoetko</p><p> </p> <p>Kwa</p><p> </p> <p>3km</p><p> </p> <p>13</p><p> </p> <p>Wadam</p><p> </p> <p>Kwanoeng</p><p> </p> <p>5km</p><p> </p> <p>14</p><p> </p> <p>Yimpan</p><p> </p> <p>Fungleet, Njak</p><p> </p> <p>12km</p><p> </p> <p>            As a result of civilisation, kofyar speakers can be found in seven districts in Qua’an pan local government area in seven villages which are Doemak, Kwa, Kwang, Kwalla, Bwalla, Namu and Doka.</p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>SOCIO-CULTURE PROFILE </strong></p> <p>The kofyar are a population in the middle belt of Nigeria. The dialects are Bwal, Bwol, Dimmuk, Doemak, Giverom, Gworam, Jepal and Nemyang.</p> <p>The official language in Qua’an pan local government is English language. The main identity of “KOFYARA’ is their language and beliefs. The kofyar people are rich in terms of social aspect and cultural aspect such as festivals, dressing, religion, food, occupation and so on.</p> <p><strong>FESTIVAL   </strong></p> <p>Ma’ap Festival: The ma’ap festival is mean for the funeral rite of a great person and it is done by slaughtering a horse.</p> <p>Ka’atar festival: It is a festival done to thank the gods for making the harvest of a year bountiful.</p> <p>Feer: Is a musical presentation for social activities especially during installations, heroic activities, funerals, station ceremonies, etc. horns are used to produce the music. It is common with keonoen, Ron and kofyar groups.</p> <p><strong>BELIEF      </strong></p> <p>The kofyar people believe in the almighty God whom they call Na’an. They also believe in mystical power, they place their belief in lesser gods such as keom Gwar and the koen toeng Munaan. The work of koem Gwar is to catch evil people and the work of koem toeng Munaacth orade) is to explore into the future.</p> <p><strong>RELIGION  </strong></p> <p>The kofyar does believe in almighty God, the only supreme being who lives in the sky, but that there is no after life. In the ancient days, the kofyar people were majorly traditional believers but due to the influence of western civilization the kofyar’s are majorly Christians followed by traditional believers and a few Muslims.</p> <p><strong>BEST FOOD AND BEST DRINK    </strong></p> <p>Their best foods in kofyar are pounded yam, Lamchik, Guzeh, Baala and Naweh, their best soups are toomang made from pumpkin leaves, tooklem made from bean seed, toompur made form mushroom and tookunlung. Kofyar people take a lot of alcohol and their favorite drink is burukutu which is known as Mous in the area, followed by Wa’argoebung and Wa’ardachant. One thing to note in their culture is that they don’t waste food.</p> <p><strong>WEDDING AND DRESSING   </strong></p> <p>       In kofyar, the wedding ceremony is called samurang, the bride is called Namwar and the groom is called Mis namwar, the wedding ceremony is done in the namwar’s place.</p> <p>In terms of the dressing, in the olden days, the kofyar have a poenlugut which means child carrier made from sheep skin. In the western time, they dress to fit civilization.</p> <p><strong>EDUCATION  </strong></p> <p>It is beyond the shadow of doubt that, the issue of western education in today’s society is dominant and nearly unavoidable.</p> <p>Kofyar a small speech community in plateau state is not exempted from this so called nomenclature ‘education’. Unlike so many places the main schools in kofyar and the neigh-boring villages are missionary and government school.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>TABLE 1:3 KOFYAR EDUCATIONAL STATUS     </strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>S/N</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>LOCATIONS</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>STATUS</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>PROPRIETOR </strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>PRESENT STATUS </strong></p><p> </p> <p>1</p><p> </p> <p>Kwa</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Secondary</p><p> </p> <p>2.</p><p> </p> <p>Kwang</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Secondary</p><p> </p> <p>3</p><p> </p> <p>Chip</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Secondary</p><p> </p> <p>4</p><p> </p> <p>Dafan</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Secondary</p><p> </p> <p>5</p><p> </p> <p>Kofyar Paya</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>6</p><p> </p> <p>Doemak</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Secondary</p><p> </p> <p>7</p><p> </p> <p>Kwagalak</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Secondary</p><p> </p> <p>8</p><p> </p> <p>Kwagalak</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Secondary</p><p> </p> <p>9</p><p> </p> <p>Ba’al</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>10</p><p> </p> <p>Chim</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>11</p><p> </p> <p>Kwagar</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>12</p><p> </p> <p>Lardang</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>13</p><p> </p> <p>Bwall</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Secondary</p><p> </p> <p>14</p><p> </p> <p>Jepjan (Namu)</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p> <p>Secondary</p><p> </p> <p>15</p><p> </p> <p>Kofyar doemak</p><p> </p> <p>Primary</p><p> </p> <p>Catholic</p><p> </p>\n\nTHE VERB PHRASE OF KOFYAR LANGUAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE VERB PHRASE OF KOFYAR LANGUAGE", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE UNEME NOUN PHRASE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 General Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>          This research work is based on the language called Uneme language spoken in Edo State.  This work will focus on the aspects of Uneme Noun Phrase. The term Noun Phrase forms an important aspect of syntax.</p> <p>          Syntax is a branch of linguistics, derived from ancient Greek ‘SYN’ and ‘TAX’. SYN mean ‘Together’ while TAX means ‘Arrangement’.  Syntax is the study of the arrangement of words to form sentences.  Different linguist has defined syntax in different ways:</p> <p>          <strong>Talleman </strong>(2005) Defines syntax as the study of syntactic property of language.  He sees syntax as sentence construction, that is, how words are put together to make phrases or sentences.</p> <p>          <strong>Akmajian </strong>(2004) sees syntax as a sub-field of linguistics that studies the internal structure of sentences and the relationship among the internal parts.</p> <p>          <strong>Ladeforged </strong>(1997) says that syntax is concerned with the way words are combined to form sentences.</p> <p>          Syntax can be hierarchically structured from the larger to the smallest (Sentence------Clause-----Phrase -----Word).<strong> Sanusi </strong>(1996) says, in the systemic analysis, a sentence is ranked the highest, consisting of one or more clauses.</p> <p>The focus of this research will be on the aspects of   Noun Phrase of Uneme language. A phrase is a sequence of words that can function as a constituent in the structure of sentences.  There are different types of phrasal categories, these are; Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase, Prepositional Phrase, Adjective Phrase and Adverbial Phrase. A Noun Phrase is headed by a noun and so applicable to others which are named after the lexical categories.</p> <p>          This project work will serve as a priority and a means of developing Uneme language and to save guard it from going into extinction.  It will suit the desires of those that want the language as a means of communication even in schools and in the community.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Historical Background</strong></p> <p>          According to oral tradition, the Uneme language speakers are found in the northern part of Edo State.  An informant claimed that speakers of the language can be found in two areas in Edo State, these areas are Akoko-Edo and Etsako North.  Edo state is found in the south eastern part of Nigeria.</p> <p>          Hakeem (2003:4) says that the history of Uneme people can be traced to the core area of the Nok cultural zone located in the North eastern part of Niger-Benue confluence.  The area represents the ancestral home land of not only Uneme people but also of related sub-ethnic groups which have come to be described as the Edoid.</p> <p>          Uneme people are migrants from Benin.  They arrived Benin area during king Ogiso Ere’s era and their first settlement was on the outskirt of Benin City.  The Uneme people moved to Benin in the tenth century and later left because of a problem that arises as a result of Oba shift between two brothers in the royal house or palace of Benin kingdom.  The crises were so tense that everybody from Uneme community had to leave.  Their mode of migration from Benin in 1370 AD was in two phases; The first major phase of the migrant moved northwards from Benin, settling in different territories between 1370 and late 1370.  Some of the notable places they headed to are Obadan in the present Edo state and Agbede in the Etsako west area of the present northern Edo state, others are Ogbomeze (Imiava) in the Etsako central area of the present northern Edo state and Okene in Ebira community of the present Kogi State.</p> <p>          The migration of Uneme people experience a split which makes them to move in two different direction, one to Akoko-Edo (the present northern Edo-state) and other to Oghomeze in Etsako.  At the time of their staying in Akoko-Edo, they established three other Uneme communities in different location within Akoko-Edo namely Uneme Aki-Osu in the early 1400s, Uneme Erhurm and Uneme Ekped.</p> <p>          According to the language informant, he claims that, people who speak Uneme are Uzanu, Anegbete, Udochi and Ologua who are the latter of Uneme community in the 1830s.</p> <p>          From history, we are aware that the listed Uneme community are named after children of the same father and mother which latter developed to different community.  Each of them developed to a large community that now lives as a town on their own.  There was a conflict that broke out between Uzanu and Anegbete which led to a war and brought about parting between Uzanu and Anegbete whereby we have Uzanu in Etsako East and Anegbete in Etsako central.  During this war, Uzanu was having upper hand, and this makes the Anegbete to seek the assistance of Nupe people in Bida.  The Nupe people (warriors) came but asking the Oriola who is the prime minister of Anegbete to divide the kingdom of Anegbete into two and give them.  Oriole made them to understand that they are only here for war and not to share kingdom so, they should mind their business and face the Uzanu’s.  The Uzanu’s were captured by the Nupe warriors and later came to invade the Anegbete and the whole of Etsako.</p> <p>          Further more, Hakeem (2003:7) pointed out that the second major phase of the Uneme’s migration from Benin in 1370 AD witnessed the movement of the affected people eastwards in Niger-river, unlike the first group that moved northwards.  Members of the second group were few in number, and they passed through fewer territories where they settle down briefly before they finally established their permanent home in the Awka area of Igboland in the present Anambra State in 1380’s and 1370’s.</p> <p>          The total population of the Uneme language speakers is estimated to be 19800 (year 2000 estimation of internet) and the alternative names with which the language is called are Ileme, Ineme and Uleme but the standard version is Uneme as been called by the speakers.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Socio Cultural Profile</strong></p> <p>          The Uneme people are distinguished from others in their own way of life. Their culture is very rich and they believe so much in it.  The language serves as a means of communication in the society, in the market and even in the religious system and it is aimed at being a medium of expression and instruction in schools.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1           Sociolinguistic Background</strong></p> <p>The Uneme language is used in trading with the neighboring communities.  For example, the Uzanu’s share the same boundary with Edo and Igbirra, so, the language serves as a means of trading between them.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2  Culture</strong></p> <p>The Uneme’s dressing is some how different.  They use Tusks, Beads (for women, the tusks for the legs and for bangles on hands).  In those days, they believed that a girl must be a virgin before she got married, as a result, when a lady is ready to get married she will not wear any cloth but will use a lot of beads to cover her private parts and almost naked round the town.  They also use “Ashid” gotten from the bush to decorate the girl and a lot of beads on the hand, just as the Benin dresses.</p> <p>          Also the Olofu who is the Prime minister has a drum called “Ukpaagba”.  This Ukpaagba is beaten when there is an emergency or a conflict in the king’s family so as to draw the attention of the people.  The drum is being beaten four times representing the four pillars of Uneme that is, it represents Uzanu, Anegbete, Udochi and Ologua.</p> <p><strong>1.2.3  Festival</strong></p> <p>          Some of the festivals of Uneme community are connected with their religious believes while others are linked to their socio-economic activities.</p> <p>          There is a festival named “Ukpe” which means end of the year celebration.  It is celebrated between August and September of every year.  The people of Uneme are virtually known to be farmers; so therefore, this celebration precedes the coming of new yam.  The festival serves as a major communication channel to bid good bye to the outgoing year and to welcome the coming year whereby every family have to participate in one way or the other.</p> <p>          Another festival in the Uneme community is named Ogun festival.  Ogun festival is associated with, and devoted to the propitiation and veneration of god of iron.  This festival is usually organized only by iron melting societies.  The festival is organized by allocation certain spots in the community to the propitiation of Ogun. They make use of certain animal named ‘dog’ and the whole of the community takes part in singing, dancing and drumming to appease Ogun ‘the god of iron’.</p> <p>          Another festival of Uneme people is known as ‘Second Burial Ceremony’ which can only be done for a dead father.  It is still valid to be done after several years of the father’s demise.  Any one that has not done the second burial is not entitled to the title “Orinitome” in the Uneme community.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4  Religion</strong></p> <p>          As we have it in the Nigeria system, the Uneme people are also recognized with three (3) main religions these are Christianity, Islam and Traditional Religion.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4.1        Christianity</strong></p> <p>          Christianity was not the indigenous religion in Nigeria but was introduced to Nigeria by the Missionaries.  This begin to spread in Nigeria to different community.  Hakeem asserted that Christianity was introduced to the Uneme communities in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s respectively by Christian missionaries like Ogidan of the Anglican Community.  The introduction of Christianity religion was done by some Yoruba missionaries who visited Akoko-Edo frequently and it gradually extend to the Etsako local government Area.  The first church of the missionaries in Uneme Akpama was named St’ Luke Anglican church and it was built in 1922.</p> <p>          Chief Ezekiel Adeleye Igenuma Uduak Peghemehe from the Enivbosu area of Uneme Erhurun was the one that build the first church in Uneme Erhurun in 1923.  This is also an Anglican church.</p> <p>          Another missionary behind the spread of Christianity in Uneme community was Rev. Oyebode, a Yoruba Christian priest who was based in Auchi.  He was the first Anglican Missionary to influence the spread of the religion in Uneme Aki-Osu in Akoko-Edo Area in the 1920s.  He found the St. Johns Church which was the first of its kind in that environment.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4.2.       Islam</strong></p> <p>The Islamic religion was introduced during the time when the Nupes were involved in the Uneme activities.  This was in the time of military and colonizing activities in Akoko-Edo in the 19th century.  The Islamic religion has been in existence before the Christian religion was introduced.  It was only few of Uneme people that are been converted because they sees the Nupes as invaders and people were not encouraged to accept their offer.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4.3    Traditional Religion</strong></p> <p>          Ever before the introduction of Islam and Christianity, the people of Uneme so much belief in the Traditional Religion.The people of Uneme believes in Osanobula, Ogbene and Osi which are Supreme Beings.  Osanobula is believed to have had heavenly aids who were appointed by him.  Among such aids were the local divinities or deities, Ilisa which is referred to as the gods and goddesses, and the spirits (especially Esi).  The people of Uneme young and old usually call on him through his various aides for protection and extrication from the hands of perpetrators of evil.</p> <p>          According to Pastor Patrick who is the language informant, he says the religion is still very prominent in the Uneme community due to their cultural and festival activities.</p> <p><strong>1.2.5  Marriage</strong></p> <p>          Pastor Patrick who is the language informant says that the people of Uneme believe so much in traditional marriage.  Uneme people do not buy the habit of marrying just only one wife but believes solely in a polygamous marriage.  It is like a compulsory fact that if someone has not married two wives, is like the person is a lazy man.</p> <p><strong>1.2.6  Occupation</strong></p> <p>          The major occupation of the Uneme people is smelting of iron (blacksmith).  The blacksmiths smelt the iron-ore mostly at night because of the high temperature generated in the process of smelting.</p> <p>          Another occupation of the Uneme people is farming.  They practice commercial farming in the Uneme community.  Some of their farm products are; coca, rice, yam, maize, cassava and banana e.t.c. The people of Uneme also practice trading.  They trade with their smelt product such as Anklets, bracelets, local necklace, cutlasses, iron weapons, knives, plates, hoes and pot.  They trade with the neigbouring community and all their products are involved in their trading.</p> <p><strong>1.3              Genetic Classification of Uneme Language</strong></p> <p>          This is a systematic way of grouping languages that share something in common into the same family.  According to Ruhlen (1991:-5), a genetic classification is a sub-grouping of all relevant language into genetic nodes.  However, a genetic node is a group of languages each of which is more closely related to others in that group than to any language outside the group.</p> <p>          African languages like other languages of the world have been classified by taxonomical linguistics.  The Uneme language is grouped with the languages in the Benue congo where we later end up having Edo and Ghotuo.  The Genetic classification tree below will summarize the sub-grouping of Uneme language.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Scope and Organization of the Study</strong></p> <p>          It has been discovered that the minority languages in Nigeria are not being paid much attention to.  Therefore, this long essay will describe and present the structure of Noun Phrase in Uneme language and the transformational processes involving such noun phrases.  The processes and the examples are presented and analyzed using Government and Binding theory.</p> <p>          This research work is organized in such away that it will comprise five (5) chapters.</p> <p>          The first chapter presents the introductory part of the long essay, dealing mainly with the historical background and the socio cultural profile of the speakers of Uneme language.  Also, the genetic classification of the language, scope and organization of the study, method of data collection and analysis, and a brief review of the chosen frame work are presented in this chapter.</p> <p>          Chapter two presents a brief review of the sounds, tone and syllable patterns of Uneme language.  It will introduce and explicitly explain with examples in Uneme language the basic syntactic concepts such as, Phrase Structure Rule, Lexical Categories, Basic Word Order and Sentence Types found in the language under study.</p> <p>          Chapter three (3) focuses on the Uneme Noun Phrase which is actually the main focus of this research work.  We will have the structure of Noun Phrase and transformational processes involved in this chapter.</p> <p>          Chapter four will focus on the levels of linguistic analysis in the language. It will examine the transformational processes in Uneme language.</p> <p>          Lastly, chapter five will contain the summary,  recommendation and conclusion of this research work. </p> <p><strong>1.5     Theoretical Framework</strong></p> <p>          Many theories have been propounded for analyzing language data in order to present a systematic description of the linguistic knowledge or competence a native speaker possesses (Sanusi 1996).  Such theories are used as theoretical framework or methodological tools for analyzing language data.  They include; Traditional or Classical Grammar, structural or Taxonomic Grammar, Systematic Grammar, Transformational Generative Grammar, Government and Binding theory and Minimalist programme.  The theoretical framework adopted for this research work is Government and Binding (GB) theory which is also known as principles and parameters theory (PPT).  This is a theory that captures the similarities which exist between different categories of lexical phrases by assigning the same structure to them rather than having different phrase structure rules for NPs, VPs e.t.c.</p> <p>          Government and Binding theory is propounded by Noam Chomsky.  The theory is named after Chomsky’s book; lectures on Government and Binding (1981). Sanusi (1996:21) describes Government and Binding (GB) as a modular deductive theory of universal Grammar (UG) which posits multiple levels of representation related by the transformational rule (move-alpha).  The application of move-alpha is constrained by the interaction of various Principles which act as conditions on possible representation. Government and Binding theory is a modular deductive theory of grammar.  Proponents of GB often maintained that there is no such thing as roles of language.  But only the principles and parameters whose values can vary from one language to the other do exist with specified units.</p> <p>          According to cook (1988:86), the theory of Government and Binding is described as an interlocking arrangement of principles and sub-theories which interact in many ways in the analysis of human language. Also, Radford (1988:419) defines transformation as the rule that deals with the act of changing the structure of one sentence to another structure through the concept of movement known as move-alpha (move α).  This theory (Government and Binding) was developed to correct the lapses in transformational generative grammar (T.G.).</p> <p>          Nevertheless, Government and Binding is misleading because it gives prominence to the two elements of Government and binding whose status was not fundamentally superior to the other sub-theories like       X-bar, theta, case and bounding theory.</p> <p>          Government and Binding proposes seven sub-theories of grammar.  The structures generated at various levels are constrained by a set of theories, which define the kind of relationship possible within a grammar.  The following are the sub-theories of Government and Binding;</p> <p>(i)                X-Bar Theory (XI theory)</p> <p>(ii)             Theta theory (θ theory)</p> <p>(iii)           Case theory</p> <p>(iv)           Bounding Theory</p> <p>(v)             Binding Theory</p> <p>(vi)           Control theory</p> <p>(vii)        Government theory.</p> <p>The above listed sub-theories of Government and Binding theory are closely related in their operation as a theoretical framework.  Each of these transformations operates on the D-Structure and maps the D -Structure into the S-structure.  This can be illustrated by the diagram below:</p> <p>                         Syntactic Components</p> <p>The base: *Phrase structure rules                         Transformation</p> <p>                * Lexicon                                                       Rules </p> <p>Deep structure</p> <p>                                                                               Surface structure</p> <p>           Semantic -                                                         Phonetic –</p> <p>        Interpretation                                                         Interpretation</p> <p>Fig 1.2   (Adapted from Horrocks 1987:27)</p> <p>    The transformational rules operate in-between the Deep Structure and the surface structure.  It should be noted that within the movement theory, we have three major concept involved;  </p> <p>(i)                Extraction site</p> <p>(ii)             Landing site</p> <p>(iii)           Intervening gap.</p> <p>          Horrocks (1987:29) says that “the core grammar of a given language is derived automatically from the interaction of the sub-theories of universal grammar?  Each of the sub-theories accounts for grammaticality or ungrammaticality of any sentence. All these sub-theories of G.B theory operates in a modular form, and this theory itself is referred to as to as a modular form, and this theory itself is referred to as a modular deductive theory of grammar.   Each of these sub-theories will be analyzed one after the other.</p> <p><strong>1.5.1  X-Bar Theory (XI   Theory)</strong></p> <p>          X-bar theory is the theory used in this research work.  The X-bar theory “provides principles for the projection of phrasal categories from lexical categories and imposes conditions on the hierarchical organization of categories in the form of general schemata” (Horrocks 987:101).  X-bar theory is designed to formalize the traditional notion called ‘head’ of a construction and to constrain the system in the recognition that the lexical categories; Noun, verb, adjectives, preposition are the heads and project to their phrasal nodes NP, VP, AP, PP, respectively.  For example, Noun phrase is headed by a Noun.  It comes after possible constituents in the example below.</p> <p><strong>The Man</strong></p> <p>NP         </p> <p>                                       Spec                   N1</p> <p>                                      Det                     N</p> <p>                                     The                     man</p> <p>          Crucially, X-bar theory makes explicit the notion ‘head of a phrase’.  It may be that grammars vary according to the extent to which they utilize the resources made available by X-bar theory.</p> <p>          Chomsky Noam himself has entertained the idea that there are languages in which sentences is simply of a string of words without any higher level organization.  Culicover (1997:134) states that, </p> <p>“Phrase structure concerns the hierarchical and left-right relationship between syntactic categories.</p> <p>In describing the X-bar theory, Chomsky (1986) says, X-bar convention states that “every maximal projection has a specifier of XP position with the intermediate bar projection serving as XP’s core.”  In other words, the X-bar theory brings out what is common in the structure of phrases and projects the characteristics of lexical entries into the syntax which links the D-structure to S-structure and logical form component to the lexicon by specifying the possible context in which a particular item can occur.  The projection from the head to the maximal level is shown below:</p> <p>XP     -        Maximal Projection</p> <p>X1      -        Intermediate</p> <p>X       -        The head</p> <p> </p> <p>Lexical Category</p><p> </p> <p>Intermediate Category</p><p> </p> <p>Phrasal Category</p><p> </p> <p>N</p> <p>N</p> <p>V</p> <p>A</p> <p>P</p> <p>I</p> <p>C</p><p> </p> <p>X1</p> <p>N1</p> <p>V1</p> <p>A1</p> <p>P1</p> <p>I1</p> <p>C1                        </p><p> </p> <p>XP</p> <p>NP</p> <p>VP</p> <p>AP</p> <p>PP</p> <p>1P</p> <p>CP</p><p> </p> <p><strong>Fig 1.3</strong></p> <p><strong>Source: Ndimele (1992:17)</strong></p> <p>          The proponents of X-bar theory argue that “there must be certain intermediate categories between the lexical head and the maximal categories (Ndimele, 1992:12).  This intermediate category is normally represented as “X” which is given the name X-bar theory. “X” is a category variable which stands for any lexical head such as noun, verb e.t.c. It can also stand for non-lexical head such as inflections (I) and complementizer (C).  These elements could head maximal projections.   The maximal projection (XII) stands for any phrase e.g. noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), adjective phrase (AP), inflectional phrase (IP) and compementizer phrase (CP).</p> <p>          The internal structure of X-bar describing a phrase is presented below:</p> <p>                                             X11</p> <p>                    Specifier                      X1</p> <p>                    (spec)</p> <p>                                 X                     Complement</p> <p>          The head ‘X’ takes a complement to form a high X1. The X-bar takes a specifier and projects maximally into a full phrase i.e   X-double bar. X is an obligatory element in the phrase.  The specifier and the complement are the optional elements. </p>\n\nTHE UNEME NOUN PHRASE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE UNEME NOUN PHRASE", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE MERNYANG VERB PHRASE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       GENERAL BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In this project, I shall be examining one of the levels of linguistics that deals with the arrangement of words to form sentence, that is SYNTAX, and my focus shall be on ‘Verb Phrase’ an aspect, which can be referred to as the apex of syntax, with examples from Mernyang language to buttress and establish my facts.</p> <p>By definition, Yusuf O. (1997:1) says: </p> <p>Syntax is the aspect of grammar, which deals with how words are put together to form sentences and how such sentences are interpreted in natural languages.   </p> <p>In the same vein, Horrocks (1987) defines syntax as the study of how sentences are formed and understood.</p> <p>From the above definitions, it can be gathered and submitted that syntax as a level of linguistics is concerned with the study of how words are strung together in an agreeable way to form acceptable and grammatical sentence in a language.</p> <p>Like I have earlier said, I shall be looking at the Verb Phrase with examples, from Mernyang language as a language of study in this research.</p> <p><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>Oral history have it that the Mernyang people are descendant of Kofyar people who lived on top of the hills in Qua’anpan Local Government Area of Plateau States.</p> <p>Mernyang people were said to leave the top the hill and come down to the ground because of their desire to cultivate and toil the land, which is certainly not possible on the hill. As a result of the height of the hill from the ground and the hardship faced by the people when climbing the hills, some decided to stayed back and make an abode for themselves on the plane ground, while those that have the strength to climb the hills still took the top of the hill as their residence. Despite this, the Kofyar and the Mernyang people still see themselves as one and their bond of unity wax stronger everyday.</p> <p>Presently, of all the villages and communities under Qua’anpan Local Government Area, Mernyang standout to be the dominant group, and they are known as ‘Kwa chiefdom’ by the neighbouring villages, while they officially call themselves Pan people.</p> <p>2005 National census states that the community has 10,000 people living within it, and they have about 95,000 speakers of the language scattered round the nooks and crannies of Plateau (Jos) State.</p> <p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>SOCIO-CULTURAL PROFILE OF MERNYANG</strong></p> <p>This has to do with the relationship between the society and culture. It is also concern with the people’s ways of life like; Marriage, Occupation, Religion, Belief, Kingship, Festivals, Dressings.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1        </strong><strong>Occupation</strong></p> <p>The major and predominant occupation of the Mernyang people (speakers) is agriculture. That is farming and animal rearing while the women only lend hand during harvesting period. They plant crops like; millet, guinea corn, maize, tubers etc and rear animals such as; cow, sheep and fowls.</p> <p>The people also engaged in hunting and trading especially during the dry season aside farming and animal rearing which are well and properly practiced during the raining season.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2        </strong><strong>Belief</strong></p> <p>Just like the Yorubas, the Kwa people (Mernyang speakers) also belief in the reincarnation. They belief the ghost of their ancestor did not depart from them after death, but still very much around them.</p> <p>In honouring and acknowledging this fact, a dance festival called SualBeets is usually organized at the middle of each year to celebrate the presence of their dead ancestor with them. This dance (SualBeet) is usually in the company of masquerades who are not regarded as human beings, but spirit of their living dead.</p> <p><strong>1.2.3        </strong><strong>Religion</strong></p> <p>Before the coming of the white missionaries, the Mernyang people are Idol worshippers and they have different shrines where they worship their numerous deities. However, the arrival of the catholic missionaries in the first decade of the 20th century altered a paid visit to the people with the aim of Christianizing them. Also, the people’s encounter with the Hausas and Tivs during hunting expedition and trading licensed Islamic religion in the community.</p> <p>Today Kwa chiefdom and its people are known to be a community of both Muslims and Christians, with the Muslims taking the lead.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4        </strong><strong>Kingship and Leadership</strong></p> <p>The process of ruling in Kwa Chiefdom could be described as Monarchial in that new king is appointed after the death of another one, and democratic in that the enthronement of a new king after the death of another is not based on mere appointment but on election and voting by the members of the community.</p> <p>After the death of one king, interested and rightful people from the next royal family (i.e. family which is the next to produce the successor to the throne) are made to come out publicly and declare their interest to the entire community, while the people of the community will thereafter vote for the one they think is responsible and capable for the task.</p> <p>After this, the kingmaker will interview and assess the person presented to them by the members of the community in order to be sure and ascertain of his competence to deal, control and lead the community. If in the course of their (i.e. the kingmaker) assessment, they discovered any shortcomings in the person presented to them, they returned him back to the people and ask them (member of the community) to vote and present another person for the post (i.e. throne). However, if no shortcoming is found in him, the kingmaker will consult their oracle, carryout all the necessary rites on him and thereafter announce him as the king of the community.</p> <p>The village head is called ‘LON GWA’ which means the king of lawa chiefdom</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.2.5        </strong><strong>Marriage:</strong></p> <p>Marriage in Kwa community is very simple and straightforward. As usual the man and the woman met, the man proposed and when they had both reach an agreement, they went for the marriage ceremonies and celebration.</p> <p>Before the woman is given to the man, the following steps are taken:</p> <p>Firstly, the man who wants to marry will go in the company of his friends to his in-laws house to present his interest in their daughter and also to seek their approval. When going, the man will take along with him a jar of their local gin ‘brukutu’ (properly called ‘i’skolo’ among the people in the community). In response to the man’s proposal, parent of the bride will ask their daughter if she would take the man as her husband. If the girl admits, they ask her to collect the jar of ‘brukutu’ brought by the man as a confirmation of her interest to marry him, and if she doesn’t, the jar of the brukutu will be rejected and the man will be sent away.</p> <p>After this, the next step will be, asking the man to bring his parent so that the two families will both dialogue and choose the day for their traditional wedding.</p> <p>On the day of the traditional wedding, items such as: A keg of palm oil, a bag of salt, 3 cartons of magi cube, 5 goats and 2 rams, 10 fowls and a basket of Benny seed (their local seed meal) will be brought by the groom’s family for the bride price </p> <p>After the payment of the bride price and every other requirement, the groom’s family will take their wife home. They may thereafter go for religious wedding if they so wish and if they don’t, they may not go. What is important is that, traditional wedding has given them the right to be husband and wife.</p> <p>The above listed items are the common items demanded by the bride’s parent for the bride price in the community. However, some families may want more or less of those items.</p> <p><strong>1.2.6        </strong><strong>Food:</strong></p> <p>As I have earlier said, the Mernyang speakers (Kwa people) are predominantly farmers and they grow plant such as millet, maize, Benny seed, tuber etc, which are all used in making their meals.</p> <p>Some of their favourite meals include: </p> <p><strong>CHUGUM:</strong> It is made form millet or guinea corn, grounded with groundnuts, melon, fish and mixed with palm oil and meat cut into pieces. It is made into a thick paste, folded in corn leaves and cooked. The meal to them is nourishing, lasting and easy to convey on a very long journey. </p> <p>Other menu (food) items of the people are: Bala, ishang, gung-gugut, muos, maar, hwan, jituon, chagar etc.</p> <p><strong>1.2.7        </strong><strong>Festivals</strong></p> <p>Among many festivals that the community observed, the most important and most celebrated are the ‘Shikaam’ and the ‘Sual-beet’</p> <p>Shikaam Mernyang as it is called by the people is a festival that is staged by both the Muslims and the Christians in the community in thanksgiving to God for his mercies and blessing over them. The festival brings the sons and daughters of the community from all walks of life together and thus, provide an avenue for them to rob mind together on what could be done to ensure peace, unity, growth and development in their community. The festival holds on every December of each year.</p> <p>Sual-beet on the other hand is staged and embraced by the traditional worshippers. The festival is used to celebrate and pay homage to their dead father (heroes) who according to them do not leave them but still looking after them and prospering their ways after death. The festival holds in the middle of the year (June/July) at the market square of the community. The festival is done in the company of masquerades who are regarded as the living dead.</p> <p><strong>1.2.8        </strong><strong>Dressing</strong></p> <p>The peculiar mode of dressing of Kwa people (Mernyang speakers) is similar to that of the Hausas. The men dressed in ‘babarija’ or ‘dansiki’ with a cap, while the woman dressed in ‘iro’ and ‘buba’, tying the ‘iro’ around their waist in such a manner that it will leave the calf of their leg uncovered.</p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>GENETIC CLASSIFICATION</strong></p> <p>According to Greenberg (1996:129), African languages are classified into four (4): Afro-Asiatic, Niger-Kordofanian, Nilo Sahara and Khoisan, while each has sub-families.

Mahama Dapele.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.8              </strong><strong>BRIEF REVIEW OF THE CHOSEN FRAME WORK</strong></p> <p>Like I have earlier mentioned, the theoretical framework adopted in the analysis of data in this research work is Government and Binding theory.</p> <p>This theory which operates through the modules of grammar, x-bar, case, control, binding, bounding, government and movement theories was propounded by Chomsky in (1981).</p> <p>Haegeman (1994:3) defined Government and Binding theory as a theory of universal grammar, which is the system of all principles that are common to all human languages. GB theory is a radical revision of Chomsky’s earlier theory in (1981) and was later revised in the minimalist programme of (1993). </p> <p>Government and binding theory is a theory of syntax in the tradition of transformational grammar, and it is a more advanced theory of universal grammar. GB theory greatly eliminates proliferation of transformational rules like, affix hopping, passivization, question formation, equi-NP deletion, verb number, insertion, agreement etc.</p> <p>In the current Government and Binding framework, distinction is made between the two types of categories we have;</p> <p>i.                    Lexical category</p> <p>ii.                  Functional category</p> <p>Lexical category in any human language includes, noun, verb, adjective and preposition, while functional categories includes elements like; complementizer, tense, inflectional, determiner focus, agreement etc.</p> <p>Syntactically, while the lexical categories projects up to a single bar level and terminate there, thus making endless reason possible with the aid of elements like complements and modifiers, the functional categories project up to the specifier of XP level thus sealing off the projection. A specifier is an element that closes off a category projection.</p> <p>Lexical categories are represented with the aid of tree diagrams below:</p> <p>NP       =          N” (XP)           VP   =   V”                 AP       =          A”</p> <p>            Spec                N             Spec        V’                        Spec            A’</p> <p>            Det                  N0                                    V0                                  Det           A0</p> <p>            The                  boy                              dance                           very          well</p> <p>PP  =    P”</p> <p>   Spec P’</p> <p>                        P0 </p> <p>                        In</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Functional categories are also represented with the aid of diagram below:</p>\n\nTHE MERNYANG VERB PHRASE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE MERNYANG VERB PHRASE", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF SLANG AND CATCHY PHRASES USED IN SOME SELECTED NIGERIAN HIP-HOP SONGS.</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Slangy expressions and catchy phrases are deliberately used in hip-hop songs in order to reduce the degree of vulgarity in the content of the song so as not to disrupt society moral norms, and to increase the rate of acceptability of such song amidst listeners, to avoid direct stating of the name of the referent (s) in a satirical song for instance, and also for singers to create a landmark worth discussing even while the song is no longer in vogue.</p> <p>Aside all these, slang forms and catchy phrases give linguistic aesthetics to song and most importantly, they enable singers to pass across a whole lot of messages, even while they utter just few of these messages. This implies that there are hidden messages in slang forms and catchy phrases used in hip-hop songs, and for these hidden messages to be known to listeners, a particular level of language analysis has to be put in place. This level is found to be pragmatics.  It is therefore to this end that this study sets out to undertake a pragmatic analysis of slang and catchy phrases used in some selected Nigerian hip-hop songs.</p> <p>The objective of this study is to identify the real meanings of slang forms and catchy phrases that are used in Nigerian hip-hop songs, with reference to the overall meanings of these songs themselves. This identification will in turn help us to state the reasons why they (these slang forms and catchy phrases) are used in the songs and their contributions to the singers’ intended meanings of these songs. Haven achieved this objective, we conclude that, for real meanings of hip-hop songs to be known to all and sundry, a pragmatic analysis is necessary.  </p> <p>                                      TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>General Introduction</p> <p>Purpose of the Research</p> <p>Justification of the Study</p> <p>1.4.                   Research question</p> <p>1.5.                   Research Hypothesis</p> <p>1.6.                   Scope of the Study</p> <p>1.7.                   Methodology of Research</p> <p>2.0            CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>2.1.              Pragmatic</p> <p>2.1.1.0             Goals of Pragmatics and its Theories</p> <p>2.1.1.1              Goals of Pragmatics Theories</p> <p>2.1.2.0             Theories of Pragmatics</p> <p>2.1.2.1A.J.L.  Austin’s Theory</p> <p>2.1.2.2John .R Searle’s Theory</p> <p>2.1.2.3Kent Bach and Robert Harnish’s Theory</p> <p>2.1.3.0Elements of Pragmatic</p> <p>2.1.3.1Intention</p> <p>2.1.3.2Presupposition</p> <p>2.1.3.3Inference</p> <p>2.1.3.4Reference</p> <p>2.1.3.5Implicature</p> <p>2.1.3.6Speech Act</p> <p>2.1.3.7Context</p> <p>2.2                   Aspects of meaning in pragmatics</p> <p>2.2.1            Meaning</p> <p>2.2.2     Denotation and connotation </p> <p>2.2.3             Encoding and decoding              </p> <p>2.3             Slang              </p> <p>2.3.1            Kinds of slang</p> <p>2.3.2               Usages of slang            </p> <p>2.4            Hip-hop</p> <p>2.4.1             Definition and evolution of hip-hop</p> <p>2.4.2             Old school hip-hop             </p> <p>2.4.3            Golden era of hip-hop</p> <p>2.4.4             Hip-hop in Nigeria             </p> <p>3.0 CHAPTER THREE:  DATA ANALYSIS</p> <p>3.1Song A: - ‘Maryjane’ by vector da viper</p> <p>3.1.1Short   summary</p> <p>3.1.2Identified slangy forms</p> <p>2.1.3Analysis of identified slangy forms</p> <p>3.2Song B:-‘Petepete’   (mud) by 9ice</p> <p>3.2.1Short summary</p> <p>3.2.2Identified catchy phrases</p> <p>3.2.3Analysis of identified catchy phrases</p> <p>3.3Song C:-‘Otiyanyan’  by Slimjoe</p> <p>3.3.1Short summary</p> <p>3.3.2Identified slangy forms/Catchy phrases</p> <p>3.3.3Analysis of identified slangy forms/catchy phrases</p> <p>3.4.Song D:-‘Enter d place’ by 2face Idibia</p> <p>3.4.1Short summary   </p> <p>3.4.2Identified slangy forms</p> <p>3.4.3Analysis of identified slangy forms</p> <p>4.0                CHAPTER FOUR:  SUMMARY, FINDINGS &amp;CONCLUSION</p> <p>4.1Introduction</p> <p>4.2Summary</p> <p>4.3Findings</p> <p>4.4Conclusions</p> <p>                        Bibliography</p> <p>                        Appendix .</p> <p>1.0  CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Language is a major and an indispensable tool in human existence. No wonder Microsoft Encarta (2009) defines it as “the principal means used by human beings to communicate with one another”. Language is primarily spoken, although it can be transferred to other media such as written, non-verbal and so on. It is therefore, the bedrock of communication which holds a society together. </p> <p>Communication occurs in various ways: in the forms of, interaction through conversation (discourse), speech delivery, the media (such as radio and television), sign language, music (irrespective of the genre) and many others. It is a point worth nothing here that, in each of these forms, pieces of information are essentially being invested with different senses(meanings), and passed across to different kinds of individuals who in turn deduce various meanings from the information passed, based on their individual views and prejudices about such information. Therefore, Mr. Ade’s interpretation of “i love you” may be different from that of Miss Kemi’s, even if the person singing/saying the utterance is the same. The whole of this process is called “encoding and decoding”.</p> <p>Hip-hop is one of the genres of music, it is denotatively referred to as a type of modern dance music with spoken words and a steady beat played on electronic instruments. The Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (2000, p.566). Nigerian hip-hop, the major concern of this research work consists of hip-hop songs, written, composed, arranged, sung, promoted, and marketed in Nigeria for Nigerians.The composition of Nigerian hip-hop songs involves the careful use of lexis (the total of words or vocabulary in a language) which appropriately expresses minds of hip-hop singers.Another important aspect in the lexis of Nigerian hip-hop is the “use of slang”. Elbe, (1996,p.3) defines slang as an ever changing and fashionable set of vocabulary of sociability used to express or reinforce identity cohesiveness within a group with a trend or fashion in a society at large. </p> <p>It is to be  noted that, certain lexical items are used in Nigerian hip-hop songs, especially those sung in Nigerian native languages (Yoruba,  Igbo and Hausa), which do not perfectly fit into the space of a slang but are at the same time, not to be categorized as conventional day to day lexis. These lexical items for the purpose of this work, are tagged, “Catchy phrases”. An example is Atilaawi (Yoruba) (meaning “the one, whom we are talking about’’) which is deliberately chosen by a Yoruba hip-hop singer to satirize (criticize) a particular leader.</p> <p>At this juncture, we can easily assert, that slangy forms and catchy phrases take an important quota in hip-hop songs in Nigeria.However, if the real meanings of these slangy forms and catchy phrases within the contexts of these songs will be known, a particular level of language analysis has to be put in place. This level of language analysis is found to be pragmatics.</p> <p>Adegbija (1999, p.18) defines pragmatics as “the study of language use in particular communicative contexts”. Pragmatics is an important aspect in the use of slangy expressions because it is necessary to decode the messages embedded in slang. Olukoya (2010, p.2), this is to enable listeners to deduce the overall meanings of the utterance within which these slangy forms are used.</p> <p>As a result of this, in this research work, we intend to identify the real meanings of slangy expressions and catchy phrases that are used in Nigerian hip-hop songs with reference to the overall meanings of these songs themselves. This will enable us to point out the reason why they were used in the songs and their contributions to the singers’ intended meanings. The purpose of all these is to make this form of music more accessible to all and sundry by enhancing their comprehension through a pragmatic analysis</p> <p>1.2                  PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH.</p> <p> The purpose of this essay is to justify the deliberate insertion of slangy expressions and catchy phrases in the composition and rendition of Nigerian hip-hop songs. The study aims at asserting the fact that the singers’ intended meanings of these songs would not have been realizable without these slangy expressions and catchy phrases used in them. It therefore pragmatically analyses these slangy forms and catchy phrases with reference to the overall meanings of the songs.</p> <p>JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>In the course of gathering materials for this research work, we came across several other researches but only two of them are related to the topic in question. They are “A pragmatic Analysis of Slang Forms Used for Females Students in the university of Ilorin” Olukoya, B. (2010) and “A pragmatic Analysis of the Titles of English Church lyrics” Indarno (2000). None of these two deal with the specific focus of this research work. This essay is therefore embarked upon to add to existing knowledge and to enable readers to know that there is a lot more information beyond the surface meanings of the hip-hop songs they listen to.</p> <p>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>What are the factors that instigate a hip-hop singer’s choice of lexical   items in the composition of his songs?</p> <p>What things does the singer generally take for granted about thehearers of the song?</p> <p> What makes the inflection of slangy expressions and catchy phrases compulsory, can’t they be avoided?</p> <p>1.5      RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>1) No hip-hop singer ever uses lexical items in his/her compositionwithout a reason </p> <p>2) Listeners of hip-hop songs usually, generally share certain salient facts and information about the context of the songs with the singers.</p> <p>Certain slangy forms and catchy phrases are necessary.</p> <p> 1.6   SCOPE OF THE STUDY.</p> <p>This research work uses; a maximum of four (4) Nigerian hip-hop songs as data within which slangy forms and catchy phrases will be extracted. Also only the illocutionary speech act and five (5) other elements of pragmatics, which are context, presupposition, reference, intention, and inference, will be used in the analysis. This restriction is due to the fact that there are a lot of elements in pragmatics, some of which are specifically gotten from pragmatic and some others, gotten from theories of meaning and semantics. Therefore, in order to be explicit and to stay within the allocated paper space for this research work, this restriction is necessary.</p> <p>1.7     METHODOLOGY</p> <p>In carrying out this research work, four (4) Nigerian hip-hop songs will be selected as data within which slangy forms and unusual lexical items will be extracted. They are, “Maryjane” by vector Da Viper, “Petepete`” by 9ice, “Otiyanyan” by Slimjoe, and ‘‘Enter the place” by 2face. (Artists’ names are written in the forms they are referred to, by Nigerians and tracks are produced in Nigeria for Nigerians). The albums within which these tracks will be extracted respectively are State of Surprise (2010), Tradition (2010), Otiyanyan Reloaded (2010) and Unstoppable (2010).</p> <p>The criteria for selecting these tracks revolve around language, whose usage is the primary concern of this work. “Maryjane” combines pure English, pidgin version of it, and a German variety of English (Patois), “Petepete” (mud) is sung using a purely native Nigerian language(Yoruba), ‘‘Otiyanyan’’ is sung, using a combination of a native Nigerian language (Yoruba) and the pidgin variety of English language, while ‘‘Enter the place’’ is sung using the pidgin variety of English alone. These tracks will be carefully and repeatedly listened to in order to gather their lyrics. Also, consultations will be made into library reference materials, textbooks, and the internet in order to get materials relating to pragmatics, music (hip-hop), and slang and also meaning in general.</p> <p>The intended technique of analysis will involve a short general description of the songs, one after the other, and identification of slangy forms and catchy phrases found in them. Finally, a detailed pragmatic analysis of these slangy forms and catchy phrases will be done using illocutionary act, context, presupposition, reference, intention and inference. It is to be noted, that the direct, full version of the lyrics of the songs will be attached as appendix in this research work.</p>\n\nA PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF SLANG AND CATCHY PHRASES USED IN SOME SELECTED NIGERIAN HIP-HOP SONGS.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF SLANG AND CATCHY PHRASES USED IN SOME SELECTED NIGERIAN HIP-HOP SONGS.", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>symbols of decadence in ayi kwei armah’s the beautyful ones are not yet born</strong></p> <p><strong>Chapter one</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       introduction</strong></p> <p>This chapter introduces the major variable (Symbols of Decadence) in the research topic as well as give a brief background of the text adopted for critical analysis.</p> <p>The text selected for the study therefore, focuses on the concept of symbols of decadence as well as its relevance to socio-economic and political cleansing of the Ghanaian society.</p> <p>            A symbol was defined according to Northrop Frye in his book “Anatomy of criticism” is something such as object, picture, written word, sound or particular mark that represents something else by association resemblance or convention for example, a red octagon may be a symbol for “stop”. On map crossed sabres may indicate a battlefield. All language consists of symbols personal numberals are symbols for numbers names are symbols representing individuals.</p> <p>            Swiss Psychoanalyst Carl Jung, who studied archetypes, proposed an alternative definition of symbol distinguishing it from the term sign. In Jung’s view, a sign stands for something known, as a word stands for its referent. He contrasted this with symbol which he used to stand for something that is unknown and that cannot be made clear or precise. An example of a symbol in this sense is Christ as a symbol of the archetype called self.</p> <p>            Decadence according to Oscar Wilde; he gave a curious definition “Classicism in the subordination of the parts to the whole, decadence is the subordination of the whole to the parts”.</p> <p>            It can also be the state of being degenerate in metal or moral qualities. A state of moral or artistic decline or determination decay. It can be refer to a personal trait or to the state of a society (or segment of it).</p> <p>            Often decadence a literary movement especially of last 19th century France and England characterized by refined aestheticism artifice and the guest for new sensation. The state reacted through such a process.       </p> <p>Symbol is totally different from an Anecdote, Metaphor, Figure of Speech and Imagery. Symbol is different from Anecdote which is a short and amusing or interesting story about a real incident or person. It may be as brief as the setting and provocation of a bon mol. An anecdote is always presented as based on a red incident involving actual persons, whether famous on not usually in an identifiable place, also figure of speech is use or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words in it, such as a metaphor, simile and personification etc. Figures of speech often provide emphasis freshness of expression or clarity. Clarity may also suffer from their use as any figures of speech introduce an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation. A figure of speech of sometime called rhetoric or a locution.</p> <p>Moreover, Metaphor on the other hand is a figure of speech, in which an implied comparism is made between two unlike things that actually have something important in common.  Metaphor is a Greek word meaning ‘to transfer’ or ‘carry across’, quality or state can be compared without using the words like or as. It is thus a condensed form of simile. Imagery is different from Symbol, it is a form of mental images, figures or likeness as of some images. Collectively the imagery or a dream, pectoral images collectively, especially those produced by the activity of imagination.</p> <p><strong>1.1       theoretical frame work and methodology</strong></p> <p>The Marxist theory will be adopted for the critical analysis of the text, out of all the theory, Marxism is a modern theory where dialectic materialism is emphasized. When literature began to be recognized as a weapon for social change, as a struggle of the individual for economic and political power. </p> <p>Marxists tell us about past and present social relations and implications of an author’s work; what they should have been or ought to be.</p> <p>The ideological aspects are of interest to Marxists who operate on the theory of political economy. Attention is paid in the main to the struggle of opposites (dialectics) and to the examination of social contradictions in the society. These  is  an   emphasis on class propaganda and revolutionary didacticism as well as the ideological specification of the total state. There is also emphasis on the deterministic origin of art, the economic and social status (proletarian, pseudo-bourgeois or aristocratic) of artists and artisans in various past eras.</p> <p>Marxism was originated by Karl Marx in 19th century, a political thinker. Hence this text aims at an analytical application of the traditional mode to indicate the ideological exegesis of the various schools indicated, (Ibrahim &amp; Akande, 2000,21). Marxist approach aims at an analytical application of the traditional mode to indicate the ideological exegesis of the various schools indicated for Karl Marx himself “Combines traditional materialism with the critical analysis of development bringing out the conflict between the original direction, its direct opposite and their unification”. The African write pre-occupation is to negate the happening in the growing urban cities include Festus Iyayi, Zaynab Alkali, Olu Obafemi, Niyi Osundare,  Odia Ofeimum, Tanuri Ojoide etc.</p> <p>Symbol and decadence are related because decadence in the society is a symbol, a machinery of oppression in the human society. These symbols of decadence therefore constitute a problem that the Marxist writers seek to address in the Marxist theory.</p> <p>The research findings here revealed that there is decadence, oppression and corruption in the society, but the problem of this research is now encountering is the issue of how these vices of the society which can be termed as basically ‘Symbols of decadence’ affect the larger human society that make up the proletariat. The psychological and emotional trauma of Sigmund Freud (1967) of the effect of these channels of depriving the society their rights is a major issue that this research addresses.</p> <p>The methodology of this work focuses on the theory of Marxism theory. The theory will then focus on the thematic concern of symbols and decadence of the text selected for the study. The thematic concern incorporates sub-themes in the story that will revolve around this major theme to develop the elements in the theory for the analysis.</p> <p>The population for the study is textual population under study are not real human being, but characters that are rigid in a story are accessible. The text used which represent the struggle of individual in The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born. We have some characters that share different perspective on the view of symbol and decadence. The author pick-out some character to represent the corrupt society, Armah create a gap between the haves and have not.</p> <p>Joseph Koomson also known as Joe Koomson represents the rich and ‘The Man’ represent the poor in the society.</p> <p>We can then imply that the author have stratified the population the text, thus the stratified sampling will be adopted for study. The discourse of the major character will be used to focus on the major theme of the text alongside the elements identifiable in the Marxism theory.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The research problems are areas of concern that affect the human society. The questions to be focused on, in order to overcome this problem therefore, are these research questions:</p> <p>1.         What are the symbols of decadence in the society?</p> <p>2.         How has decadence cause trauma and loss of hope in the human society?</p> <p>3.         What are the ways in which decadence can be overcomed in the society?</p> <p>The decadence in the society is a symbol or vices that have been affecting the human society, especially Africa for decades. The research hypothesis therefore would be that decadence, corruption and oppression can be wiped out, if man would change for the better, if people can be more contented and have the fear of God. If this could happen, the present today will give birth to a better tomorrow when the Beautyful Ones will be Born in Africa and the world as a whole.</p> <p><strong>1.3       AUTHORIAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>Ayi Armah was born at Sekondi-Takoradi a place now called Ghana in 1939. He attended Secondary School at Achimota College and Groton, he went to Harvard to get a degree in Sociology and Columbia to get an MFA in creative Writing. He has worked as a translator and a teacher at Amherst and the University of Wisconsin at Madison as well as several African Institutions. </p> <p>Armah was also an editor of Jeune Afrique in 1968-1969 and it shows the intense concern with social and political commitment which was further energized by the atmosphere of increasing political activism, he encountered in United State especially among African and American.</p> <p>His first novel The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born was published in (1968). It is still in print and is considered a Modern African classic. He has written numerous novels which include Fragments (1970) Why Are We So Blest? (1974) and Two Thousand Seasons in (1979).</p> <p><strong>1.4       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this research is to examine symbol of decadence in this text: Ayi Kwei Armah The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born. TH</p> <p>he study also aims at examining the elements in the story that constitutes the data.</p> <p><strong>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study is very wide, as the research variables symbols of decadence is a concept that is interrelated and wide in scope but the research limits its scope to the issues of symbol and decadence in the text adopted for the study. </p> <p>The symbols of decadence are issue that require of relevant and adequate attention as they affect the human society. Ayi Kwei Armah addresses the ills of the society  and all the channels of perpetrating these vices in the community.</p> <p>These issues are those that the study addresses and the limit will be on the vices as they eat into the deep core of the society.</p> <p><strong>1.6       JUSTIFICATION </strong></p> <p>            The justification of this work is that symbol and decadence is simple to study and according to the findings researchers have dealt with the novel that have only limited their study to either class differences or oppress. This research will therefore examine how the authors have addressed the issue of symbols of decadence in his work.</p> <p>             Symbol and decadence are the key vital image that constitutes the problems that affect the masses. These symbols will be areas of focus that will be addressed in the course of the study. Government, citizen and the entire human society will benefit from this study. The notion of the people about oppression and corruption will change if people can be truthful and also live a corrupt-free life.</p>\n\nSYMBOLS OF DECADENCE IN AYI KWEI ARMAH’S THE BEAUTYFUL ONES ARE NOT YET BORN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SYMBOLS OF DECADENCE IN AYI KWEI ARMAH’S THE BEAUTYFUL ONES ARE NOT YET BORN", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>SYNTACTIC AND LEXICO-SEMANTIC ANALYSES OF SELECTED SMS TEXT MESSAGES AMONG THE UNIVERSITY OF ILORIN STUDENTS</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>                            Words form the basis for a Linguistic analysis at any level of language study. The aim of this essay was to identify the various Lexical and Syntactic elements that make up personal text messages among the students of the University of Ilorin. Lexical features, Lexical relations, Word-formation processes and Word Sequences were employed to unravel the Lexical and Syntactic elements contained in selected text messages. Among the findings in the work were that nouns are the most prominent lexical features in the personal text messages of the students of the University of Ilorin, while adverbs are the least used lexical features in the composition of these messages. It was also discovered that most of the words that were used in composing the messages were created through the word-formation process of derivation and that simple sentences in the most used sentence sequences in these messages. The conclusion in the essay was that effective communication through personal text messages among the University of Ilorin students can be ensued, if the receivers of the messages take into cognizance the various Lexical and Syntactic elements identified in their interpretation.  </p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 Introduction                                                                                                                                       </p> <p>1.2 Statement of the Research Problem                                                                                             </p> <p>1.3 The Purpose of the Study                                                                                                                </p> <p>1.4 Scope of the Study                                                                                                                           </p> <p>1.5 Justification of the study                                                                                                                 </p> <p>1.6 Methodology                                                                                                                                     </p> <p>1.7 Data Description                                                                                                                               </p> <p>1.8 Summary                                                                                                                                            </p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>2.1 Introduction                                                                                                                                       </p> <p>2.2 The Meaning of Lexis                                                                                                                        </p> <p>2.3 Lexical Features                                                                                                                                  </p> <p>2.4 Lexical Relations                                                                                                                                  </p> <p>2.5 Word-formation Processes                                                                                                               </p> <p>2.6 The Sequence of Words                                                                                                                     </p> <p>2.7 A Brief Examination of Semantics                                                                                                     </p> <p>2.8 Lexico-semantics                                                                                                                                  </p> <p>2.9 SMS Text Messaging in Nigeria                                                                                                          </p> <p>2.10 Summary                                                                                                                                              </p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>DATA ANALYSIS</p> <p>3.1 Introduction                                                                                                                                                    </p> <p>3.2 Lexical Features                                                                                                                                     </p> <p>3.3 Lexical Relations                                                                                                                                    </p> <p>3.4 Word-formation Processes                                                                                                                  </p> <p>3.5 Sequence of Words</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>DISCUSSION</p> <p>4.1 Summary                                                                                                                                                  </p> <p>4.2 Findings                                                                                                                                                     </p> <p>4.3 Conclusion                                                                                                                                                 </p> <p>REFERENCES                                                                                                                                                      </p> <p>APPENDIX                                                                                                                             </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 INTRODUCTION </p> <p>Communication through an effective use of language is a tool that makes a good human relationship. Human beings are considered higher animals because of their ability to communicate effectively through the use of language. Language as a tool for effective communication is the most important part of a human being that makes him different from animals, Adedimeji (2005,p.1). As a result of this great role language plays in a man’s life, language is studied at five major levels in linguistics (Tomori,1977,p.21 as cited by Adedimeji,2005,p.1). These levels are Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics and Pragmatics. Words are very essential in every level of language analysis.</p> <p>          A Lexeme as defined by Crystal (2008) is “a term used by some linguists to refer to the minimal distinctive unit in the semantic system of a language”.  Crystal (2008) also defined Semantics as “a major branch of linguistics devoted to the study of meaning in a language”. Lexico-semantics therefore combines both the meaning of ‘Lexemes’ and ‘Semantics’. It originated from the linguistic fields of Lexicology and Semantics. Lexico-semantics as a subfield of Semantics addresses words and their meanings. It investigates the daily use of words among interactants with the aim of effective communication. Lexico-semantics deals with the relationship that exists between words, their meanings and the messages they convey. </p> <p>SMS is a short message service that allows information to be passed across from one person to another, over a network at a particular rate. SMS is used as an abbreviation for all types of short text messaging in many parts of the world. SMS text messaging is one medium of communication that has found its way into the system of communication over the past few years. It is one technological device that its use is fast growing over a wide range in the whole of Africa and even the globe.</p> <p>                                 Communication through SMS is done by no other means but by the use of words. Lexemes are used to facilitate the effectiveness of this device. The effectiveness of this medium of communication depends on the appropriate combination of the words it carries, and in the combination of these words lies what is known as the message. Therefore, the relationship that exists between Lexico-semantics and SMS text messaging is effective communication, which is made possible through an appropriate combination of words into text messages.</p> <p>                                 From the foregoing, this work aims to investigate and identify the processes involved in the creation of these words, the various lexical relations and features that exist among the words that make up text messages. This will enhance a better interpretation and prevent misinterpretations among participants.</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM</p> <p>                                 The problem which this work intends to solve is the problem of the misinterpretation of text messages as a result of a wrong choice of words or arrangement of lexemes in the composition of text messages, thereby leading to a breakdown in communication. This work intends to identify the various word-formation processes involved in the creation of new words, the lexical features and relationships that exist among words and also how these words are sequenced to build larger grammatical units.  This work also intends to examine how these words contribute to the interpretation of a text message, thereby leading to better choices of words on the part of the sender and a more precise interpretation on the part of the receiver.</p> <p>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>                                 The purpose of this study is to contribute to the body of knowledge through an investigation into the combination of word and their meaning in conveying an SMS. This work seeks to examine selected personal text messages sent by the students of the University of Ilorin between the ages of 18-25 years, identify the word-formation processes, lexical features and relations that exist among the lexemes that are contained in them. Also, how the knowledge of the lexical and semantic relations contribute to the meaning of the text messages would be examined. This will help to promote a better understanding of text messages.</p> <p>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>                                 This work will focus basically on the analysis of thirty personal text messages of the University of Ilorin students between the ages of 18-25 years. The analysis will be carried out through an identification of the word-formation processes, lexical features and relations and the word sequences among the words that make up these messages. The study will also take a look at the sequencing of words in the messages and how all these features contribute to the understanding of these messages.</p> <p>1.5 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>                                 This work is based on an analysis of SMS text messages using a Lexico-semantic approach. Several other studies have been conducted on SMS text messages. Among these are Awonusi (2004), who did “A Sociolinguistic study of SMS text messages as a register in Nigerian English”, Egbe (2005), discussed the “Aspects of the Grammar of SMS text messages”, Alabi, (2010b), wrote on “Stylistic creativity via schemes: Tropes, Lexical cohesion and Descriptive Adjectives in SMS text messaging among Nigerian university Graduates”.</p> <p>                                 However, going by the above, it can be observed that SMS text messages have been studied from various fields of linguistics ranging from Sociolinguistics, to Grammar, to Stylistics, etc. This study is however adding to the knowledge and analysis of SMS text messages in the Lexico-semantic field. This work will be of great relevance and a reference point to students of communication studies, users of SMS text messaging as a medium of communication and students of English language and literature.</p> <p>1.6 METHODOLOGY</p> <p>                                 The selection of data for analysis in this study has been done randomly. The sources for the data for analysis in this study are text messages sent by the University of Ilorin students between the ages of 18-25 years. Out of these text messages, this work will focus on personal text messages (Chiluwa,2007, p.98 as cited  by  Alabi,2010b,p.1). Thirty personal text messages have been selected for analysis in this work. These messages represent the whole body of personal text messages and are considered suitable for the purpose for which this work is conducted. The analysis ofthese messages will be done through an identification of various elements that characterize lexemes i.e. word-formation processes, lexical relations and features and word sequencing in contributing to the messages they pass across as a result of  their  co-occurrence in an expression.</p> <p>1.7 DATA DESCRIPTION</p> <p>                                 SMS was first used in December 1992 by a 22-year-old named Neil  Papworth. The concept of SMS was developed by Friedhelm Hillebrand, Bernard  Ghillebaert and Oculy Silaban in 1984, in the Franco-German GSM cooperation. However, following the inception of the Global System of Mobile communication (GSM) in Nigeria, in the year 2001, Alabi, (2010b), SMS text messaging has become a major medium of passing across information from one person to another irrespective of the distance between the ‘sender’ an ‘receiver’. MTN, which happened to be the first GSM Company in Nigeria, commenced its commercial services in August 2001. This commencement brought the Short Message Service (SMS) to limelight in the Nigerian communication system. Ever since then, text messaging has taken different turns.</p> <p>                                 The data for analysis in this study are personal text messages, as described by Chiluwa (2007) as “well wishing messages and messages that are used to express emotions”. Thirty of these messages have been selected for analysis using certain tools that will be discussed in the next chapter.</p> <p>1.8 SUMMARY</p> <p>                                 So far in this chapter, an insight into the variables of the topic of this  study has been created, the purpose, scope, justification and methodology for this  study  have been discussed. A more extensive and detailed discussion of the approach to the  study and its elements is hoped to be discussed in the next chapter, which is the  literature  review.</p>\n\nSYNTACTIC AND LEXICO-SEMANTIC ANALYSES OF SELECTED SMS TEXT MESSAGES AMONG THE UNIVERSITY OF ILORIN STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SYNTACTIC AND LEXICO-SEMANTIC ANALYSES OF SELECTED SMS TEXT MESSAGES AMONG THE UNIVERSITY OF ILORIN STUDENTS", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF CHIMAMANDA </strong></p> <p><strong>NGOZI ADICHIE’S <em>THE THING AROUND YOUR NECK</em></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>Stylistics is the study and interpretation of texts from literary and linguistic perspectives. As a discipline it links literary criticism and linguistics. A stylistic analysis entails studying in details the features of written or spoken texts and stating what functions they perform in the context of the texts. The features chosen from any text are dealt with in three ways; identification, description and purpose. The method of analysis is purely scientific.</p> <p>            Carter (1989, p.162) suggests that the practice of stylistics comes about at any point of intersection of the language of a text with the elements which constitute literariness of that text. The point of focus in stylistics is the recognition of how a text works as a whole. It attempts to establish principles capable of explaining the particular choice made by social groups in their use of language and the production or reception of meaning. Stylistics is practiced as a part of understanding the possible meanings in a text. It is also generally assumed that the process of analysis will reveal the qualities of a work.</p> <p>            Stylistics is the study of style used in literary and non literary texts and the effect a writer or speaker wishes to communicate to the reader or hearer. It is mainly concerned with the idea of style, the analysis of literary texts and the application of linguistics to literary and non literary texts. Since every writer possesses his or her own particular way of writing and thinking, language use is different from one writer to another. To appreciate a literary work, it is important to see how the language and style used by the writer affect the interpretation of the work. Stylistics focuses on texts and gives much attention to the devices and style. It therefore, discusses theoretical matters alongside whatever practical analysis they provide.</p> <p>            Stylistic analysis besides helping one to acquire an explicit basis for deciding between interpretations also helps one to become more consciously aware of the processes of interpretation which are used in order to get to grips with the text one has read.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>Adichie, being a young writer in exile, has written many books which have won several awards including her latest novel <em>The Thing Around Your Neck</em>. So many reviews have been done on the book and that is why the Daily Telegraph (UK) says this about the book “Adichie writes with an economy and precision that makes the strange seem familiar, she makes story telling seem as easy as a bird song”.</p> <p>            It is therefore important to study how Adichie has been able to manipulate language to create stylistic effects to pass her message across to the readers.</p> <p><strong>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>            The purpose of this work is to examine the basic linguistic features that have been used by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in <em>The Thing Around Your Neck </em>to pass her message across to the readers and the society.</p> <p>            Since language is an important tool used in literature, and language use differs from one writer to another, how then has the writer been able to employ language to create stylistic effects?  The effect of her language use on the overall appreciation of the work will be studied.</p> <p><strong>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            This work will make use of Adichie’s <em>The Thing Around Your Neck</em> as its primary source. A stylistic analysis shall be done to know how the writer has been able to manipulate language to achieve certain effects. This analysis shall be conducted using the following elements of stylistics, graphology, morphology, phonology, syntax, lexico-semantics and point of view.</p> <p><strong>1.5       JUSTIFICATION </strong>   </p> <p>            A study of this nature is important as it helps us to know how language contributes to meaning generation in Adichie’s <em>The Thing Around Your Neck</em> which has qualified the book published in 2009, to win various prizes. Since a literary work cannot be complete without an effective use of language, it is significant to study how Adichie has employed language to create stylistic effects.</p> <p>            This work will expand the frontiers of knowledge. It will make a place in the body of knowledge and help upcoming researchers to understand how Adiche has employed stylistic devices in her text.</p> <p><strong>1.6       METHODOLOGY </strong>      </p> <p>            This research will adopt a functional approach, an approach where particular note is taken of the stylistic function, effect and thematic significance of linguistic features in a literary text.</p> <p>            The essay will study the society created by the writer through the character and situations in the text. <em>The Thing Around Your Neck</em> will serve as the primary source. There will also be reliance on secondary materials such as text books, stylistics dictionary and internet sources.</p> <p><strong>1.7       THE AUTHOR </strong></p> <p>            Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie was born in 1977 in Enugu, Nigeria. She studied medicine and pharmacy at the University of Nigeria then moved to the US to study communications and political science at Eastern Connecticut State University. She obtained an MA in creative writing from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore.</p> <p>            After initially writing poetry and one play, <em>For the love of Biafra</em> (1998), she wrote several short stories published in literary journals. She has won various competition prizes. The first novel <em>Purple Hibiscus</em> was published in 2003 and is set in the political turmoil of 1990’s Nigeria. The narrative was told from the perspective of a 15-year-old Kambili Achike. <em>Purple Hibiscus</em> won the 2005 commonwealth writers prize (overall winner, best book) and was shortlisted for the 2004 orange prize for fiction. Her second novel, <em>Half of a Yellow Sun</em> 2006 was set before and during the Biafra war. It won the 2007 orange broadband prize for fiction.  </p> <p>Her latest book is a collection of short stories; <em>The Thing Around Your Neck</em> (2009), shortlisted for the 2009 John Llewellyn-Rhys Memorial prize and the 2010 commonwealth writers prize (Africa Region, Best Book). Chimamanda lives between Nigeria and the United States</p> <p><strong>1.8       DATA DESCRIPTION</strong></p> <p>In the novel published in 2009, the writer turns her penetrating eye on not only Nigeria but America, in twelve dazzling stories that explore the ties that bind men and women, parents and children, Africa and the United states with a few telling details that do not portray one culture superior to the other.</p> <p>            In “A private experience”, a medical student hides from a violent riot with a poor Muslim woman whose dignity and faith force her to confront the realities and fears she has been pushing away. In “Tomorrow is too far”<em>,</em> a woman unlocks the devastating secret that surrounds her brother’s death. In “Imitation”<em>,</em> a young mother finds her comfortable life in Philadelphia threatened when she learns that her husband has moved his mistress into their home in Lagos. “The Thing Around Your Neck” depicts the choking loneliness of a Nigerian girl who moves to America that turns out to be nothing like the country she expected though falling in love brings her desires nearly within reach, a death in her homeland forces her to re-examine them.</p> <p>“Searing and profound, Suffused with beauty<em>, </em>sorrow and longing, the collision of two cultures and the deep human struggle to reconcile them”. <em>The Thing Around Your Neck a</em>ccording to the back cover of the book, “is a resounding confirmation of the prodigious literary powers of one of our most essential writers”.</p>\n\nA STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF CHIMAMANDA  NGOZI ADICHIE’S THE THING AROUND YOUR NECK<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF CHIMAMANDA  NGOZI ADICHIE’S THE THING AROUND YOUR NECK", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>SATIRE AND SOCIAL MEDIATION IN WOLE SOYINKA’S: </p> <p>A CASE STUDY OF <em>THE TRIALS OF BROTHER JERO AND A PLAY OF GIANTS</em></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>          This research endeavour focuses on the social and political ills prevalent in the African societies with the view of correcting them thus, making the contemporary society a better place to live. Using two texts from renowned Nigeria writer, we see the economic, social and political evils which morally degrade our society and the community at last.

However, literature goes beyond just mirroring the society to depict various aspects of human life.</p> <p>          The social, political, economical, religions and historical aspects of human lives are portrayed through literature. Basically, there are three major genres of literature, poetry prose and drama.</p> <p>          For the sake of this study, we shall concentrate on the dramatic generic form of literature and the social mediation.</p> <p>          Drama represents life in a more distinctive way. It educates, entertains, orientates and satirizes. Drama originates from the Greek worship of gods in the classical period as a form of ritual.</p> <p>          This research concentrates on the concept of satire used by African playwrights (using Wole Soyinka as case studies) to effect societal transformation.</p> <p>          Satire according to the <em>Dictionary of Literary Terms</em> (1977) is a literary work intended to arouse ridicule, contempt and follies of man and his institutions. It is also aimed at correcting malpractice by inspiring both indignation and laughter with a mixture of criticism and wit. The concept of satire is invented from the act of mockery or ridiculous, to correct the ills of the society.</p> <p>          Satire is any piece of writing that uses devices such as irony. A text or performance that uses irony, derision or wit to expose or attack human vice, foolishness or stupidity.</p> <p>          To buttress this, George Ostler in Oxford Dictionary, Opines that Satire is a composition which vice or folly is tended up to ridicule.</p> <p>          Sarcasm or irony is used to expose absurdity. The essence of satire therefore is to ridicule the ills of an individual or institution with the aim of correcting and transforming the society. Satire helps to mould individuals character and it also exposes the point of weakness of particular society. Social and political satire is prominent in this particular Wole Soyinka’s work see in Wole Soyinka. <em>Trial of Brother Jero</em>and A play of Giant selected Dramatext above. He treated social satire obtainable in the contemporary Nigeria society.</p> <p>          According to <em>Shorter Oxford Dictionary</em>. Satire is a thing, fact or circumstance that has the effect of making some person or thing ridiculous. It is employed to mock or cause the actions of man or his beliefs. According to the <em>Collins Dictionary of English Language</em> is a novel play, entertainment etc in which typical issues, follies, or evils are held up to scorn by means of ridicule and irony.</p> <p>          Jessie Coulson, describes Satire as:</p> <p>“Satire is a composition in which folly or vice is held up to ridicule, use of ridicule, sarcasm or irony to expose folly”.</p> <p>Satire is a literary technique which principally ridicules its subject which includes individuals, organization or states often as an intended means of provoking or preventing changes. Satire can be said to be both a specific literary genre, and a literary manner. As a literary genre, it is said to have reference to a poetic form which was originated in the 2nd century B.C Persuis, Juveral and Quritilian. This is to say that Satire was initially often Quintilian that it required a general application to other forms of literary expression and verbal expression.</p> <p>          Alexander Pope also affirms with the duty that Satire performs to a man which is used to check the excesses of man to inform man and denounce his follies or vices. He believes strongly in the effects of satire. He says:</p> <p>“Know nothing that moves strongly satire and those who are shamed of nothing else are so of being ridiculous”.</p> <p>As a literary manner, Satire is concerned with ridiculing human and institutional follies with the intention of correcting them.</p> <p>Satire may be presented in the mode of allegory and also mode imitation through pictures and caricatures, it is indicious treatment of subjects in a dramatic fashion, also in the mode of Lampoon which is explained as the act in which an individual is represented in a virulent way, this makes it a subject of a laughter. In the mode of irony which is explained as a situation whereby the intended meaning is the opposite of that expressed by the word used.</p> <p>          In the mode of irony which is explained as a situation whereby the word used. In the mode of Allegy which is the presentation of a subject to represent meaning</p> <p>          In the mode of Allegy which is the presentation of a subject to represent another one where they both share similar features. The most effective mode of Satire is sarcasm which is defined as a sharp, biting or cutting expression of remark. It can also be in the form of a bitter glibe or taunt. The satire here tends to be direct and hard on the subject of discourse. On the other hand, it may be through the mode of humour which is explained to be the presentation. Finally, satire can be presented through force, a situation whereby metaphorical language or expressions are used to mock.</p> <p>          The whole question of the responsibility of the artist to the society is perhaps as old as the responsibility of the artist to the posed as the relationship between the artist and the public or as the functions of the artist or the relationship between art and the society the function remains unchanged. It is therefore in the attempt at unveiling the great role of Artists in the society that we come across the concept of satire. Satire can be described as a means or mechanism by which a novelist, artist or dramatist aims at exposing the ills and vices in the society such as corruption, injustice, lust for materialism, moral and spiritual bankrupt and exploitation of all forms, political and socio-economic</p> <p>Fallacij Roget Fowler Subiruts that satire is a</p> <p>Genre defined primarily but not </p> <p>Exclusively in terms of its inner</p> <p>Form in it the author attacks</p> <p>Some subjects using it as his menns,</p> <p>Wit or humour that is either</p> <p>Fantastic or absurd</p> <p>Therefore, Satire is employed to mock or censor the actions of man or his belief, it is also used to assess the state of man in his society and to create a difference between the present  situation and the ideal situation. Satiractries to expose the abuse of a system and the actors involved. The best satire is concerned with the nature of reality and unlike other arts which emphasizes what appears to be real but is not. It always pretends to be something other than what is really is.</p> <p>We read satire because it gives pleasure. Some scholars have course to disagreed on the kind of pleasure.</p> <p>It give us.Some critics suggest that the pleasure is a moral one. Just as one would agree with the former opinion, it is important to say that satire does not give us the type of pleasure fable stories gives us, on the other hand from satirical writing we derive ethical satisfaction because through Satire, we are able to imbibe a code of conduct which we apply to our daily lives.</p> <p>          It is a fundamental and basic fact that satire entails more than exposing societal ills and vices. Satire is a literary response to life in the city, its basic cynicism and especially its political nature seen to require an urban culture to spawn and thrives.</p> <p>          There are other less sophisticated kinds of verbal and literary vitrid; flyting and invective. What might be best described as creative name calling, occur almost universally but satire proper derives from a periodic association between literature and the hypocricy of civil behaviour. While the term itself has its etymological roots in the Latin Satura meaning a full or mixed dish in the sense of a cacophonous variety, the Greeks had rich satiric tradition especially evident in the Athenian old comedy which played scatologically with the pretentious behaviour of particular contemporary citizens recognizable to the Audience. Aristophanes Lampoons on Socrates and Euripides are prominent examples. The great Roman poet Horace and Juveral set the literary standards for European satire, their best work being much imitated models even well into the 20th century. They also lend their names to the two essential types of satire which are the Horatian who is the gentler kind, which exposes human folly to correct it and thus strengthens the social fabric and Juvenalian is harsh, even abusive and sees little chance of social progress. Horace and Juvenal use language that is colloquial and contemporary people and current issues.</p> <p>          These remain the distinguishing elements of Satire which is colloquial and contemporary, immediate and recognizably real in style and subject.</p> <p>          In a peculiar way satire’s generic qualities and social motives are very close to those of the essay. The satirist, like the essaylist is intensely aware of his or her subjectivity and attempts to engage the readers on a personal and even conversational level. In both genres, the dominant impression is one of immediacy of a face to face exchange in which opinion and interpretation take procedure over fact and objectivity. The attitude is casual, however changed with message.</p> <p>          Satire is a genre of literature. According to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (1993), Satire can be inform of a poem, prose or composition. In which prevailing vices or follies are held up to ridicule.</p> <p>          A thing, fact or circumstance that has the effect of making some person or thing ridiculous. Satire is employed, to mock or censure the action of man or institution in the society.</p> <p>          Also, the Encyclopedia American (1829) defines satire as both a specific literary genre and literary manner. As a genre it has reference to poetic form originated in the 2nd century by Roman Satirist Lacillius. It was practiced with distinction by his successor Horace, Persius and Juvenal.</p> <p>          As a literary manner, the follies, vices and crimes of a person or an institution are held up to ridiculous or scorn with the intention of correcting them.</p> <p>          From the above definitions, we can say that satire is every expression that makes fun of an institution or an individual by drawing the attention of the people to their vices with the aim of making amendments. Satire is a major tool in bringing about societal transformation.</p> <p>          Satire originates from ‘Satura’ a Latin word which means ‘medley’ or ‘mixtured’ – satirical usages have being part of the folk culture since the early communities. It featured in the Greek Culture as it was specifically located within a Grecian fertility rite. The first satirist was Acholochus. He was said to have been so savage that his target one Lycambas and his daughter hanged themselves.</p> <p>          Furthermore, the remain rhetorician Quintillians established Satire as a ‘Roman Phenomenon’. He claims “Satire is our own in his words “Satura totanoshraest-Qum”. By these, he was referring to lucillus poetic practice who was a contemporary of his works had a considerable influence on Horace one of the keg figures in the development of satire persius was influenced by Horace.</p> <p>          To Horace satire is urbane, the satirist smiles at the foibles of his fellow men without indignation. Juvenal satire is harsh. The satirist is an enraged moralist. Who denounces the vices and corruption of his fellowmen. Satire here is bitter and commading.</p> <p>          The pre-independent African society had satire in its arts- A typical example is the poetry of the Yorubas called “Ewi”-The Elewi, satirist ridicule people and institutions. Element of satire can be seen in their proverbs, riddles and jokes. After independence. However, Satire assumed a different phrase in the Contemporary African society. It became very popular as it is being used to attack theme of neo-colonialism, corruption, hypocrisy, ignorance and administration and other vices. Narrowing it down to Nigeria, we have a lot of artist who are satirist in their writings. Such writers are Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe. In his <em>A man of the people </em>Ken Sarowiwa <em>Prisoners of Jebs</em>, Olu Obafemi in the, <em>The New Dawn</em> Ola Rotimi etc.</p> <p>          According to IRF Gordan (1976) Horace’s approach to Satire is the one that tells the truth better with laughter while Juvenal states that their anger make him to write satire.</p> <p>          In the 17th century satire marked the highest point in English literature through the works of Dryden, Alaxander Pope, Jonathan Swift etc. They attack materialism, hypocrisy, pride, cruelty and political experience in the works.</p> <p>          From the Horatian or Juvenalism concept of satire as a sting that is deep and sharp and thus, it produces result; transformation. In the 19th century we talk about other satirist as Jane Austen, Thomas Peacock, Samuel Butter, Bettoit Brecht etc.</p> <p>1.1     AIMS/PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>          The purpose of this research endeavour is to portray the socio-political ills of the Contemporary Nigeria Society as represented in the works of Wole Soyinka. The interest of this playwrights is the use of Satire as a potent weapon to mock political problems, leadership, mediocrity vice-versa religious hypocrisy, moral decadence, exploitation andegostic tendencies of the people trusted with the mandate of the masses. The concern of this research study is to enumerate the relevance of satire for the correction of socio-political ills of the contemporary Nigeria Society. This focus make this study quote relevant and useful for academic purposes and further related studies. The study will also aim at addressing the imbalances in the society and how this writers view this differences. This study is being embarked upon in order to bring out the salient idea behind these writers use of satire as it affects the life of Nigerian citizens.</p> <p>1.2     JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>          This study is important as it brings to limelight issues that are integral to our society which many people are not aware of. More so, this study intends to re-emphasis and expose the use of satire by African playwright to lash political leaders and religious leader and highly esteemed people in the society. The work of Wole Soyinka are appraised as a corrective instrument for socio-political problems of Nigeria contemporary society.</p> <p>          Through the use of satire the authors Wole Soyinka has been able to expose the ills and vices in the Nigeria socio-political system since independence. Attention will be drawn not only to the weaknesses in the society but also to the attitude which must be change, if the society is to develop and their importance and relevance to the contemporary times.</p> <p>          This study will also focus on the awareness of the people to the policies of the government, the tyranny and evil that pervaded his rule and the uptum of justice and misrepresentation of the truth. A particular character seen as being totally power drunk and this trait is seen as been totally power drunk and this peculiarities and idiosyncrasies. However, powers the bottom line. The way, the shade and color of the power are now the issue. The work is also embarked up on to establish the fact that political and economic violence is a phenomenon satired by literary master piece.</p> <p>1.3     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>          The purpose of this research work is to add flavour to the already existing scholarly established opinion that satire as a literary form has gone along way not only to attack the assumed unattackable ills and vices in human life which are mostly blinded by emotional instinct, but also as like no other literary application brought reformation to all these ills and vices in terms of political, social and economic ways. Another vital significance is the correctly position that in as much as man’s existence  as a social being in intermittently unending the existence of satire would not only continue to complete with the age of man but would remain firmly abated. The essay is also meant to add useful literacy  contribution to the existing body of knowledge in this field and to serve as useful literary contribution to the existing body of knowledge in this field and to contribution and to serve as useful consultation in this field for future researchers.</p> <p>1.4     SCOPE AND LIMITATION</p> <p>          The scope of this work is firstly assessing some of the available materials on satire (literature review) to the sourcing of Data as in studying satire and analyzing the texts by Wole Soyinka ‘The Trials of Brother Jero’ and A PLAY OF GIANTS”.</p> <p>          This research work will be limited to the justification and analysis of satire. It will be clear from our objective that even though the research deals with satire generally, we shall limit our study to the use of satire in the selected texts to expose the social and political malaise in Nigeria religion and political leadership.</p> <p>          The limitation has been dictated by the need to attempt a thorough research within the available time.</p> <p>1.5     METHODOLOGY</p> <p>          The facts to be used will be collected from the novel based on the concept of satire in the novel. Here, the sociological approaches will be used. The sociological approach views the salient happenings in the contemporary society with regards to man.</p> <p>          It puts on record socio-cultural elements that cannot be researched in present usage. The Quota system of sampling is employed. The social problems of the society is not just religious hypocrisy which is prominent in Wole Soyinka’s <em>The Trial of Brother Jero</em> but also moral decadence, where martial imbalance is also embedded in the text to signify the total domestic disorder of the Nigeria system. Also,  A PLAY OF GIANT is a political problem abuse of power, complexities of power, intrigues of power, craze andhurt for power in African leadership, doctorial African leaderat the bayin an embassy in New York. A satire in the misrule of “miracden men” Textbooks, journals, and periodicals shall be consulted from which information will be collected. Also the tools which Wole Soyinka employs to satirize in “The Trials of Brother Jero and A Play of the Giants’ shall be examined.</p> <p>          This essay will be divided into four parts. Chapter one presents different definitions of satire by different scholars, important satiric strategies and the importance of satire to  the individual and the society as a whole shall be examined. Chapter two deals with the review of related literatures. It will examine what different scholars and critics have said on the novel under study and the use of satire as a deliberate tool by the authors will be examined. Chapter three examines critically Wole Soyinka “The Trials of Brother Jero.</p> <p>          Chapter four also examines critically Wole Soyinka a Play of Giants showing distinctly the aspects of dictorial African leaders in the world at large, especially in the society being satirized the characters. Chapter five which will be the conclusion of this study is’ a brief summary and evaluation of what the study is all about. For the purpose of analysis of the data collected for the study, the research entails the use of textual analysis as parameters for drawing conclusion on the research findings. In this study, the sociological approach to literature discourse is used. This approach studies the work of art as determined by social forces.</p> <p>          One of the foremost theoreticians is George Lukas. He argue that the work of art reflects social forces and it has dialectal impact on society. The work of art educates the society too, a part from entertaining the audience. This theory see the central character as representing his society.</p> <p>1.6     SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY</p> <p>          Theories depend on what the scholars under each school of thought feel literature should be and be used for. Various critics and scholars decide to evaluate or approach or criticize literature from their various perspective. These variant perspective are often referred to as approaches of literature.</p> <p>          Hence the words, theories are approaches are synonymously used. A pre-knowledge of the theory adopted for the critical analysis of our text will be highly essential to our understanding. As earlier mentioned in our methodology.</p> <p>          We have adopted the sociological criticism under which the liberal humanist sociological critical form is used as a variant.</p> <p>          This brand best suite our study as it:</p> <p>“Owes its rise to the rather relunctant realization on the part of some critics that the literature which forms the object of their enquiry is made peculiar by the fact that it is concerned with problem in African society at various points in its development”.</p> <p>          Irele’s position on criticism, especially his defence of the liberal humanist sociology of literary production is remarkably espoused in <em>African experience in literature and ideology</em> the emphasizes that the long cultivated collective social force, its shape and movement in time are some of the determinants of the direction of the artist’s mind and sensibility. Eagleton’s analysis of liberal humanism particularly reveals of the fundamental weakness and based it on.</p> <p>“Liberal humanism has dwindled to the impotent conscience of bourgeious society gentle, sensitive and ineffectual… The importance of liberal humanism is a symptom of its essential contradictory relationship to modern capitalism. For although it forms part of the official ideology of such society, and the “humanitics” exist to reproduce it, the social order within it exists has in one sense very little time for it at all”</p> <p>          Irele draws attention to the potential of a literary sociology which approaches art criticism from the study of the responsiveness of the artist to his social background.</p> <p>          With all these characteristic of liberal humanist criticism, we can deduce that it best suite our study and it can be applied in the analysis of two of Wole Soyinka texts <em>The Trials of Brother Jero and A Play of Giants</em> as the African writers makes his focus in African experiences in literature and ideology. It is seen from the fact that both problem facing African society at various points in Its development. Their focus even though they are diasporian writer is on African society and the social problem that are in the African society.</p>\n\nSATIRE AND SOCIAL MEDIATION IN WOLE SOYINKA’S:<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SATIRE AND SOCIAL MEDIATION IN WOLE SOYINKA’S:", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A SURVEY OF THE LANGUAGE OF NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT (A CASE STUDY OF THE VANGUARD NEWSPAPER)</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Advertising is a form of communication used to encourage or persuade on audience (viewer, reader or listeners) to continue to take some new action. Most commonly, the desired result is to influence consumers’ behavior with respect to a commercial offering, although, political and ideological advertising is also common. The purpose of advertising may also be to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful. Advertising messages are usually paid for by sponsors and viewed via various traditional media: including mass media such as: newspaper, magazines, television commercials, radio advertisement, outdoor advertising or direct mail, or new media such as websites and text-messages.</p> <p>Advertising has been defined as “a powerful communication force and a vital marketing tool helping to sell goods and services, images and ideas”…. (Wright, 2003:8). Similarly, Roderick (1980:4) defines advertising as “a message specified by its originator, carried by a communication system and intended to influence and/or inform an unknown audience.” Advertising may also be seen as “a group of activities aiming at and including <strong>dissemination</strong> of information in any paid product or service to compel actions in accordance with the intent of an identifiable sponsor” (Doughuge, 1985:8).</p> <p>Advertising has a long history, with some options tracing its origin to the story of Adam, Eve and the serpent in the Bible (Okigbo, 1985:10 and Weffer, 1985:6). Wright (2000:4) however, opines that advertising started in ancient Babylon at about 3000BC when inscription for an ointment dealer, a scribe and a shoe maker were made on clay tablets. Sandage and Fryburger (1963) argue that Egyptians first wrote runaway-slave announcements on papyrus at about 3200BC. In Africa, town crying and hawking were the earliest forms of advertising. These have survived in many Nigerian villages till date. With respect to media advertising, which is the focus of this paper Sandage and Fryburger (cited in Okeke, 2006:24) suggest that the first media advertising was done in London in 1477 when a prayer book was announced for sale, while the first newspaper advertising appeared in the Boston Newsletter in 1704</p> <p>The print media came into Nigeria in 1859 with the appearance of a Yoruba language newspaper “Iwe Iroyin” published by Reverend Henry Townsend at Abeokuta. The publication carried an advert in form of an announcement for the Anglican Church.</p> <p>It is noteworthy that the earliest forms of newspaper advertising were crude and unsophisticated. But they not only help the local merchants to sell of his goods, or services, but also set a pace for the modern methods of advertising, which have over a long period of time undergone tremendous changes such that today, a lot can be written on the language of advertising in Nigeria. This is possible because advertising has become more professional, involving copywriters who exploit all the available linguistic devices to make their adverts not only persuasive, but also aesthetically appealing. This paper therefore, attempts a linguistic analysis of the language of newspaper advertising in Nigeria, highlighting the phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic features that make them attractive and persuasive.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Purpose</strong></p> <p>The structure of language in advertising has a peculiar form. Many factors predispose the copywriter (i.e. one who writes advertisements) to choose his vocabulary this in some sense implies that copywriter does not have a free flow of lexical items.</p> <p>It is worthy to note that some important points about newspapers is that they are businesses, and businesses need to make a profit. They can only do that if they have readers. So newspapers have to provide us with the most up-to-date information: news, features and also movie listings, the weather, sports scores, and so on. The greater the circulation, the more advertising a paper can sell which means more profits, but less space stones. Newspapers need to balance these needs</p> <p>It is however clear that the copywriter is restrained to the use of language in advertisement, and the owner of the advert has a primary motive of making profit out of the adverts. It is obvious that in good adverts language matters in this context; therefore, purpose of this study is to critically analyze the most suitable language for newspaper advertisement.</p> <p><strong>Research Question</strong></p> <p>The following will help guide the research study in achieving its objectives:</p> <p>1.  What makes you stop and look at the adverts?</p> <p>2.  What kind of adverts do you place on newspapers?</p> <p>3.  What kind of caption should be given to adverts?</p> <p>4.  What kind of message should be driven out through advertisement?</p> <p>5.  Should adverts be short or lengthy?</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to examine the following:</p> <p>1.  To know how to construct adverts to attract readers or viewers.</p> <p>2.  To be able to distinguish the terminology to use in different adverts.</p> <p>3.  To be able to determine the right choice of language used in newspaper advertisement. </p> <p>4.  Understand the need for long or short newspaper adverts.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will be able to unveil some of those hidden facts about the use and choice of languages used in newspaper advertisements, and also bring about a more refined advert outputs.</p> <p>This research study will highly relevant to the readers, and especially to the world of journalism in the way and manner in which adverts are to be constructed and be placed on newspapers for public consumption.</p> <p>The study will also help to ensure that the choices of languages of newspaper adverts are properly selected so that those who pay for the adverts will be satisfied with the publications, and that the readers’ attention will be captured at the sight of such adverts.</p> <p><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is basically limited in space to the Vanguard Newspaper of Nigeria, and also to the world of publication and journalism.</p> <p><strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>1.                <strong>Advertisement</strong>: A public notice or announcement</p> <p>2.                <strong>Newspaper</strong>: A printed publication containing news, advertisement and correspondence</p> <p>3.                <strong>Announcement</strong>: To make publicly known</p>\n\nA SURVEY OF THE LANGUAGE OF NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SURVEY OF THE LANGUAGE OF NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>EFFECTS OF NIGERIAN R&amp;B MUSIC ON THE USE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>            Due to the fact that English language is the official language of Nigeria, and Nigerian is a multilingual country, English language continues to grow popular every day. The Nigerian R&amp;B with its high level of spread lately has contributed a great deal in influencing English usage. This research work has aimed to enlighten people on how Nigerian R&amp;B music penetrates and affect their usage of English language. This research work has examined the various ways in which the Nigerian R&amp;B music affects the use of English language using four randomly selected Nigerian R&amp;B tracks. The result of the analysis shows that Nigerian R&amp;B music introduces and changes a lot in English vocabulary.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.0       INTRODUCTION                   </p> <p>1.1       ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN NIGERIA                                                   </p> <p>1.2       RHYTHM AND BLUES MUSIC       </p> <p>1.3       MUSIC IN NIGERIA                     </p> <p>1.4       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY    </p> <p>1.5       JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY                      </p> <p>1.6       SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH         </p> <p>1.7       RESEARCH METHODOLOGY    </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>2.0       INTRODUCTION         </p> <p>2.1       LEXICO-GRAMMAR                                         </p> <p>2.1.1    LEXIS                                                                     </p> <p>2.2       GRAMMATICAL COMPETENCE AND PERFORMANCE          </p> <p>2.3       SOCIOLINGUITICS                                               </p> <p>2.4       INFLUENCE OF THE AMERICAN ENGLISH          </p> <p>2.5       WORD FORMATION           </p> <p>2.5.1    IDIOM                                                        </p> <p>2.5.2   NEOLOGISM                                               </p> <p>2.5.3    AGGLUTINATING                                  </p> <p>            2.5.4    CONTRATION          </p> <p>2.6       SLANG                                                                     </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: DATA ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p>3.0       INTRODUCTION                                                 </p> <p>3.1       ANALYSIS OF DATA                  </p> <p>3.1.1    SLANGS                                                                               </p> <p>3.1.2    WORD FORMATION                                          </p> <p>3.1.2.1 IDIOMATICITY                                                           </p> <p>3.1.2.2 NEOLOGISM               </p> <p>3.1.2.3 AGGLUTINATING                         </p> <p>3.1.2.4 CONTRATION                         </p> <p>3.1.3    INFLUENCE OF THE AMERICAN ENGLISH     </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR: SUMMARY AND FINDINGS</strong></p> <p>4.0       INTRODUCTION      </p> <p>4.1       SUMMARY                   </p> <p>4.2       FINDINGS                 </p> <p>4.3       CONCLUSION                   </p> <p><strong>         BIBIOLOGRAPHY</strong></p> <p><strong>      APPENDIX</strong></p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>            English language is the official language in Nigeria as a tool that facilitates cultural and linguistic unity in the country. Part of the area in which English language is used peculiarly in the country is music. R&amp;B music originated from traditional Rhythm and Blues music. Today, the term R&amp;B is most often used to describe a style of Africa American music originating after the demise of disco in the 1980s. Nigerian R&amp;B culture started spreading in the 1990s with the likes of Plantashun Boiz, The Remedies etc. When the country witnessed proliferation of computer and cheap music editing software in the 21th century, Nigeria R&amp;B artistes started achieving higher quality recordings that rapidly won over the Nigerian audience.</p> <p>            English language has been adopted as the language of the Nigerian R&amp;B music. In spite of the fact that most Nigerian R&amp;B singers use English language, they still try to identify with their indigenous languages. Nigerian R&amp;B singers use their music as a medium of informing their listeners of the current event and liberation strategies, using alternate language understood only by those within the cultural network. Through the years, many of the words and phrases become integrated and used by listeners who had figured out the context and definitions of these words.</p> <p><strong>1.1       ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p>            English is a heritage left behind in Nigeria by the British at the end of the colonial administration. However, it is now the language of government, business, commerce, education, literature, arts, the mass media, internal and external communication in Nigeria. In practice therefore, English is the only effective medium of communication among Nigerians from different linguistic backgrounds. Although English is the official language of Nigeria, it has not succeeded in replacing any of the indigenous languages. Three of the hundreds of Nigerian local languages (Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo) are often referred to as the major languages of the country; but few people speak more than one of the local languages.</p> <p>            The multilingual nature of the Nigerian society leads to many regional variations in their use of English because local languages have their accents directly or indirectly transferred to English language. So, we have the majority speaking the Nigerian English (NE) as it can be tagged, with different accents. The term “Nigerian English” has come to be recognised and accepted is referring to the legitimate subtype of English, which is peculiar to Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2       RHYTHM AND BLUES MUSIC</strong></p> <p>            Rhythm and Blues music or R&amp;B is a variety of different, but related types popular music produced and supported primarily by African American beginning in the early 1940s. R&amp;B was first coined in 1949 by Jerry Wexler, who became prominent with Atlantic Records. The term R&amp;B was used as a synonym for black rock and roll in the early and mid-1950s. R&amp;B music embraces such genres as jump blues, club blues, black rock and roll, doo wop, soul, Motown, funk, disco and rap.</p> <p>            Today’s contemporary R&amp;B music has a distinctly different sound than its forebears, focusing on pop beats and culture rather than the blues, gospel and jazz sounds of previous the generations. In the late 1940s and into the 50s, R&amp;B groups consisted brass instruments and woodwinds, as well as drums, piano and vocals.</p> <p><strong>1.3       MUSIC IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p>            Nigerian music is extremely vibrant and lively. The popular music of Nigeria are highlife, afrobeat, juju, apala, hip hop (which includes R&amp;B) and a lot more. As Nigeria culture is completely multi-ethnic, the music in Nigeria is influenced by a lot of traditions of different tribes. Hip hop which has gained worldwide popularity in the recent years is the most popular music among Nigerians today especially the Nigerian youths.</p> <p><strong>1.4       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            This research intends to show the relationship between language and the society by investigating the lyrics of the Nigerian R&amp;B music. With the continues growth of the English language among the people of Nigeria, and language learning being highly influenced  by the socio-environment, the music industry in Nigeria is one of the greatest influence on language acquisition in the country. </p> <p>     Therefore, it is the aim of this research work to review the social effects of Nigerian R&amp;B music on English language, so that at the end of this research, readers of this work will be able to have a visible assessment of the effect of the Nigerian R&amp;B music on the standardization of English language in the country.</p> <p><strong>1.5       JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>     This study is being embarked upon because no study of this nature to the researcher has focused on the complexity of the effect of the Nigerian R&amp;B on the use of English language in Nigerian R&amp;B on the use of English language in Nigeria. A similar research work which the researcher came across is Babalola and Taiwo (2009), which focuses on code-switching in contemporary Nigerian hip hop songs. This research work will not only look into code-switching but will examine the ideological background of Nigerian R&amp;B songs and relating it to the linguistic constructions employed as the medium.</p> <p><strong>1.6       SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH</strong></p> <p>     In the research work, the researcher intends to place more emphasis on the analysis of pervasive lexico-grammatical properties of R&amp;B music on the use of English language. The study is limited to the Nigerian environment alone. Because of space constraint and for explicit discussion, a maximum of four Nigerian R&amp;B tracks will be selected and used as the data in this research work.</p> <p><strong>1.7       RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>     The method intended will incorporate the following components of linguistics/language in layers:</p> <p>(i)                 Sampling and listening to some randomly selected Nigerian R&amp;B tracks.</p> <p>(ii)               Selection and analysis of some R&amp;B musical lyrics.</p> <p>(iii)             Evaluation of common expressions, grammatical construction, and lexical items in Nigerian R&amp;B music.</p>\n\nEFFECTS OF NIGERIAN R&amp;B MUSIC ON THE USE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF NIGERIAN R&B MUSIC ON THE USE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN NIGERIA", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF EMECHETA’S SECOND CLASS CITIZEN AND NWAPA’S EFURU</strong></p> <p><strong>  ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>          This study undertakes a comparative analysis of the works of two Nigerian female novelists: Buchi Emecheta and Flora Nwapa, it looks at the contemporary African society which is dominated by men.Little or no recognition is given to women thus they have been oppressed, depressed, subjected and neglected.

They wrote novels about the struggles of African women in a contemporary African society and portray the condition of women in the traditional African setting. Their works promote equality for men and women in political, economic, educational, traditional and social spheres. They believe that women are oppressed due to their sex based on the dominant ideology of patriarchy.</p> <p>Patriarchy literally means rule by men or by paternal right.It is a situation whereby women are ruled or controlled by men, giving power and importance to men.</p> <p>Were Nigeria and Africa oppressively masculinity? The answer is “yes” Ghana was known to have some matrilineal society such as Akans; but Nigeria’s traditional culture, Muslim as well as non-Muslim had been masculine – based even before the advent of the white man. The source, nature and extent of female subordination and oppression have constituted a vexed problem in African literary debates. Writers such as Ama Ata Aidoo of Ghana and late Flora Nwapa of Nigeria insisted that the image of the helpless, dependent, unproductive African women was once ushered in by European imperialists whose women lived that way. On the other hand, the Nigeria-born, expatriate writer Buchi Emecheta, along with other critics, maintain that African women were traditionally subordinated to sexist cultural mores.</p> <p>Colonial rule aggravated the situation by introducing a lopsided system in which African men received a well rounded education like their European counterparts before the mid-nineteenth century, African women received only utilitarian, cosmetic skills in domestic science centers the kind of skills that could only prepare them to be useful helpmates of educated, premier nationalists and professionalssuch as Nnamdi Azikwe Nigeria’s first president, and the late Obafemi Awolowo of the Yoruba tribalist leader.     </p> <p><strong>1.1    COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND INTERTEXTUALITY</strong></p> <p>Comparative analysis refers to the way of comparing and contrasting two things: two texts, two theories, two historical figures and so on. It is also item by item comparison of two or more comparable alternatives, processes, products, qualifications, sets of data, systems etc. it can be two similar things that have critical differences of similarities yet turn out to have surprising commonalities.</p> <p>Comparative analysis shows the relationship between A and B and how two things are similar and/or different. It requires comparism between two things. It is also known as a compare and contrast essay.</p> <p>According to (Irwin, 228) “intertextuality is the shaping of texts meaning by other texts. It can be referred to author’s borrowing and transformation of a prior text or to a readers referencing of one text in reading another.”</p> <p>The term “intertextuality” has itself been borrowed and transformed many times since it was coined by post structuralist Julian Kristeva in 1966. If we were to look at intertextuality as a weaving, then it would become apparent that for a piece of fabric to be intertextual it would put together many different threads. It would be woven from threads pulled from many sources to create new weaving. The same can be said for books intertextuality results when the author echoes or refers to other texts and other authors. The electronic labyrinth claims that a literary work is not simply the product of a simple actor but of its relationship to other texts and to the structure of language itself.</p> <p>In Africa, the early colonial era was pre-occupied by issues of cultural conflicts between Africans and western cultures, religion and world view but the post independent African countries experience further changes in themes, this brought about changes in African writers thematic focus of most of female writers such as Ama Ata Aidoo, Marima Ba, Buchi Emecheta and Flora Nwapa.</p> <p>Flora Nwapa was the lone African female novelist’s voice lamenting patriarchy, in 1966, she published Efurusignificantly in African feminist scholarship, it signals a long awaited departure from the stereotypical female portraiture in male-authored African literature but the prolific Buchi Emecheta joined the fray with The Joys of Motherhood (1980). Therefore as the female Nigerian critics, Chikwenye Okwonje Ogunyemi writes:</p> <p>If Nwapa is the challenger, Emecheta is the fighter…</p> <p>for the first time, female readers, through characters,</p> <p>are aware of their subjugation by their fathers, uncles, </p> <p>husbands, brothers and son.</p> <p>Examples of feminist writers are Elizabeth Gilman, Charlotte Perkins, Julia Ward, Lockwood, Mary Wollstonecraft, Simeon De Beauvoir, Catherine Acholonu, Ama Ata aidoo, Marima Ba, Buchi Emecheta and Flora Nwapa.</p> <p><strong>1.2    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>This research work will examine the two novels by comparing and differentiating the novels, since the writers share similarities and differences in their texts.</p> <p><strong>1.3    SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this work is relatively wide.It will be determined by how affective or relevant a portion is to the study.The study will touch the mainline text, i.e. the area in which the topic is concerned.</p> <p>It would have been worthwhile to use as many texts for this research but it will be limited to Emecheta’s Second Class Citizen and Nwapa’s Efuru.</p> <p><strong>1.4    JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>There have been a lot of researches conducted on comparative analysis but only few researches has been done on comparing and contrasting the texts of two great African writers; Buchi Emecheta and Flora Nwapa. Therefore, this research work will do a vivid comparison between Emecheta’s Second Class Citizen and Nwapa’s Efuru.</p> <p><strong>1.5    METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Feminism is one of the broad literary criticisms in literature. According to (Joseph, 2003, p.161) feminism is a world wide ideology and political movement directed at existing power relations between men and women in patriarchal society. She goes further to assert that feminism is a kind of criticism which is the struggle of women emancipation and men in such society hide under the disguise of male supremacy to subjugate women by a system of sex role stereotyping. There are different types of feminism which are: Radical, socialist, cultural, eco-feminism, liberal, conservative and others.</p> <p>Liberal feminism is the equality of men and women through political and legal reform. They want the eradication of institutional bias and implementations of fairer laws towards women. Features of liberal feminism include: focus on women’s ability to show and maintain their equality through their own actions and choices, it looks at the personal interaction of men and women as the starting ground from which to transform society into a more gender equitable place and it projects genders complimentarity and gives room to caring and nurturing of children.  </p> <p>Therefore this work will discuss feminism from liberal perspective because it contains issues relating to women’s suffering. Despite this, they remain strong, assertive and doubtful in their relationship with the other sex. Also, liberal feminism expresses predicament of the women folk and their suffering without retaliating but believes in endurance and perseverance.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong>    <strong>BIOGRAPHY OF BUCHI EMECHETA</strong></p> <p>Buchi Emecheta was born on August 14, 1944 in Lagos to Igbo parents, Alice Emecheta and Jeremy Nwabudinke. Her father was a railway worker in the 1940’s. due to the gender bias of the time, the young Buchi Emecheta was initially kept at home while her younger brother was sent to school, but after persuading her parents to consider the benefits of her education, she spent her early childhood at an All-Girl’s Missionary School. Her father died when she was nine years old.</p> <p>A year later, Emecheta received a full scholarship to the Methodist Girl’s School, when she remained until the age of sixteen. She married Sylvester Onwordi, a student to whom she had been engaged since she was eleven years old. Onwordi immediately moved to London to attend University and Emecheta joined him in 1962. She bore him five children in six years, but it was an unhappy and sometimes violent marriage (as chronicled in her autobiographical writings such as Second Class Citizen).</p> <p>At the age of twenty-two, Emecheta left her husband. While working to support her children alone, she earned a B.sc degree in Sociology in the University of London. From 1965 to 1969, she worked as a library officer for the BritishMuseum in London from 1969 to 1976 she was a youth worker and sociologist for their inner London Education Authority. </p> <p>She has visited several American Universities including PennsylvaniaStateUniversity, RutgersUniversity, university of California and Los angels. She was senior fellow and visiting professor of English in University of CalabarNigeria.</p> <p>Her major theme is child slavery, motherhood, female independence and freedom. She is the author of numerous books including; The Joys of Motherhood, The Bride Price, In the Ditch, Second Class Citizen, Destination Biafra and Head Above Water.</p> <p><strong>1.7    BIOGRAPHY OF FLORA NWAPA (1931-1993)</strong></p> <p>Flora Nwapa was born in Oguta, Eastern Nigerian, which was then a British colony. Both of her parents, Christopher Ijeoma and Martha Nwapa were teachers. She was educated at the University of Ibadan, receiving her B.A in 1957.

This study will attempt to make readers realize these themes in Richard Wright’s Black Boy by analyzing the concept of racial segregation of Black in America. We will examine the historical perspective of Black writing narrative and the effects of racism and oppression, which include poverty, hunger assault etc. and the ways through which the blacks reacted to racism. We can claim that Black American literature was written to oppose racism and oppression in all ramifications and also to gain self-pride and identity.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          Racism in literary studies is defined by Wikipedia as the belief the of genetic factors which constitute race, are the primary determinants of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produces an inherent superiority of a particular race. Racism effects are called racial discrimination. Although the term racism usually denotes race based on prejudice, violence, dislike, discrimination or oppression. Racism is also defined simply as a reflection of the economic system and its cultural, ethnic and political ways. The concept of racism is derived from the word race and it is believed that one racial or ethnic group is inferior to another and the unequal treatment is therefore justified.</p> <p>According to Charles V. Hamilton and Kwame Ture they defined racism as </p> <p>“A prediction of decision and policies on consideration of race for the purpose of subordinating a racial group and maintaining control over that group”.</p> <p>On the other hand, oppression is defined by the encyclopedia as torture or degrading treatment and the use of threat or violence. It is also the exercise of power/authority in a burden, cruel or unjust manner. Oppression is also defined by Wikipedia as an act or instance of oppressing the state of being oppressed and the feeling of being heavily burdened; mentally or physically by troubles adverse conditions and anxiety.</p> <p>          It is this experience of Black Slaves that Richard Wright tries to capture in BlackBoy (1945). In the text, Wright recalls the plight of the Africans that were sold into slavery between the early 1700’s and 1860’s through the convenience of their own fellow Africans. They were transplanted to American, Canada, the Caribbean Island and other parts of the world. The Africans taken into America were now referred to as “Black Americans” while those on the Caribbean Island are called “Afro Caribbean” but they all have a common roots and common problem- Racial Discrimination. The Africans faced a great ordeal trying to survive hardship on their journey across the Atlantic Ocean on arrival to America; they were conscripted into force labour, maltreated, abused and demoralized on the cotton fields and plantation where they were put to work as slaves. As a result of this hardship deprivation and degradation, the blacks began expressing themselves through Negro spirituals which marked the beginning of the artistic expressions of the emotion. They told stories of unpleasant experience of slavery and oppression through pamphlet and short stories, which formed the basic of Black writings and which were later referred to as “Slave Narrative” or “secret text” because they were written without the knowledge of the slave owners. This inhuman trade led to the transportation of Africans to American to work as slave on the plantation where they experienced unimaginable oppression from the white owner. Many youth are ignorant of this fact and see American as a peaceful place and a bed of roses. </p> <p>The project therefore sets out to trace the origin of racism in America and try to expose the horrible experience that the black slaves went through. The experiences of the blacks recounted by Richard Wright in BlackBoy will therefore by analysed to expose the themes of racism and oppression as aspect of the American society.</p> <p><strong>1.2     RICHARD WRIGHT’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY</strong></p> <p>          Richard Wright, the grand son of slaves was born in Natchez Mississippi on 4th of September 1908. His father deserted the family in 1914. When Richard was ten years old, his mother had a paralytic shock. The family was extremely poor. After a brief education, he was forced to seek employment in other to support his mother. He had a difficult childhood which was characterized by hopelessness, insecurity and hunger as portrayed in his autobiography Novel, BlackBoy. Wright worked in a series of menial jobs in Memphis. He wanted to continue his education by using the local library but Jim Crow laws prevented this. Richard Wright solved this by pretending he was collecting a book for a white man.</p> <p>After passing a civil service exam, Wright find a job as a post office clerk. When the wall street crash and the beginning of depression was over, Wright lost his job for a period. He found employment with the Negro Burial Society but that came to an end in 1931 and he was forced to go on relief after several jobs, the relief office found his work with the Federal Writer Project. This enabled him to publish his story Superstition in the Magazine Abbot’s Monthly.</p> <p>In 1932, Wright began attending meeting of the literary group at the John Reed Club he meets several Marxist at the club and later in the year, he joined the American Communist Party. His poems, short stories and essays are accepted by various left using journal including the new masses and international literature, his poem Between The World And Me and a short story BigBoy Leaves Home were both based on the lunching of a black man that he had witnessed when he was a child.</p> <p>In May 1937, Wright moved to New York where he became Harlem editor of the daily worker and a new literary quarterly new challenge. The following year, a collection of short stories about racism in the United States titled Uncle Tom’s Chicken was publish and Wright announced that all royalties would be used to help to pay the appeal cost of Earl Browder, the general secretary of the American Communist Party who had been sentenced to four years in prison for misusing a passport.</p> <p>The publisher accepted Wright’s novel, Native Son in 1940. The book of the mouth club selected the novel as its March selection, therefore, ensuring large sales and publicity. Over a quarter of a million copies were sold within four weeks, making it the fastest selling large novel in twenty years. Wright’s next book, Twelve million Black Voices (1941) was a sociological study of black migration from the rural south to the urban north. By 1944, Wright left the American Communist Party and published an article in the Atlantic Monthly titled The God that Failed, his short novel, The Man Who Lived Underground appeared in 1944. </p> <p>Wright’s powerful autobiography and our main concentration in the project, BlackBoy is a record of childhood and youth which was published in 1945. After then, there was a wave of great hostility towards black writers, so Richard Wright fled to Paris. In 1953, Wright published The Outsider and in 1954 Savage Holding was published, when he traveled to Ghana he wrote about his experience in Black power (1954). This was followed by a collection of essays. White listen (1957), The psychological reaction of the oppressed people and the literature of the Negro in the United States.</p> <p>Wright final novel, The Long Dream was published in 1958. He died of a heart attack in Paris on 28th November 1960. Richard Wright was indeed a true voice of the Black Americans, every bit of his literary works sought to bring an end to physical and psychological oppression and also abolish racism and oppression.</p> <p><strong>1.3     PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to create an awareness of racism and oppression using the personal experience of Richard Wright in his autobiography BlackBoy. </p> <p>This essay concentrates on the theme of racism and oppression in Black American literature. Our intention is to show that racism and oppression indeed is a prominent theme in BlackBoy especially because the book was written during the Jim Crow era at a point where racism was very prominent in the American society.</p> <p>It also looks at the personal understanding of the Blackman’s point of view and his situation. Examples of racism and oppression are cited in BlackBoy. This project exposes how racism and oppression affects the mentality and the way of living of the Black race, reducing them to a level of inferiority, in every aspect of their lives.</p> <p><strong>1.4     SCOPE AND LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>          Our scope and limitation is on the theme of racism and oppression in BlackBoy by Richard Wright so as to prevent the project from being untidy and ambiguous in nature. From intense research we believe that BlackBoy, an eye witness account is accurate enough to fully express the terms of racial segregation and oppression because it has made a strong impact on American literature with its strong commentary on the cultural, political, racial and social issues going on during the period of 20th century racism.</p> <p>The very title of the book “BlackBoy” already gives us an idea of our thematic discussion because he uses the term ‘Black’ in the title to emphasize the fundamental racial facts of his life (the author Richard Wright); the black against the white. Black race subordinate to the white race which is the main and only scope and limitation.</p> <p><strong>1.5     JUSTIFICATION</strong></p> <p>Many works have been carried out on Black American literature majorly focusing on self identity and racism. For example Babalola (1992) “The concept of racism and crisis of self identity in James Baldwin’s Go Tell it on the Mountain (1954) and George Lamming’s Water with Berries (1972) focused on aspect of racism. Both novels highlighted the concept of self identity. The present study will be different from the works mentioned above. It will shed more light on oppression experienced by the African’s using Richard Wright’s autobiographical novel {BlackBoy}.</p> <p><strong>1.6     METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>          The methodology used in this project is a Carl Jung (1952) psychological approach in literature. It is believed that this approach will best expose the inner mind and psychological torture of the Black American characters in Black Boy. Oppression and Racism are better analysed, examined and portrayed through the workings of the intellectual thinking of those affected. This approach is the only approach that has helped to review visual and close insight of confrontations and conflicts between the Blacks and the Whites. Concentration is placed on the major character which serves as the representative character for the Blacks. Through his life experience, we can deduce the predicament of the Black Americans in South Africa.</p> <p><strong>END NOTES      </strong></p> <p>Http://wikipedia.org.racism on 29th March, 2011.</p> <p>http://wikipedia.org. “Wright life and background” on 29th March, 2011</p> <p>Wright, Richard (1945) BlackBoy.

This research work therefore will find out if students in the University of Ilorin borrow words from English in to Yoruba in their day to day interaction and if they do to identify this borrowings. The sample population used in this work is 80 (Eighty) students of the University of Ilorin and these students were randomly chosen from four faculties in this University and they are all Yoruba language speakers with the use of instruments like tape reader and audio cassette. From the data analyzed, it is  observed that the Yoruba speaker use their language predominantly during communication not only borrow in most times a single lexical item from English and in corporate it within their utterances. Code-mixing, as a sociolinguistic phenomenon, is a familiar practice through out the world, most especially among  bilinguals who combine certain linguistic items is from two different languages. In this regard, it was discovered that language contact also result in borrowing from one language to another.</p> </div> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       General Introduction</strong></p> <p>            It is a well established fact that English language has established itself firmly in Nigeria thus, its importance cannot be over emphasized. Apart from being an official language. English language is the rope that ties members of  the different speech communities together in continuing interrelationships. It is the common instrument that they draw on for socio-cultural identification.</p> <p>            English language is said to be a human specific mode of expressing  our thought  through the verbal (i.e spoken and written) and non-verbal means. With this definition, we shall reiterate that English language necessarily serves humans in a multitude of ways: English language is said to have a great impact on the cognitive development of man: Man is able to express his thoughts and view.</p> <p>            The majority of world English speakers use English either as a second or third language and exists in an environment where in the least, bilingualism is the norm even though English may be the official language. In many countries, including Nigeria, English is the main language of instruction in schools (especially after primary education level) and it is used in business and other official transactions and interactions.</p> <p>            English came into Nigeria through colonization centuries ago and three main groups of people emerged from this contact of English with the indigenous languages of Nigeria. These groups are the  British,  the new Nigerian elite trained in Britain and the native indigenous population trained  in Nigeria. A local variant of English emerged from the mixing of those groups of people. This local variant of English was coloured by influence from local languages. Borrowing of indigenous words into English is a result of this contact and these borrowed words are what we call ‘loan words’.</p> <p>            Today as English is used in almost every facet of life in Nigeria, it still comes in contact with practically all indigenous Nigerian languages and when Nigerians speak English words from their various indigenous languages occur in their speech</p> <p>            This research work therefore, will find out if students in the University of Ilorin borrow words from English into Yoruba in their day to day interaction and if they do, to identify these borrowings.</p> <p>            We shall also find out the sources of these borrowings. We hope to trace them to the various indigenous languages and which they use in a communication. In other words, effort shall be made extensively on the scope of the study and methodology involved in the collection of data.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.2   Scope and Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>            This study intends to deal with the influence of English language on our indigenous Nigerian languages. To this end ,  we will focus on Yoruba as our case study. This is because Yoruba is the predominant indigenous language of the geographical areas in which this research is being carried out. We then examine if students borrow words from English into Yoruba and specifically if they indulge in code mixing when they communicate in Yoruba by interspersing the Yoruba speech with English words or phrases. </p> <p>            The scope of this study will also cover why and when these students code-mix. This study does not concern itself with error analysis. Therefore attention will not be focused at correcting sentences collected in the process of our analysis.</p> <p>            The examples of borrowing used in our data are English borrowings into Yoruba. This is due to the fact that our data are based on Yoruba which is one of the Nigerian indigenous languages which borrow English language into their languages. The researcher in this research  has decided to limit herself to Yoruba language because of the geographical area she finds herself.</p> <p>            This research work will pay attention to whether  English language has a positive or negative influence on Yoruba one of the Nigerian indigenous languages  so has to find out whether English language aids the growth of Yoruba language or impedes it?</p> <p><strong>1.3 Methodology </strong></p> <p>            The sample population that will be used in this study is 80 (eighty) students of the University of Ilorin. These students shall be randomly chosen from four faculties in the University of Ilorin, which are:-</p> <p>i.                    Faculty of Arts</p> <p>ii.                  Faculty of Agriculture </p> <p>iii.                Faculty of Engineering and </p> <p>iv.                Faculty of Law</p> <p>The students that will be used as subjects from the selected faculties are all Yoruba language speakers.</p> <p>The instruments to be used in the collection of our data are tape recorder and audio cassette in the recording of some natural conversations of undergraduate students of the University of Ilorin. Eighty conversations shall be recorded and the techniques of sampling shall be used by numbering the conversations from one to eighty. The conversations with even numbers would be selected and analyzed.</p> <p>Specifically, 400 level students of four faculties shall be studied and analyzed because it is felt that this category of students know enough English to be affected by the phenomenon being investigated.</p>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE ON OUR NIGERIAN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES: EXAMPLES OF BORROWING FROM ENGLISH INTO YORUBA BY UNILORIN UNDERGRADUATES <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE ON OUR NIGERIAN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES: EXAMPLES OF BORROWING FROM ENGLISH INTO YORUBA BY UNILORIN UNDERGRADUATES ", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CRITICAL DISOURSE ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p><strong>OF</strong></p> <p><strong>OLA ROTIMI’S</strong></p> <p><strong>OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>            Analysis on a discourse level has been used in the analysis of texts, but this study attempts to carry out a Critical Discourse Analysis of Ola Rotimi’s Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again.

CDA along with other related disciplines attempts to reveal hidden meanings i.e. the ideological loads of the language and the exercise of power. CDA is a contemporary approach to the study of language and discourses in social institutions. It focuses on how social relations, identity, knowledge and power are constructed through written and spoken texts in communities, schools and classrooms.</p> <p>CDA aims to make its user<strong>s </strong>aware of and able to describe and deconstruct vectors and effects in texts and semiotic materials generally which might otherwise remain to wield power uncritiqued. In there respects, CDA may be a kind of wake up cal, or consciousness, rising about the coercive or anti-demo criticizing effects of the discourses we live by. Critical discourse analysts take explicit position and thus want to understand, expose and ultimately resist social inequality. In other words, CDA may be seen as a reaction against the dominant formal (social or uncritical most times) paradigms <strong>of</strong> the 1960’s and 1970’s.</p> <p>This project focuses on an attempt to carry out a Critical Discourse Analysis of Ola Rotimi’s <strong>Our Husband has Gone Mad Again</strong>. This chapter therefore focuses on the purpose of study, scope of the study, justification, methodology, data description and author’s background.</p> <p><strong>1.1    PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this project is to critically analyze <strong>Our Husband has Gone Mad Again</strong> by Ola Rotimi using Critical Discourse Analysis. Being that the analysis of a play is rarely done, the researcher is not aware of any previous attempt to do CDA of the text <strong>Our Husband has Gone Mad Again.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project will analyze Ola Rotimi’s <strong>Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again</strong> using Critical Discourse Analysis. It will analyze selected conversations and utterances in the text. There are a lot of CDA elements but only some of them will be selected for the analysis of the text. The analysis will entail how power relations are decoded from the text that links to the society. Findings and conclusions will bring a temporary end to this research work.</p> <p><strong>1.3    JUSTIFICATION</strong></p> <p>In the best knowledge of the researcher as a theoretical construct has not been used in analyzing <strong>Our Husband has Gone Mad Again</strong> by Ola Rotimi. Thus, the study is justifiable as it seeks to investigate the sociopolitical and cultural issues that are inherent in the text. It is also believed that this study will be an additional work in the scholarship of the study of CDA, especially at the undergraduate level.</p> <p><strong>1.4    METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>This project is basically a Critical Discourse Analysis or Ola Rotimi’s <strong>Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again</strong>. Some selected conversations and utterances will be selected from the text for analysis.</p> <p>Norman Fairclough’s theory of CDA has been chosen for the analysis of this research work, some elements have been selected from the theory including the political and sociocultural issues which occur in the text and leads to the society. The textual analysis sociocultural analysis and the political issues of this text will be analyzed.</p> <p><strong>1.5    DATA DESCRIPTION</strong></p> <p>The play, <strong>Our Husband has Gone Mad Again</strong>, is a political satire. It shows the follies and fables of the entire political system in Africa and Nigeria in particular, in a bid to correct some of its anomalies. It lampoons the protagonist Major Rahman Teslim Lejoka-Brown a former military officer who takes to politics with the motif that looks more of vanity patriotism. Ola Rotimi takes a comic swipe at the ideological misfits and opportunist who strut the ever accommodating political landscape of the continent Africa.</p> <p><strong>1.6    AUTHOR’S BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>Olawale Gladstone Emmanuel Rotimi, best known as Ola Rotimi was born in Sapele, former Bendel state of Nigeria on 13th April, 1938, to an Ijaw mother and Yoruba father, so cultural diversity was a recurring theme in his work. He was a playwright, stage director, producer, actor, critic, scholar and a teacher. In his early age, he was exposed to a traditional Nigeria heritage of arts. He was educated at Methodist Boys High School in Lagos from 1952 to 1957. He went to Boston University for a bachelor’s degree in theatre arts where he studied play writing and directing. He later went to Yale University where he had masters in the arts after three years and retired to Nigeria in 1966. While in America, he got married to a French Canadian lady, Hazel a renowned artist, actress, singer and pianist. In Nigeria, Ola Rotimi took a job at the University of Ife, where he was a research fellow from 1966 to 1969 at the institute of African studies. He later became the head of creative arts and director at the University of Port Harcourt.</p> <p>The dramatic works of Ola Rotimi are known throughout Africa and have made him one of the most significant playwrights on that continent. While he was at Yale University on a Rockefeller fellowship, his socio-political comedy <strong>Our Husband has Gone Mad Again</strong> was chosen as Yale’s student play of the year in 1966. Ola Rotimi examines Nigerian’s history and ethnic traditions in his works. Some of his published works are: Introduction to Nigerian Literature, The Gods Are not to Blame (London: Oxford University Press 1971), Kurunmi (Ibadan: University press Limited 1971<strong>), Our Husband has Mad Again </strong>(London: Oxford University press 1977), Ovourumwen Nogbaisi (Benin: London: Ethiopian and Oxford University press 1974), If : A Tragedy of the Ruled (Ibadan: Heinemann 1983). He was in Nigeria until his Nigeria until his death in 2001.</p> <p>Ola Rotimi is sure to be remembered as a model in the literary genre whose views have shaped the conduct of the theater and whose plays have demonstrated the power of drama to shape the thinking of the society and attempted to solve some of the problems encountered in everyday living.  </p>\n\nCRITICAL DISOURSE ANALYSIS     OF     OLA ROTIMI’S     OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL DISOURSE ANALYSIS     OF     OLA ROTIMI’S     OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A LEXICO-SEMATIC ANALYSIS OF OLU OBAFEMI’S NAIRA HAS NO GENDER</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This work focuses on the Lexico-semantic variation of the Nigerian English using Olu Obafemi’s text <em>Naira Has No Gender</em>. The aim of this work is to highlight meaning change according to context and environment. Element of Lexico-semantic variation in Nigerian English which are Transfer, Analogy, Acronyms, Semantic Shift and Extension and Coinages or Neologism identified by Adegbija (1989) are used to analyse data collected from Olu Obafemi’s <em>Naira Has No Gender</em>. In this analysis we discovered that lexical usage varies according to context and situation. We found out that contextual use of lexis resulted in meaning change. We also discovered that English usage in Nigeria reflects the culture and its various languages.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>Chapter One </p> <p>General Introduction</p> <p>1.0       General Introduction</p> <p>1.1     The English Language in Nigeria</p> <p>1.2    The Use of English Language in Nigerian Literature</p> <p>1.3    Purpose of the Study</p> <p>1.4    Significance of the Study</p> <p>1.5    Scope of the Study</p> <p>1.6   Methodology</p> <p>1.7   A Short Biography of Olu Obafemi</p> <p>1.8   A summary <em>Naira Has No Gender</em></p> <p>Chapter Two </p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>2.0       Introduction</p> <p>2.1       Nigerian English</p> <p>2.2       General Features of Nigerian English</p> <p>2.3       Lexico-Semantic Variation in Nigerian English</p> <p>2.4       Standardizing Nigerian English: A Conceptualization</p> <p>2.5       Conclusion</p> <p>Chapter Three</p> <p>Data Analysis</p> <p>3.0       Introduction</p> <p>3.1       Presentation of Data</p> <p>3.2       Summary Table of Analysis</p> <p>3.3       Data Discussion</p> <p>3.4       Research Findings</p> <p>Chapter Four</p> <p>Summary, Recommendations &amp; Conclusion</p> <p>4.0       Introduction</p> <p>4.1       Summary</p> <p>4.2       Recommendations</p> <p>4.3       Conclusion</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Language is the brain behind communication among human beings in different societies (Jackson, 1990, p.1). This implies that ideas, messages, norms etc., are shared among people in divergent societies through conventional symbols and sounds- verbal communication. But communication can be non-verbal e.g. shaking of hands, gestures, nodding, winking etc. Jackson (ibid).</p> <p>An aspect of this broad means of communication is lexic-semantics which is formed by lexis and semantics. Lexis is “the vocabulary of a language”  (Crystal 2008, p. 279). While semantics is defined as “a major branch of LINGUISTICS devoted to the study of MEANING in LANGUAGE (crystal, 2008, p. 428). Thus the selection of words in relation to their functional ends in terms of meaning informs the field of lexico-semantics. This implies that each time a language user sets out to speak or write, he/she is faced with choices to select from among infinite sets of lexical items.</p> <p>However, since contexts that constrain language users when speaking or writing differ in situational, socio-cultural, political and geographical degrees, there is bound to be lexico-semantic variation. The English language as used in the Nigerian context differs in these degrees, from the ways it is used in native contexts such as the USA, the UK, Canada, etc, (Jenkins, 2003). In this connection, Adedimeji (2009, p.2) has this to say “In Nigeria… the need to express local wisdom and concepts through the medium of an otherwise foreign language had generated the regional lexico-semantic variation that characterizes the use of Language.”</p> <p>It is against this background that we set out to investigate <em>Naira Has No Gender</em> (a play piece by Olu Obafemi) through the lens of Lexico-semantics. The underlying assumption is that, since the text is written in English to express the socio-political realities of Nigeria, we shall then attempt to relate these “Nigerianisms” to their functional imports in the social context.</p> <p>It is a compelling truism that the English Language is a world Language and that it is according to Aje, (2003).</p> <p>“…. the most colonized and the most colonizing….” Language. This submission is reminiscent of the many invasions experienced by the people that lived on the island now called England and the imperialism and colonization of the English in many parts of the world. Nigeria was not an exception in the colonization business of the English.</p> <p>The Nurture of English Language in Nigeria could be principally attributed to colonization, Christianity and commerce in the Country. For instance, the Christian missionaries were saddled with the responsibilities of proselytizing people from their traditional believes to Christianity, thereby establishing missionary schools whre the new African convert were taught how to read the Bible, Alabi (2007 p.78). This implies that the main aim of the missionaries was not to teach the English language for its own sake, but to make peole understand the message of the Bible. And since contact between people leads to linguistic and cultural transaction, the English Language was gradually being appropriated by the indigenes.</p> <p>And like Christianity, colonialism is also a contributing factor in the nurture of English Language in Nigeria. To this end, (alibi, 2007, P. 28) has this to say,…. Later, the British colonized Nigeria and of course, used their language. English for administration. This administration states of the English further advanced the nurture and survival of English in the Country.</p> <p>Equally prior to Christianity and colonialism, there had been trades contacks between certain British sailors in certain parts of the Country (Musaka, 2003, p.23); (Adedimeji 2009, p. 4-5).</p> <p>These activities were followed by the infamous. Trans-Atlantic Slave trade, business returned some African states as Liberia, Sierra Leone etc. Their exposure to the European world implies that they were exposed to the English Language as well.</p> <p>1.2       THE USE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN NIGERIAN LITERATURE</p> <p>There seems to be a proliferation of Nigerian literary works in the English language throughout the country, and it is observed that the country has the greatest output of literature in Africa in English Language, (http://www.onlinenigeria.com/Nigerianliterature/). Some of these works were originally written in the indigenous languages such as Fagunwa’s Igbo Olodumare translated by Ajadi (1984, 1995) as the Forest of God.</p> <p>From the wake of the struggle, for independence in the 1950s, writers such as Achebe had written literary pieces to orchestrate the voice of the Nigerians against colonialism. These writers also extended their struggles against social, political and cultural maladjustments to the Present-post-colonial periods when independence had been achieved. For instance Soyinka’s The Man Died, and Kongi’s Harvest Achebe’s A Man of the People, and Anthills of the Savanah, and  Amadu’s Sunset in Biafra, are important literary works of Nigerian.  It could be said that the Nigerian Literature in English is the one which attracts greater attention and have the greater influence nationally and internationally” (http://www.onlinenigeria.com/Nigerianliterature/). This is probably due to the fact that English language has gained a wide currency nation wide and internationally.</p> <p>The Drama, one of the three genres of literature, is a medium through which the Nigerian socio-political and cultural realities are mediated by using English language in particular. But this English seems to have maintained a middle course by trying to balance the equation between Nigerian socio-cultural contexts and the foreign tongue (English). This is expressly visible in the words of Achebe (1975) cited by Adedimeji, 2007 p.166) “The English language will be able to carry the weight of my African experiences. But it will have to be a new English, still in full communion with its ancestral home but altered to suit its new Africa environment.” This seems to be the place of English language in Nigerian literature.</p> <p>1.3       THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of the study is aimed at investigating <em>Naira Has No Gender</em> by Olu Obafemi using Lexico-semantic variation as our theoretical construct. It is presumed that the text has within it traces of Nigerianism which we shall attempt to bring to the limelight.</p> <p>The study is as well premised on the need to explicate these Nigerianism vis-à-vis their functional uses in socio-political and cultural contexts where they are applied.</p> <p>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Much work had been done in the analysis of many Nigerian literary works using different theoretical frame works.  This work, it is hoped, shall advance the scholarship in lexico-semantic variation in Nigerian literary works.</p> <p>Beneficiaries of this study include students at the secondary School and undergraduates levels. Readers from other disciplines can as well benefit from the study as it will intimate them with such usages as Nigerianisms which are used in literary texts, with <em>Naira Has No Gender</em> being a case study.</p> <p>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Texts (literary texts inclusive) can be x-rayed through different layers of linguistic analysis such as morphology, syntax, pragmatics etc. However, due to time and space constraints and for a thorough analysis, we have restricted ourselves in this study to the lexico-semantic variation specifically the five typologies of Adegbija (1989). Another underlying reason for this restriction is that Lexico semantic variation best explains the socio-cultural aspects inherent in texts, literary texts in this case. The whole play will be studied with a view to identifying and classifying its lexico-semantic patterns.</p> <p>1.6       METHODOLOGY</p> <p>This study will be descriptive and analytic. It will adopt Adegbija’s (1989) classification of lexico-semantic variation in Nigeria English. These are: Transfer, Analogy, Acronyms, Semantic Shift or Extension and Coinages or Neologism and the framework will be used in describing and analyzing the data.</p> <p>1.7       A SHORT BIOGRAPHY OF OLU OBAFEMI</p> <p>Olu Obafemi was born on April 4, 1950 in Akutupa Bunu, Kogi state, Nigeria. He read English at the Ahmadu Bello University of Leeds, England, specializing in dramatic literature.</p> <p>Olu Obafemi, a professor of English at the University of Ilorin is a playwright, a poet and a scholar. His published works includes Night of Mystical Beast, Wheels, Pestle on the Mortar. His published plays have been performed to audience in Nigerian Universities and to Africa and international audience in Kenya, Cameroon, England and the United States.</p> <p>Obafemi has won many academic fellowships and awards. He was awarded the DAAD study visit to the University of Bayreuth, Germany in 1993,1994 and 1995. Professor Obafemi is a fellow of the Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA) as well as fellow of the Society of Nigerian Theatre Arts (SONTA).</p> <p>Olu Obafemi, a man of many part is currently the chairman, National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.8       NAIRA HAS NO GENDER</p> <p>Naira has No Gender by Olu Obafemi is one of his over thirty plays ever written ‘…through his University base theatre outfit, Ajon players and the University theatre works in Leeds.’</p> <p>The playwright writes about the play as follows:</p> <p>I have chose an ostensibly trivial part-domestic, part-social issue in this play to examine how conscious (socially and politically) individuals confront the reality of the existence in a bankrupt cynical and dysfunctional social order (Obafemi, 1990, p5).</p> <p>Here the central focus of the play has been revealed. And since drama is meant to be acted, and not read, the play is said to have been performed several times across the globe.</p>\n\nA LEXICO-SEMATIC ANALYSIS OF OLU OBAFEMI’S NAIRA HAS NO GENDER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A LEXICO-SEMATIC ANALYSIS OF OLU OBAFEMI’S NAIRA HAS NO GENDER", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF CHRISTIAN HANBILLS AND POSTERS</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Generally, christain handbills and posters are meant to invite people for programs in churches. Different handbills and posters have different meanings. It has been observed that there are other hidden meanings to these sentences, to this effect, the researcher hopes to highlight the meanings pragmatically. Data have been collected from churches and placement centers in Ilorin, the data will be analyzed using some pragmatics elements such as presupposition, implicature, context, etc. through which we will be able to deduce adherent meanings in christain handbills and posters. The study showed that many writers just design handbills without knowing the implied meaning of what they have written, by doing this, many readers have been led astray and made to believe things that were unintended. As a result of this work, we have been made to see that handbills and posters should not just be written without total consideration of what the readers might imply and assume.</p> <p> TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0       Introduction</p> <p>1.1       Purpose of study</p> <p>1.2       Scope of study</p> <p>1.3       Methodology</p> <p>1.4       Justification</p> <p>1.5       Christain handbills and posters</p> <p>1.6       Summary</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>2.0       Introduction</p> <p>2.1       Pragmatics</p> <p>2.2      Theories of pragmatics</p> <p>2.3       Elements of pragmatics</p> <p>2.4       Handbills and posters</p> <p>2.5       Summary</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0       Introduction</p> <p>3.1       Data analysis</p> <p>3.2       Summary</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>4.0       Introduction</p> <p>4.1       Summary</p> <p>4.2       Findings</p> <p>4.3       Conclusions</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>       Language is a sort of code system, a carrier of information which is capable of transmitting only intended meaning whatsoever. It also reveals man’s socio-cultural beliefs and thoughts. The importance of language is for easy communication, expression and enlightenment. The traditional linguists believe that language has an intended meaning and that the recipient has only to understand that meaning by interpreting it to make communication work. In that case, the above information given about language means that we can deduce different meaning from the same language used in different contexts.</p> <p>Sanusi (1996 p 8) states that “if you have not developed language, you simply don’t have access to most of human experiences, and if you don’t have access to experience, then you are not going to be able to think. That is, language is very important and cannot be removed from a community or else, the community is officially dead.</p> <p>The reason for success in a community is being able to communicate intelligibly because it is difficult to function without language.</p> <p>Through language, several acts are performed and there are possibilities that the writer of a handbill can cajole people to come to his church by putting up an upcoming event. This is where pragmatics comes in, the writer of a handbill has used some pragmatic elements in the construction of those handbills and this is what the researcher has decided to show to all.</p> <p>Pragmatics is an important aspect in the use of handbills and posters because it is necessary to decode the messages embedded in the handbills. The linguistic encyclopedia (1990) defines pragmatics as “the study of rule and principle which govern language in use”. That is, pragmatics is the study of language use.</p> <p>1.1 PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>Handbills and posters are well known by the people. It is here and there and people read them and just ignore some sentences that they see. In view of this, the researcher hopes to highlight these expressions and help bring out the meaning that they might have pragmatically. Doing this will help the writers and those reading them to know what a particular expression mean within and outside the context used.</p> <p>1.2    SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>The scope of this study will be limited to the important role played by pragmatics in the expressions/sentences used in these handbills and posters.</p> <p>There are so many handbills and posters in the world today, but, the researcher has limited this study to some of the handbills and posters in Ilorin and also the researcher has narrowed it down to twenty (20) Christian handbills and posters only.</p> <p>1.3 METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The research work is divided into four chapters for easy analysis. Chapter one introduces what the research work is all about. That is, the general introduction. The literature review makes up the next chapter which is chapter two.</p> <p>The major data for this study will be gathered from some selected handbills and posters of Christian adverts in Ilorin. A total sample of twenty (20) handbills and posters will be collected and analyzed in chapter three (3). Chapter four (4) sums up the whole work with observations, summary and conclusions. Then the references end it.</p> <p>1.4 JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>Although, researches have been carried out in this field, the researcher aims to add more to what other researcher must have done. The researcher is willing to know if the expressions on those handbills and posters have other meanings.</p> <p>This study will also help to promote the study of pragmatics in the field of language study. It will also serve as a guideline for students who might be interested in this field to know the effect of pragmatics on the expressions used in handbills and posters.</p> <p>1.5        CHRISTAIN HANDBILLS AND POSTERS</p> <p>Handbills and posters are used by so many people; they are used by music industries, beauty pageantries, schools, Muslims, Christians. Etc. but the researcher considers Christian/church handbills and posters most suitable for this research work.</p> <p>Christians are people who believe in the Almighty God and worship him in church. They are headed by pastors, deacons, elders, priests, bishops, reverend fathers, etc. we have different kinds of churches in Nigeria, we have the Catholics, Anglicans, Pentecostals, etc. and each of these want people/Christians to worship in their churches. In order to achieve this aim, they do things like evangelism, crusades, praise nights, sharing of handbills etc. telling them about upcoming event/events or about their church services.</p> <p>Most of these handbills and posters contain the names of their churches, host pastors, venue, time, themes, and other sentences to encourage them to come, some of these sentences include testimonies, words of encouragement etc. the main in general is to invite people to their churches in order to fellowship with them.</p> <p>Handbills and posters are littered everywhere but just few will be selected for the progress of this work.</p> <p>1.6      SUMMARY</p> <p>This chapter has been able to give a general introduction on language, Pragmatics and Christian handbills and posters. It also stated the purpose, scope, methodology, justification, of the research. It also gave us a little insight on Christian handbills and posters.</p> <p>The next chapter will be a review of the works of various scholars based on the research.</p>\n\nA PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF CHRISTIAN HANBILLS AND POSTERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF CHRISTIAN HANBILLS AND POSTERS", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF NIGERIAN PROVERBS IN WOLE SOYINKA’S “THE LION AND THE JEWEL”</strong></p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0     INTRODUCTION</p> <p>            Communication in the society happens chiefly by means of language. However, the users of language, as social beings, communicate and use language within the context as society; society controls their access to the linguistic and communicative means. Language, being the most important means of communication, interaction and social integration among individuals in the society, needs to be preserved, sustained,  and properly developed. Language, by definition, is said to be the human vocal noise or the arbitrary graphic representation of the noise, used systematically and conventionally by members of a speech community for the purpose of communication. (Osisanwo 2003:1)</p> <p>As evident in the Nigerian context, when using language to communicate, some expressions are not considered rich except such expressions are buttressed with proverbs. These proverbs are rich with words of wisdom and they are passed across from generation to generation. Proverbs can be said to be succinct and pithy sayings in general use, expressing commonly held ideas and beliefs. (Encyclopeadia Britannica, 2010)<em>.</em></p> <p>Pragmatics can be seen as a branch of study concerned with the ability of language users to pair sentence with context in which they would be appropriate. (Levinson, 1983:24). The pragmatics of English can be said to be one of the linguistic features of Nigerian English. This study will discuss at length pragmatics along side with proverbs in our subsequent discussion.</p> <p>1.1     THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN NIGERIA</p> <p>The evolution of English language in Nigeria has been traced by Alabi (1994:187) to pre-trans-Atlantic slave trade era, specifically in 1553 when some British were said to have paid a very brief visit to the Nigerian coasts especially the ports of Benin and old Calabar. The first obstacle confronted by the visitors was communication barrier between the native and the English men. There was then a pressing need to dislodge this obstruction, hence, the need to teach the basic English for communication, business transaction, and missionary activities and for other functions.</p> <p>At the initial stage, the medium of communication between the English men and the native was an English-based pidgin. Since the traders, missionaries and colonial administrators were not willing to learn the indigenous language(s), English had to be imposed and taught in order to train clerks, interpreters, stewards and messengers to help white men in administrative and domestic activities.</p> <p>It is therefore evident that the cornerstone of the British introduction of the teaching of English language was not based on evolution of a “standard” English but on the emergence of fairly communicative English. Therefore, right from the outset, there has been a basis for dialectal varieties in Nigeria spoken English.</p> <p>Consequently, the use of English in Nigeria survived the departure of the colonial administrators as the official language. Now, several years after independence, English still survives and assumes a more important status in Nigeria. It is a medium of social and inter-ethnic communication. It is used as a medium of instruction in schools: primary, secondary and tertiary. There is no gainsaying that ultimately, a variant of English tagged Nigerian English has become an inevitable variety from one culture to another bringing about various English varieties/dialects. Thus, the English language has attained a dominant status in Nigeria such that it is arguable that the survival of the country largely depends on it as the language of unity, nationism and intra- and inter-ethnic communication. </p> <p>1.2     PROVERBS AND THE PRAGMATICS OF ENGLISH IN NIGERIA</p> <p>Nuggets of popular wisdom abound in many African languages to accentuate and highlight discourses in given context. These expressions of wisdom are usually referred to as proverbs (Adedimeji 2003:54). Proverbs are used in different ways in the Nigerian context. This shows that Africans, especially Nigerians, cannot communicate effectively on many occasions without punctuating their expressions with proverbs. This is because proverbs are part of every spoken language and are handed down from generation to generation, The reality of which has become an attribute of Nigerian English.</p> <p>English as a second language in Nigeria has undergone many changes to suit the Nigerian English speakers. Certain flavour and ‘Nigerianisms’ have been added to it to ensure its (English) survival in the Nigerian context. The Nigerian Standard English is said to enjoy social acceptability and international intelligibility. Some scholars are of different views concerning this. Alabi (2007:81), for instance is of the view that, the English which is used in the Nigerian environment is something other than a replica of native speakers’ varieties. Kujore cited by Alabi (2007:81) buttresses this point that English as a living language is bound to undergo many changes in such a foreign environment as Nigeria’s whose cultural and linguistic backgrounds are different from those of English in its native environment.</p> <p>Many characteristic features of Nigerian dialectal forms of the English language exist at the phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic. Interestingly, these ethnic traits do not simply disappear just because a speaker is educated. This is because variation in English reveals more of cultural differences. The language as it is now has been ‘domesticated’ in Nigeria to reflect the general social context within which it functions.</p><p> <em>Achebe, quoted by Kachru (1981:25) says …</em> </p> <p><em>I feel that English language will be able to carry the</em></p> <p><em>weight of African experience. But it will have to be a</em></p> <p><em>new English, still in full communion with its ancestral</em></p> <p><em>but uttered to suit its new African surroundings.</em></p> <p> </p> <p>Adedimeji (2007:166) submits that, as language reflects the totality of culture, mores, philosophy and customs of its speakers, Nigerian English showcases the traditional  experiences of Nigerians.</p> <p>The above utterance by Achebe is manifested in what is called pragmatic variation which will includes: euphemisms, kinship terms, greetings, idiomaticity, discourse/conversational implicature, politeness, transfer features and proverbs (Adedimeji 2007: 166-169) making the pragmatic features of Nigeria English. These are briefly discussed as follows:</p> <p>EUPHEMISMS: These are expressions that are used to lessen the bad effect of something or situation; present unpleasant or unsuitable situation in a pleasant and elevated manner.</p> <p>KINSHIP TERMS: These are words that reflect deep family and social relationship.</p> <p>GREETINGS: Nigerian cultures place much emphasis on greetings. This is manifested in the following examples “Well done”, “Welcome”, “Sorry”, (even when one has not caused the inconvenience).</p> <p>IDIOMATICITY: This has to do with the use of idioms. They are expressions which meaning cannot be known literarily.</p> <p>DISCOURSE/CONVERSATIONAL IMPLICATURE: This happens when one or all of the Gricean maxims, i.e. Quality (be informative as required), Quality (be truthful), Manner (be clear), Relation (be relevant) are flouted and not adhered to.</p> <p>POLITENESS: Expressions showing respect are created by the Nigerian speaker of English to exhibit all the titles of the addressee so as not to rob the person of being addressed of his/her supposed dignity and respect.</p> <p>TRANSFER FEATURES: These are patterns that reflect the influence of Nigerian languages on English.</p> <p>PROVERBS: These are ancient sayings of wisdom handed down from generation to generation. The Nigerian uses of proverbial expressions have led to the formation of English that is out of tone with the standard British English because some proverbs in Nigeria are directly translated from mother tongue e.g. ‘there is no smoke without fire’, ‘A man running during the day time, if he is not after something, then something must be after him’, etc. These proverbs among several thousands of Nigerian proverbs enrich the pragmatic variation of Nigerian English.</p> <p>1.3     PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to examine how meaning is generated from the use of proverbs and beyond the level of general conversational meaning. Also, this study aims to survey the importance of proverbs in Nigerian culture. This study also aims at showcasing Wole Soyinka as a competent writer whose work is relevant to the Nigerian society.</p> <p>1.4     SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>              This will be limited to the identification and analysis of Nigerian proverbs in <em>The Lion and the Jewel</em>. All Nigerian proverbs found in the chosen text will constitute the body of data for the research work. This work shall not examine proverbs outside the chosen text. Pragmatic theory will be used in the course of the study.</p> <p>1.5     JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY</p> <p>This study is being embarked upon because no study of this nature, to the knowledge of the researcher has focused on the pragmatics of Soyinka’s proverbs in <em>The Lion and the Jewel.</em> In this research work, the researcher came across such works as Alabi (2009), which focuses on the syntactic structures of proverbs in Achebe’s and Adimora-Ezegbo’s trilogies, Adedimeji (2009), which focuses on a universal pragmatic analysis of Nigerian proverbs in Ola Rotimi’s <em>Kurunmi</em>, Arimi (2009), which concentrates on the contexted wisdom on Indonesian and Japanese proverbs, and Adeleke (2009) that focuses on the aspect of Yoruba history in the proverbs.</p> <p>In the above works, the researchers focused on proverbs in different aspects. This work will be different from the above as the researcher will analyze the Nigerian proverbs using the  pragmatic framework. This study will go a long way in helping people to know the importance of proverbs in our society.</p> <p>1.6     RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>In this research work, all Nigerian proverbs in the chosen text will constitute the body of data. However, to achieve comprehensibility and better understanding, various elements of pragmatics are not only pertinent but also required. Therefore, the data will be analysed using the elements suitable such as speech act, context, presupposition, implicature, intention, inference and mutual contextual belief (MCB).</p> <p>1.7   WOLE SOYINKA AND A SYNOPSIS OF HIS <em>THE LION AND THE JEWEL</em></p> <p>Wole Soyinka was born on 13th July 1934 at Abeokuta, Ogun State. After preparatory University studies in 1954 at Government College in Ibadan, he continued at the University of Leeds. During the six years spent in England, he was a dramaturgist at the Royal Court Theatre in London 1958-1959. In 1960, he was awarded a Rockefeller bursary and returned to Nigeria to study African Drama. At the same time, he taught drama and literature at various Universities in Ibadan, Lagos, and Ife, where, since 1975 he was appointed professor of comparative literature. In 1960, he founded the theatre group, “The 1960 Masks” and in 1964, the “Orisun Theatre Company” through which he produced his own plays and performed as an actor. He has periodically been a visiting professor to the Universities of Cambridge, Sheffield, and Yule.</p> <p>During the civil war in Nigeria, Soyinka appealed in an article for cease-fire. For this he</p> <p>was arrested in 1967, accused of conspiring with the Biafra rebels, and was held as a political prisoner for 22 months until 1969. Soyinka has published about 20 works: drama, prose and poetry. His writing is based on the methodology of his own tribe- the Yoruba- with Ogun, the god of iron and war, at the centre. He wrote his first plays during his time in London, <em>The Stomp Dwellers</em> and <em>The Lion and the Jewel</em> (a night comedy), which were performed at Ibadan in 1958 and1959 and were published in 1963.</p> <p>The play, <em>The Lion and the Jewel</em> is set in the village of Ilujinle. Lakunle catches a glimpse of Sidi carrying a pail on her head, and rushes out of the classroom to seize the pail. He tries to emulate European notion of courtesy by relieving Sidi of her burden, though carrying water is traditionally a woman’s task. When Lakunle proposes to Sidi, he is quoting words he has read in popular English books about marriage, with his pretentious metaphors being answered by Sidi’s pithy proverbs.</p> <p>The heightened when Sidi says she wants a bride-price. She insists on this because of the tradition which will prove her value in the eyes of the village. The girls come to tell Sidi about the magazine which contains her images and that of Baroka, the Bale of Ilujinle. Photographs of Sidi have pride of place, on the cover and centre spread, whilst the village bale, has only a small corner inside. Sidi realizes the power of her beauty, placing her above the leader of her people.</p> <p>Baroka was once a powerful warrior. He has lived a long life and acquired many concubines. Now he wants Sidi and sends his head wife, Sadiku, to propose to her. This is common in many cultures for men to use elderly women as intermediary to solicit a new bride. Sidi is not interested since he is an old man, and with arrogance of youthful pride, rebukes his advances. But Baroka is a wily old fox, not so easily brushed aside. He is determined to have Sidi, and hatches a plan to seduce her. Sidi falls for Baroka’s seduction and finally gets married to Baroka.</p>\n\nA PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF NIGERIAN PROVERBS IN WOLE SOYINKA’S “THE LION AND THE JEWEL”<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF NIGERIAN PROVERBS IN WOLE SOYINKA’S “THE LION AND THE JEWEL”", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A PRAGMATIC STUDY OF SOME SELECTED POLITICAL POSTERS</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This long essay focuses on the pragmatics study of selected political posters imprinted in the pages of selected newspapers.

The data of choice were randomly selected (from the pages of <em>THE NATION, THE SUN</em> and <em>THE VANGUARD</em> newspapers) and the pragmatic elements were applied on them. Posters are capable of influencing the mind of the reader(s) when the context is taken into consideration, political ones for that matter. Implicitly, there are hidden intentions in most political posters. The pragmatic elements help to bring out the intended meaning of most posters. The outcome was evident in course of this research work.

There is countless number of things which we could do or use to achieve. It is therefore, no surprise if language is used to influence decision in various ways (even in the field of politics). Can one really mention any particular field of endeavour that does not involve the use of language?</p> <p>      This bring us to the view about pragmatics; an aspect of language study. Communication in any society happens chiefly by means of language. However, the users of language as social beings communicate and use language in the society’s premises. Mey (2001), in his second publication: <em>Pragmatics: An Introduction </em>has this to say:</p> <p><em>    …pragmatics as the study of the way human being use their</em></p> <p><em>                                         Language in communication, bases itself on a study of those</em></p> <p><em>                                         Premises and determine how they effect and effectualize human</em></p> <p><em>                                         Language use… (pp6)</em></p> <p>         With the above aforementioned extracted text, we therefore, take a critical look at pragmatics, its influence on the analysis of political posters. The strength it commands in influencing the needed effect.</p> <p>1.1         PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>       The purpose of this research work is to identify the influence of pragmatics elements on encoded texts or utterance; the meaning that is implied and the effect on the addressee. We do this with the use of deployed political posters (statements) in the field of politics. Besides exploiting the features of pragmatics, this study seeks to analyse the thought provoking influence of such political posters; the rules of pragmatics governing the use of language in this aspect.</p> <p>This study, we hope, prioritize on the need to view utterance as instrumental in influencing necessary developmental changes. We also analyse the feature of context, among other things, as a necessary factor to understanding inherent objectives of most political posters. We intend to carry-out this work in relation to semantics since the synergy will help us in understanding of this research work.</p> <p>1.2      JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>So far it has been discovered from the analysis of previous research that many a researcher, who have carried research works  on this particular aspect of pragmatics and its use on political posters have left some unresolved issues which we hope to clarify. Previous or past works on this matter need be advanced with the hope that future researchers would find it worthwhile in making reference to this work as a stepping stone. The manipulation of language as pointed out in the work of Mey (2001, p308) in his publication <em>Pragmatics: An Introduction</em> is an issue that need be corrected. The author seems to view utterance (what he referred to as ‘manipulation’) from the negative aspect. It must be stated that not all manipulation of language are of diabolic intention. Mey (2001) gave limited information which we hope to expand. Conversely, this present work will take a deeper look at the utterance of political posters (i.e. word captions, pictures, and headlines etc), their pragmatic meaning and implication on the hearers.</p> <p>1.3       THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY     </p> <p>         There are many aspect of pragmatics in different fields, delving into all its parts in entire will be too daunting for this research work. It is, therefore, necessary to limit our research to a more specific unit. Herein, we make use of Leech’s (1983) <em>Principles of Pragmatics</em> as we attempt to define, describe, analyse, explain and subsume the core aspects of pragmatics. This will, in no small way, help our understanding of some selected political posters i.e. applying those pragmatic features on samples of political newspaper headlines, pictures, captions etc entailing how meanings are decoded from them.</p> <p>1.4      METHODOLOGY</p> <p>      The data of choice as used in this research work would be from randomly selected samples of political posters. By this, we mean deploying pragmatic elements, rules ad theories to captions, pictures etc in political aspect. These data material are randomly selected. We analyse them (i.e. the posters), the language and the affect they are trying to draw from the readers or hearers; the information they convey to the readership etc. we examine the level of understanding these political posters.</p> <p>1.5    DATA DESCRIPTION</p> <p>     The data of choice for our analysis focuses on the events building up to the 2011 elections, the presidency state visits, and legal tussle that characterised the previous election held in Nigeria. All these data were imprinted in the pages of newspapers that fall within the year 2010.</p> <p>Majority of these data, seven of them precisely, were randomly selected from the <em>THE NATION</em> newspaper. Two of them were taken from <em>THE VANGUARD</em> newspaper. A datum was taken from <em>THE SUN</em> newspaper. The imprinted political posters in these daily newspapers were randomly analysed. We apply the pragmatic elements on these data wherever applicable.</p> <p>The next chapter shall deal with the theoretical aspect of pragmatics and the various postulations about pragmatics.</p>\n\nA PRAGMATIC STUDY OF SOME SELECTED POLITICAL POSTERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PRAGMATIC STUDY OF SOME SELECTED POLITICAL POSTERS", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF SELECTED CARTOONS FROM NIGERIAN DAILIES THE ‘GUARDIAN, THE PUNCH, AND THE NATION’</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This work investigates how meaning is derived in an utterance through cartoons.

It then gives the purpose, the justification, the scope of the study, research methodology, data description and finally, it includes by giving a summary of a pragmatic analysis of selected cartoons from Nigerian dailies.” The Guardian, The Punch and The Nation”</p> <p>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>The power of language makes man so distinct and different from all other creatures. Language allows man to communicate since the effective communication means the appropriate use of language in a relevant content. This work intends to investigate how communication is achieved among interlocutors and language has been used as a means of conversation.</p> <p>In everyday interactions, we use language to communicate with other people either in oral or within form. It has been observed that many newspaper readers do not show interest in cartoons reading as the way they do to other part, of the Newspaper. Meanwhile, there are many things to pass across to the readers through the cartoons. It is entertaining and informative.</p> <p>Therefore, the main focus of this work is to look at the pragmatic features in a cartoon text, some selected cartoons from Nigerian dailies “The Guardian, The Punch and The Nation will be analyzed using features of pragmatics analysis.</p> <p>1.2    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to examine the pragmatic features of cartoon from Nigerian dailies. The Guardian, The Punch and The Nation 2010. It also investigates how communication is achieved among the participant, how meaning is derived and the pragmatic features employed by cartoon writers to pass across their intended messages to readers.</p> <p>1.3       JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Interaction gives the meaning of certain word when an utterance is uttered. There is a need for a research work on this study to pay attention to on cartoons. By doing this, the pragmatic features and element will be identified. This will assist students and readers to read cartoons at their leisure time.</p> <p>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study is being carried out using cartoons as a data from Nigerian dailies The Guardian, The Punch and The Nation. The cartoon chosen are twelve in all, these cartoons will cover three (3) months editions 2010 i.e August, September and October 2010. Some chosen features of pragmatic analysis include Context, Participants, Mutual Contextual Beliefs (MCBs), Intention, Message, Inference, Pre-supposition, Implicature, Reference and World Knowledge.</p> <p>1.5     RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The data for this study are cartoons selected from Nigerian dailies “The Guardian, The Punch, The Nation. This research work will cover three months edition of newspapers published in the month of August, September and October 2010. The cartoons are twelve in all.  Examples of the pragmatic features used will be identified in the conversation of characters in the text.</p> <p>1.6    DATA DESCRIPTION</p> <p>The data chosen for this research work are cartoons selected from Nigerian dailies “The Guardian, The Punch and The Nation. Cartoons are interaction between two or more people, these people are usually sketched with a box pointing towards each of them. It contains their various utterances, some are political others are not .e.g Adult, Children and Government etc. The cartoonists of the selected cartoons are Femora, Neearo, Prasad Golla, Edun, Didi Onu, Obe ESS, Mayowa Adetula, Tayo Olujimi, Chukky, Stanley and Azeez Sanni.</p>\n\nA PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF SELECTED CARTOONS FROM NIGERIAN DAILIES THE ‘GUARDIAN, THE PUNCH, AND THE NATION’<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF SELECTED CARTOONS FROM NIGERIAN DAILIES THE ‘GUARDIAN, THE PUNCH, AND THE NATION’", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A SOCIOLINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF PROVERBS IN ADIMORA- EZEIGBO’ S TRAFFICKED</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Language is learned, shared, and it is an arbitrary system of vocal symbols through which human beings in the same speech community or     sub-culture interact and hence communicate in terms of their common experience and expectations. Sociolinguistics is the study of any or all aspects of the society, including cultural norms, values, and beliefs. This research set out to carry out a sociolinguistic analysis of the proverbs in Adimora- Ezeigbo’s <em>Trafficked. </em>The sociolinguistic analysis of the selected proverb was carried out by using the Dell Hymes’ Ethnographic acronym model. The research found out that the settings, participants, ends, act sequence, key, instrumentality, norms, and genres allow for a comprehensive understanding of the data. It was also found out that in analyzing the proverbs, transfer of lexemes of other languages cannot be avoided due to non-availability of their translations in the English language. From these findings, the study submitted that sociolinguistics is a veritable tool in the analyzing and understanding of oral traditions to people of various cultures.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>Chapter One: GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1   Introduction</p> <p>1.2   Aims of the study<br/></p> <p>1.3   Justification<br/></p> <p>1.4  Scope of the study<br/></p> <p>1.5   Methodology<br/></p> <p>1.6   Data Description<br/></p> <p>1.7   The Author: Adimora- Ezeigbo<br/></p> <p>Chapter Two: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>2.0 Introduction<br/></p> <p>2.1 The concept of Sociolinguistics                                                           </p> <p>2.2 Sociolinguistic Theories                                                                         </p> <p>2.2.1 Language Ideology                                                                          </p> <p>2.2.2 Basil Bernstein’s Sociolinguistic Theory of Language Codes     </p> <p>2.2.3 The Sapir- Whorf Language Hypothesis                                      </p> <p>2.2.4 Dell Hathaway Hymes’ ‘Ethnography Theory’                           </p> <p>2.2.4.1 Hymes’  “SPEAKING” Model<br/></p> <p>2.3 Social Variables                                                                                      </p> <p>2.4 Diglossia                                                                                                </p> <p>2.5 Bilingualism and Multilingualism                                                        </p> <p>2.6 Speech Communities                                                                            </p> <p>2.7 Taboo and Euphemisms                                                                      </p> <p>2.8 Code Mixing and Code switching                                                       </p> <p>2.9 The Igbo Tradition in the Nigerian novel                                         </p> <p>3.0 A Conceptual Review of Proverbs                                                      </p> <p>3.1 Sub- genres of Proverbs                                                                        </p> <p>3.2 Functions of Proverbs                                                                          </p> <p>3.3 Conclusion                                                                                             </p> <p> Chapter Three: PRESENTATION OF DATA</p> <p>3.1 Introduction<br/></p> <p>3.2 Sociolinguistic analysis of proverbs in Adimora- Ezeigbo’s <em>TRAFFICKED</em>                                               3.3 Findings                                                    </p> <p>Chapter Four:</p> <p>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>4.1 Summary                                                                                          </p> <p>4.2 Conclusion                                                                                          </p> <p>4.3 Recommendations                                                                              </p> <p>REFERENCES</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 INTRODUCTION                                                                                       </p> <p>Language is both an individual and a social possession. It is said to serve interactive and integrative functions. We would expect, therefore, that certain individuals would behave linguistically like other individuals; they might be said to speak the same language or the same dialect or the same variety. Language is what the members of a particular society speak. When two or more people communicate with each other in speech, we can call the system of communication a code. In most cases, that code will be something we may also want to call “a language”.</p> <p>Every culture codifies its values in its own language. Through systems of myths, anecdotes, stories, proverbs and others, values are defined and good-bad differentiations are specified. More formal systems are also evolved and are represented by ethical codes and religious institutions. Communication, including communication through language, can be classified into different modes. That aspect of communication in which comment on behaviour, that is to say, which modifies or makes some definitions of other behaviours, is called “meta-communication” and the aggregate of its forms “meta-systems”. Meta-systems are the carriers of values and as an individual in any culture develops, he learns sets of meta-systems. In this way, the culture passes along its values systems and continuity in the values of the culture is thereby maintained. (Alger, 1970, p. 51).</p> <p>Sociolinguistics is concerned with investigating the relationship between language and the society with the goal being a better understanding of the structure of language and of how language functions in communication. The equivalent goal in the sociology of language is trying to discover how social structures can be better understood through the study of language.</p> <p>As observed generally, the use of proverbs, other folklores and songs are dwindling amongst cultures in our day-to-day interaction and even literary works as observed in the 90s. Research works on sociolinguistics will help bring back the cultural values of story- telling, parables, riddles, folklore and so on.</p> <p>1.2 AIMS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>       This research work aims at anaslyzing the power of the language of proverbs and their values on the traditions, beliefs and norms in any given society. It will, through the analysis of language as it affects the society, look into how Adimora- Ezeigbo has used proverbs in her novel, <em>Trafficked</em> to achieve some foregrounded effects on the characters therein.</p> <p>Proverbs analyzed in this research work will indicate the various functions they perform or/and used for. It will also expose the readers of this work to the various classifications of proverbs there are and their ability to transfer African cultural values and heritage.</p> <p>1.3 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>      Across centuries, researchers have studied the relationship that exists between language and the society. Since no speech community can exist without ‘a code’ of communication, a Sociolinguistic analysis will remain a significant area of study. Various aspects have been researched upon. These areas include daily extinction of languages, the effect of social variables such as age, sex, status, role- relation and so on, on language use among users. Various theories have been developed to give the study of Sociolinguistics a sound back-up. Among the famous exponents of Sociolinguistics are Dell Hymes, J.K. Chambers, Sapir-Whorf, Basil Bernstein, etc.</p> <p>This research work looks into the analysis of proverbs under Sociolinguistics and brings out the moral and social values. It will contribute to humanity and other research studies with the numerous functions proverbs perform.</p> <p>1.4 SCOPE AND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>       The research embarked upon in this project will look into the interaction that exists between the society and how it affects language use. It will only analyze the Sociolinguistic levels of language with a view of identifying only some theories that have emanated from the studies those scholars had undertaken.</p> <p>The research will analyze the twenty- five proverbs in Adimora- Ezeigbo’s <em>Trafficked</em> using Dell Hymes’ Ethnography of speaking model.</p> <p>1.5 METHODOLOGY</p> <p>In carrying out a Sociolinguistic analysis of proverbs, the data that will be used will be collected from Adimora-Ezeigbo’s <em>Trafficked</em> using the Ethnography model of Dell Hyme. The twenty- five proverbs will be picked out and worked with the ‘SPEAKING’ acronym. Elements and variables such as code-mixing and switching, taboo, euphemisms and so on will also be considered in the analysis.</p> <p> 1.6 DATA DESCRIPTION</p> <p>The data analyzed are collated and collected from Adimora- Ezeigbo’s <em>Trafficked, publisged in 2008. </em>The novel discusses the adventure of Nneoma who goes in search of greener pastures but who is tricked and trafficked (the title is deduced from this) in Italy and London. She is deported back home after six years but cannot return home due to shame. The novel discusses the hardship in the family and the society and its consequences.</p> <p>1.7 THE AUTHOR: ADIMORA-EZEIGBO</p> <p>The author, Adimora- Ezeigbo was born and raised in Eastern Nigeria, but now lives in Lagos. Raised partially in a rural environment and partially in the city, she combines these two factors as background and setting for her children’s stories and adult fictions. A lecturer, writer, novelist, critic, essayist, journalist and administrator; she was appointed a professor of English at the university of Lagos in 1999. She is married to Professor Chris Ezeigbo and is blessed with three children.</p>\n\nA SOCIOLINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF PROVERBS IN ADIMORA- EZEIGBO’ S TRAFFICKED<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SOCIOLINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF PROVERBS IN ADIMORA- EZEIGBO’ S TRAFFICKED", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A SOCIOLINGUISTIC STUDY OF CODE-MIXING AND CODE-SWITCHING IN NIGERIAN INSTITUTIONS</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>For communication to be effective in any human society, the appropriate language must be put in to use in the appropriate context. This work examined the motivation for code-mixing and code-switching among undergraduates. The natural conversations of some undergraduates of the University of Ilorin were recorded, and analysed and it was found that code-switching is a display of bilinguals’ competence while code-mixing is a sign of vocabulary inadequacy in first language (L1). It is noteworthy however, that both code-mixing and code-switching were not only found among the Yoruba undergraduates on our campus but are equally prevalent among Hausa and Igbo undergraduates in their bid to communicate effectively with one another. Our conclusion is that bilingualism/multilingualism has taken its toll on these students who are confronted with two or more languages on their learning environment.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>1.1       Aims and objectives</p> <p>1.2       Justification</p> <p>1.3       Significance of the study</p> <p>1.4       Scope and Delimitation</p> <p>1.5       Methodology</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>2.1       Sociolinguistics</p> <p>2.2       Scope of sociolinguistics</p> <p>2.3       Concepts of sociolinguistics</p> <p>2.3.1    Speech community</p> <p>2.3.2    Language contact</p> <p>2.3.3    Multilingualism/Bilingualism</p> <p>2.3.3.1 Types of Multilingualism/Bilingualism</p> <p>2.3.4    Effects of Bilingualism/Multilingualism</p> <p>2.3.4.1 Diglossia</p> <p>2.3.4.2 Code-switching</p> <p>2.3.4.3 Code-mixing</p> <p>2.3.4.4 Differences between code-mixing and code-switching</p> <p>2.3.4.5 Reasons for code-mixing</p> <p>2.3.4.6 Categorization of code-mixing</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>DATA ANALYSIS</p> <p>3.0       Introduction</p> <p>3.1       Data presentation and analysis</p> <p>3.2       Conclusion</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR               </p> <p>SUMMARY, FINDINGS, RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION</p> <p>4.0       Introduction</p> <p>4.1       Summary</p> <p>4.2       Findings</p> <p>4.3       Recommendation</p> <p>4.4       Conclusion</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0       INTRODUCTION</p> <p>One aspect of language study that attracts much attention today is sociolinguistics. It examines the use of language by considering social parameter. This field is relatively wide and it encompasses a lot of variables like the context of the situation, age, status etc. among other variables that can be found in sociolinguistics are code mixing, diglossia, Code-switching, language death etc.</p> <p>Code-mixing and code-switching are important aspect of sociolinguistic given their use and status in the society. Different reasons have been advanced by various writers and scholars as to why people code-mix and code-switch. Whatever the reasons, they are to some extent reasonable. However, it obvious that they have both the negative and positive effects closely associated with them. It there becomes necessary that these concepts which are directly related to human society and our educational system be given adequate attention so that they are known and also used effectively where necessarily.</p> <p>In a society where individuals speak more than one language there is usually a language that is naturally influenced by the others. Some of the effects of multilingualism are code-mixing and code-switching, bilingualism, diglossia etc when a speaker comes in contact with two or more languages he or she may start to use the languages together even though it might not be with equal proficiency. However these languages affect one another and often lead to code-mixing and code-switching.</p> <p>Code-mixing and code-switching occurs when elements of two or more languages are mixed between sentences, clauses and phrases. These concepts are products of bilingualism and they are the focus of this research work. Some researches have shown that students code-mix and code-switch in order to be admitted into some social situations.</p> <p>It is on this note that this research work intends to find out if undergraduates of University of Ilorin code-mix and code-switch, and also intend to find out why if they code-mix and code-switch. Thus in carrying out this research work, code-mixing and code-switching as concepts of sociolinguistics will be given attention thereby bringing it to the notice of the people who are not linguistics.</p> <p>1.1       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>This research work intends to conduct a sociolinguistic study on code-mixing and code-switching and to also carry out a practical study of how these concepts occur in the conversation of Nigerian undergraduates especially students of University of Ilorin. In this project, we will attempt to determine the motivation or causes underlying the use of code-mixing and code-switching</p> <p>Moreover, this research work will examine the effects of code-mixing and code-switching on the Nigerian language and why students of the university of Ilorin code-mix and code-switch English with their various indigenous languages.</p> <p>1.2       JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>At the end of this work, it is expected that the long essay will come up with findings that will discourage the use of code-mixing and code-switching if their use suggest negative effect on the proficiency of the users. On the other hand, if the proficiency of the bilingual is not affected the phenomenon will be encouraged.</p> <p>It is strongly believed that the findings at the need of this research will benefit bilinguals and it is also expected to contribute additional knowledge to the field of sociolinguistics. It will also be of immense benefit to students of English and linguistics.</p> <p>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The essence of this research is to identify the likely social effects on the undergraduates of the University of Ilorin if they are users of code-mixing and code-switching. The research will also investigate the extent to which the undergraduates code-mix and code-switch if at all they do.</p> <p>Again the research sets out to identify factors responsible for code-mixing and code-switching among the undergraduates of University of Ilorin if at all they code-mix and code-switch. The purpose of this research is to answer the following questions:</p> <ol><li>Do the undergraduates of University of Ilorin code-mix and code-switch?</li> <li>Why do they code-mix and code-switch?</li> <li>Does the improper acquisition of language lead to code-mixing and code-switching?</li> <li>Does code-mixing and code-switching connote low proficiency?</li> </ol> <p>1.4       SCOPE AND DELIMITATION</p> <p>This research work is limited to the undergraduates of the University of Ilorin. University of Ilorin is a multilingual institution which comprises students from different linguistics background across the country. Most of the students are bilinguals who can speak at least one indigenous language and also English language.</p> <p>For the purpose of this research work the recording of conversations among the undergraduates of University of Ilorin shall be limited to three faculties within the institution and they are:</p> <ol><li>Faculty of Arts</li> <li>Faculty of Education</li> <li>Faculty of Science</li> </ol> <p>These three faculties are the largest within the University thereby having the largest population. The data to be used in this research work shall be gathered from the undergraduates in their lecture rooms, hostels, library etc. The research will highlight instances of code-mixing and code-switching in their various conversations and analyse them.</p> <p>1.5       METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The method to be used for data collection will be the audio recording of conversations of undergraduates of the University of Ilorin. Twenty conversations shall be recorded for the research.</p> <p>Students would be unaware that their conversations are being recorded because there is the probability that once they are aware their utterance will be ingenuine and unnatural sentences.</p>\n\nA SOCIOLINGUISTIC STUDY OF CODE-MIXING AND CODE-SWITCHING IN NIGERIAN INSTITUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SOCIOLINGUISTIC STUDY OF CODE-MIXING AND CODE-SWITCHING IN NIGERIAN INSTITUTIONS", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF AKACHI ADIMORA-EZEIGBO’S TRAFFICKED</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>            Stylistics is the study of  literary and non-literary texts using linguistic and literary descriptions.  The aim in this research work was a stylistic analysis of Akachi adimora-ezeigbo’s <em>Trafficked</em>. The study critically analysed the data through the use of some levels of stylistic description namely; graphology, morphology, syntax, lexico-semantics and cohesion. The study discovered that at the graphological level, the author used italics, comma and dash. Among these, it was found out that the author used italics for stream of consciousness in order to reveal the real intention of the speaker. At the morphological level, it was noticed that the author only gave the full meaning of ‘OYSCO’,’WON’, etc which she introduced in the novel and takes for granted the full meaning of other acronyms. She also idiosyncratically employed more hyphenated compounding. The marked lexico-syntactic patterns used in the text are basically for emphasis. At the lexico-semantics level, proverbs was used  to introduce the readers to the rich culture of the African society. Also, cohesive devices employed by the author were used to create links within the text. The conclusion to the work was that the employment of stylistic tools in the analysis of literary and non-literary text enhances better understanding of such texts and the authors.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>General Introduction</p> <p>1.1  Introduction to the study</p> <p>1.2  Statement of the problem</p> <p>1.3  Purpose of the study</p> <p>1.4  Scope of the study</p> <p>1.5  Justification of the study</p> <p>1.6  Data description/synopsis of the novel</p> <p>1.7  Biography of the author</p> <p>1.8  Summary</p> <p> CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>Literature review</p> <p>2.1 Introduction</p> <p>2.2 The Concept of style</p> <p>2.3 Stylistics</p> <p>2.4 Levels of stylistic description</p> <p>2.4.1 Graphology</p> <p>2.4.2 Morphology</p> <p>2.4.3 Syntax</p> <p>2.4.4 Lexico-semantics</p> <p>2.5  Cohesion</p> <p>2.6  Summary</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p> Stylistic elements in Akachi adimora-ezeigbo’s <em>Trafficked</em></p> <p>3.1       Introduction</p> <p>3.2       Graphology</p> <p>3.2.1    Italics</p> <p>3.2.2    Comma</p> <p>3.2.3    Dash</p> <p>3.2.4    Capitalization</p> <p>3.3      Morphology</p> <p>3.3.1   Compounding</p> <p>3.3.2    Acronymy</p> <p>3.4       Lexis and syntax</p> <p>3.4.1    Parenthesis</p> <p>3.4.2    Anaphora</p> <p>33.4.3   Polyptoton</p> <p>3.5   Lexico-semantics</p> <p>3.5.1     Proverbs</p> <p>3.5.2     Simile</p> <p>3.5.3      Deviant words</p> <p>3.6   Cohesion</p> <p>3.7   Findings</p> <p>3.8   Summary</p> <p> CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>Introduction, Summary, Recommendation and Conclusion</p> <p>4.1  Introduction</p> <p>4.2  Summary</p> <p>4.3  Recommendation</p> <p>4.4  Conclusion</p> <p>References</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1       INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Stylistics, a branch of linguistics which developed from the ancient Greek rhetoric through the Swiss linguist, Charles Bally during the 20th century, is an aspect of language study that has attracted a great deal of attention from scholars. Young as this discipline is, it is open to so many fields of study most especially to related disciplines such as theory of literature, poetics and aesthetics, among others.</p> <p>However, over the years, there have been various arguments among scholars about the application of linguistics to the analysis and interpretation of literary texts. This is because, “they operate at different levels that are hardly reconcilable”. Literary criticism on the one hand operates on terms of value, purpose and aesthetics while linguistic analysis focuses on phonetics, stress, syntax, and lexico-semantics (Kolawole, 2003, p.1)</p> <p>In the words of Short (1996, p.1), stylistics is “an approach to the analysis of ‘literary texts using linguistic description”. Stylistics, from his submission deals with how literary and non-literary texts are analyzed through linguistic tools. As observed by Short, stylistics is both relevant in studying literary and non-literary texts. One of the prominent areas in literature in which stylistic theory could be of great benefit is in the study of a novel. This is so because the language employed by an author in a novel should help in contributing to the overall development of the text.</p> <p><em>Trafficked, </em>by Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo is a literary text that was written in 2008. The novel in 2009 received Honourable mention as Runner-up for the ANA/NDDC Flora Nwapa  prize for women and also that same year, Chris Anyoku wrote an article which he titled “Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo’s <em>Trafficked: </em>Re- defining the ‘New’ Nigeria Novel.</p> <p>Therefore, this research attempts to analyse <em>Trafficked </em>using stylistics as the theoretical basis. The stylistic tools that will be used as mode of analysis include Graphology, Morphology, Syntax, Lexico-semantics and Cohesion.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>            This study “A stylistic analysis of Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo’s <em>Trafficked” </em>attempts to analyse the text using some stylistic tools. The problem this study hope to provide answers to is how these stylistic tools are used in the novel. By so doing, this study will show whether Adimora-Ezeigbo’s work is simply an exhibition of stylistic effects or these stylistic tools contribute to the overall development of the text.</p> <p> 1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The aim of the work titled “A stylistic analysis of<em> Trafficked</em>” is to examine how the author has used the linguistic and literary stylistic tools to convey meaning in her literary text. This research is not only to critically assess the stylistic tools that are employed by Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo in the text, but also to examine how the tools have in one way or the other contributed to its receiving honourable mention as runner up for the ANA/NDDC Flora Nwapa prize for women writing in 2009.</p> <p>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>In this work, our focus shall include some of the stylistic elements found in the data. Graphological, Morphological, Syntactical and Lexico-semantic devices will be examined. Also, we shall examine all the cohesive devices found in the data.</p> <p>1.5       JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            This study, which is titled “A stylistic analysis of <em>Trafficked</em>” is being embarked upon because no study of this kind, to the best of our knowledge, has focused specifically on, or has been carried out on Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo’s <em>Trafficked </em>because it happens to be the latest work of the author.</p> <p>This work will therefore, be of great importance to up-coming researchers who will like to study the novel or explore the field of stylistics. Also, it will be of great benefit to studies in language and literature in general.</p> <p>1.6       DATA DESCRIPTION/SYNPOSIS OF THE NOVEL</p> <p>            <em>Trafficked,</em> is a novel written by Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo in 2008. The book dramatizes the story of a young lady, Nneoma, who is order not to marry Ofomata, her supposed fiancé flees from home and goes to Lagos in company of a friend. She is later, alongside five other ladies trafficked to Europe for prostitution under the pretense of working as a teacher.</p> <p>After six years, she is deported to Nigeria along with some other trafficked young ladies. The deportees are taken to a rehabilitation centre, which is a non-governmental organization. Through the assistance of this NGO, Oasis Youth Centre for skills development (OYCSD), Nneoma is able to start her life all over again.</p> <p>1.7       BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR</p> <p>Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo was born and raised in Eastern Nigeria to the family of Mr. and Mrs. Joshua Adimora. She was raised partially in a rural environment and partially in the city. She therefore, combines these two factors as background and setting for her literary texts.</p> <p>She studied English and literary studies at the University of Lagos and the university of Ibadan, where she obtained Bachelor of Arts (B.A), Masters of Arts (M.A) and PhD degrees. She also has a postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) from the University of Lagos.</p> <p>Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo has received many literary and academic awards for her works among which is the NLNG prize for children’s literature which she won in 2007. Apart from publishing over forty-five academic papers in local and international journals, she has also published thirteen books for children out of which two have been translated into Swahili and Xhosa.</p> <p>She is married to Professor Chris Ezeigbo and they are blessed with three children.</p> <p>1.8       SUMMARY</p> <p>            This chapter has given an introduction, the statement of the problem, the purpose of the study, the scope of the study justification, research methodology, data description and the biography of the author.

Advertising is a form of communication used to help sell products and services. Adverts are not just to fascinate, but rather, they are used by advertisers to achieve their persuasive goals. This study reveals the manner in which language is used in Bank advertisements for conveying messages to the public and the effectiveness of the choice of language. The stylistic elements employed in the analysis of Bank adverts included Graphology, phonology, lexis and syntax and cohesion.</p> <p>Among the findings were: the use of capitalization for emphasis, repetition of words, phonemes etc. To give musical colour and Gothic writing to attract the attention of the readers. The conclusion to the work is that the use of stylistic devices is relevant because they help to attract customers to the service and products being advertised.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE                                                                                                     </p> <p>General Introduction</p> <p>Introduction 1</p> <p>1.2       English Language in Nigeria</p> <p>1.3       The Language of Advertising</p> <p>1.4       Purpose of the Study</p> <p>1.5       Scope of the study</p> <p>1.6       Justification of the Study</p> <p>1.7       Research Methodology</p> <p> CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>2.1       The Origin and Development of Stylistics</p> <p>2.2       Style and Stylistics</p> <p>2.3       The Goals of Stylistics</p> <p>2.4       Levels of Stylistic Analysis</p> <p>2.4.1    Graphology</p> <p>2.4.2    Phonology</p> <p>2.4.3    Lexis</p> <p>2.4.4    Syntax</p> <p>2.4.5    Lexico Semantics</p> <p>2.5       Reference</p> <p>2.5.1    Cohesion</p> <p>2.5.2    Foregrounding</p> <p>2.6       Conclusion</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>Data Analysis                                                                                                        </p> <p>3.1       Introduction</p> <p>3.2       Graphology</p> <p>3.2.1    Capitalization</p> <p>3.2.2    Gothic Writing</p> <p>3.2.3    Exclamation mark</p> <p>3.2.4    Orthographic Modification</p> <p>3.3       Phonology</p> <p>3.3.1    Alliteration</p> <p>3.3.2    Assonance</p> <p>3.3.3    Consonance</p> <p>3.3.4    Phonaesthesia</p> <p>3.4       Lexis and Syntax</p> <p>3.4.1    Simile</p> <p>3.4.2    Metaphor</p> <p>3.4.3    Anaphora</p> <p>3.4.4    Epiphora</p> <p>3.5       Cohesion</p> <p>3.5.1    Reference</p> <p>3.5.2    Substitution</p> <p>3.5.3    Conjunction</p> <p>3.5.4    Ellipsis</p> <p>3.5.5    Verbs</p> <p>3.5.6    Adjectives</p> <p>3.6       Findings</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR                           </p> <p> Summary, Recommendations and Conclusion                                             </p> <p>4.1       Introduction</p> <p>4.2       Summary</p> <p>4.3       Recommendations</p> <p>4.4       Conclusion</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>  CHAPTER ONE</p> <p> General Introduction</p> <p>1.1       Introduction</p> <p>Over the years, the study of language in use has always been an attractive field of study to linguists in the aspect of its origin, nature and its functions, whether for persuasion, poetry, or prayer.</p> <p>Language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols used for human communication (Wardhaugh, 1972:3).</p> <p>In the world today, people still continue to research into what language is and its functions. Hence, linguists are in agreement about some of the characteristics of human language, its definition and functions.</p> <p>The use of language has also become deeply entrenched in human culture and apart from being used to communicate and share information; it also has social uses such as social stratification, social grooming, entertainment and persuasion.</p> <p>In this research, our focus will be on “the Stylistic Analysis of Bank Advertisements in Selected Nigerian Newspapers”.</p> <p>1.2       English Language in Nigeria</p> <p>The English language originates from England. It later spread across the borders of Great Britain and even beyond the continent of Europe to America, Australia, Asia and Africa. It has become so widespread that it is often considered the world language.</p> <p>The advent of English in Africa cannot be separated from the incursions of trade, missionary and colonial activities. Though, the primary purpose of the missionaries was not to make Christian converts speak English, nevertheless, it was to make the populace literate enough to read the bible in their own languages. Some indigenes were able to learn and use the language after which they became catechists and teachers in the mission schools. The British later colonised Nigeria and of course used their language – English – for administration. It also became more prominent in the educational system and was used for official purposes. It became an elitist symbol used by a few privileged Nigerians who serve as models for some indigenes who sought after education.</p> <p>The use of English in Nigeria survived the departure of the colonial administrators as the language of governance. Now, after independence, English still survives and assumes a more prominent status in Nigeria. Bamgbose (1971) says it is a medium of social and inter-ethnic communication. It is a national language and it is used as a medium of instructions in schools: primary, secondary and tertiary. He also says that a variant of English tagged Nigerian English has become an inevitable language in the country which has become an invaluable legacy which Britain has bequeathed to Nigeria.</p> <p>In this vein, the adventure of English language from one culture to another brings about various varieties. The variety of English that performs these functions in Nigeria is not the same as the native speakers’ varieties spoken in Britain or America. For instance, Nigerian pidgin English which has developed much earlier between English traders and Nigerian resident in the coastal areas to cater for the urgent needs of the two linguistic groups for transactional communication became extensively patronised in different versions (Bamgbose, 1995).</p> <p>Jowitt (1991:191) also opines that the English which is used in the Nigerian environment is something other than a replica of native speakers’ varieties. The evolution of local varieties of English is an illustration of the adaptation of an overseas variety of English to meet the requirements of a second language context. In its use as a medium of both formal and informal communication (Wigwe, 1981).</p> <p>English language has become therefore an important second language in Nigeria and the rate at which it is accorded importance cannot be over-emphasised. It is an official language, being used to conduct legislative, executive and judicial functions, the principal medium of instruction in Nigeria schools and also the language of journalism.</p> <p>1.3       The Language of Advertising</p> <p>Language has a very powerful influence on people and their behaviour. This is especially true in the field of advertising. Advertising is a powerful communication force and a vital marketing tool that helps to sell goods and services, images and ideas. Therefore the choice of language to convey specific messages or ideas with the intention of influencing people is very important. Brown and Yule identify two functions of language; the transactional and interactional which is used to convey factual or preparational information. Hence, language plays an important role in advertising because a breakdown in communication can occur if the speaker and the hearer are not on the same “wave length”.</p> <p>Visual content and design in advertising have a very great impact on the consumer, but it is language that helps people to identify a product and remember it.</p> <p>Leech (1966: 25) says that the structure of language in advertising has a peculiar form and many factors predispose the copywriter (i.e. one who writes advertisements) to chose his vocabulary. Hence, the copywriter puts into consideration language variation as regards the target audience and also ensures that his choice of language and content meets the four basic characteristics outlined by Leech (1966: 25) which are necessary for successful advertising. These are:</p> <ol><li>Attention value: This refers to the unorthodox use of language to provoke the consumer’s attention and curiosity by presenting something surprising and unexpected.</li> <li>Readability: The advertisement must be easy to grasp and assimilate.</li> <li>Memorability: An advertisement gains nothing unless the name of the product is remembered. In fact, it is desirable that part of the stylistic message should memorised. This includes brand names, slogans, key phrases, snatches of songs, etc.</li> <li>Selling power: One of the most striking features of the language of advertising is an extreme infrequency of imperative clauses aimed at attracting potential buyers to goods and services being advertised.</li> </ol> <p>The language of advertising must be informative, instructive, distinctive, alluring and persuasive (Okpaleke 1992:21). This has been so since the time of oral hawking. Advertisements are to conceive and disseminate information about the product on sale to people in a competitive market.</p> <p>The language of advertising is also brief and concise. There is no room for unnecessary verbosity because advertisements are expensive and it is a field where the coat has to cut according to the cloth (Okpaleke, 1992).</p> <p>In addition, the language of advertising entails the use of rhythm. Advertisers use rhythm in order to make an advertisement pleasing to the ears of the customers. David (1987:390) also states that “language of advertisement is generally laudatory, positive and unreserved emphasising the uniqueness of a product.” The use of language in advertising could be subjective and objective. The subjective factor is that the writer’s linguistic competence determines his vocabulary usage, style and creative ability to conform with the stylistic tendencies peculiar to the agency and his consciousness of the advertisers objectives successfully in good write-ups would portray the language use as being objective.</p> <p>1.4       Purpose of the Study</p> <p>This project is a Stylistic Analysis of Bank Advertisements in Nigerian Newspapers. The aim of this work will therefore involve the manner in which language is used in Bank advertisement for conveying messages to the public, the effectiveness of the choice of language and the meaning of bank advertisements using stylistic elements.</p> <p>1.5       Scope of the Study</p> <p>In carrying out this research, the data which shall be used for analysis shall be limited to fourteen bank advertisements. These bank advertisements shall be from The Guardian, and This Day Newspapers.</p> <p> 1.6       Justification of the Study</p> <p>The researcher is aware that several works have been carried out on advertisement generally over the years. However, no particular attention has been paid to a stylistic analysis of bank advertisements in Nigerian newspaper.</p> <p>Therefore, this study shall investigate the area with the hope that it will be beneficial to writers of advertisements in their choice of words, those who might be conducting future research on a related topic and to the students of stylistics.</p> <p>           Research Methodology</p> <p>This work is basically a Stylistic Analysis of Bank advertisements. Therefore, the use of stylistic variables selected from Graphology, phonology, lexis, syntax, and cohesion will be employed in analysing and interpreting bank advertisements.</p> <p>Fourteen bank advertisements will be data for the stylistic analysis.</p>\n\nA STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF BANK ADVERTISEMENTS IN NIGERIAN NEWSPAPERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF BANK ADVERTISEMENTS IN NIGERIAN NEWSPAPERS", "id": 50}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF SELECTED NIYI OSUNDARE’S SOCIO-POLITICAL POETRY</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Language is a vital medium through which human beings express themselves.

Certain scholars have tried to define what language is; Henry Lee Smith, (1969) sees language as: “A shared, learned, arbitrary symbol through which human beings in the same speech community or sub-culture communicates and hence interacts in terms of their common experiences and expectations.”</p> <p>Odebunmi (2001, p.26) opines that “language is the rope that ties members of a speech community together in a continuing relationship”. He goes further to summit that “it is the common instrument that they draw on for socio cultural identification”. From this excerpt, language is portrayed as an inevitable phenomenon and the basis of mutual communication in man’s life. Language is glimpsed as an instrument for social identification and unity in a speech community. It is when they are able to share their thoughts, feelings, and ideas using the same language that they can have understanding which is one of the foundations of unity.</p> <p>Also, Adejumobi (2009, p .9) asserts that “Language is human vocal sound, or it is the graphic representation of signs, symbols, gesticulations and signals for the purpose of communication” In this regard, Man uses language in conveying meanings and tends to display different attributes and most cases different styles. These styles therefore, determine the language habits and language use utilized by certain individuals.</p> <p>This research therefore, intends to study the style used by Niyi Osundare in some of his selected socio political poems.</p> <p>1.1      FUNCTIONS OF LANGUAGE</p> <p>As it is noted in the introductory aspect, language is used by man to express his mind, views, and contributions to the society. Speech acts such as sympathy, admirations excitement, ideas, jokes, reprimands, warnings, feelings, greetings and so on, are carried out through the use of language. Brown and Yule (1983) referred to by Odebunmi (2001, p.27) have described these as transactional and interaction functions of language.</p> <p>Transactional function of language simply refers to the use of language as a medium of communication, in other words, it serves as a medium of information dissemination .For instance, certain traditions, cultures and the likes have been kept into existence through the use of language. In this function, vital information about old tradition has been brought into the new generation in order for them not to go into extinction. Societal issues have also been talked over through the use of this function of language.</p> <p>Odebunmi (2001, p.28) notes that:</p> <p>Right from the home  when the   child is   moving  close to school age,  parents   start giving   academic  Instructions    to him or her literate  parents   especially,   use   English  to   order    the   child   around and to request some responses  which are   either supplied  verbally or through child’s reaction or obedient   to the Instruction  given, thus the child is  being   prepared in  the    school    situation where instructions are provided in the classroom through language.</p> <p>Transactional function of language is portrayed as a kind of mutual interaction that serves as a background for effective communication.</p> <p>On the other hand, when language is used for the purpose of establishing, boosting and sustaining relationships that exist among members of a speech community, the language function is referred to as interactional. This can also be referred to as the secondary functions of language.</p> <p>1.2      English Language in Nigeria</p> <p>Nigerians had contact with English language as far back as 1553. Through colonization, the colonial masters attacked Lagos in 1861, they entrenched Ilorin in 1920 and though the northern part were very strong, they were later captured in 1900 and by 1914, the amalgamation of Nigeria took place .Ever since then , through colonialization, constitution , commerce, christianity and trans-atlantic slave trade, English  language was robbed into the language system of Nigeria and has captured a very pertinent role in the intra and international communicative system of Nigeria.</p> <p>According to Tomori (1981) cited in Babatunde (2001, p.105-108) “It (English Language) has been with us for about one hundred and thirty years. Hence it has become our second language.” English Language at present serves virtually all the functions of language in Nigeria. It serves as the language of intra and inter ethnic communication, language of education, commerce, entertainment, science and technology, international relations, literature .Just to mention a few. At present in Nigeria, if not objected by some illiterate, English is indeed a blessing in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.3   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research is basically on stylistics, to engage stylistics as a branch of linguistics and to study and analyze the characteristics of situational distinctive use of language with referent to Niyi Osundare‘s selected socio political poems, also to show the functional significance and the interpretation of the poems.</p> <p>1.4      JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>In an attempt to study stylistics and use it as a linguistic tool of analysis, many writers have embarked no stylistics .Example is “A stylistic analysis of Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu’s coup speech 1996” by Moses Alo and Igbwebuka Ebuka ; rhetorical  concise, Syntactic features, Declarative mood and acts Referring expressions and lexico-semantic features were all used in analyzing the coup speech. In this research, the importance of writers cannot be over-emphasized because through their literary piece, many socio-political ills in our society have been discussed and possible solutions have been proffered to them. In view of these, there exists a great need to examine the use of language by these writers whose literary works have done a lot in shaping our society.</p> <p>Selected poems of Niyi Osundare’s as one of the prominent writer whose socio-political poems have gone a long way in addressing societal ills will be subjected to analysis in order to show the style and the aesthetic use of language Osundare has used in his socio-political poems.</p> <p>1.5      SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The scope of the study shall be limited to stylistics  analysis using the features of cohesion , graphology, phonology, pragmatics and lexico-semantics in analyzing Niyi Osundare’s selected socio political poems which are: The Politician’s two mouths, A Villager’s Protest, Eating with all fingers, Eating Tomorrow’s Yam In  “village Voices”. Forest Echoes and They too are the Earth in “the Eyes of the Earth.’</p> <p> 1.6     THE BIOGRAPHY OF THE POET (NIYI OSUNDARE)</p> <p>Niyi Osundare was born in 1947 in Ikere Ekiti, Ekiti State. Nigeria. He is a prolific poet, dramatist and literary critic. He gained his degree at the University of Ibadan (B.A), his masters degree in the university of Leeds and his PhD in York university, Canada in 1997. Niyi Osundare has always been a vehement champion of right to freedom of speech and he has a strong believe in the power of words saying “to alter is to utter”. Osundare is renowned for his commitment to socially relevant art and artistic activism .He has written several letters to former president of Nigeria (Olusegun Obasanjo) whom Osundare had often publicly criticized. He believes that there is no choice for Africa poets but to be political. He is a holder of numerous awards for his poetry as well as the Falcons Nichol award for excellence in poetry, creativity combined with significant contributions of human right in Africa.</p> <p>So far, Niyi Osundare has been a very successful playwright, columnist, literary critics and Emergent writer whose pieces are socio-politically inclined.</p> <p>Biography from WIKIPEDIA.</p> <p>1.7      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>We shall attempt a brief review of existing materials or body of knowledge in our chosen theory, it various definitions by scholars and the corresponding stylistics element shall be expounded in the next chapter.</p> <p>In the chapter that follows, there shall be the analysis of the data i.e. the application of the theory on the data. The data are: selected socio political poems in “Village Voices” and The Eyes of the Earth.

People see fictional works as being fictitious, but they are over laid with fact. This long essay, using Akachi Adimora. Ezeigbo’s works as guide, demonstrated the impact of the intermeddling of fact with fiction in literary works. They do not always obstruct each other and when harnessed depending on the ingenuity of the artist they can serve multiple purposes. The sociological socialist realism theory is used in this research work because real and factual events in Ezeigbo’s life are contained in her works. Ezeigbo make use of the Igbo setting. There are names proverbs, idioms and practices that epitomize the Igbo culture and Igbo world view. Her works are linked between her fiction and her lived experience. The major source of her stories is her own direct experience through fiction. Oral Aesthetics is highly portrayed in Ezeigbo’s works in her constant use of songs, proverbs, lullabies and the Igbo cultural setting. This study has shown that Akachi Adimora Ezeigbo, a fictional writer wrote about her own personal experiences in her novels and short stories.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p>1.0       <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.1       Introduction                                                                                                  </p> <p>1 .2      Definition of Terms                                                                                     </p> <p>1.3       The Last of the Strong Ones : A Synopsis                                                </p> <p>1.4       The Relationship Between Facts and Fiction                                          </p> <p>1.5       Research Problem                                                                                        </p> <p>1.6       Methodology                                                                                                 </p> <p>1.7       Scope of Study and Limitation                                                                  </p> <p>1.8       Justification                                                                                                  </p> <p>1.9       Purpose of Study                                                                                          </p> <p>1.10    Structure of Thesis                                                                                       </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.0       Literature Review                                                                                        </p> <p>2.1       Issues Relating to Akachi Adimora — Ezeigbo’s Writings                   </p> <p>2.2       Aesthetics in Akachi’s Works.                                                                  </p> <p>2.3       Adimora — Ezeigbo’s Formal Aesthetics Borrowings from     the</p> <p>Oral Narrative Tradition.                                                                                        </p> <p>2.4       The Role of the Writer in Literature                                                         </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>3.1 Fact and Fiction in Akachi Adimora —Ezeigbo’s The Last of the</p> <p>Strong Ones and Children of the Eagle                                                                 </p> <p>3.2 The Search for Self                                                                                            </p> <p>3.3 The War’s Untold Story: The Challenging Years of Youth                                    </p> <p>3.4 Marriage and Family Life                                                                                 </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p>4.1 The Aesthetics Residues of Facts and Fiction: An Example of Akachi’s The Last of the Strong Ones and</p> <p>Children of the Eagle .                                                                                             </p> <p>4.2 The Igbo Nuaces in The Last of the Strong Ones and </p> <p>       Children of the Eagle                                                                                        </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.1 Summary of Findings and Conclusion of the Research Work                    </p> <p>5.2 Summary                                                                                                             </p> <p>5.3 Findings                                                                                                              </p> <p>5.4 Conclusion                                                                                                         </p> <p>Bibliography                                                                                                             </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Literature is studied for various reasons. It covers all aspects of human life. It is all-embracing and encapsulating. It contains artistic truth, which is better than historical truth. An artistic truth applies to every situation of life while historical truth appeals to a specific situation of life.</p> <p>A quality of Akachi Ezeigbo which makes her fiction not just reading matter is her ability to knit life experiences into art. There is an effort to make the incidents as realistic as possible not just in context but in form and style. Prominent among her choice of techniques is foreshadowing and the use of the third person omniscient narrator.</p> <p>A writer is a “righter” righting the societal “wrongs”. This is another way of saying that a writer is a watchdog to the society. He comments upon social happenings with the aim of improving them. This argument can be used to nullify the “art-for-art-sake” philosophy of literature. Art - for - art - sake perception opines that literature should be on its own aesthetics and not be mixed up with politics. In reality, literature cannot really be separated from human experience from the political, social, religious and cultural realm.</p> <p>Literature is essentially a creative art. Hence, originality and creativity are the key words. Most of the ideas in 1 are either totally imagined (fiction) or partially imagined. Partial imagination is interplay of fact and art known as faction.</p> <p>The generally accepted notion is that literature mirrors the society. But literature, as can be deduced from the present ideological trends does not stop at mirroring the society. It does more than mirror the society. It does not just give us the picture of our lives alone but goes further to suggest ways of improving ourselves. Literature is th private and public awareness given to both the individual and the society respectively through the exposure of the hidden or open truths that people seem to be ignorant of. Literature aims at affecting a change in the societal status quo.</p> <p>Omotayo Oloruntoba -Oju (1999) cited in Ibrahim B.F. &amp; Akande F.F, States that;</p> <p>The term. literature may be used to refer to any material in written form or any other material whose features lend them to literary appreciation or appraisal... the term in a specialized sense refers to works of art in any of the established literary genres, prose, poetry and drama..</p> <p>One would have expected Oloruntoba - Oju to have recognized the un-established and un-written genre (material as well in her definition of literature in order to make such a definition comprehensive enough. According to Terry Eagleton (1983) Cited in Akande and Ibrahim (1997),</p> <p>Literature is a liberating force, freeing us from the inherent shackles placed upon us by the society. Literary criticism is therefore born out of it struggle against a loss of culture and its feature becomes defined as struggle against the foreseen bourgeois stat and it’s has no predetermined future.</p> <p>All definitions of literature hang on essentially what literature looks like, what it aims at doing or what it is for or why it is the way it is or what it should be used for. Literature as a discipline is a spoken or written medium which uses languages, plot, character and setting to give us a picture of what our life looks like.</p> <p>Literature draws its strength from actual life. It deals with human life with all its complexities and difficulties. Literature deals with the Joys, Sorrows, Poverty, Plenty and above all death to which man is subjected and which is man’s enemy.</p> <p>The Literature of a particular community can be defined as the sum total of all works of imagination either in oral or written form, in prose or in verse .which have helped to reflect and project the life and culture of that community in the three important areas of narrative fiction, drama and poetry. Literature, like all other art forms draws on human experience and tries to reflect the same and communicate it back to man in an ordered or artistic form. This is because the human condition is the reality known to most men and women and it is this reality that literary artists depend on for their writings.</p> <p>Literature may deal with particular and contemporary events and issues or with attitudes and behavior in contemporary and particular situations. For example, Achebe’s A Man of the People (1966) deals with politics and politicians in the early years of Nigerian independence. A very remarkable way of showing the despicable, ruthless and selfish politician of the period is found in the portraiture of Chief Nanga. Also in Nigeria, the events of the civil war of 1967 — 1970 are made memorable in for example:</p> <p>Akachi-Adimora’s The Last of the Strong Ones (1996) and Children of the Eagle (2002). These writing are varied accounts of the Nigerian civil war, a contemporary event and through them unborn generations will be aware, even if not of the full factual details of the war of at least the basic perceptions of the war.</p> <p>Literature enlarges ones experience. Some texts will lend themselves to easy understanding simply because of the reader’s actual experience. Hence, all definitions of literature boil down to and emphasize its nature, form and utility. These days, unlike in the past when the literature of a people is said to be the unwritten records of those set of people, the word literature is used to refer to a collection of historical, geographical and academic records such as personal essays, speeches, biographies and letters.</p> <p>Nigerian writers generally appear to be more interested in recreating in the reader’s mind, a whole traditional way of life, bringing out varying degrees a man’s realities, by making use of frequent allusions to their people’s customs ‘and tradition. They bring on record communal activities such as festivals, ceremonies, ritual practices, beliefs, occupations and the co-existing nature typical of all Africans.</p> <p>Hence, these writers have their foundations in the cultural heritage of their respective ethnic groups. Ernest Emenyonu (1972) rightly puts it thus:</p> <p>In a multi-ethnic nation like Nigeria, it is imperative that the culture and life-ways of the component units should be given full airing so that national sentiments could be built upon the foundation of understanding.</p> <p>In the same vein, Emmanuel Obiechina (1975) reasserts that “it is only by incorporating Nigerian tradition in our writings that make them Nigerian”.</p> <p>Finally, literature is a portrait of man and his environment held up for him to see by the artist, so that he can have profound reflections about his world view and general existence. Critics of literature must understand it’s interdisciplinary nature for an intensive and extensive comprehension. Literature should contain ideology and also reflect the human mind. This is the meeting point between creativity and criticism.</p> <p><strong>1.2 DEFINITION OF TERMS:</strong></p> <p><strong>a) FACTS.</strong></p> <p>Facts can be defined as concrete reality or actual reality or actual presentation of events that have historical record. The reality could be social, economics or politics. The rise of facts in the novel was necessitated when there came the need for the actual documentation of events that occurred in the life of the people in a society or the society itself. Example are autobiographies, Biographies, documentary. All these give the actual events as they occurred and are recorded down through an element of creative imagination.</p> <p>A writer like Adimora-Ezeigbo has shown in her trilogy an attempt to understand her society and relate with it in the context of a global historiography that shaped the works of pioneer writers and which as has been stated, is still unfolding. In simple terms then, the span of Nigerian literary history is still too short to evaluate the performance of writers on the basis of ‘generation’. The task of periodizing, and indeed, of writing a comprehensive and reliable account of Nigerian literature is rightly that of a future generation of critics for whom compilations of the nature attempted here would function as data. Facts are real issues discussed in Akachi Adimora Ezeigbo’s works like: feminism/gender issues, The Orature of the Igbo’s and the Aesthetics of facts and fiction. Akachi Adimora. — Ezeigbo in her The Last of the Strong Ones (1996) emphasized on the issue of feminism. In The Last of the Strong Ones(1996) Adimora — Ezeigbo continues what Chinua Achebe had begun more than forty years (40) before with his novel Things Fall Apart (1958). He wanted to show;</p> <p>That African people did not hear of culture for the first time from Europeans; ... their societies were not mindless but frequently had a philosophy of great depth and value and beauty. They had poetry and; above all, they had dignity .... The worst thing that can happen to any people is the loss of their dignity and self-respect. The writer’s duty is to help them regain it by showing them in human terms what happened to them, what</p> <p>they lost. There is a saying in Igbo that a man who can’t tell where the rain began to beat him cannot know where he dried his body. The writer can tell the people where the rain began to beat them.</p> <p>Achebe’s literary portrait of the history and culture of the Igbo was limited to the extent that he marginalized women and neglected their voice. While Achebe thematizes the curse of colonialism with a view to men alone, and without a deeper examination of gender relations, Adimora — Ezeigbo is interested not only in colonialism, but also in gender relations on the eve of colonization. Unlike in Things fall Apart (1958), existing gender relations are not merely portrayed, but institutions such as polygamy and violence against women are put in a critical light. This double — tracked thematic orientation of the novel is also manifested in the narrator, who is commissioned by the inhabitants of the village “to preserve our tradition and guide our people back to our way of life before ‘Kosiri’ infested us with their presence” (p.82). In very concrete terms, she has the task of recording the life stories of the four Oluada, the “top women representatives” of .Umuga, who are also the main figures in the Umuada, the association of the daughters of Umuga. Later she is appointed chronicler of the colonial destruction of Umuga. The first person narrator lives up .to both tasks in the novels. By using the medium of literature for remembrance, she puts herself in the oral narrative tradition, to which the first-person narrator herself refers when she names “the family historian, the storyteller and the custodian of tradition” in one breath (p.83). This goes along with the fact that the narrator tells the story in an oral narrative style. Ezeigbo manages to imitate conventions of spoken language, so that when reading one has the impression that one is hearing the novel rather than reading it.</p> <p><strong>b) FICTION</strong></p> <p>Fiction is an abiding social beauty, the expression of human activities in written words; the expression and the impression of the people who have created it; it is the production of what purports to be an authentic account of the actual experience of individuals. </p> <p>The novel reflects actual human experience narrated in a straight forward manner. While reading any novel, the reader might feel that he is reading about his own character or about his neighbors. This kind of reading is purely for enjoyment, leisure and probably to while away time, Besides, since prose is a narrative form, it becomes more accessible to the reader than other genres of literature especially in the African setting where the culture involves storytelling techniques.</p> <p>Here, the literary artist is able to use very effectively, l for communicative purposes through imagination and creativity. And basically, the novel can be classified into fiction and non — fiction. Fiction in opposition to non — fiction is the prose from which the element are based on mere creative imagination of the artist rather than the real life situations presented by the non — fictional writers who are the novelists.</p> <p>1.3 THE LAST OF THE STRONG ONES (1996) A SYNOPSIS</p> <p>The novel is an imaginative reconstruction of the history of Uga, a town in South Eastern Nigeria. Woven around the lives of four influential women who flourish alongside their male counterparts in the leadership of their town, the story relates the struggle of a people to free their community from the clutches of meddlesome British colonialists, chronicling their experience as they resist a disruptive order that threatens their tradition and their humanity. Amidst the dramatic build up to an inevitable collision between tradition and change, the author embarks on a journey of role re- evaluation and redefinition of womanhood within the context of the Igbo culture.</p> <p>Following the footsteps of Nigeria’s first female novelist, Flora Nwapa, who protested the relegation of the Igbo whom in a patriarchal society in her works Efuru (1966) and Idu (1968), Ezeigbo’s work is a reaction to the unacceptable socioeconomic situation of Igbo women in particular and Nigerian women in general, under colonial rule.</p> <p>Like other Novelists in the womanist genre, Ezeigbo is preoccupied with the struggle for change, consciously expressed in the different forms of protest. In the case of The Last of the StrongOnes (1996) however, the author chooses to’ reconstruct the social realities of the Umuga community by entrenching women in active leadership roles alongside their male counterparts. This can be seen as a deliberate insistence on positive Igbo Heroines as a means of drawing attention to the importance and relevance of the woman’s voice, despite tradition.</p> <p>Thus, by tracing the history of the Umuga community through the voices of women and reconstructing the transition process via women’s experiences, pains and emotions, t author protests the one sided presentation of gender roles in the writings of men which overlooked the militant role of women in the struggle against Colonialism (C.F. Nina Mba 1997).</p> <p>Adimora Ezeigbo, through her fictional novels enlightens her readers on issues concerning her society. Social realities are entailed in her works, these issues are facts.</p> <p><strong>1.4 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FACTS AND FICTION.</strong></p> <p>Literature teaches moral lessons to man. A lot of lessons can be learnt from various works of literature. This is what we mean by didacticism. At the same time, literature is a source of entertainment. It is a known fact that man is always facing one problem or the other, because of the complexity and multiplicity of human problems. Human mind is most of the time being troubled. Literature can be used to heal the mind. This is what we mean by psycho-therapeutic function of literature. One should not forget to mention the fact that literature can be used to promote culture. Through it, we are exposed to the norms and values of various human societies.</p> <p>Recently, I asked my sisters to make their biodata available to me as soon as possible, to write down facts about their lives that I might include in the family book. I belie\\re I should also put together facts about my life that can go into the book. What is fact? And what is fiction? Can a line be really drawn between the two? I often think that the line between fact and fiction is blurred. What about the myths that society surrounds itself with? Is myth fact or fiction? People create myths to explain the unexplainable, the unknowable. In my family, we have our myths, just as Umuga has her myths (p.368).</p> <p>The above excerpt by the author, explains that facts are real events and happenings in her life. Through her short stories and novels, the author tells us about her family background and childhood in ‘The Blind Man of Ekwulu’. She also tells us ‘The War’s Untold Unstory’: The challenging years of youth and also through her short story ‘Agarachaa’, She writes on the fact of the memories of her youth. However, ‘The life out there’ tells us the single and searching days of the author. In ‘The life out there’, the author writes on the strict, stern and constraining background in which she grew:</p> <p>My parents were strict with us... I was a subdued child and quick in obeying whatever rules my parents laid down. One of those rules was that we were never to have boyfriends. I remember the day a boy posted a letter to our house without my knowledge and it got into my father’s hand. He read it and threatened to give the letter to the principal of my school and even to stop my education. You can imagine how I lost my patience with the boy upon my return to school. I warned him never to write such letters to me again... (Wov: 18).</p> <p>Ezeigbo also wrote about her marriage and family life in ‘A Day to Remember’ (Rituals and Departures).It tells us about the author’s early marriage while in school and her first pregnancy.</p> <p>Ezeigbo in her trilogy puts all these short stories together to produce a bigger novel. The writer is seen in the character Nnenne. She is a lecturer and a writer.</p> <p>‘...She was happy; she was free from lectures, from supervision of projects and dissertations’ (COE: 343).</p> <p>Ezeigbo in her literary works tells her readers the story of her life, family and children. She makes use of the novel because it gives her an avenue to depict fictional characters that represent her in her works. These events in her works are real but told as stories to entertain her readers and show her skill in writing.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>This research study will address itself to the way people tend to see fictional works. People see fictional works as being fictitious but they are over laid with fact. This study using Akachi Adimora - Ezeigbo’s works as guide, will demonstrate the impact of the intermeddling of fact with fiction in literary works.</p> <p><strong>1.6 METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>This research work will make use of the sociological theory. This theory is adopted for this study because Ezeigbo’s two works; The Last of the Strong Ones (1996) and Children c the Eagle (2002) are centered on literature and the society. Sociological theory relates arts to the society. This is virtually important because literature cannot exist without the society. This study will also make use of the Socialist realism theory as a branch of sociological theory.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF STUDY AND LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>This research work titled Facts and fiction in Akachi Adimora — Ezeigbo’s The Last of the• strong Ones(1996 and Children of the</p> <p>Eagle (2002), will begin with facts and fiction in literatuTe. The researcher will limit this study to areas of Orature, Feminism /Gender issues and Aesthetics concerning Ezeigbo’s works. This study is supposed to contain, broader aspects of facts and fiction. But due to time and space, this study will limit itself to the study of facts and fiction in Ezeigbo’s two works The researcher’s inability to interview Akachi , personally due to distance of learning is a limitation. Ezeigbo is a new writer. This fact led to difficulties in getting materials for the research work. This research work will pioneer criticism on the novelist.</p> <p><strong>1.8 JUSTIFICATION</strong></p> <p>This research work is carried out on Akachi Adimora Ezeigbo’s works because she ranks among the most out — spoken and prolific writers of modern times who use their literary works to challenge colonialist literatures and also African men’s literature. Akachi’s two works, The Last of the Strong Ones (1996) and Children of the Eagle (2002) are used for this study because the author infuses oral narratives of Igbo land. By adapting oral narrative devices, Adimora Ezeigbo decolonizes or, to be more precise, appropriates the Western’ based and determined novel and short story genre. This topic was chosen by the researcher because little has been done on Facts and Fiction in Ezeigbo’s The Last of the Strong Ones (1996) and Children of the Eagle (2002). The research will find out the realities in Ezeigbo’s fictional works. This research is carried out on Akachi because her novels have won awards and also because she is an award winning writer. She has won four major literary awards. She has also won several academic awards.</p> <p><strong>1.9 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research will exhibit that literature contains fact and fiction. They do not always obstruct each other and when harnessed depending on the ingenuity of the artist they can serve multiple purposes This study will show how Ezeigbo through her works reenacts the evolution of modern Nigeria from the era of colonial incursion to the present. Ezeigbo’s works show with priority the role of women in the making of national history. Ezeigbo’s maturation in her literary writing will be exhibited in this research work.</p> <p><strong>1.10 STRUCTURE OF THESIS</strong></p> <p>Chapter one of this work covers the introduction to literature. It explains the definition of terms and it’s relationship. It also shows the research problem, purpose of the study, scope of the study and limitation, justification and methodology.</p> <p>Chapter two of this research work contains the literature review. It entails the role of the Nigerian writer, issues related to Ezeigbo’s works and the use of oral literature in Ezeigbo’s fiction.</p> <p>Chapter three of this study titled “Facts and Fiction in Akachi’s The Last of the Strong Ones (1996) and Children of the Eagle (2002)”, looks at the realities in Ezeigbo’s fiction.</p> <p>Chapter four of this study covers the “Aesthetics residues of facts and fiction; An example of Akachi’s The Last of the Strong Ones (1996) and Children of the Eagle (2002)”.</p> <p>Chapter Five is the summary of findings and conclusion of the research work.</p>\n\nFACTS AND FICTION  IN  AKACHI ADIMORA - EZEIGBO’S  CHLDREN OF THE EAGLE AND THE LAST OF THE STRONG ONES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTS AND FICTION  IN  AKACHI ADIMORA - EZEIGBO’S  CHLDREN OF THE EAGLE AND THE LAST OF THE STRONG ONES", "id": 52}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHARACTERIZATION AND SYMBOLISM IN OLU OBAFEMI’S <em>WHEELS </em>AND NGUGI WA THIONGO’S <em>A GRAIN OF WHEAT</em></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>          Characterisation is the presentation, description, representation and analysis of the various characters or cast in any work of art; either a play, novel or poetry.</p> <p>          Characterisation is how the characters are created, moulded and presented by a writer. Characters are fictional even when they are not real human beings but animals or inanimate objects, we very well do know what they stand for. It can be said to be the way the author treats his characters or the development of characters in a piece of work.</p> <p>          Characterisation is a word that describes how the author develops the personality of the story characters in a story. A well developed characters is one that has been thoroughly characterized, with may traits shown in the narrative. A well-developed character acts according to past instances provided by its visible traits unless more information about the character is provided. The better the audience knows the characters, the better the characters development. Thorough characterization makes characters well-rounded and complex.</p> <p>          Characterization is also the process of conveying information about characters in narrative or dramatic works of art or everyday conversation. Characters may be presented by means of description, through their actions, speech, or thoughts. There are two ways an author can convey information about a character and they are:</p> <p>1.      Direct or explicit characterisation: The author literally tells the audience what a character is like. This may be done via the narrator, another character or by the character himself or herself.</p> <p>2.      Indirect or Implicit Characterisation: The audience must deduce for themselves what the character is like, through the character’s thoughts, actions, speech (choice of words, way of talking), looks and interaction with other characters, including other characters reactions to that particular person.</p> <p>          Symbolism is when the author uses an object or reference to add deeper meaning to a story. Symbolism in literature can be subtle for obvious, used sparingly or heavy-handedly.</p> <p>          Symbolism is the art or practice of using symbols especially by investing things with symbolic meaning or by expressing the invisible or intangible by means of visible or sensuous representations as:</p> <p>(a)      Artistic initiation or invention that is a method of revealing or suggesting immaterial, ideal; or otherwise intangible truth or states.</p> <p>(b)     The use of conventional or traditional signs in the representation of divine beings and spirits.</p> <p>          A symbol in literature is a thing that suggests more than its literal meaning. Symbols generally do not stand for any one meaning nor for anything absolutely definite, they point, they hint or as Henry James puts it, “They cast long shadows.” It is the use of symbols to represent things especially in art and literature.</p> <p>          Symbols are amazing things that rule our lives. When we over estimate their power, we suffer, when we underestimate their power we suffer.</p> <p>          Symbolism is often used to support a literary theme in a subtle manner. When the symbols, words, objects symbolize things that are not literally portrayed in the literary work, it is regarded to as symbolism.</p> <p><strong>1.1   PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>          This project work is aimed at exploring the ways in which characters and symbols contributed to the discovery of insights and meanings in Olu Obafemi’s Wheels and Ngugi Wa Thiongo’s A Grain of Wheat.</p> <p>§  It is also to understand the concept of characters and symbols by the writers.</p> <p>§  To promote the knowledge of significance of characterization and symbolism among the students</p> <p>§  And also to make the text easier to understand.</p> <p><strong>1.2   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project work focuses on the study of two texts of prominent African writers; it is based on the way characterization and symbolism are being used and how the writers were able to achieve these in their text chosen Olu Obafemi’s Wheels and Ngugi Wa Thiong’s A Grain of Wheat.</p> <p><strong>1.3   JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The two texts studied give us different style used by the writes on characterisation and symbolism. Though, there have been some work on the style, language, characters and symbolism on the two texts being used in this project work, but the authors are from two different countries.  So comparing their works expose the level of degeneration in every country in Africa. So this research work is a contribution to review characterisation and symbolism.</p> <p><strong>1.4   METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The study concerned itself with characterisation and symbolism in Olu Obafemi’s Wheels and Ngugi Wa Thiongo’s A Grain of Wheat and it relied on the close textual reading. Also consulted are textbooks, handbooks and other document relating to the two texts with a critical examination of the texts which also serve as a main source of information. Also, the sourceinclude visiting the website (Internet). The approach used by the author is the Marxist approach.</p> <p><br/></p>\n\nCHARACTERIZATION AND SYMBOLISM IN OLU OBAFEMI’S WHEELS AND NGUGI WA THIONGO’S A GRAIN OF WHEAT<div

</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p><p> <strong>I</strong><strong>NT</strong><strong>RODUCTION</strong> </p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Most cultures have stories which seek to explain the origin of life and to explain why things are as they are in the world today.  The story from Genesis would have us believe that linguistic diversity is the curse of Babel (Genesis 11:1-11).</p> <p>And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech…  And they said to one another… Let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.  And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.  And the Lord said, behold, the people is one, and they have all one language,… Let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.  So, the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.  Therefore, is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth.</p> <p>In primordial time, people spoke the same language.  God, however, decided to punish them for their presumptuousness in erecting the tower by making them speak different languages.  Thus, multilingualism became an obstacle to further co-operation and placed limits on human worldly achievements.</p> <p>Most communities in the world are multilingual.  In these communities, there is more than one language that plays an important role, and many or all of the individuals in such communities are at least bilingual.  Here, the context you find yourself determines the kind of language you use.</p> <p>When you talk of language choice in any country, one bears in mind the multilingual societies.  In monolingual countries, there is no worry about choice of language to use, they only have to use the language available to them.</p> <p>One of the most obvious problems associated with newly formed multilingual communities, for example, in countries such as Australia and Canada which have seen considerable immigration from different parts of the world, is that of cross-cultural communication.  Sociolinguistic research has made it clear that to communicate successfully  in a language other than your own, it is not enough to learn the phonology, grammar and vocabulary of that language.  You also have to learn how to use it appropriately in particular social situations according to the norms employed and accepted by its native speakers.</p> <p>Potential multilingual speakers are people with a strong interest in a foreign language, people who find it necessary to acquire second or third language for practical purposes, such as business, information gathering or entertainment.</p> <p>Multilingual speakers outnumber monolingual speakers in the world’s population.  In a multilingual society, not all speakers need to be multilingual.  When all speakers are multilingual, linguists classify the community according to the functional distribution of the languages involved.</p> <p>The researcher observed that before an individual thinks of language choice, there must be some motivational factors.  Motivation and investment in this process, by the individual, will depend on the value attached to prospective gains accompanying proficiency in the relevant language.  He also observed that language choice is affected by utilitarian considerations.  A speaker may feel that the use of a particular language will place him in an advantageous position either within a group or within a wider social context.  If his antagonists in a discussion or argument are less fluent than he is, this will clearly serve to give him a valuable edge.  The perceived advantage does not have to be in relation to other individuals.  It may be for purely personal considerations that a person chooses to speak a particular language.   A student of a foreign language may prefer to use that language whenever possible, with the sole intention of improving his ability.</p> <p>Acquiring an additional language, second, third or fourth, will be greatly affected by the social, political and economic environment within which the acquisition process takes place.  Learners of additional languages are either born into or transferred to (as a result of migration) a multilingual context.  Those born into such a situation usually accept the need for multilingualism as a natural phenomenon and hence can easily see the importance and the gains of achieving a high level of proficiency in the various relevant languages.  Those transferred to a multilingual context as a result of immigration, have some difficult choices to make:</p> <ol><li>Maintenance of the heritage language in order to preserve the culture and ethnic identity.</li> <li>Acquisition of the new national language in order to gain equitable access to the new country’s resources.</li> <li>Acquisition of a language of wider communication, such as English for academic and professional purposes.</li> <li>Finally, acquisition of another local language, which is needed for interaction with neighbours or fellow workers at the workplace.  In this kind of situation, language choices may require certain “prices” to be paid by the learner.</li> </ol> <p>Communication is only possible if both speakers share the same language, and there is little to  gain  from addressing someone in a language which they do not understand.  There is an almost universal taboo upon the use of a language which might exclude one or more members of a group from a discussion, even if the subject of that discussion has no direct relevance to that person or persons.  For example, a group of Igbo speakers may be discussing plans for a farewell party for one of their work-mates who is about to retire.  Another person, one who does not work at the same company, who does not know the gentleman in question, and who will not be invited to the party, joins the group.  This new comer, moreover, does not speak Igbo.  It is now incumbent upon the group to continue their discussion in a language which that person can understand.  Having to change the language of the discussion to one which may be a second or third language for a majority of the members can, of course, have a stultifying effect upon the course of the discussion, making it more difficult to express thoughts and ideas.  In this case, however, the exclusion constraint takes precedence over the language preference of the group majority.  In extreme cases, the requirement for a common language might force all of the speakers to adopt second or third languages.  The search for a common language may sometimes prove unsuccessful, and a group will have to choose the language which allows participation of the greatest number of people.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The focus of this research work is on those factors that affect language choice in a multilingual community or society.</p> <p>Keen observation and study have shown that there are many things that make people to think of language choice.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>These questions have been posed to guide this study:</p> <ol><li>What are the problems

what extent do these factors affect language choice?</li> </ol> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this research work is to identify those things that affect people’s language choice in a multilingual society. To examine the problems individuals encounter when trying to choose a particular language.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of this study is to reveal those factors that affects language choice in a multilingual society or setting.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is limited to a multilingual society.  It is restricted to factors that affect language choice in this kind of society mentioned above.  The constraints associated with time shall not allow the researcher to stretch his hands to evaluate all the factors.</p>\n\nFACTORS AFFECTING LANGUAGE CHOICE IN A MULTINATIONAL SOCIETY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS AFFECTING LANGUAGE CHOICE IN A MULTINATIONAL SOCIETY", "id": 54}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> THE LANGUAGE OF FEMINISM AND ITS IMPACT ON THE SOCIETY </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background of Study</strong></p> <p>The struggle for women’ right began in the 18th century during the period of intense intellectual activity known as the Age of Enlightenment.</p> <p>In traditional Africa the woman is an object of constant scorn, degradation and physical torture.

This work takes for granted that grammatical competence is totally different from phonological competence and it has worked on this premise using phonological conventions in analysing the sampled data. The findings proved that interference at the phonological level is a major problem confronting our media houses in Nigeria with respect to spoken English.

It can be language of a particular field like science, humanity just to mention few. It can also be the animal language, sign language and many other types of languages.</p> <p>Human language especially spoken dominates them all. Human language is natural. According to Adebayo (1995), “Language (Human Language) is one of the chief means by which a person learns to organise his experiences and thoughts”</p> <p>In Adebayo’s words above, human language is one out of many means by which a person’s experiences and thoughts can be organised. This supports the many senses that language has. And also, without language, (spoken) thoughts will never be born and experiences of life will be wasted because no one will be able to learn from them. Communication is the major bridge that links the whole world. Communication is a crucial factor in the society at large and there is pieces evidence that prove this. The global village and the internet prove this among others.</p> <p>Language whether written, spoken, sign or through any means is a tool for communication and English language, out of many languages of the world has emerged the most used language all over the world. The global village use this language (English) and it stands to be the language of the net.</p> <p>English language accords respect and pride to its speakers but some have been left with the effective use of this language especially in the countries where the language (English) is not the mother tongue or the first language one comes in contact with, for instance in countries like Nigeria, Ghana and many others.</p> <p>The language teachers, the broadcasters and some few others have been left with the duty of speaking the correct version of English language in Nigeria. And if this proof is true, these categories of people should speak error free English. However, it is unfortunate that some of our broadcasters still goof on air and this distorts communication. In the light of the above, this research is out to work on the use of language in English newscast under the title “Mother Tongue Interference in English Newscast: a Case of a Recorded Kwara Television News”</p> <p> 1.1 The Research Problem</p> <p>This work knows that some issues that have become problems in our media houses have been handled by some scholars. For instance, Medubi (2007) and Okoye (2007). Both of them dwelt more on the problems confronting the press in Nigeria but not directly as this work will handle it. No one has really worked on how Mother Tongue Interference distorts communication in our media houses in Nigeria. This work will look into this problem and will try to proffer solutions.</p> <p>1.1.1 Research Question</p> <p>In handling the research problem above, this research will focus its attention on this question: How much does Mother Tongue Interference distorts communications in our media houses in Nigeria?</p> <p>1.2 Research Purpose</p> <p>The purpose of this research is to achieve some set goals.</p> <p>Firstly, this research is to further enlighten the media on the importance of Standard English.</p> <p>Secondly, this research is to also help the second language teachers. Since they are the foundation layers of all learners and when the foundation of a leaner is solid, anything built on it will stand erect.</p> <p>Lastly, this research will be useful for the media and the second speakers of the English language on how to produce sounds of English that will be free from Mother Tongue Interference.</p> <p>1.3 Scope of the Study</p> <p>This work will focus on “Mother Tongue Interference in English Newscast”. Different authors have dealt with his topic from different perspectives.</p> <p>Hoffmann (1991) identified four major types of mother tongue interference in English.</p> <ol><li>a) Interference at the phonological level</li> <li>b) Interference at the grammatical level</li> <li>c) Interference at the lexical level</li> <li>d) Interference in spelling.</li> </ol> <p>Alabi (2007) also identified three types of mother tongue interference in English which are: phonological interference, lexical interference and grammatical interference.</p> <p>This research will concentrate on the phonological level of mother tongue interference because it deals mainly with speech (Day to day conversation).</p> <p>1.4 Justification</p> <p>This research topic “Mother Tongue Interference in English Newscast” is important because the problem is obvious in almost all the media houses in Nigeria.</p> <p>Some authors have outlined the problems confronting our media houses in Nigeria but few have given us solutions. An author like Okoye (2007) outlined the problem of the press in Nigeria but did not give solutions to such problems.</p> <p>This research is set to look into the problems and proffer solutions to them with top priority given to the phonological aspect.</p> <p>1.5 Methodology</p> <p>This research is to analyse the Kwara Television main News. This television station has two sections of news. Basically, the news at five O’clock and the news at half past six in the evening.</p> <p>This research will analyse one of the main news which is usually broadcast by two people unlike the news at five which is shorter and taken by only one person.</p> <p>More people also listen to the main news compared to the one at 5pm perhaps because it is fuller or later than the first or both.</p> <p>Some of the workers in the newsroom will be interviewed to know the philosophy, ideology and the brief history of the television station.</p> <p>The data will be analysed using phonological rules because this is the most pervasive type of interference according Romaine (1989, p.52).</p> <p>In the process, if questionnaire will be useful, it will also be composed and given to some selected people in the society to know their reactions to the media house and oral interviews can also be conducted.</p> <p>These are some of the methods that have been chosen for the success of this work.</p> <p>1.6 Data Description</p> <p>Kwara Television Authority UHF 35 (Socially responsible) was established in 1991 under the able leadership of Mall. Ishaq Maddibo Kawu. The establishment was promulgated into a decree in (1997) with six departments.</p> <p>The departments are Administration, Accounts, Marketing, News, Programmes and Engineering.</p> <p>After the tenure of Mall. Maddibo, eight directors have managed the Television station and Barrister Mohammed Abdul Raheem who is the current General Manager was appointed on 16th June, 2010. And he is the General Manager till date.</p> <p>This station covers up to five states which are Kwara, parts of Oyo-state, Kogi, Ekiti and Osun states.</p> <p>This television station has the mind of becoming the best in all things especially in informing people and updating them in all useful and educating matters.</p> <p>Most people complained of the time of the main news which is (6:30pm) half past six. Many said they will still be at work or not at home at the time of the news and few who listen to KWTV news commend that the news is fuller and it covers more of the local events which some other stations usually neglect.</p> <p>1.7 Definition of Some Terms</p> <p>Mother Tongue/First language (L1).</p> <p>Mother tongue also called the first language (L1) is the first language a child comes in contact with in his/her environment.      Mother tongue is slightly different from the first language. Mother tongue is the language of the parents especially the father while the first language is the language of the environment.</p> <p>The child’s mother tongue can be his/her first language and it may not also be. In the case where a Yoruba child grows up in ‘Okene’ in Kogi-state where the language in such environment is “Ebira” the Yoruba child can or will conveniently speak, “Ebira” because of his/her environment.</p> <p>1.7.1 Second Language (Target Language)</p> <p>A second language (L2) is that which exists side by side with the indigenous language(s) in a bilingual or multilingual situation. It is usually an official language and as such enjoys a high status within the nation.</p> <p>A second or the target language can be the fourth or the third language to be acquired but as long as someone has a language before learning another, it will be referred to as the second language or the target language</p> <p>1.7.2 News</p> <p>Danuta (1998, p. 4) says:</p> <p>News is a late Middle English Word that means “tidings” New information of recent events. Even if we accept this definition as a useful description of what Newspaper delivers… A more useful definition might be information about recent events that are of interest to a sufficiently large group, or that may affect the lives of a sufficiently large group.</p> <p>1.7.3 Phonology</p> <p>Akmajian (2001, p.109) etal says “phonology is the subfield of linguistics that studies the structure and systematic patterning of sound of human language”.</p> <p>In his words, phonology is used in two ways. The first one describes the sounds of a language and the rules governing the use of those sounds. While the second refers to that part of the general theory of human language that is concerned with the universal properties of natural language sound systems.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Since language and man are not the same and they cannot be separated, problems will always arise from the two angles. Solutions must also be provided to such problems in order to have effective communication in the society.</p> <p>This chapter has introduced us to the work that will be done and the next chapter, chapter two will review some works of literature by some renowned scholars in the field of language and this will establish the place of this work by linking it to some works that have been read.</p>\n\nMOTHER TONGUE INTERFERENCE IN ENGLISH NEWS CAST <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MOTHER TONGUE INTERFERENCE IN ENGLISH NEWS CAST ", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CLASS STRATIFICATION, POVERTY AND SOCIAL INJUSTICE:</strong></p> <p><strong>A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF FESTUS IYAYI’S<em>VIOLENCE</em> AND </strong></p> <p><strong>OLU OBAFEMI <em>WHEELS</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Chapter one</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>A writer is supposed to perform certain duties to the upliftment of his society.

(Ngugi, 1975:50)</p> <p>Nigerian writers have pursued different themes amongst which are cross-cultural conflicts, the African past, corruption in politics, social injustice, which also include; poverty, exploitation, oppression, marginalization, class struggle and class stratification. Achebe argues that the novel is a:</p> <p>Form of fiction has seized the imagination of many African writers and they will use it according to their differing abilities, sensibilities and vision without seeking anyone’s permission. I believe it will grow and prosper. I believe it has great future. (Achebe, 1981:54)</p> <p>Apparently, the events of the Nigerian political system have caused Nigerian writing to shift in themes. Therefore, a writer who tries to avoid the big social and political issues of contemporary African society will end up completely irrelevant because his work would have no impact on the people and society.</p> <p>Such work becomes irrelevant like the writer himself to the society and the people because he has failed to address any of the important issues at stake. Therefore art should not just be for the purpose of exploring its beauty just as the formalist school of thought posits. It should contemplate the society and expose the ills in the society and as well define a solution for these ills just as the Marxist would argue.</p> <p>The Marxist concern emerges out of the need to find a lasting solution to class stratification and a society free of oppression. Fortunately, this quest is not in vain as a good number of writers in Africa are involved in various ways in the struggle for the negation of the neo-colonialism and the alienating effect of capitalist lordship in African countries. Among these African writers are OluObafemi and Festus Iyayi. OluObafemi uses his novel <em>Wheels </em>to mirror the society and as well fight for the cause of the poor, just as Festus Iyayi has done in his novel <em>Violence.</em> He uses his protagonist Idemudia to narrate the plight of the poor who suffer from social injustice and are placed in the lower cadre of the society.</p> <p>Marxism, like every other modern theory of writing is universal and since it can be used in quest of freeing the society from corrupt practices, Africans should then, not be left out as the decisive development of African literature. Marxism consists of the rise of a tradition of radical thinking in general, and with strongest ideological alignment.</p> <p>At the level of general theory of development in question, it is a vindication of the generalization that in a class society, literary movements are inevitable, if not automatic outgrowth of class society and political directions.</p> <p><strong>1.1       Statement of Research Problem</strong></p> <p>Every research work poses as a problem that needs to be resolved, which bring about the questions as to how these problems that arises will be solved. The sole aim of the researcher is to find answers that will best solve these problems. Therefore this research will by the end have answered questions like:</p> <p>1.                                          What is Marxism?</p> <p>2.                                          How has the gap between the rich and the poor evolved?</p> <p>3.                                          What is poverty and class stratification and why is it regarded as social injustice?</p> <p>In an attempt to provide appropriate answers to these questions the researcher will carry out thorough investigations on the Marxist theory thereby making references to the work of other researchers and scholars who have worked on Marxism. Also the works of Festus Iyayi and OluObafemi, as earlier stated, will be used as well.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Purpose of Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to shed more light on the issues of class stratification, social injustice, and poverty and how African writers like OluObafemi, Festus Iyayi, AyiKweiArmah, IsidoreOkpewho, NgugiwaThiong’o have used literature as a tool for the eradication of poverty and to breach the gap between the rich and the poor.</p> <p>Also, in the light of these issues been faced in Africa, the aim of this study is to also bring to the reader’s notice the importance of fighting to get out of poverty in a dignifying manner and not allowing the oppression and exploitation of the bourgeois just as Festus Iyayi uses the character, Idemudia, in <em>Violence </em>to explain this, as well as how OluObafemi explores these issues in <em>Wheels.</em></p> <p><strong>1.3       Scope and Limitation of Study</strong></p> <p>The major preoccupation of this study is to bring to limelight the issues of class stratification, social injustice and the eradication of poverty in the African society and how African literary writers have been able to expose these ills with the intention of eradicating it from the society. In order to achieve this, the research work shall be limited to using Festus Iyayi’s<em>Violence </em>and OluObafemi’s<em>Wheels</em> as the data for the analysis of these issues.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Justification</strong></p> <p>Many scholars and writers have examined class stratification as a component of social stratification, perhaps, why it exists. Also ‘poverty’ has been examined as one of the major issues in Africa and how it has become difficult to eradicate.</p> <p>Though scholars and writers have examined these motifs, sometimes as a single entity and at other times collectively, readers don’t yet seem to understand that poverty is what leads to class stratification and social injustice. That is what Obafemi and Iyayi pointed out in their novels, <em>Wheels</em> and <em>Violence.</em></p> <p>These novels were the primary sources of reference as they capture the political experiences of the people. Both novelists unfold the nature of the instruments of power which were meant for effective governance is misused on the governed especially the poor.</p> <p><strong>1.5       Research Methodology</strong></p> <p>The methodology approach to be used for the effective analysis of this study is the Marxist theory. This is because the Marxist theorist view the society (especially capitalist society) as politically locked down and hold the freedom of the people. They portray the suffering of the masses in their literary texts and form their analysis and view point, that the masses suffer as a result of corruption and stratification which our leaders seem to always follow.</p> <p>            As most literary texts written now discuss more on the political state of a society and how political climate affects the economic structure of the society, which is depreciating as a result of class stratification, poverty and social injustice, the best approach pays more attention to the exploitation, the oppressed and stratified and explains the labour complexities been faced, which is the Marxist theory.</p> <p>            The use of Marxist approach is justified as the two novelists whose work shall be used as the data for analysis share the same ideological approach which is Marxism. </p> <p><strong> 1.6      FESTUS IYAYI ‘S BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>Festus Iyayi, born 1947, in Benin City is a Nigerian writer known for his radical and sometimes tough stance on social and political issues.

Inconsistent language policy, successive government‟s inability to pick any of the indigenous languages as a national language, non-codification of many minority languages, inadequate definition of roles for indigenous languages in governance, among others, are some of the major harbinger of this crisis. Although Nigeria has between 250 and 400 indigenous languages (Ogunwale 2013) none of the languages has been considered worthy of adoption as national language. Attempt was made to popularize an artificial language, akin to Swahili of the East Africans, in the 1990s, but that was also unsuccessful as it contains mostly bits of words and vocabularies found only in the three major languages, namely WA (Yoruba); ZO (Hausa) and BIA (Igbo), neglecting the other languages. English Language has since continued to gain so much prominence in the country that its dominance has stifled the growth (and even led to the extinction of some) of the 529 indigenous languages in Nigeria. The dominance, as could be decipher, is not inflicted, but by a natural course of indispensability of the language as its use cuts across different spheres of the nation. However, when one considers the fact that the linguistic situation in Nigeria before colonisation was that in which indigenous languages thrived and promoted cultural values of the people, then it will be expedient to unravel why the indigenous languages suddenly take the back seat. In the course of colonization, Nigerian indigenous languages had contact with the language of the colonialists; the latter was more favored than the former. English language then became the language of colonial administration. At independence the language was bequeathed to Nigeria as a nation, especially because it was the only language that was used for administration, missionary work and later education. Even after attaining independence, Nigeria has not been able to have language policies that could create functions for the indigenous languages. The existing policy which is an aspect of the Education Policy of 1977, has only feebly assigned roles that have been difficult to execute so effectively. The status of these three languages as major languages is captured in theNational Policy of Education formulated in1977 (and which has subsequently been revised in 1981, 1989, 1998 and 2004). The Nigerian Language Policy is a document of the Federal Government of Nigeria, which has statutory guidelines regarding the official use of different languages in the country. Although the policy documents and stresses the importance of language to national development, as a means of promoting social interaction and national cohesion, as well as preserving the nation’s rich cultural heritage, but its implementation has not been diligently executed. The Yoruba language is mainly spoken in West Africa with millions of speakers mainly in Nigeria and Benin with some in other parts of Africa. The traditional ruler is known as the TimiAgbale, the most prominent Timi in recent history is Oba John AdetoyeseLaoye who made the \"talking drum\" popular. He was reputed to have entertained the Queen of England with his group of skilled drummers and poets when she first visited Nigeria and thereafter in her palace in England before he died in 1975. The present King of the town is Oba MunirudeenAdesolaLawal (Laminisa 1). The Ede speech community being a largely indigenous Yoruba community uses the Standard Yoruba dialect which is also known as the Oyo dialect. The Yoruba language has been classified as one of the major languages in Nigeria simply because of the population that speaks it. In recent times certain factors such as the economy and location of schools has brought the people in contact with other languages. The town parades an array of Elementary Schools, Middle Schools, High Schools, a Federal Polytechnic and two universities. One of them Adeleke University already has members of staff and students in the various faculties while the second university, The Redeemers University is completed. With the myriad of educational institutions in Yoruba town the indigenes who predominantly speak Yoruba language are having frequent contact with students and staff of the various institutions who are mostly bilinguals of Yoruba and English. A situation of language contact is presented and the impact is more on the indigenes as they have had to use English words and expressions in order to sell their goods and services to the staff and students of the various institutions highlighted above. Language as defined by Oluga (2006) is a systemic means of expressing ideas, facts, views, thoughts, opinions or a means of passing meaningful messages or information by the use of appropriate signs, sounds, symbols and gestures generally understood by all the users within a speech community.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Nigeria being a multilingual society has adopted English Language as its official language with the resultant effect of bilingualism and multilingualism even in a predominantly indigenous community like Yoruba. It is of a fact that when more than one language is in regular use in a community certain things happen linguistically, sociologically, educationally, politically in that society. Thus the co-existence ofEnglish and Yoruba languages in Yoruba community has produced various hybrid forms in terms of nativilized or domesticated variety of English, characterized by interference, code-mixing and code-switching, on the part of the second language speakers (L2). It is in view of this that the researcher intend to investigate the impact of Yoruba on the spoken English of student in Illorin.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to ascertain the impact of Yoruba on the spoken English of student in Illorin, but to aid the successful completion of the study, the researcher intend to achieve the following objective;</p> <p>i)             To ascertain the impact of Yoruba on the spoken English of student in Illorin</p> <p>ii)           To evaluate the effect of Yoruba on the eloquence level of student in spoken English</p> <p>iii)          To investigate the role of Yoruba language on the unity</p> <p>iv)         T</p> <p>iv)         To suggest possible solution to the identified problem</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>To aid the successful completion of the study the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher;</p> <p><strong>H0:</strong>Yoruba language does not have any significant impact on the spoken English of student in Illorin</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong>Yoruba language does have a significant impact on the spoken English of student in Illorin</p> <p><strong>H02:</strong>Yoruba language does not have any effect on the eloquence level of student in English language.</p> <p><strong>H2:</strong>Yoruba language does have a significant effect on the eloquence level of students in English language</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of benefit to lecturers and student of English language as the study will guide them to create a synergy between both English language and Yoruba language, because Nigeria being a multilingual nation there is bound to be conflict between theses language considering the effect of language on the unity of Nigeria. The study will also be of great importance to department of linguistic as the study will add to the existing literature. The study will also be of great importance to student who intend to embark on a study in similar topic as the findings of the study will serve as a pathfinder to them.

In the Selected texts, Animata Sow Fall’s <em>The Beggars’ strike</em> and Festus iyayi’s <em>Violence</em>, themes pertaining to class struggle were described, Class struggle becomes a necessity in any society with a wide gap between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have nots’. This academic project examines the extent to which the duo of Animata and Iyayi utilized the theme – Class struggle, in their novels, <em>The beggars’ strike</em> and <em>Violence</em> respectively.</p> <p><strong>1.2     BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>          Karl Marx wrote to Friedrich Engels in 1882: “you know very well where we found our idea of class struggle; we found it in the work of the French historians who talked about the race struggle”. Class struggle predates Karl Marx; one may boldly say that it describes the history of all existing human civilizations.</p> <p>          Social classes are often described as either upper, middle or lower based on income, wealth or estate. However, Marxist notion of class in a capitalist setting is based on the control of means of production. Karl Marx describes two main classes:</p> <p>§  Proletariat (Labour)</p> <p>§  Bourgeoisie (Capitalist)</p> <p>The Proletariat (labour) makes a living directly from their labour whereas the Bourgeoisie controls the means of production, exploiting the proletariat, living off the surplus value on cheap labour. This may be perceived as a form of neocolonialism, labour is exploited to create economic and socio-political dominance. A most shameful version of Apartheid in post colonial Africa, perpetrated by Africans on fellow Africans. Burdened by extreme poverty and hunger, the masses inevitably revolt against oppression. The ensuing struggle, though often violent, non-violent struggle is not uncommon.</p> <p>In the selected texts, forms of class struggle includes: industrial strike actions, protests, rallies, pilferage, sabotage etc Class struggle in Africa is inextricably linked to corruption and injustice. In an unjust society where wealth is unevenly distributed and the rule of law biased, class struggle is seen as a necessity. It becomes the only available option for the masses to fight for economic and social relevance. Class struggle is a brave attempt at reshaping capitalism into a more equitable system of governance and giving birth to a truly egalitarian, economically viable and politically stable Nation. Class struggle is a bold step towards achieving a true utopian society, which is the ultimate Marxist phantom.</p> <p><strong>1.3     AIM OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>          This study is a modest attempt at providing insight into the concept of class struggle in Africa. Based on the works of two distinguished proletarian writers, Animata Sow fall and Festus Iyayi in their works – The Beggars’ strike and Violence, the following objectives were brought to light:</p> <p>§  Definition of and description of the concept of class;</p> <p>§  Identification and description of the types of class in the selected texts;</p> <p>§  Definition of class struggle;</p> <p>§  Identification of similarities and differences between francophone and Anglophone African societies in terms of class and class struggle;</p> <p>§  Identification of benefits and side-effects of class struggle;</p> <p>§  Providing a workable solution to the problems of class struggle in Africa; and</p> <p>§  Providing reliable answers to research questions set at the beginning of the study.</p> <p><strong>1.4     SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The focus of this study is Africa, with Senegal and Nigeria as case studies as portrayed by the duo of Animata and Iyayi in <em>The beggars’ strike</em> and <em>Violence</em> respectively. This research investigates how judiciously the understudied works reveal the existence of class struggle and other sub-themes like, oppression and negritude in the context of francophone and Anglophone Africa. The choice of works based on Senegal and Nigeria is motivated by the fact that, the two countries give a fair representation of West Africa, giving the Francophone and the Anglophone point of view. This is imperative as it is almost certainly impossible to study works from every part of Africa considering the constraints of time and resources.</p> <p><strong>1.5     JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The significance of this research apart from providing a reliable source of information for future researchers on class struggle is also of great value in appraisal of democratic values in Africa. Understanding the role of class struggle in society will strengthen Africa’s nascent democracy and promote good governance.</p> <p>This research is also a celebration of artistic imagination and dexterity displayed by these distinguished African Writers, Animata Sowfall and Festus Iyayi.</p> <p><strong>1.6     METHODOLOGY AND THEORY</strong></p> <p>          This research is both qualitative and descriptive, with thematic analysis of the texts. Themes of class struggle and related sub-themes like poverty, rule of law, democracy etc were adequately analyzed.</p> <p>This research is based on the Marxist-Leninist theory of the society, which could be simply paraphrased as: The exploiters oppress the exploited while the exploited attempt to get ride of exploitation and the exploiters.</p> <p>The sample frame is Senegal and Nigeria which were the setting in the selected texts, this research also made use of demographic analysis as well as a general overview of the </p> <p>Characters and the artistic styles employed by the authors. </p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.6.1  DESCRIPTION OF STUDY AREA</strong></p> <p><strong>SENEGAL</strong></p> <p>Senegal a former French colony in West Africa, capital is Dakar.

Previous unicameral system was abandoned in 2007, Senegal now run a bicameral parliament, consisting of the National Assemble and the Senate. Senegal is divided into 14 divisions, headed by local administrators appointed and accountable to the president. Power is intensely centralized and this often leads to criticism of Senegalese political structure, state and religion are not clearly demarcated as a majorly Islamic population, leaders of Islamic groups called the marabouts often play major role in politics.</p> <p>Senegal has a wide variety of ethnic groups and, as in most West African countries, several languages are widely spoken. The Wolof are the largest single ethnic group in Senegal at 43 percent; the Fula and Toucouleur (also known as Halpulaar'en, literally \"Pulaar-speakers\") (24 percent) are the second biggest group, followed by others that include the Serer (15 percent), Lebou (10 percent), Jola (4 percent), Mandinka (3 percent), Maures or Naarkajors, Soninke, Bassari and many smaller communities (9 percent).</p> <p>          The main industries include food processing, mining, cement, artificial fertilizer, chemicals, textiles, refining imported petroleum, and tourism.

There are two broad areas that have set apart Marxism-Leninism as a school of thought.</p> <p>First, Lenin's followers generally view his additions to the body of Marxism as the practical aspect of Marx's original theoretical contributions of the 19th century. Lenin called this time-frame the era of Imperialism. </p> <p>Joseph Stalin wrote that; <em>“Leninism grew up and took shape under the conditions of imperialism, when the contradictions of capitalism had reached an extreme point, when the proletarian revolution had become an immediate practical question, when the old period of preparation of the working class for revolution had arrived at and passed into a new period, that of direct assault on capitalism”</em></p> <p>The most important consequence of a Leninist-style theory of Imperialism is the strategic need for workers in the industrialized countries to come together with the oppressed nations contained within their respective countries and colonies abroad in order to overthrow capitalism. This is the source of the slogan, which shows the Leninist conception that not only the proletariat, as is traditional to Marxism, are the sole revolutionary force, but all oppressed people; “Workers and Oppressed Peoples of the World, Unite!”</p> <p>Second, the other distinguishing characteristic of Marxism-Leninism is how it approaches the question of organization. Lenin believed that the traditional model of the Social Democratic parties of the time, which was a loose, multitendency organization was inadequate for overthrowing the Tsarist regime in Russia. He proposed a cadre of professional revolutionaries that disciplined itself under the model of Democratic Centralism.</p> <p>In solving the national question Leninism profer the following thesis:</p> <p>a] The world is divided into two camps: the camp of a handful of civilised nations, which possess finance capital and exploit the vast majority of the population of the globe; and the camp of the oppressed and exploited peoples in the colonies and dependent countries, which constitute that majority;</p> <p>b] The colonies and dependent countries, oppressed and exploited by finance capital, constitute a vast reserve and a very important source of strength for imperialism;</p> <p>c] The revolutionary struggle of the oppressed peoples in the dependent and colonial countries against imperialism is the only road that leads to their emancipation from oppression and exploitation</p> <p><strong>1.7     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>          The following questions were modestly answered by this research:</p> <p>§  What kind of ideological vision is demonstrated by Animata Sow fall and Festus Iyayi?</p> <p>§  Race struggle is the predecessor of class struggle.

Yule (1997: 73)</p> <p>The central of the core of morphology is morpheme. hence, morphemic analysis together with the types of morpheme shall be extensively discussed. Much attention shall be placed on bound morphemes and morphological processes like, affixation, compounding, reduplication, borrowing, clipping etc. in Koro language. These and many more morphological concepts shall be discussed in the subsequent chapters.</p> <p>Also in this chapter, we shall examine the historical background of Koro language, socio linguistics profile under which we shall discuss the origin, religion, festivals, occupation, marriage, culture and belief, burial rites, educational, language status, the genetic classification of the language.</p> <ul><li>Historical Background of the Koros.</li> </ul> <p>There are many version of the origins of the Koro. Some primary and secondary sources of oral tradition, assumed monolithic origin for the Koros. However, all these contradictory versions reflect migrations and inter relations.</p> <ul><li>Origin</li> </ul> <p>According to the story of the origin of Koros narrated to us by Sariki Muhammed Yawa, the present village head and 14thchief of Ija-Koro village, he said a group of Koro left Zaria area on a hunting expedition to old Abuja emirate, years before the Hausa Zazzau came to Abuja (Suleja) under the leadership of ‘Shiwoyi’ who later became the first chief of Ija-Koro.</p> <p>They later discovered that the land was blessed with thick foliage and more game, the Koros decided to settle very close to the Gbagyi people who they met there and who also welcome them without any bitterness or rancour.</p> <p>After living with the Gbagyi for many decades they left their former abode to where they presently occupy in Tafa local government area of Niger state. They later divided into two villages, Gbaraku and Ija-Koro with Ija-koro as the senior of the two. Today Ija-koro is made up of ten wards which include, Kacha, Kachago, Kachadato, Kugawa, Kugu, Adidipu, Gbaraku, Adiotolafu, Adesa and Tungan and Ladan. Ija-Koro is one of the ten villages under Bwarri district until the creation of federal capital territory Abuja.</p> <p>Also according to Na’ibi and Hassan in their book ‘a chronicle of Abuja’ the Koro of Ija came from Jaban-Kogo in southern Zaria under the leadership of Idrisu who left Jaban-Kogo because of chieftaincy dispute. He traveled with his people through Jere and Garam and then settled on.</p> <p>Another popular legend of the Koros claimed that they were evidently influenced by the attempt to link their origin to the universal perspective and centers of old civilization. This legend claimed that one koro and his younger brother ‘Jukun’ were born east of Mecca and settled in “Apa” which became the capital of Kwararafa Kingdom. He was blessed with four children named Igala, Nupe and two daughters. Igala in turn begot Alago and Idoma. One of the daughter of Jukun begot Bachama, while the second daughter begot Ankwe (Gojeh, Jatau and Mamman, 1998:9) from linguistic evidence, the legend of Koro and his brother Jukun were not from Mecca. Infact, some Koro, Kanuri, Jukun and Arab do not belong to the same linguistic group as evidenced in the recent linguistic classification of Gordon (2005).</p> <p>The above legend contradicts the oral accounts narrated by Sarki Muhammed Yawa.</p> <p>Linguistic consideration strongly point to the fact that all Koros couldn’t have one origin nor came together into central Nigeria, as they do not speak same language. Infact the difference in dialect from one Koro group to another further points to the fact that they have different origin.</p> <p>Meek quoted by Goje, Jatau and Mammah (1998:18) classified it simply as “Nigerian semi-Bantu with no further refinement” Godon’s (2005) linguistic family tree traces Koro to have originated from among the Niger-Congo group of languages through the Atlantic Congo, Volta-Congo, Benue-Congo, Plateau Western to North-Western Koro. They are known with the dialects, Koro-Ija, Ashe, Gbegbe-Ejar, Koro Panda, Koro Ache, Koro Tandili, Koro Adong, Koro-Ujiji or mijiji. Koro is a cover term for the several dialectical groups while some of them have other names like Koro-Eger, Koro-Makama, Koro myamya, Koro miamiya, Koro-lafiya, Koro gbegbere and Koro Ala.</p> <ul><li>Socio-Cultural Profile</li> </ul> <p>The Koros are known for unshakeable peace and unflinching tolerance even with other distinct neigbours. They believe that this two things (peace and tolerance) are one of the things human being needs to survive and have a productive life. The puzzle of Koro social psychology attracts scholarly interest to examine the binding forces. Other groups are most comfortable with them for their strong believe or humour, human relations, accessibility, peace and docility. They are identical through joking relation, common facial marks, sharing of foods, traditional/cult consultation, moving together in the market or social occasion and sometimes forging common origin.</p> <ul><li>Cultural Values</li> </ul> <p>Cultural values are the cherished traditions and ethos, which are desirable to the society (Koro community) and taken as normative civilization. They value submissive character, readiness to obey orders, and fulfill responsibilities.  Their expectations and practices that make life meaningful and anticipation of better tomorrow. One observable cultural value of these people is good mind and behaviour and predisposition to work as demanded. This is reinforced through organization of age-grades. A well-behaved man is favoured while there is also a severe punishment for the deviants. They also love organizing their societies with structured authorities some of which one religious and some administrative.</p> <ul><li>Administrative System</li> </ul> <p>The unit of authority starts from the house hold under its house-head called “Pinwada” or “Ikpunkiya”. The house hold heads are answerable to the clan-head (ebe-tuko) or ward head. All the village head are answerable to the chief (Osu) and the house hold head are also answerable to the village head. The Osu or Ghere-Ghabin is turbaned like an Emir since colonial days. Title holders have overlapping roles in the palace, but the most important ones are the secretary, Sarkin Pada, ‘Bochi-zaki’ (adviser) and Sarkin Dorgarau (in charge of security). Some of the earliest palace titles are, padawa or Sopada à The chief of palace officer.</p> <p>Gaduma/Adogo – The judge.</p> <p>Unir – ghokuci – Heir to the throne and disciplinary officer.</p> <p>Tulaci/wuzili – Information or protocol officer.</p> <p>Madachi – Treasurer and custodian of the armory and calvary</p> <p>Zhekada – Tax collector</p> <p>Sarkin muma – Judge over land</p> <p>The committed leadership attracted the admiration of Arab and European writers, and remarked that “they were world famous is governance, better than European Asian, or American systems. Ibn Batuta, a famous historian observed in Western and central Sudan in 1352 that;</p> <p>“The Negroes possess some admirable qualities. They are seldomly unjust and have a greater abhorrence of injustice than any other people. Their Emir shows no mercy to anyone who is guilty of the least act. There is complete security in their country. Neither traveler nor inhabitant in it have anything to fear from robbers or men of violence.</p> <p>They do not confiscate the property of any man… They are careful to observe the hours of prayers.”</p> <p>(Okoye 1964:72)</p> <p>The traditional institution was not corrupt, it protected the weak, dealt with criminals particularly aimed robbers and could stop any violent clash.</p> <p>However, the Koro system of government was found under confederal arrangement for sporadic consortium against invaders. In attempt to account for the semi – autonomous nature of the village groups, some information simply submitted that they were kingdom independent of external control and reduced every big settlement into a kingdom.</p> <ul><li>Religion and Festivals</li> </ul> <p>The Koros are dominantly traditional worshippers with every families having its own ancestral shrine. They also have clan shrines (ebe-tukwo), town shrines and individual or town cults and sanctuaries (ashmaukuk). Many pre-colonial polities were purely exercising cultural and religious control over tribes while excluding non-tribe even in the same settlement. Hence, individuals and families paid more respect to their kin and cultural cum religious head. Recently, the influence of Arab traders have firmly establish the religion of Islam. With the dominance of Islam, the Koros are very careful to observe the hours of prayers. Be that as it may, individuals and families paid more allegiance to their kin and cultural cum religious heads.</p> <p>1.7 Festivals</p> <p>Festivals are organized to unite all their kins form far and near. The chief priest is regarded as the ruler of the tribe only, but without defined territory. Ceremonies were some of the arenas for hosting neighbouring groups. Some of these ceremonial are burials, turbaning marriages and animal festivals e.g Ghetiri – Nengwezi, Kebere, Ukodogu, Mwamwa, Usor, Ghokonor and of course, the two most popular festivals “Zhiba – je” “Zhiba means” ‘settlement’ while “je” means ‘beer/ceremony’ put together to mean town festival. It is usually celebrated after the harvest of guinea corn and when the first rain has dropped around March. Till today, the Koros are culturally vibrant. The second intriguing and popular festival is ‘Kuye’.</p> <p>This festival (Kuye) is celebrated to the remembrance of the death of “Najaja”, the great hunter who emancipated the Koros from the shackles of invades and led them to their present location. An antelope must be killed as the festival’s rite, however, some of these festivals have reduced in importance because of the influence of Western education.</p> <ul><li>Geographical Location/Population</li> </ul> <p>The Koros are found in the federal capital territory Abuja (FCT), Niger and Kaduna state respectively. In Kaduna state, they live together in Kagarko local government area (L.G.A). Koro and Jere chiefdoms.</p> <p>In Niger state, they live together in Kuta, Suleija and Chanchaga. In the federal capital territory, they are found or are living in the whole of Bwarri and Abuja municipal area council (AMAC).  The population of the Koro speakers dwelling in Kaduna was given by Barret (1972) as 45,000. There was no estimate for the Koros in Kefi local government, Nassarawa state in Panda, Karu. The population of Koro of Niger state was conservatively put at 150,000 in 2007.</p> <ul><li>Economy</li> </ul> <p>Agriculture is the main stay of Koro economy. Commercial and subsistence farming are what they do most. Yam and maize are the major thing they sell and it is their major articles of trade in their place. The land has varying proportion of Silica, suit, nitrogen and phosphorous. It is alluvial and sticky in the paddy areas and sandy on the up-lands. They make plant grow well. The boom in agricultural production is related to the fertility of the soils. It is interesting to note here that farming in this region is of great antiquity.</p> <p>The ethnobotanical and archaeological findings suggest that farming dates back to 3,000 BC. Therefore, agriculture here doesn’t possess the rich potentialities that belong to it in the other regions. Agricultural produce are sold in a weekly market called “Ija-Koro market”.</p> <ul><li>Marriage System and Rites</li> </ul> <p>Marriage is a necessity to every human society. It is the only formal universal approach to procreation. The Koros make marital negotiations between both party in an highly confidential manner. The bride and the groom are excluded from this arrangement in other to avoid premarital sex and other forms of immorality that may perspire by virtue of their knowledge. Besides, premarital sex is forbidden and frowned at. The bride as a matter of tradition must undergo different physical fitness exercises like, carrying of wood for seven days. This exercise is meant to ascertain her level of fitness.</p> <p>Marriage ceremony in Ija-Koro is usually elaborate, it is accomplished or organized with traditional display of all sorts. It is intriguing that, it may attract the attention of on lookers. The most frightening aspect of this display is the physical combat between young boys of similar weight. Unlike in other parts of Nigeria where marriage is celebrated in the daytime, in Ija-Koro, celebration galore starts at night with intriguing traditional dances. Maiden (s) are no ground to entertain guest with terrific dance step. One distinct thing about their marriage system is that a girl of 14 or 15 may be given out in marriage. Every father in Koro sees it as a pride to witness the marriage of his son. The father may cast a cause on the son if he decided not to marry at the appropriate time.</p> <ul><li>Burial Rites</li> </ul> <p>Death is accompanied just like any other tribes with sorrow and agony. Anytime a person travels to the world beyond, people gather at the village square to sympathize with the family of deceased. Interestingly relatives of the dead come out in mass with different masquerade and these masquerade are traditionally expected till dawn. Before the corpse is deposited in the grave, several processes are involved, first the masquerade jumps over the corpse seven times as farewell message. The body of the corpse will be designed with ashes culturally regarded as “Kaji”. After which a well fashioned clothe called “shachi” is designed for the burial of the corpse. As part of the burial rite, a mortar is placed at the front of deceased’s house, one of his relative sits on it while the corpse is placed at the front of the mortar like a living being. Relatives, friends, sons and grandsons, honour the corpse with money at his forehead. It is expected that, the money will serve the benefit of transport faire to his ancestors. Moreover a masquerade gives a violent shout to indicate or shows readiness for burial. All females are banned from staying outside during the burial proper. Before the female are sent indoor, a group of females traditionally called “Alarache” will bid a farewell to the corpse with their song. A goat and a fowl are slaughtered as burial atonement. The corpse will later be carried shoulder high in readiness for the grave. The specialists known as ‘Abuya’ are waiting by the grave side to do the final part of the burial. At the end, the two of the corpse relatives are called upon to bid the deceased goodbye seven days with dancing and a formal ceremony will be inaugurated as final relecdictory service.</p> <ul><li>Education</li> </ul> <p>The Koros are fairy educated. This is not to say that a limited number of the people are not well educated. However, the acquisition of Islamic education is placed at priority than any other forms of education. The submissiveness and readiness of the Koros to aquire Western education in something to note. Infact, the researchers of this work found as many as possible fluent English speakers. within the native community. Though, these set of people acquire their education outside the community. A survey of Ija-Koro primary school located at Tafa local government of Niger state points vividly to the fact that 65% of Ija-Koro children enroll as a starter in 2008/2009 academic session. This is indeed an evidence of a potential educationally developed community.</p> <p>Niger Congo                                                       Kordofanian</p> <p>Mande               Atlantic Congo</p> <p>Atlantic                              Ijoid                          Volta Congo</p><p>       </p> <p>Kru   Kwa          North        Volta Congo               Benue Congo</p> <p>Defoid       Edoid        Nupoid    Idomoid    Igboid   Cross-River   Bantoid</p> <p>Kanji         Platois</p> <p>Tarokoid<br/>Bernoic      Southern     Indunic    Alumiu    Ninzic   West   East   North</p> <p>Yeskwa                     Gyonic       Koro         Hyamic     Jiju   Tyap   Irigwe<br/>Koro-Zuba                         Koro-Ija                  Jijilic</p> <p><em>Adapted from Roger Blench (2006).</em></p> <p>1.13 DATA COLLECTION</p> <p>The data is collected through contact or informant method.

(Vision accessed 19th Jan, 2010). Phonology is a branch of linguistics which investigates the ways in which sounds are used systematically in different languages to form words and utterances. It is the scientific study of arbitrary vocal symbols used in human speech, and patterns in which symbols enter to produce intelligent, meaningful utterances (Oyebade 2004:2).</p> <p>1.2    Historical Background</p> <p>The history of Kuturmi people has always been associated with migration. There are two sources of the Kuturmi origin. One traditional source says that the people of Kuturmi formerly called ‘the Kutumbawa’ hailed from Daura province in Kastina State. Burdon (1909) allerged, that Baganda who was the grandson of Bayajidda ‘the snake killer of Daura’ was the one that led the Kutumbawa people to capture Kano Empire in the year A.D 499. The second source says that they migrated from Kano city in 1809 AD as a result of jihad wars and ruled Kano Empire between 14th to 18th centuries.</p> <p>The  Kuturmi people were nicknamed after the occupation of their forefather ‘mortal carving by their neighbors. Kuturmi means motar carving called (Sassakan Turmi in Hausa language) while ‘Turmi’ in their language means ‘mortal’. They can be identified among other tribes through their longitudinal marks on their chicks. It was alleged that when Kano empire was over thrown in 1809 AD, the Kuturmi people who were residing in Kano city under the leadership of  Bakutumba of Kutumbawa fled to Sabo village to the west of Kano city from where they migrated southwards in search of refuge. There by passed Zaria to the north and Kauru to South and settled at a village called Kallah Kauru to South and settled at a village called Kallah Kauru District of Kajuru Local Government Areas. On arriving at the place the people  attacked and conquered Kajuru kingdom. The Kuturmi still in search of refuge moved further southward and settled at Iburu in Kufana district from where they moved southward and settled at their present site in Kaduna State. After settling down, their forefathers continued with their traditional rulership constitution under the leadership of ‘Ogumo’ meaning ‘king’ in Kuturmi Language.</p> <p>The headquarters of Kuturmi people was built in Awon village because their speech form has the standard language of the speakers. There are several dialects in the language. They are Anturu, Akama, Ariko, Awon, Asane, Akwando. All these dialects speaks differently from the standard language called Awon,</p> <p>1.3   Socio-Cultural Profile</p> <p>Culture is a shared, learned, symbolic system of values, beliefs and attitudes that shapes and influence perception and behavior. The socio – cultural life of the Kuturmi which among others, mode of dressing, belief of system, marriage and festivals are dicussed bellow:</p> <p>Occupation</p> <p>The major occupation of their forefathers is making of mortal but presently then occupation is mostly farming. Others includes fishing, basket weaving. The farming is carried out in sessions starting with yam, cocoyam, hungryrice, guinea corn and local maize. Today, because of their large lands they produce food crops in commercial quantity for sale.</p> <p>Marriage</p> <p>Marriage in Kuturmi in the olden days was the responsibility of the parents. The parents chose would be wife, for their sons right from the day that female child was born. Gifts of foodstuffs were usually presented at the end of every farming season until she attained marriage age. In the contemporary kuturmi society, the females marry between the ages of seventeen and twenty  (17-20) and their males between twenty one and twenty five (21-25). Their dowry is usually a hen and a pot of local wine called ‘Burukutu’</p> <p> Dressing</p> <p>The Kuturmi men dressed in animal skins and Agwando. The animal skins were usually worn around the waist with another hung covering only one part of the body. The Agwando dress is made from cotton, worn by the male children and adolescence. The women dressed in <em>ture</em> a piece of cloth of about 1.5 meter long and two inches wide, tied around the waist and covering only the essential parts of the women while young girls use leaves. Today men dress simply using flowing gowns while women wear wrappers and blouses with head ties to church or celebrations.</p> <p>Religion</p> <p>The people believes in God, spirits, ancestors, magic and medicinal practices. The religion of the speakers before the coming of Christianity just like any other Nigerian community was essentially traditional but presently they belief in God because they believe that God is the creator and controller of the universe. The name ‘God’ in the language is known as ‘Onung’ meaning the ‘supreme being’ Onung is represented by them as being too holy to be approached directly. Hence, they have devised other means of approaching him. These means serve as mediators and one of such means is through the ‘Okwu’ shrine known as ‘Ujenekwu’ to consult the Supreme Being concerning their problems and the chief priest Ete-kwu’ normally leads them in performing the rituals required for them.</p> <p>The spirit means ‘Ushari’ they are said to constitute a world of their own and live as humans with organized form of life and authority. Some are associated with protection while others with destruction. The protective ones are harmless while destructive ones are called ‘red or black’ depending on the degree of destruction. They cause illness and death to people. The speakers and strangers are not allowed to visit such places especially at noon.</p> <p>The general name for ancestors is ‘Okwu’, both male and female ancestors. They are believed to be interested in the affairs of the living members of their families. Ancestors are worshipped on sessional basis especially after the harvest and at the start of rainy seasons. Individual families organize generational ceremonies known as ‘Umuroso’ for those that died at very old age.</p> <p>Agricultural Resources</p> <p>The vegetation of the area falls under the guinea savannah type with prominent feature of tall grasses called ‘elephant grasses’. Among the natural resources of the people are timber, palm produce, agricultural products such as ginger, maize, millet, yam, and cassava.</p> <p>1.4   Geographical Location</p> <p>Kuturmi land is located on latitude 9.5 degree north and 10 degrees south and on longitude 7.5 degrees east and 8.0 degree west. The region lies to the western part of Kachia district headquarters. The region is bounded by the river Gwarara to the east and south where hippopotamus are found and to the north and west by Kadara tribe. In the northern part of the region is a range of hills called ‘Apan-okung and at the central location is another range of mountains called Kankan hills. The kilometers between Kachia Local Government to Awon village where the standard language of the speakers is spoken, is about 20 kilometers (20kms).</p> <p>1.5   Genetic Classification of Kuturmi Language</p> <p>A genetic classification is a sub-group of all relevant languages into genetic nodes, meaning group of languages in each of which one language is more closely related to the other than to any language inside the group. Therefore, genetic classification is based on the assumption that languages have diverged from common ancestors and the method used in classifying them is based on the resemblances found in elements of languages.</p> <p>According to Ruhlen (1987: 1) ‘the idea that groups of languages that share certain systematic resemblance have inherited those similarities from a common origin, is the basis for ‘genetic classification’. Therefore, Kuturmi language can be classified under Kada sub-group of Benue Congo.</p> <p><em>Source: Ruhein (1987: 1).</em></p> <p>1.6  Scope and Organization of Study</p> <p>This research work describes the aspects of Kuturmi phonology. It examines the sound system and patterns of Kuturmi language and the phonological process that are found in the language.</p> <p>Chapter one focuses on the historical background, geographical location, socio-cultural profile, genetic classification as well as the theoretical framework for the study. The research methodology used is also included in this chapter. Chapter two presents the sounds, types of syllable and syllable processes of Kuturmi language. It also deals with the charts of both consonant and vowel sounds. Chapter three examines the phonological processes like assimilation, deletion, insertion, nasalization and vowel harmony that are attested in the language. Chapter four presents the tone and tonological processes of the language. It also gives detailed information on the types of tone attested in Kuturmi language. Chapter five concludes and summarizes the work. Further findings and recommendations are also included in this chapter.</p> <p>1.7   Theoretical Framework</p> <p>The theoretical framework adopted for this research work is Generative Phonology (GP). This theoretical framework is a theory that builds on the insights of taxonomic phonemics while remodeling the focus of phonological analysis. Generative Phonology focuses on three fundamental issues in language which are linguistic intuition, foreign accent and speech error. The goal of this theoretical framework is to express the link between sounds and utterance that are present in a language. Generative phonology view speech as sequences of discrete segments which are complex of a particular set of phonetic features and  the simultaneous and sequential combinations of these features are subjects to a set of specific constraint found in this research work.</p> <p>Hyman (1975:19) describes generative phonology as the description of how phonological rules can be converted into phonological representation and to capture the distinctive sounds in contrast in a language. Therefore, in this research work, we shall consider how phonological representation is converted into phonetic representation through phonological rules.</p> <p>According to (kenstowicz 1994:8), phonetic representation indicates how the lexical items are to be realized in speech. Sommerstein (1977:115) also says that it is characterized by ‘a degree of narrowness such that any two sounds that are distinguished in any human language are differently represented. For example, in Yoruba language, we have words like;</p> <p>[ìjàwó]       ‘Wife’</p> <p>[ajé]          ‘world’</p> <p>[כmכ]          ‘child’</p> <p>The phonetic representations are  [ ìjàwó] ,  [ ajé ], [כmכ]</p> <p>  Structure of Generative of  Phonology</p> <p>According to Oyebade (2004:11), generative phonology assumes three general components. The underlying representation, the phonetic representation and the phonological rules. Generative phonology proposes that utterances can be profitably analysed based on two levels of representations which are underlying level called ‘UR’ and phonetic or surface level.</p> <p>Phonological Representation</p> <p>Oyebade (2004:11) says phonological or underlying representation is assumed to be an abstract representation existing in the linguistic competence of the native speakers. At this level, items with variant meanings have identical representations. For instance, the forms of negation prefix in English language having the same meaning are accounted for:</p> <p>e.g.   (indirect)  in    __       /indərəkt/</p> <p>(illegible)          il    ___     / iledзebl/</p> <p>(impossible)       ir    ___      /impƆsəbl/</p> <p>(incomplete)       iŋ    ___     /iŋkכmpli:t/</p> <p>(imbalance) im  ___      /imbæləns/</p> <p>Phonological Rules</p> <p>Phonological rules are directives which join underlying forms on the surface forms. As Hyman (1975) points out, they are derivational sequence of items from an underlying level to a phonetic level. They are regarded as predictable rules. For example, the data below in Yoruba language shows how phonological rules assimilate nasal segment to the place of articulation of the following segment.</p> <ul><li>ń-bò ḿbƆ  ‘is   coming’</li> </ul> <p>ń -bà ḿbà   ‘is   perching’</p> <ul><li>ń -tò ńtò ‘is    arranging’</li> </ul> <p>ń -tà ńtá    ‘is   selling’</p> <p>3)     ń- kí     ήkí    ‘is   greeting’</p> <p>ń- kà ήkà    ‘is    reading’</p> <p>Three rules are accounted for in this phenomenon.</p> <p>Rule 1. An alveolar  nasal becomes a bilabial nasal before a voiced bilabial stop at morpheme boundary.</p> <p>ŋ→m  -b [+nas] _   +cons          +cons                                   -cont</p> <p>+ant                +ant                                        +ant</p> <p>+cor                  -cor                                         -cor</p> <p>+nas     +nas            +voiced                                Rule 2. An alveolar  nasal becomes an alveolar nasal before a morpheme, beginning with a voiceless alveolar stop.</p> <p>n→n −   t [+nas]       +cons               +cons                              +cont</p> <p>+ant             +ant                              +ant</p> <p>+cor               +cor                       +cor                     +nas               +nas                               -voiced</p> <p>Rule 3. An alveolar  nasal changes to velar nasal velar it occurs at morpheme boundary before a velar  stop.</p> <p>n→ŋ  −  k [+nas] ___      +cons         +cons                         +cont</p> <p>+ant              -ant                      −ant</p> <p>+cor            -cor                      −cor</p> <p>                                           +nas                +nas               -voiced  </p> <p> Distinctive Features</p> <p>Halle and Clements (2004:22) point out that the sets of articulatory and acoustic features sufficient to define and distinguish one from the other is the great majority of the speech sounds used in languages of the world. This theory of phonological features is concerned with the discovery and explanation of generalization about the phonological behavior of phonological segments both in isolation, in sequence or as member of a segment. There are two major criteria that potential features must meet to be admitted as distinctive features. These criteria are phonetic specifiability and morphophonemic relevance. On the basis of these criteria, generative phonologists identified twenty distinctive features as the only linguistically relevant features of the human vocal production which can be loosely classified in terms of :</p> <ul><li>Major class features (syllabic, consonantal, sonorant)</li> <li>Place of articulation features (anterior, coronal, labial).</li> <li>Tongue body features (high, low, back, ATR/ tense).</li> <li>Manner of articulation feature (continuant)</li> <li>Lip feature (rounded).</li> <li>Acoustic feature (strident).</li> <li>State of glottis feature (voiced, spread, constricted).</li> <li>Others (nasals, laterals, distributed).</li> </ul> <p>For instance, in Yoruba language, the following feature can be used to distinguished vowels with the use of binary features that is, to determine if a sound is present or absent.</p> <p>1.8.1   Data Collection</p> <p>Samarin (1965:45) says that the kind of corpus a field researcher obtains is determined by the purpose and the techniques he adopts in his data. The two types of data collection methods suggested by Samarian are the informant method and introspective method. The informant method and frame technique was used in this research while the native speaker served as a source of information as well as the means of evaluation of all sounds and tones present in the language. The introspective method involves the linguist serving as his/her informant. It describes a situation whereby the linguist, or investigator is working on his/her native or second language. The two informants that kindly engaged in the development of this project are Mr Jonathan Shekarau (42years old), an assistant headmaster in kuturmi and Mr Sunday Dogo Danmadammi (32years old) headmaster.</p> <p>1.8.2   Data Analysis</p> <p>All the data obtained in the language were written, transcribed and recorded using a sixty minute cassette and a tape recorder in the evenings after their farming work. The classification of the data was done through parts of speech namely: Nouns, Verbs, Adverbs, Adjectives, Prepositions, Pronouns, and Conjunctions. All these reflect parts of the body, household items kinship terms, colour terms, numerals. We also analyzed information through frame techniques.</p> <p>1.9.1   Phonemes</p> <p>Phonemes are sounds that constitutes a difference in the meaning of words in a language. Its an abstracts linguistic unit that brings about a change in a given language. Phonemes can be identified in three ways namely, minimal pars, complementary distribution and analogous environment. For instance in minimal pairs of  English language, phonemes are members of the smallest unit of sound that serves to distinguish one utterance from another. e.g.  /bat/, /hat/, /cat/, /rat/. The four words change in meaning at the initial position. Therefore, the phonemes are /b/, /h/, /c/ and /r/.</p> <p>1.9.2   Allophones</p> <p>According to Ladefoged (1993:40), ‘the variants of the phoneme that occur in detailed phonetic transcription are known as ‘allophones’. They are generated as a result of applying the phonological rules to the segments in the underlying forms of words. It can also be described as conditional variants of phoneme generated by phonological conditioning. They are usually represented in a squared brackets. For example in English language allophones are derived from voiceless alveolar fricative that is phoneme /s/. Observe the data below:</p> <ol><li>Lip – s     ‘lips’</li> </ol> <p>KLp  – s   ‘kLps’</p> <p>ræt   – s    ‘rats’</p> <ol><li>rib – z    ‘ribs’</li> </ol> <p>rכɖ    – z   ‘rods’</p> <p>ræg   – z   ‘rags’</p> <ol><li>æʃ – iz     ‘ashes’</li> </ol> <p>dʒ^dʒ  -iz     ‘judges’</p> <p>ʧʒ:ʧ      -iz     ‘churches’</p> <p>From the example above, the plural suffix in (1) remains voiceless if  the preceding consonant is voiceless while in (2 and 3) the plural suffix changes to voiced if the preceding consonant is voiced. The allophones in the data are [z] and [iz]. derived from phoneme /s/.</p> <p>[z]- before voiced sounds</p> <p>/S/                      [iz]- before voiced sound                                   </p>\n\nASPECTS OF KUTURMI PHONOLOGY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASPECTS OF KUTURMI PHONOLOGY", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0    General Background of the Study</p> <p>Language is the fabrics that ties every member of the society together, which serves as an instrument used by man for specific and distinguishable purposes. Indeed, the focus of this research is to shed light on how verb phrases are formed in Migili language. Therefore, the first chapter of this research is focused on the genetic classification of Migili language. As an introductory chapter, attempts shall be made to trace the origin, socio-cultural profile, administrative system, religion, geographical location, topography (life zone) economy, marriage rites, map, genetic classification of Migili. Effort shall also be extended to the organization of the study, theoretical framework together with a review of the chosen theory, data collection and analysis and some syntactic concept.</p> <p>According to Crystal (1994: 420) syntax is the study of the rules governing the way words are combined to form grammatical sentences in contrast with morphology that studies word structure. This branch of linguistics is concerned with how words are combined to form phrases are sentences in a rule governed manner. In a nutshell, words are not together in a random order, they follow certain observable patterns in any language.</p> <p>1.1    Historical Background of Migili</p> <p>Migili refers to the name of a language and also a group of people. The Migili people constitute about 96% of the total population of Agyaraoju Obi Local Government, Nasarawa State in Nigeria; with a total population of about 18,000.</p> <p>History has it that different tribes including Migili, Alago, Eggon all settled at Korofa Kingdom in Taraba state. It was said that a man named Akuka was denied the right to the throne and as a result had to leave Kororofa together with some other members of the Migili tribe to a place called Ukari and later to Lafia region. Some of them moved to Abuja, Minna in Niger State, Kubacha in Kaduna state.</p> <p>The Eggon tribe are also neighbours of the Migilis with some of them having the knowledge of Migili language.</p> <p>Today, Migili language has various alternate names such as: Higili, Migili, Koro of Lafia.</p> <p>1.2    Socio-Cultural Profile</p> <p>Like most communities around them, the socio-cultural background of the people of Migili include: Occupation, Religion, Festival, Mode of Dressing, Marriage.</p> <p>1.2.1 Occupation</p> <p>The Migilis are farmers to the core. Yam is the major cash crop that is being produced in the area. Some other agricultural produce include guinea corn, maize, millet, groundnut, and beans. However, they also engage in wearing and artistic works. The land has varying proportion of nitrogen and phosphorus, it is sandy on the up land, it makes plant grow well, agricultural product are sold in the market called Migili market once in a week.</p> <p>1.2.2 Religion</p> <p>The Migili people are predominantly Christians. Before the coming of the missionaries, the Migilis’ were traditional worshippers who had belief in ancestral gods. By the coming of Christianity, a lot of people who were traditional worshippers became converts and embraced Christianity.</p> <p>1.2.3 Festival</p> <p>One major festival in Migili land is the Odu masquerade festival. The Odu masquerade is dressed in colourful masks and displays great dancing skills with spectacular dancing skills and beautiful dance steps. According to the people, Odu was the god of war and it is believed that he helped the people win battles, equipping them with magical and spiritual powers which made them unconquerable. In every village in Migili, there is a small building built for the Odu masquerade around which he will dance for three (3) days.</p> <p>1.2.4 Mode of Dressing</p> <p>The people of Migili are fashionable people. These are people who still preserve the tradition of their ancestors and their rich culture. In the olden days, both male and female were usually seen wearing bracelet, cowries, beads. Another distinguishing feature of the Migilis’ was the plaiting of head by both men and women.</p> <p>Nowadays, civilization plays a significant role in the mode of dressing of the people as most of them especially the younger ones now dress into western manner.</p> <p>1.2.5 Marriage</p> <p>Before the coming of the missionaries into the Migili society marriage was done by the father of the boy approaching the mother of the girl (from birth) and paying a token amount of money to her parents. Once this has been done the girl was said to be betrothed and will continue to live with her parents until she gets about fifteen (15) years of age. The boy pays his first installment of her dowry and farms for the father-in-law once every year.</p> <p>Today marriage are done in churches and unlike before women are free to choose their groom and are not mandated to marry from their society alone.</p> <p>1.3    Genetic Classification</p> <p>According to Greenberg (1966: 8) African languages belong to various families, and there are four main groups. These groups are: Niger Kordofania, Nilo Sahara, Afro-Asiatic and Khoisan.</p> <p>DIAGRAMATIC REPRESENTATION OF GENETIC CLASSIFICATION OF IJAKORO LANGUAGE</p> <p>1.4    Scope and Organization of Study</p> <p>This research is aimed at discussing the general overview of verb phrase in Migili language. This research work is divided into five chapters which are relevant aspects of the theory of syntax.</p> <p>Chapter one which is the introductory part includes the historical background, socio-cultural profile, the scope and organization of study as well the theoretical framework, the data collection method and data analysis and lastly, a brief review of the chosen framework.</p> <p>Chapter two shall focus on sound inventory, the basic syntactic concept such as phrase structure rule, lexical categories, basic word order and the sentence types.</p> <p>Chapter three contains the main aspect of the study which is the verb phrase. In this chapter the nature of verb phrase in Migili language and the processes that are attested will be discussed.</p> <p>Chapter four will examine the transformational processes such as focusing, relativization, relfexivization, passivisation and question formation.</p> <p>Chapter five which is the last chapter will present a brief summary of the whole research and also the conclusion and recommendation based on such finding.</p> <p>1.5    Theoretical Framework</p> <p>The theory to be adopted in this research is the government and binding theory in the analysis of Verb Phrase in Migili language.</p> <p>1.6    Data Collection</p> <p>This research is made possible through the bi-lingual language helper. However, the Ibadan four hundred word list and some sentence constructions are used to extract necessary information from the language helpers (informants) The method of collection was through direct translation from English to Migili language. The language helper speaks Migili, English, Hausa, and Eggon.</p> <p>Mr. Ayuba Osibi Haruna one of the language helper is a typist in the local government secretariat, Agyaragu Obilocal government. Also, Revered Albert, a man of God in Agyaragu.</p> <p>1.7    Data Analysis</p> <p>Statistically, about one hundred and fifty sentences were collected from the native speaker. In order to have accurate analysis for this research, the Ibadan four hundred wordlist with an equivalent meaning of the item in Migili language was used.</p> <p>Also, the frame technique used in his research is by framing of sentences in English language and the translation of these sentences into Migili language by the informant. This enables the researcher to determine the actual underlying form of a word, constituent and possible syntactic classes to which each word belongs to in Migili language.</p> <p>1.8    Review of the Chosen Framework</p> <p>The theory to be used in the analysis of Verb Phrase in Migili language is the Government and Binding theory (GB). This theory is a modular deductive theory of universal grammar which posits multiple level of representation related by the transformational rule. However, it is a more advanced theory of universal grammar. Sanusi (1996:19-21).</p> <p>Again, Sanusi (1996: 21) explained that government and binding theory greatly eliminates proliferation of transformational rules like passive, affix, hoping verb-number agreement, question formation, equi-NP deletion, raising permutation, insertion etc.</p> <p>Hegman (1991: 13) defined government and binding theory as a theory of universal grammar which is the system of all the principles that are common to all human languages. Government and binding theory is otherwise known as principle and parameter theory.</p> <p>In government and binding theory, the grammar is a continuous interaction between component and sub-theories embodying different principle and parameters.</p> <p>Government and binding theory operate through the modules of grammar like government, case, theta control, binding, bounding, and X-bar theory.</p> <p>1.8.1 Sub-Theories of Government and Binding</p> <p>Horrock (1987: 29) stated that, the core grammar of a given language is derived from the interaction of sub-theories of universal grammar. These sub-theories are inter-related that each of them can account for grammaticality or ungrammaticality of any sentence. These sub-theories are: X-bar theory, case theory, government theory, control theory, binding theory, bounding theory and the theta theory.</p> <p>The above listed sub-theories are diagrammatically represented below to show the inter-relationship among them.</p> <p>MODULAR THEORY OF GRAMMAR</p> <p>X-BAR Theory</p> <p>                                                ECP</p> <p>                                                Control</p> <p>                                                Binding</p><p>            PHONETIC FORM     LOGICAL FORM  </p> <p><em> (Adapted from Cook (1988: 33).</em></p> <p>X-bar Theory</p> <p>Based on appropriate analysis, for this research work, X-bar is the theory to be adopted for comprehensive analysis.</p> <p>According to Chomsky (1981) “the X-bar theory is the central module of the principles and paramenters approach in syntax”.</p> <p>Also, Haegeman (1994) says that the X-bar theory is the part of grammar regulating the structure of a phrase.</p> <p>The core of X-bar theory is the recognition of the fact that phrasal constituents have ‘head’ upon which the other elements of the constituents in question are dependent. (Horrocks 1987: 63) He submits that items which are involved in sub-categorization and which are in most cases interrupted as arguments of the head, appear with the head X in a phrasal category X-bar. X-bar is called a phrasal ‘projection’ of head, in this case the smallest constituent X as a sub-constituent (Horrocks, 1987: 64).</p> <p>From the above, the cover symbol ‘X’ stands for the set of lexical categories which head phrases, as in V (for verb), N (for noun), Adj (for adjective), P (for preposition), Adv (for adverb), such that N heads NP, V heads VP, P heads PP, Adj heads Adjp and Adv heads Advp. This implies that phrasal categories e.g. VP, PP, NP, AP all have heads that belong to the same category as the phrasal category (Akmajian, 2001: 215).</p> <p>Again, Horrocks (1987) explains that X-theory periods principles for the projection of phrasal categories from lexical categories and imposes conditions of hierarchical organization of categories in the form of general schemata. Thus, the general phrase structure rule schema for phrasal categories would be: XP     à      X        Comp.</p> <p>Where ‘comp’ which stands for complement could be a ‘PP’ or an ‘NP’ with ‘X’ standing for a lexical category e.g. P. N, V etc. This implies that when ‘X’ represents ‘N’, it means that ‘XP’ is an ‘NP’, when ‘X’ represents ‘V’, then ‘XP’ is a ‘VP’ and so on.</p> <p>In summary, the major concern of the X-bar theory is to describe the syntactic and formal structures of phrases and the inherent general characteristics they have in common.</p> <p>1.9    Case Theory</p> <p>According to Horrocks (1987: 102), “case theory deals with the principle of case assignment to constituents”.</p> <p>Yusuf (1998: 26) defines case theory as a theory that deals with the forms that NPs take in different syntactic environments.</p> <p>Basically, the assignment of case is done under government theory in which the choice of case is determined by the governor.</p> <p>Yusuf went further to say that adjacency is required for case assignment. This means, case assignees and the assignors must be contiguous with no barrier blocking the discharge of the (Abstract) case.</p> <p>He also makes it clear that, case assignor are always head of their phrases and are adjacent to the complements that receive the case (pg. 28).</p> <p>The implication is that, a verb cannot assign any case to prepositional phrase as there is an NP barrier. That blocks such a transfer.</p> <p>The three common case under Government and Binding theory are:</p> <ul><li>Nominative case assigned by tensed INFL</li> <li>Accusative case assigned by verb</li> <li>Oblique case assigned by prepositions</li> </ul> <p>1.10  Theta Ө Theory</p> <p>Another module under GB theory is theta theory. The submission of this theory is that a lexical category will have Ө attributes either as assigner or assignee.</p> <p>Horrocks (1987: 101-107) says Ө-theory is concerned with the assignment of what Chomsky called ‘thematic’ roles to sentential constituents. By thematic roles, Chomsky means thematic assignment called semantic roles such as agent, patient, etc. It is assumed that these are assigned to the complements of lexical items as a lexical property.</p> <p>For example:</p> <p>Play the ball on the pitch</p> <p>The NP complement “the ball” is assigned the role of patient or theme while the PP complement is assigned the role of location.</p> <p>In all, the fundamental task of Ө-theory is to determine the circumstances (i.e. the syntactic position) occupied by an NP as well as the governor of such position in the sentence.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <p>The goalkeeper threw the ball to the opponent</p> <p>The goalkeeper      à      subject</p> <p>The ball                 à      Direct object</p> <p>The opponent        à      Indirect object</p> <p>The main principle of Ө-theory is Ө criterion which requires each thematic role to be uniquely assigned. Each argument bears one and only one Ө-role and Ө-role is assigned to one and only one argument. Yusuf (1998: 124).</p> <p>The commonly expressed roles are agents, theme, instrument, locative (goal, source, direction) and a few more.</p> <p>Yusuf stresses further that, participants are assigned these roles in the D-structure, whatever it is, the V or P assigned Ө-roles to their governed complement while the VP assigns a role to be subject NP.</p> <p>The thrust of Ө-criterion is that every argument (be it subject, direct or indirect object) must have a Ө-role.</p> <p>1.11  Binding Theory</p> <p>Madjaer (1991: 46) refers to binding theory as a theory that is concerned with the systematic domain in which NP can and cannot be constructed as co-referential.</p> <p>Yusuf (1998: 45) in his own view states that binding theory is concerned with the relationships of NP participants in the sentence. Precisely, binding theory shows how NP can be related to another NP.</p> <p>Chomsky (1988: 520) submits that binding theory deals with the connection among Noun Phrases that have to do with such semantic properties as dependence or reference, including the connection between the pronouns and its antecedents.</p> <p>The implication of the above definition is that, binding theory deals with the co-referential relationship among NPs in the same sentence. That is, how NPs co-referred or co-indexes one another in a simple sentence.</p> <p>NPs that are argument are assumed to fall into one of these three categories:</p> <ul><li>Anaphors</li> <li>Pronominal</li> <li>Referential expressions</li> </ul> <p>Anaphors</p> <p>These are NP types that must have antecedents they depend on one for existence in some definite place in the sentence. Reciprocals and reflexive pronouns fall under this class e.g.</p> <p>Ade hurts himself</p> <p>“Himself” in the above sentence refers back to Ade, therefore Ade is the antecedent which licensed its existence.</p> <p>Pronominal</p> <p>These are NPs that lack specific lexical content and have only the features; person, number, gender and case they either refer to individuals independently or co-refer to the individuals already mentioned in a given sentence. E.g.</p> <p>Bola greeted her mother.</p> <p>“Her” may refer to the individual denoted by Bola, or another individual not mentioned in the sentence.</p> <p>Referential Expression</p> <p>These are NPs lexical heads which potentially refer to something.  A referential expression is also known as R-e</p>\n\nASPECTS OF MIGILI VERB PHRASE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASPECTS OF MIGILI VERB PHRASE", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</em></p> <p>1.0   INTRODUCTION</p> <p>This chapter is centered on the introductory part of the whole essay. It shows brief historical background of the Yukuben language speakers. As a matter of introduction to a general survey of the study of the Yukuben language morphology, on attention is drawn to the family head of the various sub-sections of the language which is the Jokon. Yukuben is closely related to the Kogon and as a matter of fact, reviewing the genetic classification of Africa languages, Yukuben is a language from the Jokonoid family. The Yukuben are majorly found in the eastern edge of Nigeria, which is in the Western part of Africa (West Africa).</p> <p>This chapter will give the reader a brief introduction on the speakers of Yukuben language and the language itself. The historical background of the language and its speakers, genetic classification, the method used in getting our data for analysis and lots more are some things that will be treated in this chapter.</p> <p>1.1   HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE YUKUBEN</p> <p>The Yukuben were said to have migrated from a village called ‘Ideu’ in Taraba in the North  neighbouring Cameroon. That was several years ago. They claimed to have been in existence before the death of Jesus Christ (BC). This movement was said to have been caused by the British merchant. These merchants trade on slaves. They buy slaves in thousands, claim them and lead them to their heavy ships, where they will be taken to Britain where they will be used as slaves to work in their sugar cane farms. The name Yukuben means “the child in which the spirit lives” or “a spiritual being”.</p> <p>A female slave refused to work, so the British slave trader ordered her to be beaten. While beating the female slave, a swain of bee busted out from no where and sting all the slave traders. With this, they believe God was on their side and the other slaves believed God his living in them.</p> <p>Another version indicates that the Yukuben migrated from their initial kingdom due to the on-ending territorial war with the Kuteb. The Kuteb claimed to be the owner of the territory and that the Yukuben should leave and find or create their own territory. The only solution to this misunderstanding then, was that the  Yukuben should leave the Koteb territory which they later did after a lot of pressure.</p> <p>The native speakers of Yukuben refers to themselves as Uhomkiji. They believe this should be their real name. They call also be called names like Nyikobeu, Nyikobe, Ayikibeu, Boritsu, Balaabe, Balaabeu, Oohom, Uohom, Uuhom-Gigi and Uhomkhegi.</p> <p>The interaction they had with other neighbouring communities brought different languages to the Yukuben community. They call these languages stranger languages. Lufu, Malam-SLie, and Kapia are some of these stranger languages. They are said to have migrated from the Jokon speaking communities.</p> <p>Apart from the territorial misunderstanding that splitted the Yukuben people from the Koteb, there arouse another misunderstanding that led to another blood shedding war. This war was majorly on leadership and chieftaincy titled. The Kuteb claimed to be the head over the Yukuben people. They wanted to have the king while the Yukuben should be lead by an ordinary chief. The Kuteb does not want the Yukuben to have a king of theirs so as to keep their own territory as the headquarter and have the central head.</p> <p>1.2   GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND POPULATION</p> <p>The Yukuben are particularly located in the Northern part of Nigeria, in West Africa. They are regionally located in the North West province; Taraba state to be precise. In Taraba state, the speakers of this language are located in Takom local government area, between Katstina Ala-and Gawana rivers. The speakers are found in more than 20 villages in Nigeria and few villages in Cameroon.</p> <p>Cameroon is the second country with the highest member of speakers of Yukuben language. with three hours, we can get to Cameroon from Taraba state in Nigeria.</p> <p>As given by “Ethnologue:- Languages of the World”, in 1992, the speakers of Yukuben language had a total population of 15,000 in Nigeria only and about 1,000 in Cameroon. In 1994, another population census was conducted, and the result given was that, the speakers of this language was 23,000 in Nigeria and 2,000 in Cameroon and other countries of the world. We had another census,  and the native speakers of Yukuben language claimed to have increased. As given by the informant, he said they are now more than 500,000.</p> <p>As a result of inter-tribal marriages, the population of the speakers of Yukuben language increased. With this, the population of the native speakers of Yukuben language; according to the first report, was about 25,000, while the later report which was a recent report which could be probably be present approximated population of the Yukuben says it has increased to half a million.</p> <p>Below is a map showing the geographical location of the speakers of Yukuben language.</p> <p>1.3   GENETIC CLASSIFICATION</p> <p>Yukuben language belongs to the Niger-Kordofanian family by the way of the African language classification. Other classes of language family are Nilo Saharan, Khoisan, and the Afro-Asiatic families. Niger Kordofanian is a family of the sub-Saharan African language. it has about 100,000,000 speakers of different languages.</p> <p>Some linguists argues that the Benue Congo in which Yukuben belong and the Kwa language family belong to the same group, that is a single branch of the Niger Congo family. Nevertheless, for the sake of this study, Yukuben is known as a Benue Congo group of languages according to Comrie (1987).</p> <p>In conclusion, Yukuben is genetically classified as a version of one of the Benue Congo group and finally traced up to the Niger-Kordofanian family of the African languages classification.</p> <p>Below is a diagram illustrating the genetic classification of Yukuben language.</p> <p>Niger Kordofanian</p><p>       </p> <p>Niger Congo                                                               Kordofanian</p><p>       </p> <p>West Atlantic  Mande Gur  Kwa    Benue Congo  Adamawa   Ubangian</p><p>       </p> <p>Plateau                              Jukunoid           Cross River Bantoid</p> <p>Yukuben</p> <p>1.4   SOCIO-LINGUISTIC PROFILE</p> <p>The Yukuben speaking community has peculiarities as far as occupation is concerned, with close relationship with the family head of Yukuben language at Kuteb. There is a close link between them and among most of the speakers of all the languages emanating from Kuteb.</p> <p>With the few relationship the Yukuben had with the Kuteb before they splitted, their social life was affected and they took on some socio-cultural characteristics or features of the Kuteb people.</p> <p>There is a concentration of the Yukuben language speaking community on farming. This is the major occupation found in the community. Large percentage of the language speakers are involved in farming. Farming of several forms, such as crop farming like, tuber (yam, cassava etc.),grains (rice, guinea corn, maize, etc.) and little vegetables (okro, pepper, etc.).</p> <p>Some minorities among the speakers are also involved in some other occupation, apart from farming, such as trading either within their immediate community or outside their community, but it is common among the women.</p> <p>Others are found in blacksmithing, carpentry, hunting, bricklaying and weaving which is dominated by women. As western education gained prominence, the language speakers also found themselves in teaching, engineering works, and other professions.</p> <p>Equally, the Yukuben language speaking society is known for certain social lives. They are known to be good Christians, but there are still groups of people who are still deeply rooted in paganism in the form of masquerades. Kukyib is the major masquerade they worship. This festival is performed annually in remembrance of the dead relatives who are said to come from heaven to visit the earth and bestow blessings on the living. They also believe the masquerade protects and blesses them.</p> <p>Before the introduction of Christianity in the early 20th century, the masquerade festival also came with circumcision (Kamang). This circumcision festival is called Kukyib-Kamang. From ages 10 – 15 years, they believe they should be circumcised. The introduction Christianity did some abolition to these practices. We are also told some Yukuben speaking communities are still circumcising their female children.</p> <p>Today, Christianity is said to be the second religion after idols and paganism to the native speakers of Yukuben language. They believe in idols like Oogun for protection against witchcrafts, Klumia protects them against thieves and his also known as their god of thunder.</p> <p>Some of the peculiar native meals of the Yukuben are boiled maize, guinea-corn, boiled cassava, yam, plantain and rice. Their major meal is made from rice. They enjoy eating over-boiled rice which all refer to it as Banana. Beasen; this is the only known wine to all Yukuben. This wine is a local wine, made from guinea-corn and it is also called Burukutu.</p> <p>1.4.1        DRESSING</p> <p>In the olden days, the Yukuben people wear leaves, and the back of trees. They cover their nakedness with this. The women fashion leaves to cover their nudity and the men uses the back of tree which must have been beaten to soften and make it tender. They tie it round their waist. It is called Isang.</p> <p>The British colonial masters had a great influence on these people and Nigeria at large. They brought real wears to Nigeria and the Yukuben. They were shown how to get cotton and weave. Now, weaving is one of the major occupations done by women in any Yukuben speaking community. Ukya, this is the name given to any weaved cloth (Ofi).</p> <p>1.4.2 FUNERALS</p> <p>The Yukuben also have their own custom of burial and funerals at various kinds. Like the Hausa speaking communities, they do their funerals in the Islamic manner while the Yukuben people have their own according to the Christians.</p> <p>1.4.3        MARRIAGE</p> <p>Marriage is another ceremony observed traditionally by the Yukuben. For the introductory part of the wedding ceremony, the mate family will provide palm-oil in a calabash and a cock to the in-laws. Later, bush meats like grass-cutter will be taken to the family. After the approval, a date will be chosen for the main wedding. The male family will make wine, Beasan, and put honey in it and drink as they celebrate.</p> <p>1.5   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The data used for analysis in this long essay are collected through competent bilingual informant of Yukuben language. Major parts of the information were gotten through a personal contact. The informants are not only from one district of the language division, so as to give room for adequate analysis.</p> <p>Since this work is aimed at the study of Yukuben morphology, all data collected either through personal contact or questionnaire is morphologically analyzed. The analysis was made in the direction of description purely, some of which are derivational analysis, word formation processes; especially the processes that are attested in the formation of words in Yukuben language.</p> <p>1.6   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study essentially corners the aspects of morphology of Yukuben language alone. For further explanation of the word structure of the language some syntactic analysis are made. It equally includes a brief phonological analysis as the case demands; take for instance, a consideration of the segmental and supra-segmental phonemic relationship in the arrangement of morpheme, especially the tonal system as it relates to the language.</p> <p>1.7   ORGANIZATION OF STUDY</p> <p>This long essay is divided into five different chapters. Each chapter treats different aspect of the essay.</p> <p>Chapter one centers on the introductory part. It treats the general background of the study. The language and it’s speakers. Within this chapter, we have the historical background of the language and its speakers. Their socio-linguistic profiles, genetic classification, population and geographical location. It also shows how the data was collected and analyzed.</p> <p>Chapter two deals with basic morphological and phonological concepts. These concepts include the meaning of morphology itself, types of morphemes, the structural function and position of morphemes.</p> <p>Chapter three gives an explicit explanation of the two major types of morphemes in relation to the language of study. Chapter four is referred to as the main body of the essay. It is this chapter we will be able to analyze the collected data comprehensively. It gives the basic morphological processes relating them to the language of study.</p> <p>The last chapter, which is chapter five, will cover the concluding part of the essay. A brief summary of this essay will be done in this chapter.</p>\n\nASPECTS OF YUKUBEN MORPHOLOGY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\"

class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL BACKGROUND</p> <p>Linguistics over the years has been defined as the scientific study of language.  However, studying language scientifically entails the study of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics of a language so as to get empirical and sufficient facts/data, carry them out, experiment and process them, then formalize a rule to form linguistically significant generalization about such language.</p> <p>The above mentioned levels of linguistics are referred to as core linguistics by YULE in that, they as the level at which the structure of any language whatsoever can be studied, analysed and determined.  Hence in this project work, my main objective is to examine one of the five attested level of language which deals with the arrangement of words (phrases) to form sentences (i.e. SYNTAX) and my focus will be on question formation.  An aspect which deals with how questions are formed/asked.</p> <p>This chapter will introduce the historical background of mernyang people, their socio-cultural profile and the genetic classification of the language.  This chapter also discusses the scope and organization of the study, the theoretical frame work used for our analysis and the review of the chosen frame work.</p> <p>1.1     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</p> <p>Oral tradition and history has it that the mernyang people are descendants of Kofyar people who lived on the hills in Qua’an pan Local government area of plateau state.</p> <p>Kofyar people are said to have migrated from Dada village in Kano State and the settlement was founded by Dofyar and nade his sister who were both great hunters.</p> <p>On the account of their settlement in Kofyar, Dofyar and Nade are said to engage in hunting expendition when they found themselves on the hills in the northern plateau.  Due to the beauty and attractiveness of the hills, Dofyar and Nade decided not to go back to Dada (Kano-State) which was their original hometown, but stayed back and made an abode for themselves on the hills.</p> <p>After many years, the offsprings of those great hunters grew into a large community and saw reasons for them to engage in farming to complement their original and major occupation of hunting.  Due to the nature of the hills, some of the people had to come down from the hills to create a better abode for themselves on the plain surface.</p> <p>As a result of the height of the hills from the ground, and the hardship encountered by the people when climbing the hills, some of them decided to stay and provided shelter for themselves while those that had the going up and down easy decided to make the top of the hills their permanent abode.  Those that decided to stay and live on the plain surface are today known as THE MERNYANG PEOPLE and the settlement is named Kwa(or pan) while those on the hills remain as “Kofyar” people.  However, inspite of this, the Kofyar and the Kwa people (Mernyang speakers) still see themselves as one and they have a mutual relationship.</p> <p>Of many communities and villages in Qua’an Pan Local Government Area of Plateau State, the Kwa chiefdom i.e. the mernyang speakers remain the major and the dominant group.  They are known and called “the pan chiefdom by their neighboring villages and towns, and according to the 2005 census, they can boast of 10,000 people within the community and about 95,000 speakers of the language, they are scattered around the nooks and crannies of Plateau State.</p> <p>Educational development, the expansion of settlement and the volume of trade, agricultural practices and population increase among others have today contributed to making (Kwa pan) chiefdom enjoy rapid growth and development.</p> <p>1.2     Geographical Background of Mernyang people</p> <p>The mernyang speaking people are found in the northern part of Qua’anpan local government area of plateau state.  In the state, they are located as the southern east of the state</p> <ul><li>Socio Cultural Profile</li> </ul> <p>The mernyang speaking people have a diverse culture and they distinct from one another depending on the districts because there are four districts of the mernyang speaking people.  They are: Kwa, which is the mernyang people, Doemak, Dokankasuwa, Kwang and the Kwalla people.</p> <ul><li>Occupation</li> </ul> <p>As fore mentioned, the main occupation of the mernyang speaking people is farming.  They also engage themselves in trading and hunting and for those close to the rivers incase of Kwang and Dokan Kasuwa they engage in fishing too.</p> <ul><li>Religion</li> </ul> <p>Before the coming of the colonial masters, mernyang people were all animist, but with the coming of Islamic and the Catholic missionaries who settled at Kwa and Kofyar, some embraced Islam and others Christianity.  Today we have Christians and Muslims and also some of the animist cohibiting together. In regards to Christianity, catholic is the dominant church because the missionaries that came are from Island and are catholic missioners.</p> <ul><li>Festivals</li> </ul> <p>The mernyang speaking people have different festivals depending on the time, place and district, but there is one general festival been celebrated yearly called Shika’am where all sons and daughters of mernyang converge to attain and celebrate the festival.  Several talents are displayed to add more beauty and shape to the event.  The people also dance, display magic and the likes.  This is done by the youth while elders watch.</p> <ul><li>Marriages</li> </ul> <p>Marriage in mernyang land differs from district to district, from clan to clan and religion to religion.  In case of Kwa, sometimes a lady is betrothed few days after birth in which she has to marry the person she is betrothed to or if she refuses she then pay back what the family of the husband already brought on her behalf even when she was young.</p> <p>Payment of bride price depends on the families and clans.</p> <p>1.3            GENETIC CLASSIFICATION</p> <p>AFRO – ASIATIC</p> <p>Ancient Egyptian Semitic

the question formation in Mernyang language.</p> <p>The work attempt to discuss WH question, The Yes or No question, Tag question, Alternative question, Rhetorical question in mernyang language.  This description will also focus on some of the peculiar features of the language.</p> <p>This research work consists of five chapters.  Chapter one deals with the introductory aspect of the work, that is the sociolinguistics profiles of the dialect, its historical background, socio cultural profile, genetic classification, scope and organization of the study, theoretic framework.  The second chapter centers on the basic syntactic concept, where we intend to analyze the phrase structure rules as well as the lexical categories and sentence types based on Government and binding theory.</p> <p>The third chapter will examine the question formation of mernyang language while chapter  four introduces us to transformational process like focus construction, reflexivization and relativization.  Chapter five summarizes and concludes the work</p> <p>1.5.   DATA COLLECTION</p> <p>The method employed for data collection is the bilingual elicitation approach involving English and mernyang.  The data were elicited with the use of the Ibadan four hundred  word  list, which consist of basic list of simple words.  Apart from the 400 wordlists, questions and sentences in English were translated to mernyang by mernyang native speakers.  The data collected were subjected to analysis.</p> <p>Oral interviews were   conducted in English language and answers to the questions   were given in Mernyang by my informant.  The answers to these questions were used in the syntactic analysis of mernyang.</p> <p><em>Below are the full details of my informant</em></p> <p>Name:        MICHAEL DAMAN NA’ANKAM</p> <p>Age:  50 YEARS OLD</p> <p>My informant is a native speaker of mernyang language.  My informant speaks the following languages; English, Hausa and Mernyang.</p> <p>1.5.1  Data Analysis</p> <p>In this research work, the data was collected from my informant both in writing and recording in an audio cassette then the analysis of the data collected was carried out using Government and Binding theory of syntax as proposed by Chomsky (1986).  This research work will be limited to the aspect of question formation of Mernyang.</p> <p>The informants used are fluent in the language, their fluently and competence formed the basis of choice of them as my informants.</p> <p>1.6     Theoretical Framework</p> <p>The theoretical framework to be employed in this research work is Government and Binding Theory (GB).  G.B theory is a model of grammar propounded and developed by Noam Chomsky.  This is done with the aim of covering universal Grammar (UG) that is, the system or principles, conditions and rules that are elements or properties of all human languages.  It was also done as a reaction to transformational Generative grammar to account for all and only the representations that underline the grammatical sentence in a language.</p> <p>Government and Binding theory is a modular deductive theory of grammar.  Proponents of G.B. often maintained that there’s no such thing as roles of language but the principles and parameters whose values can vary from one language to the other do exist with specified units.</p> <p>Chomsky (1995:15-16) remarks as follows,  “The principles and parameter approach held that language have to rule in anything like familiar sense of transformation and no theoretically significant grammatical construction, except taxonomic artifacts”.  There are universal   principles and finite array of options as to how such principles apply (parameter) but no language particular roles.</p> <p>It is also worthy to note that though Government and Binding theory is a common label for this model or syntax,  it is misleading because it gives undue prominence to the two elements of government and Binding, whose status was not fundamentally superior to the other sub-theories like X-bar, theta, case etc.  Hence, the ‘principles and parameters theory’ has come to be seen as closer to essence.</p> <p>G.B has two levels of representation related by transformational rule called Move alpha.  Move alpha is stipulated by movement that is  the syntactic level is  elaborated by the concept of movement (Cook 1988:30) G.B requires two levels of syntactic representation.  The deep structure (D-structure) which is the level at which we obtain all information on the words and their combination, it consists of base rules, lexical rules, strict sub categorization, selectional restrictions, phrase structure rules (Yusuf 19971:68)  It is the level at which all the elements in the sentence are in their original location (cook 1988:30)</p> <p>We also have the surface structure level (s-structure) which is the level at which some components in the sentence have been moved.  The s-structure is clearly generated from the D-structure by the application of movement rules.  There is a relationship between the deep structure and the surface structure they are related by movement.</p> <p>THE SUB-THEORUS OF G.B.</p> <p>Chomsky postulates a set of interacting sub-theories each of which deals with some control area of grammatical enquiry.  Each of these theories comprises a principle or set of principles, and each of these may be subject to parametric variation.  That is to say, it is assumed that the grammar of languages vary in only finitely =.  Many ways with respect to the domain covered by a given sub-theory.</p> <p>All these sub-theories of G.B. theory operates in a modular form, this theory itself is referred to as a modular deductive theory of grammar.  The sub-theory assured are the following:</p> <ol><li>X-bar theory</li> <li>Theta theory</li> <li>Case theory</li> <li>Binding theory</li> <li>Bounding theory</li> <li>Control theory</li> <li>Government theory</li> </ol> <p>1.6.1  X-bar Theory</p> <p>X – Bar syntax replaces large numbers of idiosyncratic rules with general principles.  It captures properties of all phrases and its bases on lexicon.  The principle is that a phrase always contains a head of the same type.</p> <p>It defines the possible phrase structure configuration of language in general.  The control notion is that each of the major lexical categories (Noun, Verb, Prepositions and Adjectives) is the head of a structure is dominated by a (phrase, verb, verb phrase, Noun phrase (NP), preposition: pp and Adjective – AP) it comes after other possible constituents in the example below.</p> <p>NP</p> <p>Spec            N</p> <p>N1</p> <p>Det</p> <p>That            house</p> <p>1.6.2  Projection Principle</p> <p>Chomsky (1981:29) states that (representation at each syntactic level is projected from the lexicon) in that they observe the sub categorization properties of lexical items; projection principles requires lexical properties to be projected to all levels of syntactic representation i.e. a lexical item projects from its zero bar level to one (single) bar level, which is optional, then to double bar level.  The zero bar level is referred to as the core projection level, the single bar level is referred to as the intermediate projection level and the double bar level is referred to as the maximal projection level.</p> <p>The illustration is shown below:</p> <p>XII     Maximal projection level</p> <p>XI      Intermediate projection level</p> <p>Xo      Core projection level</p> <p>Horrocks (1987:99) states that X-bar theory tells us that a lexical head (X) and its complements form a constituent (XI) and that any specifier of this form with a high level of constituent (XII) Thus:</p> <p>XII</p> <p>Spec                               XI</p> <p>XO                             Comp</p> <p>The lexical entry projects onto the structure of the sentence, and its influence ceases at the double bar level.  Another feature that makes generalization rule possible in x – bar theory is the concept of head.  The notion of head of a phrase is called the principle of head parameter.</p> <p>1.6.3  The Principle of Head Parameter</p> <p>The principle of head parameter specifies the order of elements in a language.  The basic assumption of head parameter is that sentences may be broken into constituent phrase and structural grouping of words.  Stock well (181:70) says that the parametric variation between language according to whether the position of the head is first or last with respect to its complement is called head parameter.  In other words, all phrases have heads of a related and possible complement along with some others like its specifiers.</p> <p>Lamidi (2000:105) says that the head is the keyword in a phrase and the word can be pre or post modified.  In essence, the head of a phrase is very important in x-bar theory and the head of the phrase to the right or left of the hand is known as head parameter.  That is, head first.</p> <p>X          XO  Complement</p> <p>XI</p> <p>XO               Comp</p> <p>Or head last</p> <p>XI                Complement X</p> <p>XI</p> <p>Comp                   XO</p> <p>To accommodate specifiers, it requires second level of structure putting the levels of specifier and complements together, the order of the head and specifier could be set separately from the order of the head and complement.  Thus</p> <p>XII               spec x</p> <p>XI                           XO  comp</p> <p>Spec            XI</p> <p>Xo              Comp</p> <p>All we have been discussing on X-bar (phrase structure) are lexical phrases   and the type of head in lexical phrases is related to word classes.  Lexical phrases invariably have heads that are lexical categories linked to lexical entries.</p> <p>Another type of phrase is the functional phrase.  Functional phrases  are the phrase that are built around functional heads – Functional phrases are the phrases that are built around functional heads.  Functional phrases invariably have heads that are linked to functional elements.  The functional phrases include inflection phrases (IP).</p> <p>Cook (1996: 150) says that, inflection phrases are built around functional heads which may contain lexical materials such as morphological endings but are not required to contain lexical materials such as morphological endings but are not required to contain lexical materials.  The top levels of the sentence have been unified with  the rest  of  X-bar  theory.    The  maximal level of a sentence is called inflection phrase (IP) in x-bar theory.  IP consists of specifier and II, II in turn consists of I and a complement thus:</p> <p>IP                spec   II</p> <p>I                  I comp</p> <p>IP</p> <p>Spec            II</p> <p>I                  Comp</p> <p>Other functional phrases includes complementizer phrase (CP)</p> <p>CP              spec    CI</p> <p>CI                C    IP</p> <p>CP</p> <p>Spec            CI</p> <p>C                   IP</p> <p>Determinant phrase (DP)</p> <p>DP              spec       D</p> <p>DI                D            NP</p> <p>DP</p> <p>Spec            DI</p> <p>D                NP</p> <p>1.6.4  Theta (θ) Theory</p> <p>Kirsten (1991:493) states that θ theory deals with the functional relationship between a predicate and its arguments: a predicate is said to assign theta-role to each of its arguments.  It is concerned with the assignment of what Chomsky calls.  ‘Thematic roles’ such as agent, patient (or theme) beneficiary etc.  It is assumed that theta-roles are assigned to the complements of lexical items as a lexical property.  The NP complements (direct object) is assigned to the role of patient, the PP complement is assigned the role of locative while the subject NP or the sentence is assigned the agent role.</p> <p>The main principle of θ theory is the ‘θ-CRITERION’ which requires each thematic role to be uniquely assigned i.e. each constituent denoting an argument is assigned just one θ role and each θ role is assigned to just one argument denoting constituent.  For example:</p> <p>Ahmed went to the market by car.</p> <p>IP</p> <p>Spec            II</p> <p>NP     I                  VP</p> <p>N1   TNS     AGR</p> <p>(Past)                 spec     VI</p> <p>AGENT NO                        V      NP                   PP</p> <p>N1                   PI         NP</p> <p>Location NO      PO        NI</p> <p>NO</p> <p>Ahmed                               go      market            by            car</p> <p>In the illustration above, verb phrase assigns agent role to the subject NP.</p> <p>Verb assigns patient role to the object of the verb and preposition assigns locative role to its NP</p> <p>1.6.5  CASE THEORY</p> <p>Kristen (1991:496) states that ‘case theory regulates the distribution of phonetically realized NPs by assigning abstract case to them.  It deals with the principle of case assignment to constituents. Chomsky assures that all NPs with lexical contents are assigned (abstract) case.  Case is assigned by a set of case assigners to the governed.  Horrocks (1987) says the basic idea is that case is assigned under government i.e. the choice of case is determined by the governor in any sentence.  For instance, a lexical head X may be said to govern its sisters in X-bar and certain lexical heads also have the power to  case mark certain  of  their  complements.   Thus</p> <p>NP subject is assigned normative by INFL; verb assigns accusative case to object of the verb while prepositi</p>\n\nQUESTION FORMATION IN MERNYANG<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " QUESTION FORMATION IN MERNYANG", "id": 64}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research work seeks to find out the challenges faced by two radio news medium, the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) Kaduna and Ray Power 100.5 Fm Jos in news gathering and reporting, and to also compare and contrast these challenges faced by the two medium.   In the review of related literature, scholars in the area under review gave different views to news and news gathering. It was observed that news refers to accurate and timely happenings, discoveries, opinions, and matters of any sort which affect or interest the readers, listeners or viewers. To strengthen this research work, the study was anchored on technological determinism theory and the new media theory. Survey research method was used in conducting this research work and in-depth interview was employed, interview guide was used as the instrument for collecting data, sixty four (64) news producers and reporters from the two medium is the population of the study. For this research work six (6) reporters from FRCN and six (6) from Ray Power Fm Jos was interviewed using in-depth interview guide to elicit response. The sample size is therefore, be twelve (12) accordingly. In data presentation and analysis, the findings revealed that the issue of news gathering and reporting in the 21st century has been improved due to the introduction and the use of information and communication technologies gadgets in news gathering and reporting. Overcoming the challenges faced in news gathering and reporting, journalist engages the new technologies for effective news gathering and reporting. The study also revealed that both stations, that is the FRCN and Raypower100.5fm Jos face similar challenges but tackled differently which some could be traced to funding and inadequate modern equipment for good transmissions. To this end the researcher recommended that journalists should uphold professionalism by adhering to ethical standard and not to allow ownership control take center play in their practices. Owners of radio stations should also ensure that they are well trained especially on the availability of modern equipment so as to meet up the standard of the day.</p> <strong><br/></strong> </div> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Radio as a medium is becoming more popular in our society daily. The medium is beneficial to both the educated and the uneducated in our society more than any other medium; it has the capacity to reach millions of Nigerians residing in the rural and urban areas.</p> <p>Nsi (1997), radio means simply reaching out to people from point to point through space with sound waves or electromagnetic waves. Radio has been dominated by the strong and almost universal half belief about its immense potency as a means of social, cultural and ultimately political influence and power. This belief about power of radio rest on a single and manifest truth. It makes it possible for man to address an audience of hundreds of millions.</p> <p>Uyo (1987) argues that messages are symbolic products, created and transmitted by radio to the public towards the fulfillment of their functions to the society. However, news gathering is a major challenge being faced by media practitioners - that is journalist in Nigeria. These challenges impede on effectiveness of radio as a medium of mass communication and journalist who are saddled with the responsibility of radio news gathering. The success or realization of an individual or a nation’s set goal is dependent on the policies legal framework, political environment and leadership styles. From the forgoing, it is quite obvious that radio reporting faces challenges daily in news gathering, which however, affects the effectiveness and efficiency of the medium. It also tends to outclass other medium in terms of relative proximity to reality of what is happening than any other media.</p> <p>Although, radio remains the most preferred medium for news amongst Nigerians, it is faced with the problems of gathering and sourcing for news. News gathering is the primary function of a media organization or a journalist as it were, which metamorphosed into dissemination of news items after proper processing.</p> <p>The radio as a medium in mass communication has remained a consistent and strong medium since its inception. It reaches more of the masses than other mass media channels because of some of its characteristics. The researcher therefore intends to delve into finding out the challenges and possibly proffer solutions to these challenges in a comparative analysis.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>            Every research work is predicated on a problem. Most researches on radio news reporting have their coverage of particular events of general interest and critique of programmes. This is so because it permits a close scrutiny of the output of radio stations. Nwosu (1990). </p> <p>            Radio stations both public and private have a mandate to educate, inform and serve as watchdog of the society. In this jet age, one expects that the radio should function in full capacity, but the disturbing story is that most radio stations are shadow of themselves. The watchdog argument has over the years been evacuated of its effectiveness, if there was any, by the political and economic interest which under guard media production and operation. The mass media having been effectively colonized by powerful economic interests, have lost their vitality as an independent watchdog. They may still occasionally bark, but their ability to bite has been seriously curtailed. In the words of Waisbord, cited in Oso (2013) proximity to specific powers makes the press unlikely to be interested in keeping the same interests at bay. It dims the prospects that new organization can effectively. “Sustain vigilant scrutiny of government and centres of powerss”. Watch dogs do not bite their owners nor do they chomp neighbour with whom they have amiable relationships (Oso, 2013:3)</p> <p>In this research work, the research intends to access the problems as it relates to the enormous challenges faces by most radio station especially the Federal radio cooperation of Nigeria (FRCN) Kaduna and the Raypower F.M Jos in their news gathering and reporting</p> <p>            The study intends to ascertain these challenges as opposed to the developed nations of the world. </p> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researcher intends to find the method and challenges of radio news gathering in FRCN Kaduna and RayPower 100.5 fm Jos.  But specifically though it is;</p> <p>1.      To find out the techniques adopted by journalist in FRCN Kaduna and RayPower 100.5 fm Jos in news gathering.</p> <p>2.      To find out the challenges faced by these two news mediums when gathering news.</p> <p>3.      To compare and contrast the challenges faced by FRCN Kaduna and RayPower 100.5 fm Jos in news gathering.</p> <p>4.      To find out whether ownership affect journalist in news gathering.</p> <p><strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In order to put this research into perspective the researcher has put down some salient questions that deserve clarifications;</p> <p>1.      What are the various techniques adopted by FRCN Kaduna and RayPower 100.5 fm Jos in news gathering?</p> <p>2.      What are the challenges facing FRCN Kaduna and RayPower 100.5 fm Jos in news gathering?</p> <p>3.      In what ways are the challenges faced by FRCN Kaduna and RayPower 100.5 fm Jos similar or different in news gathering?</p> <p>4.      How does ownership affect news gathering in these news media?</p> <p><strong>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>After the whole work is completed, media outfits will benefit because the researcher must have suggested other ways through which they can easily set information for their news.</p> <p>The society on the other hand will also benefit in the sense that when these media outfits access information, they will disseminate it to the general public.</p> <p>The study will also add knowledge to scholars and upcoming researchers on these challenges.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Every event, situation or circumstances occurs with an environment. It means that the event as a phenomenon occurs in an environment. Owuamalam (2012), the area within which the event occurs is the scope of the study. He added that it delimits the area or subject, from a vast area of consideration. Scope therefore makes the area of study manageable for effective research study. The scope of the researchers work is FRCN Kaduna and RayPower 100.5 fm Jos.</p> <p><strong>1.7       OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Radio</strong>:             It is the transmission of signal by modulation of electromagnetic waves with frequencies below those visible light received by heterogeneous audience.</p> <p><strong>Reporting</strong>:      To write or give account of something for the purpose of presentation to others, for the publication of news in the newspaper, radio and television.</p> <p><strong>Nigeria</strong>:           Is a Federal constituted Republic comprising of  36 states and one (1) Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

The methodology adopted for this study is based on descriptive linguistics which attempts to describe a language in terms of its current form (i.e. synchronically without reference to earlier forms or other languages). The data employed for the project was obtained from primary sources via interviews. Some of the data was obtained from secondary sources including the Urhobo dictionary. For lexical relations, the analysis showed that Urhobo has synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, and homonymy. It also showed that they are somewhat similar to what one finds in English language. The study therefore concluded that most of the lexical relations identified in other well studied languages can be found in the Urhobo language. </blockquote> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT        <br/></strong><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong> 1.0 Introduction <br/>1.1  Background <br/>1.1.2  Urhobo People and Language <br/>1.2 Methodology <br/>1.2.1  Data Collection <br/>1.2.2 Data Analysis <br/>1.3.

We will look in general term at lexical relations i.e. the meaning relationships words have with one another, the semantic features that help to differentiate one from the other and also at how lexical negations are realized i.e. if a morpheme is added to negate it or if an entirely different word is used. </blockquote> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong> </p> <blockquote>Semantics is a branch of linguistics studies, and has been defined by different scholars. Okolo and Ezikeojiaku (1999:175) defined semantics as “the study of meaning”. Radford (1997:27)defined semantics as “the linguistics aspect of meaning”. Fitch (2010:120)“semantics is the branch of linguistics studies that is constantly in shoulders with philosophy. This is because the study of meaning raises a host of problems that are the traditional stomping ground of philosophy”. Charles (1955:202) “linguistics semantics is the study of how language organizes and expresses meaning.” Semantics is like a coin with two aspects: lexical and post-lexical semantics. Lexical semantics the subject of this study deals with the meaning of words. It’s a linguistics theory that investigates word meaning. Iloene and Iloene (2013:4) “word meaning in language are atoms that are intricately interconnected in a web-like fashion, in which some concepts have been differentiated into two fundamental types: i) the ones that necessarily involve a relationship with other concept ii) the ones that are just seen to be independent units.” Mowarin (2010:57) “lexical semantics deals with the study of lexis, it focuses on lexical universals. It is observed that the denotation of a word is not studied in isolation”. Saeed (2007:53) reinforces this fact where he states that “…the meaning of a word is defined in part by its relation with other words in language.” </blockquote> <p><strong>1.1.1</strong>  <strong>URHOBO PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE</strong> </p> <blockquote>Urhobo is a south western edoid language spoken in Delta State. Ukere (1990) “Urhobo is spoken in Ethiope, Okpe, Ughelli, Sapele and Warri local government areas. Urhobo belongs to the kwa sub-group of the Niger-Congo phylum in Greenberge’s (1963) classification of African languages. Urhobo is found in the south western edoid (SWE) branch of the genetically related languages and dialects referred to as the “Edoid group of language” in Elugbe’s (1989) classification. <em>The diagram below shows Urhobo in the proto-edoid family</em> Fig. 1: The Edoid Family Tree showing the Urhobo and related languages. (Elugbe 1986) Key: PDE: proto -delta edoid (Egene, Degema, Epie-Atisa) PNCE: proto-north central edoid (Glotua, Uweme, Yekhee, Ora-Emai-Iuleha, Esan, Edo). PNWE: proto-north western edoid (PSNWE; Okpomberi, Emahe, Oloma, Okpe-Akuru-Idesa, PO; Ukue, Ehuene, Uhame). PSWE: proto-south western edoid (Uvwie, Isoko, Eruwa, Urhobo, Okpe). As the figures above shows edoid language is divided into four and SWE is further divided into five languages including Urhobo. According to Ukere (1990) there are twenty-two clans within Urhobo speaking community namely; Agbarho, Awrata, Agbarha, Arhavwarien, Agbon, Agbassa, Ephro-oto, Eghwu, Erwreni, Idjerhe, Ogo, Oghara, Okere, Olomu, Okpe, Orogun, Okparebe, Ughievwen, Ughelli, Udu, Uvwie and Uwheru. Based on Rolle (2013) “there are eighteen (18) dialects of Urhobo; Agbarho dialect being its standard form. Although the language is widely spoken, Ojaide (2007:3) reports that many of the urban dwellers in Effurun, Sapele, Ughelli and Warri do not use or speak the language. On the population of speakers, Lewis (2009) suggests that the minimum population is approximately 500 000, while Mowarin (2004) estimates that the maximum population is approximately 1.5 million. </blockquote> <p><strong>1.2     METHODOLOGY  </strong></p> <blockquote>This study methodology will be divided into two parts; data collection and data analysis. <strong>1.2.1 DATA COLLECTION</strong> This study will use two methods in the data collection. They are the primary and secondary methods.<strong>Primary data</strong>: this was collected from 5 native speakers purposefully selected based on their availability to partake in the study. The data was elicited via oral interviews using a self-structured word list of common lexical relations. <strong>Secondary data</strong>: this comprises data drawn from several sources including Rolle (2003) “phonetics and phonology of Urhobo” and “A concise dictionary of Urhobo language. </blockquote> <p><strong>1.2.2  DATA ANALYSIS</strong> </p> <blockquote>This study will entail the descriptive method of analysis. Descriptive theories are theories about what languages are like. They are theories about what tools we need in order to provide adequate descriptions of individual languages. According to Himmelmann (1995:1), ‘much of the work that is labeled ‘descriptive’ within linguistics comprises two activities i.e. the collection of primary data and an analysis of these data’.</blockquote> <blockquote> <strong>1.3     PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong> <br/>To the best of my knowledge, there are not many studies on lexical semantics. Hence this project was carried out with the aim of proving and identifying some of the existence of lexical relations in the language, with the objectivity to; i) shade more light on the aspect of lexical semantic relations and negation ii) distinguish semantically the notion of lexical negations (marked or unmarked) iii)show  how meanings of words are interrelated in the language iv) show the different senses of words in the language  v) Give examples of senses of words that are used in different context <br/><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong> <br/>Lexical semantics is an aspect of linguistics studies which has generated a lot of interest among linguists. Many people have attempted to work on lexical relations and negation; some have been bold enough to tackle it while others have circumvented. Some authors have gone further than merely defining these terms. They have been able to identify the various types, and the number varies from one author to another. This work will be productive as it will; i)add to the volume of literature available on lexical semantic relations ii) provide useful information to both speakers, learners and teachers of the language on its lexical aspect iii) Encourage further research on the not just lexical relation in Urhobo but lexical semantics as a whole. </blockquote>\n\nASPECTS OF THE LEXICAL SEMANTICS OF URHOBO<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASPECTS OF THE LEXICAL SEMANTICS OF URHOBO", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>DIALECTAL VARIATION <br/><br/>A CASE STUDY OF IKERE AND IJEBU<br/><br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/><br/>Pages<br/><br/>Title page ---------i<br/><br/>Certification---------ii<br/><br/>Dedication---------iii<br/><br/>Acknowledgements-------iv<br/><br/>Table of contents--------vi<br/><br/>Abstract---------x<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/><br/>1.0Introduction--------<br/><br/>1.1Origin and Language of the Yoruba people---1.1.1 Ikere Variety and People------<br/><br/>1.1.2 Ijebu Variety and People-----<br/><br/>1.2 Purpose and Significant of Study-----<br/><br/>1.3Scope of Study-------<br/><br/>1.4PreviousWorks-------<br/><br/>1.5Data and Methodology------<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE<br/><br/>2.1Language and Dialect------<br/><br/>2.1.1Language--------<br/><br/>2.1.2Dialect--------<br/><br/>2.1.3The Linguistic Viewpoint-----<br/><br/>2.2 Other Related Studies------<br/><br/>2.3Theoretical Framework------<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE: RESULT OF DATA ANALYSIS<br/><br/>3.0 Introduction --------<br/><br/>3.1 Findings--------<br/><br/>3.1.1 The Vocalic Variation ------<br/><br/>3.1.2 The Consonantal Variation-----<br/><br/>3.1.3 Consonant Deletion-------<br/><br/>3.1.4 Comparative Vocabulary------<br/><br/>3.2 Discussions--------<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR: CONLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/><br/>4.0Conclusion--------<br/><br/>4.1Recommendation-------<br/><br/>REFERENCES--------<br/><br/>APPENDIX--------</p> <p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This is a work on dialectal variation focusing on a comparative study between Ikere and Ijebu of the Yoruba language, as spoken by the people of Ekiti and Ogun state respectively, with a view to determining the linguistic status of both varieties. It is limited to only these varieties as they are the main focus of the study. The Ibadan word list of 400 basic items was the primary instrument for data collection, and informants were used. This work <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/><br/>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>This work sets out to do a comparative study to determine the status of the Ikere and Ijebu varieties of Yoruba in order to find areas of convergences and divergences which will help determine the level of mutual intelligibility between them. The motivation for this study is that there have been some controversies as to the relatedness between these two language varieties. Thiswork sets out to examine the Ekiti and Ijebu varieties of Yoruba in the light of these controversies and establishes their linguistic status as well.<br/><br/>The study is divided into four chapters. Chapter one is the general introduction to the study. It entails the preliminaries, the Ikere and Ijebu varieties of Yoruba: the languages and peoples, the aim, scope of study, significance and methodology of study. In chapter two a review of relevant literature is carried out. It entails a linguistic viewpoint, a theoretical review, definition of terms and definition of terms. For chapter three, the data collected is analyzed and the results are also presented to show the convergence and divergence between the Ikere and Ijebu varieties of Yoruba. Chapter four entails the concluding remarks where the summary of work done, findings and conclusion are presented. This is followed by the references and appendix sections.<br/><br/>Languages are used in different forms, in different situations and for different purposes. This use of language has given birth to various forms. For example if a dialect is defined as a geographical sub-division of language, we do not come very far without the definition of language and sub-division is not a very clear concept either. Therefore discussions of the terms will be necessary. These discussions will be treated in the second chapter of this study.<br/><br/>According to Catford (1965:84), a language variety is:<br/><br/>“a subset of formal and or substantial features which correlateregularly with a particular type of socio-situational feature”.<br/><br/>A language can thus be defined as abody of words and system used for communication among people of a particular nation or area. This definition only scratches the surface of language as a whole, but it is essential in the understanding of the afore-mentioned terms.<br/><br/>A dialect then,is a variety of language that is distinguished from other varieties of the same language by features of phonology,grammar and vocabulary, and by its use by a group of speakerswho are set off from others geographically or socially.<br/><br/>This work sets out to do a comparative study to determine the status of the Ikere and Ijebu varieties of the Yoruba language in order to find the areas of convergences and divergences which will help determine the level of mutual intelligibility.<br/><br/>However, there has been some controversies as to the relatedness or otherwise between these two varieties. This work also sets out to examine these varieties and establish the linguistics status of these varieties as well.<br/><br/>1.1ORIGIN AND LANGUAGE OF THE YORUBA PEOPLE<br/><br/>The Yoruba people have different accounts of their origin but they all relate to the same ancestor, “Oduduwa”. One account is that he migrated from what is called Mecca because of his belief in deities which caused him to be expelled from his abode, and to settle in Ile-Ife and start a dynasty which was further expanded by his seven sons. Another school of taught is of the view that Oduduwa was sent by God to create the human race, but his first descent was at Ile-Ife where he proceeded with his mission.<br/><br/>According to the CIA World Fact Book (2013), the Yoruba diaspora consists of two groupings.One of them includes relatively recent immigrants, the majority which moved outside the shores of Africa and the other includesthose within Africa. It also states that the Yoruba language is one of the 12 Edekiri languages of the Yoruboid group that also includes Igala, Edo, Ebira amongst others. The Yoruba language has numerous varieties spoken in Nigeria and other parts of the world where it is spoken. Aside from Nigeria it is spoken in Benin, Togo, Ghana, Brazil and by immigrant in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world.<br/><br/>Yoruba is a tonal language comprising of three (3) basic tones : high, mid and low tones but these tones may interact producing rising or falling tones.<br/><br/>1.1.1 Ikere Variety And People.<br/><br/>According to the World Gazette (2013) Ikere-Ekiti, also known as Ikere is a city in Ekiti state of Nigeria. Ikere is a variety of the Yoruba language spoken by the Ekitipeople that differ from other varieties of the language.<br/><br/>The Ikere peopleare aboriginal, culturally homogeneous and highly intellectual Yoruboid speaking people that form a sub-group of a larger ethnic group in West Africa particularly in Nigeria.(Nigerian Muse : 2006) <br/><br/>The difference noticeable in the Ikere language are informed by their spatial locations especially the boarder community to the state.<br/><br/>The Ekiti people settle in nucleus urban patterns, well linked within networks of roads. The state “Ekiti” from whichIkere is a tribe, means “mound” and is derived from the rugged mountainous feature of the state. The Ikere people are well known for their diverse quality of traditional arts, poetry and witty sayings.<br/><br/>An Ekiti man can be identified in Bùbá (round neck shirt) and sòkòtò (trousers). While the woman’s dress is Bùbá (blouse) and ìró (wrapper). Generally, any Ikere person can be identified by their facial marks which is a quarter-of-an-inch horizontal line, called “Pele Ekiti”.<br/><br/>1.1.2 Ijebu Variety and People<br/><br/>The Ijebu speak another variety of Yoruba and are found in large concentrations in Epe, Ikorodu and IbejuLekki, apart from those who have longsettled in Lagos Island especially in the area of Idumagbo and EbuteEro.The Ijebu people are mainly from Ogun state in Nigeria. They are bounded in the north by Ibadan, in the east by Ondo, Okitipupa and the west by Egbaland. (Encyclopedia Britannica 2014)<br/><br/>The people are business minded and are shrewd in business. Hence, any Yoruba person that exhibits such behaviour is said to hail from Ijebu. They are also very ritualistic; a typical EbifestivalinEpe for instance features the worship of many deities, cult ceremonies, blood sacrifices and masquerades display.<br/><br/>According to the Journal of The Historical Society of Nigeria (2004), the Ijebu are connected to the larger Yoruba race and are very united despite their presence in more than one state and in many towns. Like other Yoruba tribes, these people can be easily identified with their tribal marks, which are a short line on both cheeks called “Pele Ijebu”.<br/><br/>1.2 PURPOSE AND SIGNIFICANT OF STUDY<br/><br/>This work is a comparative study of Ikereand Ijebu varieties of Yoruba language. It seeks to compare Ikere and Ijebu varieties of Yoruba to determine their relatedness and determine whether they are dialects or simply varieties of Yoruba language.<br/><br/>This work would also serve as a guide to interested researchers who would want to develop and consolidate the frontiers of this subject matter.<br/><br/>1.3SCOPE OF STUDY<br/><br/>This study covers the language variety of the Yoruba language spoken by the Ijebu and Ikere people.<br/><br/>However, it is limited to these two varieties as they are the main focus of the study.<br/><br/>1.4PREVIOUSWORKS<br/><br/>There is no contrastive study carried out on Ikere and Ijebu varieties. Although there are individual studies on Ijebu and Ikere respectively, but no work focuses on the varieties as a particular study.<br/><br/>1.5DATA AND METHODOLOGY<br/><br/>The Ibadan word list of 400 basic items was the primary instrument for data collection. The choice of the Ibadan 400 word list is informed by the factthat it constitutes a reliable and codified source of frequently used words inYoruba language.</p>\n\nDIALECTAL VARIATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DIALECTAL VARIATION", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Style is the manifestation of one’s personality. Every writer has a natural, linguistic and idiosyncratic way of expressing ideas that leads to the identification of style with man and his thought. The manipulation of words by a writer creates a distinct style through which he/she reaches out to the audience. This research work focused on a stylistic analysis of selected socio-political poems of Christopher Okigbo. This aims at identifying Okigbo’s unique use of language. Stylometrics was used as a theoretical framework for the study. The findings in this are that Okigbo’s poems begin with some words in capitalisation which are foregrounded to the theme of the poems. He makes use of elements like repetition, alliteration, rhyme, parallelism and so on which add musical colour and rhythm to his poems. It is also evident his poems are sometimes prophetic, ritualistic and often address socio-political issues from a universal perspective. The work found out that each of the linguistic choices has an identifiable function that is performed in the poem. The study concludes that Christopher Okigbo’s poems are musical in nature and highly figurative in language use. </div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0       INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>This chapter serves as general introduction and includes background to the study, the statement of the problem, as well as the scope and delimitation of the study. Also, included in chapter one are the aim and objectives of the study, significance of the study, limitations of the study as well as the research design and a definition of terms.</div> <div><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>Language use by individuals differs from one person to the other. This is because of the differences in language ability. Stylistics is a borderline discipline between language and literature.  It  focuses  on  language  use  in  both  literary  and  non-literary  texts. Stylistics is also concerned with the study of the language of literature or the study of the language habits of particular authors and their writing patterns. Therefore, it can be said to be the study of style. Style on its own has been defined differently be scholars. According to Leech and Short (15), style is the cover of our feelings and it is the tool of the writer to transfer the message to readers. Leech further says “style proclaims the man” (11), that is, there is an intimate relationship between the choice of language and the author’s personality. Haynes defines it as “the study of style is the study of differences” (3).  This further drives home the point that our choice of diction differentiates us from others.</div> <div>Language gives the reader a new perspective on familiar themes and allows us to look at them without the personal or social conditioning that we unconsciously associate with them (Widdowson 9). So, although the reader may still use the same exhausted words and vague terms like ‘love’, ‘heart’ and ‘soul’ to refer to human experience, to place these words in a new and refreshing context allows the poet the ability to represent humanity and communicate honestly. This, in part, is stylistics, and this, according to Widdowson, is the point of poetry (76).</div> <div>Every writer’s works can have a great influence on fore coming literary works even though their purpose is the same. This is because writers do not have the same approach when it comes to language. That is why one person’s style can be different from another. Thus, this work will focuses on “A Stylistic analysis of selected Christopher Okigbo’s socio-political poetry”.This aims at revealing what has made Okigbo so popular in the literary world despite his short life.</div> <div><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></div> <div>Stylistics is the study of style. It is the description and analysis of the variable forms of linguistic items in actual language use. This research project intends to carry out a stylistic investigation of selected Christopher Okigbo’s Socio-political Poems<em>.</em> When two or more authors write on a particular topic, the style of writing differs from one author to the other authors thereby distinguishing one from the others. This can be achieved through choice, deviation, conformity and so on. Okigbo has a style that is peculiar to him and differentiates his work from those of other authors. His style reveals his feelings about the socio-political situation in Nigeria. This research paper seeks to find out what is peculiar to his language.</div> <div><strong>1.3       AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></div> <p>The aim of this research is to carry out a stylistic analysis of some of Okigbo’s socio-political poems. The objective is to give better understanding of the poems, thereby maximising the enjoyment of the poems. <br/><br/></p>\n\nA STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF SELECTED CHRISTOPHER OKIGBO’S SOCIO-POLITICAL POETRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF SELECTED CHRISTOPHER OKIGBO’S SOCIO-POLITICAL POETRY", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This research work is on <em>Sociolinguistic Investigation of Some Hausa Proverbs. </em>The Hausa term for proverb is Karin Magana and they are one of the oldest and most important types of myth, which form part and parcel of the Hausa culture. These wise sayings form a very crucial phase of the ways of life of the people who use them. They vary in meaning, depending on the way the speakers and listeners understand them. The consequence of proverbs on the general public depends on the context in which they are employed. Hausa proverbs maintain conformity to cultural values and accepted pattern of behavior. Thus, proverbs are filled with hints on several aspects of life. Proverbs are employed in different kinds of situations in Hausa society to control numerous activities without the use of force or harsh language. There are many proverbs that relate to situation of courage, despair, hope and others. They are also used to caution, advise, educate and control. This research work viewed some of these Hausa proverbs from sociolinguistic standpoint, usingthe Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. It came to the conclusion that proverbs foster unity, peace, understanding and a deep sense of belonging among the Hausa people.</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1  </strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>People commonly use different forms of expressions which are peculiar to their societies to express their views and for effective communication. These expressions can be verbal and non-verbal, including signs and symbols among others. The verbal forms and include forms such as songs, riddles, poems and adages. Whatever forms of expressions used in any society, they aim at expressing values, ideas, emotions, and desires, which are used to educate, caution and enlighten such society. Just like most African societies, the Hausa people of Northern Nigeria make use of proverbs known as “Karin Magana” to indicate subjects of interest. Proverbs are of great practical values and are used to portray social conditions, express feelings, admire, detest, warn and encourage people.</div> <div>A proverb is a saying popularly used to express simple and concrete truth based on common sense and the experience of people. According to Bascom, “Proverbs which are the most important type of aphorism in Africa have a deeper meaning than is stated literally; a meaning which can be understood only through the analysis of the social situations to which they are appropriate” (438). Hausa proverbs (<em>Karin Magana)</em> are said to be the oldest and the most important genre of folklore which are used by the people in many contexts. Hausa proverbs give answers to recurrent problems; they are also used to revive history, develop language, entertain and educate. The proverbs touch on almost every aspect of the people’s life. Akporobaro rightly observes that “Proverbs in Hausa language manifest the same wide range of topical interest and close attentiveness to the facts of human life, as do the proverbs from other major social ethnic groups” (89). In addition, Hausa proverbs reflect the religious temper and heritage of the Hausa people. Hausa proverbs are used to express social approval and disapproval, praise, criticize, warn and advise. Karin Magana is very valuable to preliterate people, for whom words cannot be read, they are more valued when heard. In many African societies, the instinct for language for imagery and for the expression of abstract ideas through concise and allusive phraseology can be seen particularly in proverbs. Karin Magana can be seen to have an immense value to speakers and orators.</div> <div>        The term “proverb” has been defined or described by various people and all the definitions point at a particular focus. One interesting definition is the one in Encyclopedia Britanica, volume 9 and it states, “Proverbs are succinct and pithy sayings in general use, expressing commonly held ideals and beliefs’ (749). They are part of everyday language and are related to such other forms of folk literature as riddles and fables that have originated in oral tradition.</div> <div>According to Chamber’s English Dictionary, proverbs are defined as “short familiar sentences expressing a supposed truth or moral lessons and requires explanations” (1177). No matter which part of the world proverbs are found, it is discovered that the same kernel of wisdom may be gleaned under different cultural conditions and languages.</div> <div>                 Proverbial sayings are very important part of folktale. They are not limited to only a particular set of people in society, but to both people of high cultures as well as the uncivilized. It is therefore impossible for a man to be considered a good orator unless he makes ample use of proverbs in his everyday speech. In societies where moral behavior of people is governed by social norms, proverbs are very effective checks on people’s behavior. Proverbs censor defaulters or praise those who conform to the ethics of the tribe. Societies also use proverbs to rebuke the young ones who err in such societies.</div>\n\nSOCIOLINGUISTIC INVESTIGATION OF SOME HAUSA PROVERBS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOCIOLINGUISTIC INVESTIGATION OF SOME HAUSA PROVERBS", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTARCT</strong></div> <div>The study examined the role of Nigerian Pidgin English in higher institutions with particular reference to students of Federal University Dutsinma. The research employed the monogenetic/reflexification theory and the data was gathered through the use of questionnaires and observation techniques. The analysis was based on the nature of the question asked as frequencies were generated and anaysed in simple percentages. The findings reveal that most students use Nigerian Pidgin however, not in formal settings such as lecture halls. In addition, the findings show that the Nigeria Pidgin English has effects on the students. This study concludes that the use of Pidgin in formal setting should be discouraged since it has not been given recognition. Its usage within the institution is affecting the students’ academic performance.</div> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>0.1 Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>One of the most important differences between man and animal is man’s ability to speak and make others understand. as such, Language is central to human existence. The relationships between humans are molded by the language they speak. It enables them to communicate their feelings and emotions to one another. This is why Edward Sapir says “language is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions and desires by means of voluntarily produced symbols” (8).</div> <div>On the other hand, Bloch and Trager state that language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by which a social group cooperates (5).  Henry Sweet also views language as the expression of ideas by means of speech sounds combined into words. Words are combined into sentences, this combination answering to that of ideas into thoughts. (8).</div> <div>From the above definitions, three words stand out “human”, “expression”, and “communication”. The word human implies that only human beings use language as a means of communication. Animals do communicate using sounds but their communication is certainly different from human language and is not language.  According to Akindele and Adegbite language is a human phenomenon that has form which can be described in terms of units of sound (phonemes), word, morphemes, phrases, sentences and paragraphs or discourse” (1).</div> <div>This definition shows that language has often been identified as the most unique attribute of man. It is through language that human beings grasp and understand reality and transmit it from one generation to another. This view is buttressed by Blakar who affairs that “we actually live and behave in a world of language” (4). Victoria Fromkin and Robert Rodman cited Noam Chomsky saying that when we study human language, we are approaching what some might call the human essence. Chomsky’s emphasis is on the important of language to human existence. Language is very important to every human being and without language, there won’t be communication.</div> </div>\n\nTHE ROLE OF NIGERIA PIDGIN ENGLISH IN HIGHER INSTITUTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF NIGERIA PIDGIN ENGLISH IN HIGHER INSTITUTION", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research examined the concept of code switching and code mixing in Doctor-Patient communication in Federal Medical Centre, Katsina. The data used for the analysis were obtained from tape recording, questionnaire and personal observation. The analysis employed the descriptive statistical method with Bach and Harnish (1979) Mutual Contextual Believe (MCB) as the theoretical framework of the study. The findings shows that code-mixing and code-switching are used very often in Doctor-Patient communication especially when performing therapeutic functions.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  </strong><strong>Background to the study</strong></p> <p>Communication is a process in which a message is sent from sender to receiver. It is a practice that the sender encodes message and the receiver decodes it. Communication may occur in small groups or in organizations where there is work to do, or several small groups that need to interact among each other within a single organization. Gumperz (1982),states that communication is a ‘social activity that requires the coordinated efforts of two or more individuals’ that construct talk to produce sentences. However, no matter how well rounded or stylish the outcome may be, it does not by itself constitute communication. Communication takes place only when a common understanding is obtained among communicants. Therefore, it is necessary to have the knowledge and ability to create and sustain conversation. The knowledge also needs to be not only grammatical competence but also linguistic, socio-cultural knowledge, and understanding the nature of the conversation Gumperz (1982: 2).</p> <p>Interpersonal communication is one type of communication, which is defined in many ways. Miller(1978) defines it based on the situation and number of participants involved and states that interpersonal communication occurs between two individuals when they are close in ‘proximity, able to provide immediate feedback and utilize multiple senses’. Others such as Peters(1974) described interpersonal communication based on the degree of personal closeness’ or perceived quality, of a given interaction; it includes communication that is private and occurring between people who are more than acquaintances. Canary(2003)view of interpersonal communication is from the perspective of conversant goals. According to Dainton(2004:50) states that communication is used to attain or achieve personal goals through interaction with others.</p> <p>As one category of interpersonal communication, medical communication is central to clinical functions in constructing a good doctor –patient relationship, which is one of the major tasks in medical profession. In this regard, Van Naerssen (1985) identifies two kinds of medical communication that includes doctor to patient and doctor to other medical personnel communications. Naerssen claims that, both kinds belong to different registers, each with a range of variations within it.’ The first is the interaction between two medical professionals (doctor with nurse, doctor with doctor, as well as nurse with nurse). The second is, the interaction between medical professionals with their patients, which includes interviews - called ‘chief complaint’, treatments, breaking bad news, consultation and follow-ups. Each part has its own structure and characteristic features that can be observed and analyzed either separately or as part of a larger discourse.</p> <p>1.2 <strong>Statement of Research Problem</strong></p> <p>Having a good medical communication is important in the delivery of high-quality health care and has the potential to help regulate patients’ emotions, facilitate comprehension of medical information, and allow for better identification of patients’ needs, perceptions, and expectations. Patients reporting good communication with their medical care professional are more likely to be satisfied with their care, and especially to share significant information for accurate diagnosis of their problems, follow advice, and adhere to the prescribed treatment Naerssen(1985: 44).</p> <p>However, according to Naerssen, patients complain about their doctors that, they are not willing to listen, do not answer their questions, or inform them properly. In addition they are authoritative and unhelpful, at the same time; doctors criticize their patients for not following their advice Naerssen (1985: 43).</p> <p>For code switching and code mixing to work properly, there should be background knowledge of more than one language by the parties involved, the absence of which may lead to ineffective switch and may sometimes lead to misconception of ideas, communication barrier and misinterpretation of messages. This research therefore investigates the role of code mixing and code switching in doctor-patient communication in Federal Medical Centre Katsina.</p> <p><strong>1.3  </strong><strong>Research Question</strong></p> <p>In line with the problem of the research raised above, this work has the following research questions:</p> <p>(i)                 Does problem of communication exist between doctors and patients at the Federal</p> <p>Medical Centre Katsina?</p> <p>(ii)               What are the factors responsible for code mixing and code switching between doctors and patients?</p> <p>(iii)             What is the effect of professional background on effective communication between Patient and doctor?</p> <p>(iv)             What are the remedies to effective communication between doctors and patients?</p> <p><strong>1.4 Aim and Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>Based on the research questions raised above, the research is guided by the following aim and objectives:</p> <p>        i.            To investigate whether there are communication gaps between doctors and patients.</p> <p>      ii.            To assess the factors responsible for code mixing and code switching.</p> <p>    iii.            To examine the effect of professional background in effective communication between doctors and patients.</p> <p>    iv.            To proffer better ways in which effective communication can take place between doctors and patients.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>This study investigates some of the important points regarding medical communication and content of the language from sociolinguistics and pragmatic aspects. In other words, the study attempts to describe issues, which are related to language use and implications in communication. Therefore, the study, first, helps patient and medical professionals to know the importance of communication in asserting themselves while talking to each other. Second, it gives an idea or a hint about medical communication for medical professionals on how to talk and handle their patients. Third, it will serve as a resource for future researchers</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope of Study</strong></p> <p>This study is carried out within the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Katsina. The study is also limited to the interview aspects that the medical professional holds with the patients, which contains the most prominent aspect of the interaction that fully employs the use of conversation. Moreover, it is obvious that medical communications are not conducted only orally but through writing, too. However, the study focuses only on the oral interaction. The excluded area, that is, the written communication will be relevant to the analysis of prescription, medication, and reports in medical records. The study also excludes the interaction between doctors with other medical personnel, in order to pay particular attention to Doctor – Patients interaction.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF CODE MIXING AND CODE SWITCHING IN DOCTOR-PATIENT COMMUNICATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF CODE MIXING AND CODE SWITCHING IN DOCTOR-PATIENT COMMUNICATION", "id": 71}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This research investigated and analysed works of two outstanding modernist writers in Africa and Europe. The work was carried out with specific objectives which are; to highlight the basic features of modernism,to discuss the reasons for writers in this vogue deviating from earlier trends and placing emphases on newness. It outlined and analysed these basic features in the texts, <em>Anthills of the Savannah</em> and <em>The Trial</em>. In the course of these analyses, the researcher highlighted seven features of modernism. This formed the Data and Textual analyses in this work. From these analyses, the study succeeded in situating these novels within the fold of modernism. It looks at the major thematic preoccupations of the novels and how they reflected the existence of humans in modern society, which is the concern of the modernist writers. Once more, the research has proven that modernism and any other literary trend is not an exclusive preserve of the West. It is possible to adopt the style in any other part of the World as Achebe and Kafka have done.</div> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0  </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Literature is often seen as a representation of man’s experiences in the society. These experiences are not represented abstractly but rather in line with the factual and visible happenings in our society. Over the years, every literature produced is meant to portray or address a particular issue in our society. The nature of life and man himself is dynamic and is reflected as such in literature.</div> <div>Both the traditional and modern man has found literature entertaining and has consequently preserved it. It is because man in his early society recognizes the entertainment values of literature that he developed it. The modern man has also continued the tradition of entertaining himself through literature in form of songs, drama, and storytelling that accompanied traditional rituals. <em>The National Teacher Institutes NCE/DLS course book on English language cycle 1 </em>gives three ways by which literature keeps the society entertained. These are psychological escape; entertainment through indulgence of our sense of humour and entertainment through our sense of beauty (225-226). Literature thus is an inspiration of societal happenings. These happenings are segmented into epochs, and modernism happens to be a literary movement that is currently in vogue. What used to be the trend at a particular time will not necessarily be in another. For instance, during classical era from the fifth A.D. onwards it was old English literature or Anglo-Saxon literature. Literature at that time consisted of spoken verse and songs or poems such as epic poems composed orally. The purpose of these forms of literature was to pass along tribal history and values to a population who could not read or write.</div> <div>The Renaissance was a period when there was a rebirth of Greek and Roman literature as well as other forms of classical knowledge. The discovery of the works of classical scholars like Aristotle and Plato exerted unprecedented influence on the Renaissance man’s thought; that is secularisation of classical learning.</div> <div>The Romanticism era was a time of war, notably the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. These wars along with the political and social turmoil that came with them served as the background for the literature of this period. Their concerns were the free expression of feeling of the artist and their thematic preoccupations were the lives of the ordinary people (as opposed to classical period) and the poet‘s feelings about nature etc.</div> <br/> <div>Towards the end of the nineteenth century, globalization and industrialization coupled with the first and second World Wars brought a new literary movement into existence. This was a break away or departure from the earliest trends such as classicism, medievalism, neoclassicism, romanticism and realism. This new movement was called modernism. The era placed emphasis on newness. Modernist movement originated in Europe and North America. The proponents of this movement were mostly influenced by Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Joseph Conrad, and D. H. Lawrence among others who tended to question how rational the human mind operated. They also believed that life does not always follow the right road; instead it was rough and quite unpredictable. Therefore, their ideas were completely new and appealing to the writers of the time.</div> </div>\n\nPLACING CHINUA ACHEBE’S ANTHILLS OF THE SAVANNAH AND FRANZ KAFKA’S THE TRIAL IN THE MODERNIST LENS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PLACING CHINUA ACHEBE’S ANTHILLS OF THE SAVANNAH AND FRANZ KAFKA’S THE TRIAL IN THE MODERNIST LENS", "id": 72}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <p>The study focuses on the Lexico-Semantic features of Nigerian English in Daily Times, Punch and Vanguard Newspapers. This is an attempt to investigate the extent to which Nigerian columnists and editorials use the Lexico-semantic features of Nigerian English for their reportings. Anchored on the theoretical premise of the contextual theory of meaning, the data for the study was arrived at through a random sampling technique which enabled the researcher to select at random Newspapers from the months of January to December in the year 2012 to 2016. The identified Lexico-Semantic features of Nigerian English which were found in these dailies were analyzed using the Lexico-Semantic variation of Nigerian English as identified by Adegbija (2004). It is evident from the findings that the socio-cultural background of the Nigerian people is captured by Nigerian English. Nigerian speakers find it preferable to use NigerianEnglish, with all its local flavours because most of them are incompetent in the use of English language and also because of the socio-cultural context of the Nigerian society.</p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0      Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>            English language in Nigeria is not the same corpora in native settings. The exact date that English language usage started in Nigeria is not certain. However it is believed that the first contact between British and some ethnic groups in Nigeria was in southern Nigeria. This must have been some period before the Atlantic slave trade. English language in Nigeria is a second language. It is a second language because Nigerians already had their first language or Mother tongue (L1) before the incursion of this foreign language called ‘English’ into the country. In this instance a foreign language (English) left its native environment and met with other languages (Nigerian indigenous languages). It is true that the culture and values of the people are embedded in the language we speak. As such, it is said that ‘language is culture’ and none can be separated from another.                     </div> <div>            This situation is informed by multiple socio-cultural variables that determine what the Nigerian variety parades at different areas of linguistic analysis: phonology, morpho-syntax lexico-semantics, and pragmatics, among others. Every country in the world has people who make use of languages which help to perform several functions. Nigeria is not an exception.</div> <div>Nigeria is a country, which has people with diverse languages and cultures. English language is one of the languages spoken in Nigeria and it serves several functions for instance, business transaction, education, administration, the language of the press, the language of entertainment and also the official language.Jowitt sees Nigerian English as the variety that is spoken and written in Nigeria, other than a replica of a native speaker’s variety. This is to assert that the variety which is spoken and written in Nigeria has certain identifiable and distinct indexical markers that distinguish it from the English language varieties elsewhere. In addition, Adetugbo buttresses these views when he asserts that “Nigerian English, as a dialect of the English language has developed its own distinct and probably unique characteristics resulting from the mood of the acquisition of the language by Nigerians and the Nigerian socio-cultural setting in which it is now ”(159).</div> <div>Nigerian English is a dialect of English spoken in Nigeria. It is based on British English but in recent years, because of increasing contact with the United States of America, some American English words have made their ways into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the language, which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e,g bride price, senior wife).</div> <p>According to Ogu and Walsh “The varieties of English spoken by educated Nigerians, no matter what their language, have enough features in common to mark off a general type, which may be called Nigerian English”(88). Odumuh subdivides Nigerian English into three dialects arising from the influences of the three major....</p>\n\nTHE LEXICO-SEMANTIC FEATURES OF NIGERIAN ENGLISH IN NEWSPAPERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE LEXICO-SEMANTIC FEATURES OF NIGERIAN ENGLISH IN NEWSPAPERS", "id": 73}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This research has set out to capture the portrayal of the Nigerian Civil War in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s <em>Half of a Yellow Sun</em>by bringing out the episodes and scenes that defined the war. This is evident in the experiences of the characters in the face of war which is captured through their fears, pains and reactions as well as how it shaped their responses and eventual personalities. The research beams its search light on the central characters as they are representative microcosm of the larger Nigerian masses that fell prey to the greed and brutality of the tussle for supremacy. Incidences that point to this fact are adequately outlined. The Nigerian civil war though not a product of imagination, is crafted in the genre of fiction so as to accommodate certain issues that are relevant today, still retaining its authenticity as a historical war fiction novel that expounds on the history of the nation Nigeria. The theme of war is the trunk that grows to accommodate a lot of issues that are central to the post colonial consciousness and the challenges that are being battled with even today. From the study, it is obvious that poor conflict management can quickly degenerate to regrettable consequences. </div> <div><strong>   CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>                                             GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0    Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Nigeria as a nation came into existence after the amalgamation of the southern and northern protectoratesin 1914 by the British administration headed in Nigeria by Lord Lugard. This was primarily because of their economic interest, and Nigeria, having a vast territory afforded them the opportunity to loot as much as they wanted.The British had earlier settled in the south and established schools, churches etc. The Yoruba’swere educated home and abroad, and had gotten used to the ways of the colonialists. The north however, posed a greater challenge to the British because they saw the British as bringing a new culture and religion; since they had embraced Islam centuries earlier. As a result, the influence of the new culture could not penetrate easily to the north as it did in the south.</div> <div>Subsequently,Nigeria gained independence from Britain and inherited a country that was torn along ethnic, cultural and religious lines which was deliberately orchestrated. The northerners felt the British had given them the torch to lead the new nation into the promise land. The south on the other hand believed they were more equipped mentally and educationally to steer the affairs of the newly birthed nation. The tussle for whom to rule gave birth to coups and counter coups which finally hatched a full blown civil war.Odenigbo asserts to the fact that “the only authentic identity for the African is the tribe”(33).Indeed, this created and became a viable weapon in the hands of the colonialists to orchestrate a division that became rife with hatred. Thus, the amalgamationfavoured the British but worked against the country generally because of the divergent tribes and ideologies which could not coexist as a single entity.</div> <div>Because of the topic under scrutiny, it is essential to relay the brief history as well as thereasons that precipitated the war. The Nigerian civil war was a reality that hit the emerging Nigerian nation from 1967-1970. The three year war brought a lot of catastrophe to a fledglingnation that had just been granted independence. Due to intense population growth and the shortage of work in the east, the Igbo’s started migrating to the northern part of the country that was not too open to the British influence. Job opportunities abounded, and the land provided a fertile footing for those that wanted to veer into agricultural production. Thus, the Igbo’s flourished in trade and business generally.</div>\n\nA DEPICTION OF THE NIGERIAN CIVIL WAR IN CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’SHALF OF A YELLOW SUN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A DEPICTION OF THE NIGERIAN CIVIL WAR IN CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’SHALF OF A YELLOW SUN", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This study is a critical discourse analysis of negation in the inaugural speeches of two Nigerian Presidents.

The knowledge to be derived from this study will enable one to analyse political speeches such as campaigns and formal speeches delivered by political figures and also the functions of negation in such speeches.</div> <div><strong>1.1       Background to the Study    </strong></div> <div>            Language is used as a means of communication, which helps people to interact with one another socially and emotionally in our society. Human beings understand each other by the process of speaking. Philips etalcited in Ahmed, views speaking as the comment that holds friendships, families, communities, societies and government together (1). Thus, for any significant development to occur in a society, people have to engage in communication. One of the ways of studying language use in the society is discourse analysis. Discourse is a means of communication seen as transaction between a speaker and a hearer and as inter-personal activities whose form is determined by its social purpose. Discourse Analysis on the other hand focuses on the structures of natural occurring spoken Languages found in ‘discourse’ as in conversations and speeches. Critical Discourse Analysis is a branch of Discourse Analysis that perceives Language use as a social practice. The users of Language do not function in isolation, but in a set of cultural, social and psychological frameworks. CDA accepts this social context and studies the connections between textual structures by taking this social context into account and explores the link between textual structures and their function within the society.</div> <p>            Fairclough in his definition perceives CDA as; discourse analysis which aims to systematically explore often opaque relationships of causality and determination between (a) discursive practice, events and texts, and (b) wider social and cultural structures, relations and processes; to investigate how such practices events and texts arise out of and are ideologically shaped by relationships between discourse and society is itself a factor securing power and hegemony (135). “Critical’ implies showing connections and causes which are hidden; it also implies intervention, for example, providing resources for those who may be disadvantaged through change” (Fairclough). CDA studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality are enacted, reproduced and restricted by text and talk in the social and political context. Language is used in discourse and every language has the ability to express negation. Negation modifies information which is present in the common ground of discourse. It is a general feature of language.</p>\n\nA CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF NEGATION IN THE INAUGURAL SPEECHES OF TWO NIGERIAN PRESIDENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF NEGATION IN THE INAUGURAL SPEECHES OF TWO NIGERIAN PRESIDENT", "id": 75}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study analyses some selected Nigerian English expressions.

An effective communication processing approach should remain the bedrock of any language study. Linguistics of all persuasions seems to agree that a language should be viewed as a system, a set of elements, each of which has a function of contributing to the working of the whole (Beangrande and Oressler 1992:3) language and society develop side by side and social change brings about linguistics change.</p> <p>The global spread of the English language as one of the most far reaching linguistic phenomena of our time is already an established fact evidence of the world wide phenomenon of language contact variation and change can be seen through such designations as world English new English, Modern English, West African English, south African English, Australian English, Indian English to mention just a few.</p> </div>                                                         \n\nSEMANTIC ANALYSIS OF NIGERIAN ENGLISH EXPRESSION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SEMANTIC ANALYSIS OF NIGERIAN ENGLISH EXPRESSION", "id": 76}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1       Background to the study</p> <p>Code-switching is the use of more than one language, variety, or style by a speaker within an utterance or discourse, or between different interlocutors or situations (Romaine, 1992:110).  In linguistics, code-switching occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more languages, or language varieties, in the context of a single conversation (Richard, 2005). However, Wardhaugh (2012: 103), states that code mixing occurs when a conversant use both languages together to the extent that they change from one language to the other in the course of a single utterance. It means that the conversant just changes some of the elements in their utterance. Code mixing takes place without a change of topic and can involve various levels of language, e.g., morphology and lexical items.</p> <p>Code-mixing and code-switching are important aspects of sociolinguistics because of their use and status in the society. The continued exploration of various facets of code change is therefore not a surprise, as it has more than just (socio) linguistic, anthropological and psychological implications. To the extent that the way people talk is the expression of their personal, social, cultural and other identities, it is not an exaggeration to say that it actually affects the majority of the world’s population and, although has often been viewed as a stigmatized form of bilingual discourse, there is no doubt that learning more about the underlying rules of code-switching can only contribute to more awareness among speakers of poles apart (Adetuyi and Jegede, 2016).</p> <p>Different reasons have been put forward by various authors and researchers to explain why people mix code and code switch. It is obvious that they have negative and positive effects on the use of the language. It then becomes necessary that these concepts related to human society and our educational system receive sufficient attention to be known and also used effectively where it is needed. In a society where people speak more than one language, there is usually one language naturally influenced by others. Some of the effects of multilingualism are code mixing and code change, bilingualism, diglossia, and so on. When a speaker comes into contact with two or more languages, he can start using the languages ​​together, even if it is not necessarily with equal competence. However, these languages ​​influence each other and often lead to code mixing and code switching (Kuntze, 2000). A typical context showing that speakers’ mix or switch codes can be found in Jenifa Diary.</p> <p>However, Jenifa’s Diary is a Nigerian television comedy series, created by Funke Akindele. The series is part of the Jenifa franchise, based on a naive and funny character of the same name. Jenifa’s Dairy has over 11 (possibly going to 13) seasons and is currently active and ongoing (Ikeke, Nkem, 2017). This series tells a story of a native village girl who desperately wants to get out of her ratchet way of life. In her desperation she leaves her village and goes to the city of Lagos in order to process her visa to travel to the United States. Although unsuccessful with her visa application she decides to stay in Lagos and live a better life. She then finds herself in University of Lagos, with the help of a lady she met, Toyo baby (Olayode Juliana) and Kiki (Lota Chukwu) who help and accommodate her (Izuzu Chidumga, 2017).</p> <p>Jenifa is unsuccessful with her education but she gets a job at Nikki’o salon on the Island with the help of her friend kiki and she becomes very successful in her hair styling career. At Nikki’o saloon she meets another stylist, Segun (Folarin ‘Falz’ Falana) who becomes interested in her but she at first rejects him, but later accepts his proposal after he goes to America and they both get engaged (Ikeke, Nkem, 2017). All over the country, people always in anticipation of the next episode on the series, the excitement almost grew to a feverish pitch. Even old men and women were hardened fans. But that ain’t the most amazing part. The most amazing part is how young people all over the country, especially the females, have resorted to speaking like Jenifa, the series’ main character, who’s major selling point was her corrupted form of English (Anozie, 2017).</p> <p>On the other hand, by virtue of communicative configuration, imitated speech can be used. It should be stressed that Jenifa’s Diary allows for a dramatized discourse; it can create, correlate, and contrast different speakers. By so doing, it imitates real life scenarios of the deployments of different languages in a typical oral discourse among Nigerians.</p> <p>But on a lighter yet more serious note, this trend might not be bad, but it definitely ain’t productive. And why do something unproductive when the time could be better spent doing the opposite. And for those arguing that English is not our mother tongue, it might not be our mother tongue, but it is still the official language. And it is still a compulsory subject in o’level and all other sorts of exams (Anozie, 2017). It is on this note that this study intends to find out what motivated code switching and code mixing in some of the characters in Jenifa’s Diary Episodes, and it also intends to find out why.</p> <p>1.2       Statement of the problem</p> <p>A few studies have been carried out on bilingual speakers of English. Some of the studies focus on the way speakers of English code switch and mix between different language codes in their daily dialogues or conversations. All these studies drew their data from real life contexts. None of them investigated the use of code switch and mix in dramatized utterances. Investigating code switch and code mixing in Jenifa’s Diary Episodes will assist us in identifying how these phenomena are used among Nigerians. This is the gap this study intends to fill.</p> <p>1.3       Aims and objectives</p> <p>This research work intends to investigate code switching and code mixing in selected Jenifa’s Diary Episodes. This study sets to achieve the following objectives:</p> <p>1.</p> <p>2.</p> <p>3.</p> <p>4</p> <p>1.5       Significance of the study</p> <p>The research will x-ray the possible social relevance of code switching and code mixing in TV soap opera in a multilingual Nigeria. The results of the study will assist in creating a better understanding of the code switching and mixing phenomenon amongst Nigerian bilinguals. Finally, it is hoped that this study will serves as a reference material for further research in this area.</p>                                                          \n\nA SOCIOLINGUISTIC ANAYSIS OF CODE SWITCHING AND CODE MIXING IN SELECTED JENIFA’S DIARY EPISODES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SOCIOLINGUISTIC ANAYSIS OF CODE SWITCHING AND CODE MIXING IN SELECTED JENIFA’S DIARY EPISODES", "id": 77}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>.1       Background of the study</p> <p>The essayists and scholars have called the abuse of children’s rights a troubled childhood. Edgar Fred Nabutanyi, in his thesis titled “Representations of troubled childhood in an African fiction selected after 1990”, defines disrupted childhood as “the experience of children exposed to different forms of abuse, including physical violence, psychological, sexual and emotional “(iv). . When the rights of a child are violated, it simply means that certain privileges deemed socially or morally acceptable are harmed. Michelle Maiese said that “talking about rights allows us to express the idea that all people are part of the scope of morality and justice”. He noted that:</p> <p>Protecting human rights means ensuring that people receive decent and decent human treatment. On the other hand, to violate the most fundamental human rights is to deny individuals their fundamental moral rights. In a sense, it is about treating them as if they were less than human and did not deserve respect and dignity. Examples are acts generally described as “crimes against humanity”, including genocide, torture, slavery, rape, forced sterilization or medical experimentation, and deliberate starvation. (Hubert 144)</p> <p>The Longman dictionary of contemporary English gives different definitions of the word “child”: it defines “child” as “someone who is not yet an adult” and “a son or a girl of any age”. The old definition, which is “someone who is not yet adult,” implies that something is missing. “Deprivation” is a word that Heidegger uses to identify something missing at one point and Leena Kakkori in his essay “What are little children? A philosophical study of the essence of the little child from Heidegger’s concept of privation is referring “to a possibility of being and not merely to a propositional negation”, to define a child as “a human being who has a privation of adulthood.”</p> <p>On the whole, children in their growth and development stage will definitely have contact with adults. These can be closely related adults like their parents, siblings, uncles, aunts etc, and naturally, these children are vulnerable to these adults in their lives as they depend on them totally for virtually everything. It is left for these adults, especially the mother and father, to protect and nurture the rights of these children. When instead of protecting these rights, “the domestic security of these children is ruptured” as Nabutanyi observes in his dissertation, “the safety of the home space and the bedroom is compromised and the cost of violence is traumatically borne by children” (92). The word ‘domestic’ usually implies the sense of protection, comfort and the place where one can feel one’s own identity.(Priya K. 52). Violation of any kind and from any direction, inflicted on children, usually affects them physically and psychologically; greater is the damage when it comes from the parents’ direction.  There is a kind of parallelism in the depiction of Ama’s childhood captured in Unigwe’s On Black Sisters’ Street with that of Kambili and Jaja in Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus in terms of extremist male parent that exhibit dogmatic traits. What is also found in both books is silence of the victims and powerlessness of the female parent to prevent or protect the child from being violated or victimized upon by the father/ father figure. The violation acts inflicted on these children affect their ability to discover and be their real self. Tuomaala points out that “at home, Kambili learns to imitate her father’s behaviour and values” (2). This is naturally imperative for Kambili because doing otherwise will earn her extreme retribution from her authoritative father. Opata asserts that “Freedom is a human being’s greatest asset and right. There are many basic freedoms which are essential for the dignity and integrity of the human person…these freedoms are foundational in the formation of one’s personality…”(qtd. in Orabueze 60). When a child is violated, especially in the domestic sphere, the home becomes a cage that represses the true self of the child. The victims of child abuse or violation, in the long run, are most often tied down emotionally and psychologically to their violators (exhibiting traits or characteristics imposed on them or brought upon them by their violators) and this affects their ability to form their own personality and be their true self. After a keen observation of the lives of the children depicted in the two books to be explored in this study, it can be explicitly stated that without self-discovery, these children would remain psychologically tied down to the violence inflicted on them. While Kambili and Jaja through the help of Aunty Ifeoma are able to discover themselves, the same is not the case for Ama in Unigwe’s On Black Sisters’ Street and this colors the choice she makes later in life. In other words, finding one’s self, as Heidegger implies in his “Being and Time”, is the key to ultimate freedom. This self-discovery is implied in one of the ‘intertwined’ Heidegerrian concepts that looks into the nature of human existence, referred to as ‘authenticity’ which Kierkegaard views as such: ““authentic existence is a herculean task requiring that we ‘choose’ ourselves in order to overcome or transcend those elements of life that we have no choice over, such as our parentage, biological makeup and place of birth” (Matthew McDonald 58).</p> <p>Existentialism sheds light on the vulnerability of children in the world. Heidegger’s concept of throwness sheds light on how beings are thrown into the world, without any choice of theirs, and as children; they are totally dependent on other beings around them for their survival. These other beings can sometimes become predators to these vulnerable beings newly thrown into the world, as is the case for Kambili and Jaja, who become preys to the frequent violent outbursts of their father, Eugene in Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus while Ama in Unigwe’s On Black Sisters’ Street falls prey to the animalistic desire of one whom she calls father. That been said, the pre-occupation of this project will be to investigate the violated states of these children and how it prevents them from being their own self and also to explore the process of their self-discovery which opened the way for the attainment of their total freedom.</p> <p>1.2       Statement of the Problem</p> <p>The thrust of this project is to study cases of child abuse using an existentialist perspective. Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus is a widely read book that have mostly been studied for its depiction of domestic violence, most times a bulk of the study is usually centred on the woman which falls in line with womanist or feminist criticism while some other works that have studied the text using the bildungsroman concept often allegorize the oppression in the home, of the children specifically, as a representation or show glass of the nation. The concentration of the studies of Unigwe’s On Black Sisters’ Street on the other hand, has mostly been based on diaspora or psychoanalytic theories. This project will focus on the abuse of children in toto, not as a show glass for something else; the reason for the unveiling of existentialist thoughts unto the issue of child violation is in order to acutely observe the vulnerability of children and also to see how freedom from the psychological effects of violation comes only after self-discovery has taken place.</p> <p>1.3       Significance of the Study:</p> <p>These two books, as far as personal research is concerned, are yet to be juxtaposed for a study of their depiction of child abuse. While Purple Hibiscus has been studied for child abuse, the studies have been based on theories like trauma theory, psychoanalytic theory, identity theory etc. This project is significant in that it applies existentialist thoughts to the treatment of child violation in both books. This allows one to be acutely aware of the extent of children’s vulnerability and how violating children’s rights lead them to live an “inauthentic existence”, which they can be free from only when they discover themselves.</p> <p>1.4       Objective of the Study:</p> <p>The general objective of this study is to investigate the abuse of children’s rights. Looking into the effects that these abuses have on the identity or mineness, according to Heidegger, of these children; journeying down to the moment of self realization and the process of self-discovery that resulted in the attainment of total freedom.</p> <p>1.5       Scope of the Study:</p> <p>Narrowing the abuse of children’s rights to the domestic sphere, the childhood lives of the characters to be studied are that of Kambili and Jaja in Purple Hibiscus and Ama in On Black Sisters’ Street. Using specifically, Heidegger’s concept of the nature of human existence.</p>                                                          \n\nABUSE OF CHILDREN’S RIGHTS: AN APPRAISAL OF CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S PURPLE HIBISCUS AND UNIGWE’S ON BLACK SISTERS’ STREET<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ABUSE OF CHILDREN’S RIGHTS: AN APPRAISAL OF CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S PURPLE HIBISCUS AND UNIGWE’S ON BLACK SISTERS’ STREET", "id": 78}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1     Background of the study</p> <p>Constructively, a sentence is an anthology of words that convey meaning and meaning and are formed according to the common sense of grammar. Short and unambiguous sentences are mostly considered and more effective for long and complex sentences. Apparently, sentence is a linguistic unit of one or more words that communicate an autonomous articulation, a question, a request, a summons, a cry, etc., and which usually has a subject and a predicate. However, a sentence typically begins with a capital letter and ends with an appropriate punctuation; in speech, it displays decipherable, unrestrained intonation patterns and is again and again marked by the preceding and following pauses. In general, the statements and questions about the irresistible preponderance of sentences force a subject and a verb, formatted autonomously, followed by what is called an independent clause: for example, he took the phone is a sentence . After hitting the phone, it’s not a sentence; as a replacement, it is a dependent clause. Even if he has a subject and a verb, he must be connected to something to complete the statement: after picking up the phone, he answered a call; or He answered a call after picking up the phone (Amayo, 2013).</p> <p>It is important to note that the sentences provide us with the structure necessary for an understandable written sentence. However, good writing skills are intrinsically vital to academic and professional success. The ability to write unequivocally and competently can transform complex and challenging writing into a more creative, exciting and fulfilling writing experience. In a more lucid sense, phrase learning is one of the most important ways to improve your English writing skills. On the other hand, writing is constructed by placing the sentences one after the other, in a coherent way. If a single sentence is read aloud, it must be explainable and devoting time to the mechanics of sentence structure can make a huge difference in your writing (Kachru, 2014). ). Typically, sentences are comprised of clauses: gatherings of words that express a solitary thought. Given to that, there are two types of clauses:</p> <p>independent clauses</p> <p>dependent clauses.</p> <p>Actually, independent clauses can situate unaccompanied as complete sentences whereas dependent clause needs an independent clause to complete its meaning by so doing different types of sentences are made up of different combinations of these two types of clauses.</p> <p>Simple sentencesconsist of just one independent clause; it needs only one punctuation mark at the end (a full stop, exclamation or question mark).</p> <p>Compound sentencesare made by fusion simple sentences. Meaning that sentences joined which are intimately allied in content to make the writing more fluid.</p> <p>Complex sentencesare made once there is combination of an independent clause with a dependent clause whereby the dependent clause in the following example is in italics.</p> <p>However, sentence stress come to play if one need to emphasize a specific fact or point in a text, there are more than a few ways to focus the reader’s or listener’s attention on it.</p> <p>Imperatively, arrangement of words: by placing an introductory word at the commencement of a sentence, for that reason, the writer makes the reader pay attention to that word; the reader is then alert for the rest of the sentence. Undoubtedly, the English language has a towering frequency of homographic vocabulary and however, this linguistic observable fact habitually results in phonological and lexical ambiguities as well as delays in lexical and pronunciation decisions by L2 readers, more than ever those that are not capable of exploring contextual clues in pronouncing the words and ‘Improper’ or ‘incorrect’ pronunciation of some English words, primarily the homographic ones, during reading or speech making has often come with its attendant challenges and complexities for speakers of English globally. Notably, earlier researchers who have worked on this observable fact have based their studies on inter-lingual factors associated with some sociolinguistic chemistry of languages in contact and this contact circumstances has given birth to many world Englishes ( Kachru 2014, Crystal 2015 and Schneider 2003). But further than these inter-lingual circumstances, there are some intricacies inbuilt in English which pose pronunciation challenges to speakers of the language generally and second language (L2) users in particular whereby Bryson (2015) and Soneye (2007) have identified the impact of spelling on the pronunciation of speakers of English and as well, Amayo (2013) have identified the supra-segmental as the ‘unlearn-able’ aspect of English in an L2 context. Nevertheless away from these problems of English orthography and supra-segmental features is that one posed by homographic words to speakers of English in general and to the L2 speakers in particular and the reasons for this are numerous in that English homographic words are words having same spellings but with double or different pronunciations. However, this duality of elocution over and over again results in what Frost, Feldman and Katz (2012) call lexical vagueness. For example, ‘read’ (present tense) is pronounced as /rí: d/ while the past tense form of the same word is pronounced / red /.</p> <p>Uncertainty is a phenomenon of human language including English and wherever it occurs, it demands more than one denotation in that it manifests at the phonological, lexical, syntactic and semantic levels of language in which at all of these levels, the outcome is communication failure or miscommunication and in other words, meaning is obscured and when this happens, defective communication comes about. It turns out to be exceptionally fundamental at this point to build up the relationship in the middle of orthography and phonology from one perspective and phonology and importance on the other. Frost et al (2012:569) express the perspective that vagueness can exist in the connection between the orthographic and phonological types of a word or between the phonological structure and its semantic representation. The purpose of union in the middle of phonology and semantics is that both help in representing meaning. A word is a phonological structure; its phonological representation is its lexical passage. Passing by this, each homographic word is given two unique passages with a specific end goal to separate it semantically. In any case, English does not have any type of visual marker (as tonal dialects do) to separate these homographic words and their different elocution suggestions. This frequently brings about semantic uncertainty. On the flip side, this study wants to investigate empirically the challenges posed by English homographic words to some students of ObafemiAwolowo University, Ile-Ife with a sight to ascertaining their impact on communication among Nigerian undergraduates.</p> <p>1.2     Statement of the problem</p> <p>Moreover, Simpson (2015) identifies some of the effects of semantic uncertainty on visual word acknowledgment. Since words in this class have twofold passages, the likelihood of experiencing one of them is more noteworthy than the shot of identifying single section. At the point when bivalent words are perused as two distinct elements, they prompt postponement choice in right articulation as per-users set aside time to match elocution with importance. Undesirably, this is not a sweeping standard, and there are bounties of English words which sound the same both as verbs and as nouns: ‘travel’ (He works in a Travel Agency and he hopes to travel by air to Abuja), ‘picture’ (He remembered taking the picture at a studio but could not picture precisely which studio.) are a few examples. These arrangements of words are both phonologically and semantically unambiguous. The setting of utilization as a rule decides the real open ramifications of such lexical things.</p> <p>In an L2 context, when a speaker pronounces ‘REcord’ instead of ‘reCORD’, it prompts miscommunication which, in another speech, can be called clamor. In any correspondence experience, there is the requirement for input. The adequacy of the input is subject to the capacity of the listener/reader to appropriately decipher the real messages conceived by the speaker/writer at both the intra and interpersonal levels of communication. The sending of the message in verbal communication bases upon the correct elocution of words in the language in question. Once words are not correctly pronounced, particularly homographic words, they amount to noise. Noise, for this situation, is introduced as anything that meddles with, slows down, or reduces the clearness or correctness of communication.  One effortlessly saw impact of error is vagueness with its specialist duality of implications in the psyche of the listeners/readers. Challenges postured by these English homographic to L2 learners and how they respond to such a word.</p> <p>Homography as an etymological marvel is not absolutely odd to Nigerian speakers of English. This wonder exists in the different indigenous languages spoken by them. On the other hand, these languages are tonal in nature as a consequence of which words with comparative spellings are checked or declared diversely because of the diacritic signs put on them. These signs help in showing the phonological contextualization that takes into consideration right elicitation of the word as expected by the encoder in a composed content. Tone blemishes on a few words in Nigerian languages, like Yoruba for example, help in making the importance of words particular. This capacity of tone is alluded to as ‘semantic phonemicity’ (Atoye, 2014:48). For instance, the following Yoruba homographic words are made particular with the diverse tone blemishes on them: ‘Obe’ (knife) with the tone mark LM is made different from ‘Obe’ (soup) with the tone ML and this phonological contextualization admissible in Yoruba language is missing in English were L2 speakers of English with this type of backdrop are introduced to different types of homographs without any hint of phonological contextualization.</p> <p>In view of the fact that English does not stain out stress placement on words in a usual text apart from in broad or narrow transcriptions, L2 learners are expected to depend on practical contextualization previous to written texts can be read and proper meanings decoded by them and this chore of practical contextualization demands higher level of language awareness on the part of L2 readers. Words that are phonologically unclear are not challenging to skilled readers but are so to preschooler and unskilled readers who translate a string into more than one conceivable phonological acknowledgment that maps into more than single word in their vocabulary.</p> <p>1.3     Aims and objective of the problem</p> <p>The general aim is to examine the use of sentence stress among some undergraduate students of the ObafemiAwolowo University Ile Ife,</p> <p>Specifically the study sought to:</p> <p>examine sentence stress between some undergraduate students</p> <p>determine homographic words challenges to L2 learners</p> <p>establish the alternativeused by the students in avoiding homographic words</p> <p>assess undergraduate student’s reading capability</p> <p>1.4     Justification of the study</p> <p>It has been scrupulously evaluated that normal speakers of a language know from 45,000 to 60,000 words. On the other hand, this shows that optimistically one must have kept these words someplace in the heads, known as mental lexicon. However, in non-specialized each day talk, one talk about “words” while never imagining this could be a problematic idea. It has been contended that the word could be characterized in four other courses: as far as sound structure (i.e. phonologically), regarding it’s inside honesty, as far as significance (i.e. semantically), or as far as sentence structure (i.e. grammatically). Notably, one might have thought that the vacant spaces in writing mirror pauses in the spoken language, and that conceivably one could define the word as a unit in speech surrounded by pauses. However, in circumspectly listening to naturally occurring speech one will apprehend that speakers do not make pauses before or after each word and conceivably one could say that words can be surrounded by potential pauses in speech.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, this decisive factor works much better, although it runs into problems because speakers can and do make pauses not only between words but also between syllables, for example for emphasis. Although there is another way of how the sound structure can tell us something about the nature of the word as a linguistic unit in that one should think of stress and in countless languages (including English) the word is the unit that is fundamental for the occurrence and distribution of stress whereby spoken in isolation, every word can have only one main stress, as indicated by the acute accents (´) in the data presented in (3) below (note that one speak of linguistic ‘data’ when we refer to language examples to be analyzed).</p> <p>(3) –carpenter, textbook,  wáter analysis, féderal syllable, mótherunderstánd</p> <p>Without doubt, the main stressed syllable is the syllable which is the most prominent one in a word.</p> <p>Notably, prominence of a syllable is a role of intensity, pitch and length, with stressed syllables being pronounced louder, by means of elevated pitch, or with longer duration than the neighboring syllable(s) in which longer words repeatedly have superfluous, weaker stresses, known to be secondary stresses, which often ignore here for straightforwardness’s sake of which often times terms to be deliberate act of short cut.</p> <p>1.5     Scope of the study:</p> <p>The scope of this study is not expected to grasp in detail all that may have been needed to develop the topic of the study in view of its wide and its natural troubles associated with obtaining data because of time constrictions which will obstruct a useful detailed development of the research topic.</p> <p>1.6     Methodology</p> <p>Methodological methodology entails data collection whereby the subjects were made to read some semantically biased sentences containing some homographic lexical items and the subjects’ readings were recorded and analyzed.

This study will attempt to make readers realize these themes in Richard Wright’s Black Boy by analyzing the concept of racial segregation of Black in America. We will examine the historical perspective of Black writing narrative and the effects of racism, which include poverty, hunger assault etc. and the ways through which the blacks reacted to racism. We can claim that Black American literature was written to oppose racism and oppression in all ramifications and also to gain self pride and identity.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>Racism changes its form, as well as strength, over time and from place to place. It manifests itself in different forms in Australia today. Indeed, it is this changing quality of racism which makes it difficult to identify and challenge, and which helps make racism so contentious an issue today. First, people are identified as members of a group because of their physical appearance, culture or ethnic origin, real or supposed. Secondly, they are judged according to the presumed characteristics of that group. Thus people are being labelled, and those labels are often on the basis of stereotypes of the group (Cardwell, 1991).</p> <p>Stereotypes are generalised images of people in a particular group or category, which are held whether or not most, or even some, people in that category fit the image. We are constantly categorising people and things, and making generalisations about them, for we have neither the time nor the information to make new judgments each time we meet an individual or enter into a new situation. However, stereotypes are relatively fixed generalisations, which are reinforced by selective perception and selective forgetting — we notice characteristics or behaviour which confirms our views; we overlook or rationalise away the many exceptions (Beaver &amp; Harold, 1974). Hence stereotypes are exaggerated or distorted pictures of others. Even where they reflect elements of truth, these are usually misinterpreted, or combined with inaccurate and derogatory images. This is made especially easy because we hold stereotypes about many groups without having any personal experience of them (Brown, 1969).</p> <p>Racism in literary studies is defined by Wikipedia as the belief the of genetic factors which constitute race, are the primary determinants of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produces an inherent superiority of a particular race. Racism effects are called racial discrimination. Although the term racism usually denotes race based on prejudice, violence, dislike, discrimination or oppression. Racism is also defined simply as a reflection of the economic system and its cultural, ethnic and political ways. The concept of racism is derived from the word race and it is believed that one racial or ethnic group is inferior to another and the unequal treatment is therefore justified.</p> <p>According to Charles V. Hamilton and Kwame Ture they defined racism as “A prediction of decision and policies on consideration of race for the purpose of subordinating a racial group and maintaining control over that group”. On the other hand, oppression is defined by the encyclopedia as torture or degrading treatment and the use of threat or violence. It is also the exercise of power/authority in a burden, cruel or unjust manner. Oppression is also defined by Wikipedia as an act or instance of oppressing the state of being oppressed and the feeling of being heavily burdened; mentally or physically by troubles adverse conditions and anxiety (Charles, Hamilton and Kwame. 1986).</p> <p>It is this experience of Black Slaves that Richard Wright tries to capture in BlackBoy (1945). In the text, Wright recalls the plight of the Africans that were sold into slavery between the early 1700’s and 1860’s through the convenience of their own fellow Africans. They were transplanted to American, Canada, the Caribbean Island and other parts of the world. The Africans taken into America were now referred to as “Black Americans” while those on the Caribbean Island are called “Afro Caribbean” but they all have a common roots and common problem- Racial Discrimination. The Africans faced a great ordeal trying to survive hardship on their journey across the Atlantic Ocean on arrival to America; they were conscripted into force labour, maltreated, abused and demoralized on the cotton fields and plantation where they were put to work as slaves. As a result of this hardship deprivation and degradation, the blacks began expressing themselves through Negro spirituals which marked the beginning of the artistic expressions of the emotion. They told stories of unpleasant experience of slavery and oppression through pamphlet and short stories, which formed the basic of Black writings and which were later referred to as “Slave Narrative” or “secret text” because they were written without the knowledge of the slave owners. This inhuman trade led to the transportation of Africans to American to work as slave on the plantation where they experienced unimaginable oppression from the white owner. Many youth are ignorant of this fact and see American as a peaceful place and a bed of roses.</p> <p>1.2 RICHARD WRIGHT’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY</p> <p>Richard Wright, the grand son of slaves was born in Natchez Mississippi on 4th of September 1908. His father deserted the family in 1914. When Richard was ten years old, his mother had a paralytic shock. The family was extremely poor. After a brief education, he was forced to seek employment in other to support his mother. He had a difficult childhood which was characterized by hopelessness, insecurity and hunger as portrayed in his autobiography Novel, BlackBoy. Wright worked in a series of menial jobs in Memphis. He wanted to continue his education by using the local library but Jim Crow laws prevented this. Richard Wright solved this by pretending he was collecting a book for a white man.</p> <p>After passing a civil service exam, Wright find a job as a post office clerk. When the wall street crash and the beginning of depression was over, Wright lost his job for a period. He found employment with the Negro Burial Society but that came to an end in 1931 and he was forced to go on relief after several jobs, the relief office found his work with the Federal Writer Project. This enabled him to publish his story Superstition in the Magazine Abbot’s Monthly.</p> <p>In 1932, Wright began attending meeting of the literary group at the John Reed Club he meets several Marxist at the club and later in the year, he joined the American Communist Party. His poems, short stories and essays are accepted by various left using journal including the new masses and international literature, his poem Between The World And Me and a short story BigBoy Leaves Home were both based on the lunching of a black man that he had witnessed when he was a child.</p> <p>In May 1937, Wright moved to New York where he became Harlem editor of the daily worker and a new literary quarterly new challenge. The following year, a collection of short stories about racism in the United States titled Uncle Tom’s Chicken was publish and Wright announced that all royalties would be used to help to pay the appeal cost of Earl Browder, the general secretary of the American Communist Party who had been sentenced to four years in prison for misusing a passport.</p> <p>The publisher accepted Wright’s novel, Native Son in 1940. The book of the mouth club selected the novel as its March selection, therefore, ensuring large sales and publicity. Over a quarter of a million copies were sold within four weeks, making it the fastest selling large novel in twenty years. Wright’s next book, Twelve million Black Voices (1941) was a sociological study of black migration from the rural south to the urban north. By 1944, Wright left the American Communist Party and published an article in the Atlantic Monthly titled The God that Failed, his short novel, The Man Who Lived Underground appeared in 1944.</p> <p>Wright’s powerful autobiography and our main concentration in the project, BlackBoy is a record of childhood and youth which was published in 1945. After then, there was a wave of great hostility towards black writers, so Richard Wright fled to Paris. In 1953, Wright published The Outsider and in 1954 Savage Holding was published, when he traveled to Ghana he wrote about his experience in Black power (1954). This was followed by a collection of essays. White listen (1957), The psychological reaction of the oppressed people and the literature of the Negro in the United States.</p> <p>Wright final novel, The Long Dream was published in 1958. He died of a heart attack in Paris on 28th November 1960. Richard Wright was indeed a true voice of the Black Americans, every bit of his literary works sought to bring an end to physical and psychological oppression and also abolish racism and oppression.</p> <p>1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to determine the use language in the expression of racism of Richard Wright in his autobiography BlackBoy.</p> <p>This essay concentrates on the theme of racism in Black American literature. Our intention is to show that racism indeed is a prominent theme in BlackBoy especially because the book was written during the Jim Crow era at a point where racism was very prominent in the American society.</p> <p>It also looks at the personal understanding of the Blackman’s point of view and his situation. Examples of racism and oppression are cited in BlackBoy. This project exposes how racism and oppression affects the mentality and the way of living of the Black race, reducing them to a level of inferiority, in every aspect of their lives.</p> <p>1.4 SCOPE AND LIMITATION</p> <p>Our scope and limitation is on the theme of racism in BlackBoy by Richard Wright so as to prevent the project from being untidy and ambiguous in nature. From intense research we believe that BlackBoy, an eye witness account is accurate enough to fully express the terms of racial segregation and oppression because it has made a strong impact on American literature with its strong commentary on the cultural, political, racial and social issues going on during the period of 20th century racism.</p> <p>The very title of the book “BlackBoy” already gives us an idea of our thematic discussion because he uses the term ‘Black’ in the title to emphasize the fundamental racial facts of his life (the author Richard Wright); the black against the white. Black race subordinate to the white race which is the main and only scope and limitation.</p> <p>1.5 JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>Many works have been carried out on Black American literature majorly focusing on self identity and racism. For example Babalola (1992) “The concept of racism and crisis of self identity in James Baldwin’s Go Tell it on the Mountain (1954) and George Lamming’s Water with Berries (1972) focused on aspect of racism. Both novels highlighted the concept of self identity. The present study will be different from the works mentioned above. It will shed more light on oppression experienced by the African’s using Richard Wright’s autobiographical novel {BlackBoy}. black american literature</p> <p>1.6 METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The methodology used in this project is a Carl Jung (1952) psychological approach in literature. It is believed that this approach will best expose the inner mind and psychological torture of the Black American characters in Black Boy. Oppression and Racism are better analysed, examined and portrayed through the workings of the intellectual thinking of those affected.black american literature This approach is the only approach that has helped to review visual and close insight of confrontations and conflicts between the Blacks and the Whites. black american literature Concentration is placed on the major character which serves as the representative character for the Blacks.black american literature Through his life experience, we can deduce the predicament of the Black Americans in South Africa. black american literature</p>                                                          \n\nUSE OF LANGUAGE IN THE EXPRESSION OF RACISM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " USE OF LANGUAGE IN THE EXPRESSION OF RACISM", "id": 80}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY</p> <p>Language is a tool or a code system used for human communication. It is made up of sounds or graphic symbols, which users or speakers have accepted to use as units of communication.</p> <p>Language is a symbol system based on pure or arbitrary conventions infinitely extendable and modifiable according to the changing needs and conditions of the speakers.</p> <p>Robins (1985).</p> <p>According to Lyons (1970) Languages are:</p> <p>The principal systems of communication used by particular groups of human beings within the particular society (Linguistic community) of which they are members.</p> <p>The use of language is not restricted to only human beings but for the purpose of this study, the researcher is concentrating on language used by human beings. Language as a human property is used to perform various functions in a society such as communication, instruction and socialization, which is why its study is indispensable. Linguists over the years have studied languages and have actually expanded the wings of language to various levels of Linguistic analysis or description such as phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and Discourse.</p> <p>The graphic representation of sounds (speech sounds) on paper is called writing. Writing is done in different ways for various purposes and by different people. It is because of this that the study of stylistics becomes necessary and an important area to both linguists and critics.</p> <p>According to Syal and Jindal (2010)</p> <p>“Stylistics is that branch of linguistics which takes the language of literary texts as its object of study”.</p> <p>Stylistics is the study of various styles used in literary and non – literary texts which distinguishes the uniqueness of a writer from another.</p> <p>Style is a pattern of linguistic features that distinguish a piece of writing from another; it also distinguishes the personality of an author from another. No wonder the French scholar Buffon said “Style is the Man”.</p> <p>Syal and Jindal (2010) opined that:</p> <p>Out of the many types of variations that occur in language, it is the variation in literary style that is most complex, and thus offers unlimited scope for linguistic analysis. (61).</p> <p>Stylistics is very important in Literature because each literary text represents an individual‟s use of language which reflects his unique personality, thoughts and style.</p> <p>The study of literary styles shows the linguistics repertoire of a writer. We often hear of the style of Armah; the style of Milton and the simplicity that is associated with Wordsworth.</p> <p>Stylistics looks at the choice of words, the sentence patterns and figurative usage of words by a writer. Figurative expressions which are sometimes called “Rhetorical Expression” helps a writer to be vivid in his description of events and ideas.</p> <p>According to Ezugu:</p> <p>Figures of speech, sometimes called “rhetorical” figures are expressions, phrases or words used to convey more than their ordinary literal meaning. These figures, if properly used, not only enrich but strengthen and give life to our writing.</p> <p>Ezugu (2011)</p> <p>Some of the features used in a achieving style include:</p> <p>– Diction, figurative usage and various sentence structures such as:</p> <p>– Parenthetical Expressions: These are words, clauses or even another sentence inserted at the middle or end of a sentence such as after thoughts.</p> <p>– Compound Sentence: A compound sentence is one which consists of three or more simple sentences joined together by a co-ordinating conjunction or semi – colon.</p> <p>– Complex Sentence: A complex sentence consists of two parts. The main clause and one or more subordinate clauses.</p> <p>– Compound complex sentence: This consists of two or more main clauses and one or more subordinate clause.</p> <p>Other features of style include:</p> <p>– Graphology: The analysis of hand writing to interpret character and personality. Aspects of which are ”Italics, Bold sentence” and capitalization”.</p> <p>– Code Switching: A system of switching from one linguistic code to another.</p> <p>– Code – Mixing: A systematic way of mixing two or more linguistics codes in an utterance or writing.</p> <p>– Transliteration: This is the literal translation of the syntatical structure of a language into another language</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Although many works have been done on stylistics, little work has been done on style used in Chimamanda Adichie‟s</p> <p>Half of a yellow sun which was published in 2006. Most of the works done were based on general analysis of how her works reflect the realities of the society. To the knowledge of this researcher, no work has been done on the stylistic analysis of the devices used in her work, hence, the decision of the researcher to investigate the style of the author in this her second widely acclaimed novel Half of A yellow Sun.</p> <p>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study aims at an identification of the predominant stylistic devices used in Chimamanda Adichie‟s Half Of A Yellow Sun and the effect these devices have in the over all evaluation of the novel.</p> <p>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</p> <p>This study will enable readers identify the predominant stylistic devices used by Chimamanda Adichie in her novel Half Of A Yellow Sun as well as the effect achieved by the use of these devices.</p> <p>The study will, in addition, encourage writers to adopt the style of Chimamanda Adichie in their writing.</p> <p>Finally, it will provide material for researchers in this field.</p> <p>1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>This investigation is limited to an analysis of the predominant stylistic devices employed in Chimamanda Adichie‟s novel Half Of A Yellow Sun . The novel comprises four parts namely: PART ONE: The Early Sixties; PART TWO: The Late Sixties; Part Three: The Early Sixties‟ PART FOUR: The late sixties. These four parts are made up of a total number of the thirty seven (37) chapters but the researcher has selected twenty four chapters for analysis.</p> <p>The analysis is restricted to such stylistic devices as compound sentences; compound complex sentences, italics, code – mixing, parenthetical expression and transliteration which the researcher encountered several times in the course of reading the novel.</p> <p>1.6 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The method used in this investigation was intensive study of related materials from the library and close textual analysis of the novel Half Of A Yellow Sun using quantitative anaysis. Quantitative analysis entails identifying counting and writing down the frequency of occurrence of each of the identified stylistic devices covered in the scope of study.</p> <p>Furthermore out of the thirty seven chapters that make up the novel, twenty four chapters are selected by random sampling. All the chapters in parts one and part three respectively of the novel are selected since they contain six chapters each but in part two and part four, six chapters are selected from each part by simple random sampling since they contain more than six chapters each.</p> <p>Part two contains twelve chapters while part four contains thirteen chapters.</p>                                                          \n\n STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S HALF OF THE YELLOW SUN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S HALF OF THE YELLOW SUN", "id": 81}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Preamble</p> <p>This chapter is the general introduction to the work, it present the background of the study, the classification of the Anaan Language. The delimitation of the study and as well as the research methodology will be explored and included here in this chapter.</p> <p>A reconstruction of proto forms in Ibibios, Efik and Anaan which the research is forced on. This work is going to explore and illustrate areas of similarities and difference between the proto forms in Ibibio, Efik and Anaan but first of all undertaking a comparative reconstruction of the cognate forms of Ibibio, Efik and Anaan Languages and then undertake a lexicostatistical analysis of the language in order to arrive at a percentage of cognacy rate which will revealed whether they are the same forms, similar forms or different forms. This will enable the research to draw a conclusion about the historical and linguistic relatedness of these (3) three speech forms (Ibibio, Efik and Anaan)</p> <p>1.2. Background of the Study</p> <p>Anaan in this work, The reconstruction of proto forms in Ibibio Efik and Anaan is referred to the geo-political ethnic groups located in the south eastern part of Nigeria in the old cross River State and now in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p>Anaan according to Udo (1983: (4) is a sub group of one Ibibio because of cultural and dialectal acceptability the name Anaan is derived from their characteristic behavior which is one that is intolerant, furious and vindictive at any slightest provocation. They are generally warlike in nature. Esseien (1983: 1,2) The tribe shares a common boundary with the Ngwa and Ndoke (igbos) in Abia State in the North. They are bounded to the east by the Isuogbu igbo and to the south Eastern Ibibio.</p> <p>Anaan originated along the eastern part of Cross River and the eastern part of the Niger Delta along the boundary of the Cameroon highlands many years ago. In another postulation on the origin of the Anaan, sir, Harry Johnson in his work stated that, “The Anaan have no tradition of legend of migration that they have always been where they are” But contradictory, he however, concedes that they first settled in Eket for many years before the visit of the early Navigators in 4500 BC and the visit of the King of Egypt. Being discontent with the land allocation they had, they migration upwards until they found their present land of habitation. Essien (1983:14) revealed that this movement of the Anaan ancestors was a matter of looking for their own destination in order to differentiate themselves from being called Ibibios. This was so because they considered themselves a distinct tribe in Nigeria with their own particular language and distinction culture. Identifying Peoples</p> <p>The Anaan people major occupation is farming and craftsmanship. The land is humorously rich. This provides for active peasant farming by the natives of this tribe. Cocoyam, maize, cassava, plantain, beans fluted pumpkin etc are the major crops cultivated by the people of the Anaan. Identifying Peoples</p> <p>According to Essien (1983:19) stated that the Anaan people were “the first ethnic group who settled down to cultivate farms and were the first to discover yam tuber as food. Identifying Peoples</p> <p>Apart from subsistence farming the people  of Anaan engage themselves in commercial farming a situation where they sell their farm products are sole out to neighboring town in the state. The Anaan people are reportedly blessed with numbers of privately own garri processing industries, likewise palm oil processing industries raffia as well as kola nut are also found among them.</p> <p>Livestock farming and fishing are not left out in their enterprise quite a large number of household near pigs. Goats and dogs. The Anaan are further reported in craftsmanship, carving and other artistic vocation. The major local government areas that constitutes the Anaan tribe includes Ikot EKpene, Abak, Ukanafu,, Etim Ekpo Ekpe Atia, Ikono etc. Anaan has eight market days in a month. These are Editaha, Etim, Ofionetuk, or Ekpenyong, Edere Obo, Urua Obom, Urua Ekpe and Edet, these names were given by the Anaan ancestor and their names were derived from different semi god or commonly knows as “D Ndem’ these days are special to the Anaan. Identifying Peoples</p> <p>The term Anaan refers to both the people and their language. Therefore like most tribes in Akwa Ibom State which are named after their languages Anaan is the language spoken by the Anaan people. The language is a variety of the lower Cross language. Identifying Peoples</p> <p>According to GreenBerge (1963) classification, the language grouped in the Benue-Congo branch of the Niger-Congo languages family. Williamson (1982) on the other hand with single alternation classified Anaan under the lower cross of the Benue-Congo sub group of the Niger-Congo. The language has great similar feature of Ibibio and Efik language structure, though in some cased the structure of Anaan language could be difficult compared with the Efik and Ibibio language due to pronunciation and narration. However, Anaan is a dialect of Ibibio according to Udo (1983)”The Anaan are Ibibio people speaking a dialect of Ibibio Udo (1983:49) the dialect was spoken by their ancestors many thousand years ago along the cross River the language like most other indigenous languages has been influenced by Eastern educational system but Verbal Arts are still verb much inherent. Identifying Peoples</p> <p>1.3. Statement of the Problem</p> <p>The Main aim of this work is to reconstruct the proto forms in Ibibio, Efik and Anaan language. The intention is not unconnected with the fact that there has no work on this work in relation to Anaan. The problems of the so-called minority language such as Anaan are multi-dimensional</p>                                                          \n\n LANGUAGE AND CULTURE AS A TOOL OF IDENTIFYING PEOPLES TRIBE/ETHNIC GROUP IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  LANGUAGE AND CULTURE AS A TOOL OF IDENTIFYING PEOPLES TRIBE/ETHNIC GROUP IN NIGERIA", "id": 82}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>·         <strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Many societies have beliefs rooted deep in ancient religion. Some beliefs include polygamy, polytheism, and patriarchy, or rule by men. One such culture is that of Achebe’s Things Fall Apart. Polytheism and polygamy are custom in the clan, and the role of each family member is much defined. The men are overly domineering. The women and children are treated poorly and often beaten. Life in Achebe’s Umuofia would seem very different to someone living in modern day America (Wehrs, David, 2011: 10).</p> <p>Although some cultural variance exists, the primary role of a family in society is to foster an environment where children learn skills, morals and values. Families provide initial socialization for children that shape their self-worth, attitudes, values and behaviors. Families create structure and stability in the lives of family members.Families provide individuals with an important support system, not just during childhood but throughout life, and they provide society with a structure for passing along a culture’s values from one generation to the next. Both of these roles are crucial for a culture to maintain consistency as decades and centuries go by.One of the more tragic events in a child’s life happens when parents fail to provide the structure of support. The role of the family in society is also significant, because the family is the transmitting unit of the values of a culture for the next generation. When people learn the right ways to behave and handle themselves at home, then they are more likely to contribute effectively to society and have a content, productive life. Families that do not transmit those values do a disservice to society (Weiss, Brian, 2010: 23).</p> <p>However, family and its role in a community is being challenged and explored. This institution contains expanding ideals of structure and purpose according to experts and others. The family organization, like any other, has issues and consequences. These consequences can be positive and negative, large and small. Communities and nations are affected by contemporary families though moral and economic debates. In turn, the political community is also affected by families. Many subtopics found in politics such as marriage, abortion, violence, and economics are viewed as separate issues (Twyning, John. 2009: 13).</p> <p>Portraying women in Nigerian family based the postcolonial literature and gender discrimination, ChimamandaNgoziAdichie’s debut novel Purple Hibiscus, the award-winning from highly-acclaimed collection. There are many works were authors hope to uncover whether the term “patriarchal society” means the absence of women’s rights and to what degree traditionalism on the one hand and the advent of modernity on the other hand has the impact on the position of Nigerian women today. Adichie focuses primarily on Igbo women since she is of Igbo descent and her novels as well as short stories are set mainly in the south-eastern part of Nigeria, where the Igbo ethnic group is predominant, and in the USA, where the author emigrated when she was nineteen years old. Throughout history, the position of women in Nigerian society has been changing, and depends largely on the specific historical period (Ozioko, 2012:17).</p> <p>The depiction of women’s participation in politics and their representation in the public sphere are undoubtedly of great significance since gender equality is the natural foundation for any democratic society and both have an enormous impact on the private sphere as well. Regarding women, Adichie depicts primarily female characters that are, despite the negative portrayals of suppressed and submissive women in Western literature, educated, strong, emancipated and fighting for their rights whenever necessary. Thanks to writers like Chinua Achebe, Adichie’s inspiration, who is considered the father of Nigerian literature, she has discovered the power of telling stories about characters she can identify with – real Nigerians. Adichie is a literary descendant of Achebe’s storytelling tradition, but, unlike him, she pays great attention to women and gives them a chance to narrate from their own female perspectives. Adichie’s work represents an amalgam of tradition and modernity, which stands as a parallel to Igbo traditional values and colonial and postindependence modernity. The author observes how traditional and modern ways of living and thinking influence contemporary Nigerien women (Oyewumi, Oyeronke, 2013).</p> <p>Both, Achebe’s Nwoye and Adichie’sJaja ultimately forsake their childhood and family identity by rebelling against their patriarchal and tyrannical fathers. Though, these two young men act in rebellion out of divergent motivations, and convey somewhat different results, the situations still strike similar in their theme and placement within the structure of each respective text. Furthermore, Nwoye and Jaja illustrate the negative repercussions of oppressive rule on individual development, family ties, and progressive futures. The conventions of masculinity in the form of fathers ultimately lead to social disintegration as the sons’ rebellion marks when things fall apart (Otagburuagu, 2014: 256).</p> <p>Both Okonkwo in <em>Things Fall Apart,</em> and Eugene in <em>Purple Hibiscus,</em> represent a very rigid sense of masculinity in which traces of flexibility and weakness are not only frowned upon, but completely unaccepted. The two overbearing fathers eventually motivate Nwoye and Jaja to disregard their authority radically and, in a sense, turn away from their families and their roots in order for introspection and self-development.  The unsettling feelings and questioning Nwoye experienced as an adolescent later manifest into complete rebellion after the exposure of British missionaries. White missionaries had come to multiple Ibo villages, proclaiming the Gospel and God’s love and faith for his followers while attempting to debunk conventional Ibo superstition and pagan belief. Already wary of Ibo ways, Nwoye was captivated by the “poetry of the new religion” and the relief “poured into his parched soul” (Achebe 104).</p> <p>After enduring a child-hood of unjustified domestic abuse and strict authoritative structures, Nwoye “was happy to leave his father” and join other Christians at the missionary school in Umuofia (Achebe 108). Without even bare understanding of Christian theology, and even the basics of salvation, Nwoye reversed every foundation of his life including traditional Ibo religion, his father’s authority, and socialized masculinity, to look for answers elsewhere in this new cultural religion. Nwoye’s conversion denoted a clear realization that things were falling apart as the domestic sphere of tradition and normality was split wide open leaving room for education, conversion, and a different kind of oppression.</p>                                                           \n\nFAMILY AND SOCIETY: A CASE STUDY OF THINGS FALL APART AND PURPLE HIBISCUS IN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FAMILY AND SOCIETY: A CASE STUDY OF THINGS FALL APART AND PURPLE HIBISCUS IN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE", "id": 83}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background of the study</p> <p>The literature of people is the one that seeks to discuss, expose and propose solutions to the daily problems of society, be it social, economic, moral, political or otherwise. Since literature is seen as reflecting life, literature and society are inseparable. To a certain extent this inspires literary artists who bring theories into the literature to affect their art in order to propose solutions to these problems and to show the way forward.</p> <p>Satire is a kind of literature and sometimes graphic and performing arts, where vices, follies, abuses and falsities are bound to ridicule ideally with the intention of humiliating individuals and society itself, Even in improvement although Satire is usually funny, A more important purpose is often social corrective or constructive criticism using the mind as a weapon. Satire is now found in many forms of artistic expression, including literature, plays commentary and media. The word satire comes from the Latin word Satur and from the following sentence LanxSatura. Saturation meant “complete”, but the juxtaposition with Lanx moved the meaning of “variety or pastiche”, meaning a combination of different kinds. The Satirist uses a range of stylistic methods that can include irony, mockery, and Exaggeration and so on to attack madness.</p> <p>According to Charles Sanders, satire dissipates the illusions that man needs to live. Because he always deals with the contemporary, he runs the risk of living only a short life. It is said that satire offers neither the escape of comedy nor the purgation of tragedy. It is only a mixture of unresolved irritating pleasure (15)</p> <p>Satire is a creative genre in which the criticism of certain cultural or other activities is manifested by a strong use of irony and sarcasm. This type of criticism can be humorous, although entertainment and humor are not necessarily the main goals, humor is often used to compensate for the harshness of the criticism itself. Satire works effectively in a society that is aware of the acceptable standards of morality and manner. To achieve this goal, the satirist must take certain values ​​against which one can depict a sudden drop in the standard of behavior or aberration.</p> <p>In general, someone uses this type of criticism to show offense or offense to someone else’s actions or words. It can be expressed in several different ways, however, and direct criticism can ultimately feel like a person is simply “preaching” his opinion to others, using more creative methods allows someone to express the idea In a more disarming manner, the real message of the criticism to more clearly come across, often the use of the mind, sarcasm and irony.</p> <p>As Adeseeke (2008) pointed out, a large-scale introduction to the dramatic writings of Wole Soyinka and a thorough and complete study of satire in fourteen of the Childe International Soyinka plays to King Baabu and sketches before the Blackout. Ebewo Patrick treats satire as an instrument of criticism, a literary genus and an establishment in society. He reconnoiters the antiquity and definition of sarcasm in various cultural contexts, approaching Soyinka as an African satirist influenced by Western and African satirical modes. He considers the functions of comic and tragic satire in Soyinka’s exhibitions on the African socio-political scene and politicians, religious hypocrites, mystical opportunists, avid women and prostitutes. The author also suggests some reflections on the effectiveness of Soyinka satire and literature as a weapon for addressing contemporary problems and effecting change in society (Ebewo, 2002).</p> <p>Frank OgodoOgbeche showed how corruption permeates government institutions and every fabric of the society as well as the devastating effect corruption has on our everyday life.</p> <p>1.2       Statement of the problem</p> <p>Satire as a literary device is a specific aspect of literature and it is one of many devices that express the idea through language. This is a style adopted by many writers and the different styles adopted by a writer allow him to tell his story and the difference between writers working is what they are known for. Satire has not been misused as a corrective tool or means for societal ills. However, satire seeks to create a shock of recognition and to make vice repulsive or disgusting so that vice is redacted from the person or society attacked in order to restore morality. The overwhelming socio-political problems facing the African continent can rarely be ignored by African writers. Ogunba (2009: 21) thus expresses this concern: When the writer in his own society can no longer function as a consciousness, he must recognize that his choice is between totally refusing or retiring to the position of postmortem chronicler and surgeon. The artist has always worked in African society as the record of manners and experiences of his society and as the voice of vision in his own time. The above explains the fact that dramatists are part of their societies and therefore have a Better explanation of what is going on around them as they function as the conscience of society. They are committed to restoring order in their communities, which have been engulfed in a myriad of socio-political and economic disorder. This patriotic ideal, burning with playwrights,</p> <p>According to Awodiya, (2010: 33) is to use the weapon we have; our pen, our zeal and our eloquence to awaken in us the song of liberation with our writings. We wash the stigma of inferiority, awaken our dormant energies, unmask the pests and traitors among us, and preach positive sermons. Since the days of the Greek philosopher Socrates, writers have been at the forefront of social change, defying the mores of oppressive society. The mode of the artist to evaluate the socio-political system in a society is satire; a form of writing that mocks the bad or senseless behavior of people, institutions and society in general.</p> <p>1.3       Aims and Objectives.</p> <p>This study aims at studying Frank OgodoOgbeche the “Harvest of Corruption” and Wole Soyinka Beyond the “Death and the Kings Horseman” how they uses satire to bring to the knowledge of individuals that the correction or reconstruction of the society begins with oneself and this became of paramount importance because this is another way of sensitizing the people about social ills.</p> <p>Specifically, the study sought to</p> <p>analyzethe harvest of corruption regarding satire in contemporary African drama</p> <p>determine the roles of all characters in harvest of corruption</p> <p>examine the death and the king’s horseman on the basis of satire in contemporary African drama</p> <p>assess satire as a dramatic tool for societal reformation</p> <p>1.4       Justification of Study</p> <p>The text Harvest of Corruption” and the “Death and the Kings Horseman areContemporary drama embellishes satirical beauty, but little or no attention has been paid to this quality of text. This research aims to study the importance of satire as a literary genre used to correct societal abnormalities and human aberrations. The purpose of this research is to investigate the relevance of satire to its effects on society as it helps to eliminate the problems that militate against national development.</p> <p>Criticism has always involved a systematic measurement of good and evil. Satire as a literary apparatus is not used by writers just for entertainment and mockery; it is used to tell more about the evils or wrongs happening in society. Research therefore aims at discussing Satire as a literary phenomenon in society in general and encouraging humanity to mobilize in society for development purposes</p> <p>On the other hand, the need to study works of art is very important because it is an abstract exhibition intended to appeal to the interests and emotions of persons whom the disciplines of aesthetics would call or designate as “Arts for the good of the arts”, Our contemporary society with the aim of effecting total change because society also needs to know better the contribution of its various citizens.</p> <p>1.5       Methodology</p> <p>In this study, the library strategy is embraced for its suitability and convenience. This methodological methodology entails data collection from secondary sources such as serious works, treatises, and documented materials usually from the library, the internet, and the book stores for the purpose of interpreting the primary texts. This relates to the qualitative research methodology used mostly in the Humanities disciplines as a means of collecting a variety of empirical data on case studies, individual encounters or contemplation, life story, interviews, observation, historical narratives, visual texts, which describe routine and problematic moments and meaning in the life of an individual.</p> <p>1.6       The Scope of Study</p> <p>The scope of this study is limited or restricted to the chosen text Harvest of Corruption” and the “Death and the Kings Horseman. It should be noted that there are many other literary devices used in the text such as comparison, humor, humor, satire, irony, etc. However our attention will be on the satire that the text itself is satirical in nature by highlighting the characteristics that characterizes it as satire.</p> <p>1.7       Definition of Terms</p> <p>Satire:Is a term applied to any work of literature or art whose objective is the ridiculous. It is more easily recognized than defined. Satire is a literary medium that combines a critical attitude with humor and spirit in order to improve humanity. Since ancient times, the Satirists have shared a common goal which is to expose stupidity in all its forms, vanity, hypocrisy, pedantry, idolatry, bigotry, semi-mentality, etc.</p> <p>Contemporary:Is occurring in the present regardingwritings being ironic and mirrors a society’s political, social and personal outlooks.</p> <p>Drama:Is an opus in verse or prose intended to represent life or character or to tell a story generally involving conflicts and emotions through action and dialogue and typically designed for theatrical performance</p> <p> Satire In Contemporary African Drama: A Case Study Of Harvest Of Corruption By Frank Ogodo Ogbeche And Death And The Kings Horseman By Wole Soyinka</p>                                                          \n\nSATIRE IN CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DRAMA: A CASE STUDY OF HARVEST OF CORRUPTION BY FRANK OGODO OGBECHE AND DEATH AND THE KINGS HORSEMAN BY WOLE SOYINKA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SATIRE IN CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DRAMA: A CASE STUDY OF HARVEST OF CORRUPTION BY FRANK OGODO OGBECHE AND DEATH AND THE KINGS HORSEMAN BY WOLE SOYINKA", "id": 84}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>Motivation plays a very important role in enhancing the students’ pronunciation learning. Consequently, the researcher’s argument is that motivation is necessary for one to learn and acquire a second or foreign language because most successful learners of a second language are motivated to do so. Hence, this research work highlights the role motivation plays in the acquisition of phonetic sounds among the Ebonyi State University students. The researcher examines the concept of motivation, explains some theories of motivation as it relates to language learning, the types of motivation — intrinsic, extrinsic, integrative and instrumental. The study analyzed the data gotten through the use of a 7 – item questionnaire administered to supposedly 120 students but recovered 113 copies from the students in the Department of Linguistics and Literary Studies, Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki. The results from the findings revealed that the use of reward, employment of competent phonetic lecturer(s), and well structured and functional phonetic laboratory enhance the students’ pronunciation learning. It was also discovered that the students’ L1 hinders the acquisition of phonetic sounds, and that pronunciation learning has future benefit.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Language is a very important phenomenon in the life of every individual. On daily basis, we communicate our ideas, feelings, desires, likes, dislikes, etc to people in community through language (spoken, written or signed).</p> <p>O’Grady (2011:1) highlights and affirms the usefulness of language by saying:</p> <p>Language is at the heart of all things human. We use it when we are taking, thinking, reading, writing and listening. It is part of the social structure of our communities, it forges the emotional bond between parent and a child; it is the vehicle for literature and poetry. Language is not just a part of us; language defines us.</p> <p>From the foregoing, it is important to state categorically, that language encompasses all human activities. It is an indispensable tool used by members of a speech community to communicate their thoughts to one another. Nnamdi-Eruchalu (2012:1) rightly states that man cannot relate with the world around him without language.</p> <p>Accordingly, Edward Sapir (1921:8) in Lyons (2009:3) stresses “that language is purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions and desires by means of voluntarily produced symbols”. This implies that every normal human being is endowed with the innate ability to acquire language. This natural (innate) ability according to Noam Chomsky (1975) quoted in Agbedo (2009:20), and Nnamdi (2012:19) is called the Language Acquisition Device (LAD). Similarly, Oates (1972:127) cited in Ajisafe (2009:1) notes the importance of language and avers that “the acquisition of the ability to use language is one of the most impressive pieces of learning that an individual achieves in the course of his life”.</p> <p>Issues bothering on language have attracted the attention of scholars from disciplines such as linguistics, psychology, sociology, philosophy, rhetoric, literary criticism, etc. Among these disciplines, we will limit our discussion in this work to linguistics. Nnamdi-Eruchalu (2012:8) opines that linguistics is interested in the historical study of written language, and the study of spoken language and its description as it is at a given point in time. This aspect of linguistics is referred to as “historical linguistics”. This discipline (linguistics) covers areas such as phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics (otherwise known as micro linguistics), and the macro linguistics which include applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, comparative linguistics, etc. Among these, we shall limit our discussion in this research to an aspect of the micro linguistics — “phonetics”.</p> <p>This research work is set to harness the role of motivation in the acquisition of phonetic sounds — a case study of the Ebonyi State University Students, Abakaliki. Ebonyi State, Nigeria.</p> <p>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>Ajisafe (2009:2) opines that “motivation is an important psychological construct that initiates and affects learning and performance and so is very necessary in language learning and acquisition”. Subsequently, Ajisafe (2009) sees motivation as one of the major similarities and differences between how a First Language (L1) and a Second Language (L2) or additional languages are learnt in which the difference lies in the level or degree of motivation. Ajisafe (2009) further notes that it is a condition that determines how fast or how well a language is learned/acquired. Umaru (2008:31) draws a distinction between “acquisition” and “learning”. Acquisition according to Umaru (2008) refers to the “<strong>non conscious incorporation </strong>of the target language structure resulting from exposure to and interaction with target language speakers in genuine communicative contexts”. Learning, on the other hand, involves the “<strong>conscious</strong> <strong>incorporation</strong> of target language rules and is facilitated by explicit presentation of these rules compiled with feedback in the form of error correction”. Yule (1996:191) in Agbedo (2009:74) also stated that in acquisition, the process is “sub-conscious and effortless”; in learning, the process is “conscious and effortful”.</p> <p>Although the distinction exist as can be seen above, but we will consider both (acquisition and learning) to mean the same, hence the use of language learning/acquisition in this work.</p> <p>The usefulness of motivation cannot be left unsaid as Morgan, King, Weisz and Schopler (1993:303) opine that “motivation refers to the driving and pulling forces which results in persistent behaviour directed toward particular goals”. From the foregoing, one can deduce that motivation brings about recurrent/repeated behaviour. Hockenbury and Hockenbury (2000:306) concur with the view of Morgan et al (1993) as they posit that “Motivation refers to the forces acting on or within an organism to initiate and direct behaviour”. Motivation can be either internal or external in nature. It is internal, if the behaviour emanates from the inside (within) of an individual, and external if the desire/behaviour is coming from outside/acting upon the individual.</p> <p>Bassett-Jones and Lloyd (2005:920) suggest that “motivation is concern with how behaviour gets started, is energized, is sustained, is directed, is stopped and what kind of subjective reaction is present in the organism while all these are going on”. Although Young (2000:1) is of the view that motivation can be defined in a variety of ways, depending on whom you ask – ask someone on the street, you may get a response like “it is what drive us” or “it is what make us to do the things we do”, but the truth is that motivation is geared towards achieving a desired aim and every human being is compelled to exhibit a particular behaviour/attitude depending on whether the motivation is positive or negative.</p> <p>According to the FREE Online Courses on Motivation, positive motivation induces people to do work in the best possible manner to improve their performance. This suggests that better facilities and rewards are provided for improved performance. For instance, when a father tells his son, “if you study well and get high grades in your examination, I will buy you a new bicycle”. Negative motivation aims at controlling unlawful behaviour and seeks to instill a sense of fear (punishment) in individuals.</p> <p>Phonetics as earlier stated is part of language, and we cannot do away with it especially as it relates to this research work. Ogayi (2005:1) sees phonetics as “the study of language sound production, the quality of sound produced in terms of phonetic environment in which they occur and the perception of such sounds”. In a similar notion, Nwankwegu and Nwodc (2012:11) posit that “phonetics is that which describes how sounds are produced (articulated); how they travel in the air as sound waves and how they are perceived through air.</p> <p>Since phonetics involves the production, transmission and perception of sounds, it then follows that the correct pronunciation of sounds is a basis for efficient communication in English language, as in any other language. It is a behaviour that every normal human being should strive to accomplish on daily basis so as to foster good communication between those in our community and the society at large.</p> <p>Interestingly, Johnson and Kozikowska (2009) examined the importance of a good knowledge of phonetics and state thus:</p> <p>“Phonetics is such an important tool for learning and teaching of foreign languages. it facilitates the ability to hear, understand and produce different sounds. It stirs up the correct pronunciation of sounds. When it is used inappropriately, it can lead to misunderstanding and even complete communication breakdown between speakers coming from two or more different linguistic backgrounds. Phonetics provides data for phonology. Although these two are closely related to each other, but understanding phonology without a good knowledge of phonetics is almost impossible, because phonetics feeds phonology with data which is then used in exploring the sound patterns of a language. It avails one the opportunity to represent (transcribe) words the way they are spoken so as to communicate with the world at large”.</p> <p>The acquisition of phonetic sounds is achievable through motivation. Yusuf (2006:36) rightly says “iii second language learning as in every other field of human learning, motivation is the crucial force, which determines whether a learner embarks on a task at all, how much energy he devotes to it, and how long he perseveres”. This work will examine the role of motivation in the acquisition of phonetic sounds among the Ebonyi State University students in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria.</p> <p>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Over the years, it has been observed that most students pass through the university without actually learning or reaching proficiency in the use of phonetic sounds. It is against this background that the researcher wishes to investigate the role of motivation in the acquisition of phonetic sounds by these English language learners.</p> <p>Even students in Linguistics and Literary Studies encounter varying degrees of difficulties in the acquisition of phonetic sounds. Therefore, it is our concern to unravel the causes of such difficulties and proffer workable means that will enhance the students’ ability in the acquisition of phonetic sounds of English language.</p> <p>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The objectives of this work are to:</p> <p>1.  critically look at the role motivation plays in the acquisition of phonetic sounds as it concerns the students within the frame of this work.</p> <p>2.  find out the difficulties the students encounter in the acquisition of phonetic sounds.</p> <p>3.  examine the importance of having a good knowledge of phonetic sounds (pronunciation) among the L learners.</p> <p>1.4   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This work will play a very vital role in educating both students and teachers to imbibe the attitude of motivating learners as regards the acquisition of phonetic sounds.</p> <p>It will enable the English language learners to strive to acquire phonetic sounds.</p> <p>Also, it would help to redirect the mindset of the lecturers and students to be (positive motivators) rather than (negative motivators) to enhance language learning.</p> <p>1.5   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>The following questions would be attempted in this work.</p> <p>i.    Does motivation play a role in pronunciation learning?</p> <p>ii.  To what extent is motivation relevant in the acquisition of phonetic sounds among language learners?</p> <p>1.6   SCOPE AND DELIMITATION</p> <p>This research work centres on the role of motivation in the acquisition of phonetic sounds among the Ebonyi State University students specifically in the Department of Linguistics and Literary Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria. The Department is made up of four (4) sub which include Linguistics, Igbo, French, and English Literature. We will not delve into the concept of motivation as it affects students in other disciplines within or outside the already named institution.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF MOTIVATION IN THE ACQUISITION OF PHONETIC SOUNDS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF MOTIVATION IN THE ACQUISITION OF PHONETIC SOUNDS", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT <br/><em>This research work focused on the phonological interference in television newscast in Nigeria. Phonological interference as one of the problems encountered by television newscasters in Nigeria, more especially some Yoruba and Hausa newscasters in NTA since it is our area concentration the work has been treated using six major interference phenomena. This project has helped to identify some of the challenges facing the newscasters in the media houses on the phonological level. This research work also provided solution in remedying the problems. The consequences of the above problem is the newscasters could no longer express their competence with other newscasters who speaks much better in other media houses. </em></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION <br/> 1.1     Background of the Study </strong></p> <p><strong>          If the question “what is language? Is asked, it has many senses and can be variously defined. It can be language of a particular field like science, humanity just to mention few. It can also be the animal language, sign language and many other types of languages.</strong></p> <p><strong>          Humanity language especially spoken dominates them all. Human language is natural. According to Adeboye Chis experiences and thoughts”</strong></p> <p><strong>          In Adeboyo’s words above, human language is one out of many by which a person’s experiences and thought can be organized. This supports the many senses that language has. And also, without language, (spoken) thoughts will never be born and experiences of life will be wasted because no one will be able to learn from them. Communication is the major bridge that links the whole world.</strong></p> <p><strong>          Communication is a crucial factor in the society at large and there is pieces of evidence that prove this. The global village and the internet prove this among others.</strong></p> <p><strong>          Language whether written, spoken, sign or through any means is a tools for communication and English language, out of many languages of the world has emerged the most used language all over the world.</strong></p> <p><strong>          The global village use this language (English) and it stands to be the language of the net.</strong></p> <p><strong>          English language accords respect and pride to its speakers but some have been left with the effective use of this language especially in the countries where the language  (English) is not the mother tongue or the first language one comes in contact with, for instance in countries like Nigeria,  Ghana and many others.</strong></p> <p><strong>          The language teachers, the broadcasters and few others have been left with the duty of speaking the correct version of English language in Nigeria.</strong></p> <p><strong>          And if this proof is true, these categories of people should speak error free English. However, it is unfortunate that some of our broadcasters still goof on air and this distorts communication. In the light of the above, this research is out to work on the use of language in English newscast under the little “mother tongue interference in English newscast in Nigeria”: A case of recorded NTA News. </strong></p> <p><strong>1.2     The Research Problem </strong></p> <p><strong>          This work knows that some issues that have become problems in our media houses have been handled by some scholars. For instance, Medubi (2007) and Okoye (2007). Both of them dwelt more on the problem confronting the press in Nigeria but not directly as this work will handle it. No one has really worked on how mother tongue interference distorts communication in our media house in Nigeria. This will look into this problem and will try to proffer solutions.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3     Research Question </strong></p> <p><strong>          In handling the research problem above, this research will focus its attention on this question: How much does mother tongue interference distorts communications in our media houses in Nigeria?</strong></p> <p><strong>1.4     Research Purpose </strong></p> <p><strong>          The purpose of this research is to achieve some set goals.</strong></p> <p><strong>          Firstly, this research is to further enlighten the media on the importance of Standard English.</strong></p> <p><strong>          Secondly, this research is to also help the second language teachers. Since they are the foundation layer of all learners and when a foundation learner is solid, anything built on it will stand erect.</strong></p> <p><strong>          Lastly, this research will be useful for the media and the second speakers of the English language on how to produce sounds of English that will be free from mother tongue interference.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.5     Scope of the study </strong></p> <p><strong>          This work will focus on mother tongue interference in English newscast” Different authors have dealt with this topic from different perspectives.</strong></p> <p><strong>          Hoffmann (1991) identified four major types of mother tongues interference in English.</strong></p> <p><strong>a)    Interference at the phonological level</strong></p> <p><strong>b)   Interference at the grammatical level.</strong></p> <p><strong>c)    Interference at the lexical level</strong></p> <p><strong>d)   Interference in spelling</strong></p> <p><strong>Alabi (2007) also identified three types of mother tongue interference in English which are:</strong></p> <p><strong>Phonological interference, lexical interference and grammatical interference.</strong></p> <p><strong>This research will concentrate on the phonological level of mother tongue interference because it deals mainly with speech (Day to day conversation).</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6     Justification </strong></p> <p><strong>          This research topic “phonological interference in television Newscast in Nigeria” is important because the problem is obvious in almost all the media house in Nigeria.  </strong></p> <p><strong>          Some authors have outlined the problems confronting our media in Nigeria but few have given us solutions.</strong></p> <p><strong>           An author like Okoye (2007) outlined the problem of the press in Nigeria but did not give solutions to such problems. And this research is set to look into the problems  and proffer solutions to them with top priority given to the phonological aspect.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.7     Definition of Some Terms </strong></p> <p><strong>Mother Tongue/First Language (LI)</strong></p> <p><strong>       Mother tongue also called the first language with in hi/her environment. Mother tongue is slightly different from the first language. Mother tongue is the language of the parents especially the father while the first language is the language of the environment.</strong></p> <p><strong>          The child’s mother tongue can be his/her first language and it may not also be. For instance, an Igbo child grows up in Kano State where the language in such environment is “Hausa” the Igbo child will conveniently speak, “Hausa” because of his/her environment.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.8     Second Language (Target language) </strong></p> <p><strong>          A second language (L2) is that which exists side by side with the indigenous languages in a bilingual or multilingual situation. It is usually an official language and as such enjoys a high status within the nation. A second language can be the fourth or the third language to be acquired but as long as someone has a language before learning another, it will be referred to as the second language or the target language.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.9     News </strong></p> <p><strong>          Danuta (1998, :4) says</strong></p> <p><strong>          News s a late middle word that means “tidings” New information of recent events. Even if we accept this definition as a useful description of what newspaper delivers. A more useful definition might be information about recent events that are of interest to sufficiently large groups, or that may affect the lives of a sufficiently large group.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.10   Phonology </strong></p> <p><strong>          Akmajian (2001, :109) etal says “Phonology is the sub-field of linguistics that studies the structure and systematic patterning of sound of human language”.</strong></p> <p><strong>          In his word, phonology is used in two ways. The first one describes the sounds of a language and the rules governing the use of those sounds. While the second refers to the part of the general theory of human language that is concerned with the universal properties of natural language sound system.</strong></p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p><strong>          Since language and man are not the same and they cannot be separated, problems will always arise from the two angles. Solution must also be provided to such problems in order to have effective communication in the society.</strong></p>\n\nPHONOLOGICAL INTERFERENCE IN TELEVISION NEWSCAST IN NIGERIA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PHONOLOGICAL INTERFERENCE IN TELEVISION NEWSCAST IN NIGERIA ", "id": 86}]
