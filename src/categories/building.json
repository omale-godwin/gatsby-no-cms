[{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Working /contract drawing according to Thomas and Marvin (1978), working drawings are defined to be a communication medium whose purpose is to graphically convey the design requirement for a construction project.They control the design by indicating the construction in considerable detail; if they are sufficiently detailed, a competent builder can construct the project in accordance with the design and without confusion. Nowadays, many building clients are curious of knowing their probable cost of having a particular building before the commencement of the work. However, the task of making the cost known to the building client entailed arrays of exercise to be done by the professionals involved, stating from the design stage up to the practical completion of the project, the design stage encompasses various activities, such as, the client brief, site investigation, skeletal design, construction design and finally the contract/working drawings which can be passed to the quantity surveyor and finally issued to the contractor.These are expected to be the minimum numbers of drawings which give production information showing all relevant information’s from consultant transferred to agreed scale, exchanges details and exploiting the values of three dimensional sketches.The information is read to gather by the client, the estimator and the site agents. Seely (2008), believed that drawing should show the nature and scope of work to be carried out under the contract. They are to be detailed and comprehensive of bill of quantities. It is also to assist the contractor to accurately price and carry out the work satisfactorily.Drawings are expected to have description and explanatory notes clearly defined, legible and free from abbreviations amplified figured dimension should be inserted in the drawing to ensure maximum accuracy in taking off quantities and in setting out construction work on site. Turner (2003), referred to the design and quality of the finished work as a major feature of the contract document. Contract drawings should show the positioning of the building members or a supplementary non-contract document. These contract drawings will include: architectural, structural and services.</p>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF CONTRACT DRAWING ON BUILDING PROJECT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF CONTRACT DRAWING ON BUILDING PROJECT", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Construction has turned into an ever more complex mesh of relationships between increasingly accelerating processes, decisions and actions. At the same time, however, there is a development toward sustainable</p> <p>Just as any other project, a construction project includes certain development phases that differ from each other in terms of the amount of time and financial funds needed for their completion. In financial terms, the construction phase of a construction project is by far the most dominant one. Research has shown that sometimes up to 95% of the total project cost is spent on the completion of this particular phase, which is why the costs incurred during the construction deserve special attention in terms of cost dynamics i.e. cost allocation in relation to time.</p> <p>In the case of construction projects, the analysis of cost allocation in relation to time is a pressing issue. It partly pertains to the analysis of the regularity of the relationship between these two variables during various project phases or, in other words, the analysis of the possibility of applying the s-curve method in regards to certain activities and problems.</p> <p>When a construction contract is concluded, the total cost of works is defined, while the data about the monthly allocation of cost, for the presentation of which the s-curve method is mostly used, remain unknown. Research concerned with the use and development of the scurve method is very rare in Croatia. The analysis of literature [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [12], [13], has shown that in several published works related to this topic and the authors mainly focus on the study of the curve trend analysis and the development of the information system for planning and controlling project cash flows.</p> <p>The conducted research produced the data on construction projects executed in Croatia that were further analyzed on the basis of statistical methods for database processing and system theories. Various theoretical methods of project management, construction organization and planning were used in conducting specific parts of the research. Regression methods and best-fit analyses, especially the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the theory of risk<br/>management, were used in drawing up a methodology proposal for modeling the cost scurve.<br/>Project time control is that element of a project that keeps it on-track, on-time and within budget. Project time control begins early in the project with planning and ends late in the project with post-implementation review, having a thorough involvement of each step in the process. Each project should be assessed for the appropriate level of control needed: too much control is too time consuming, too little control is very risky. If project time control is not implemented correctly, the cost to the business should be clarified in terms of errors, fixes, and additional audit fees.<br/>Control systems are needed for cost, risk, quality, communication, time, change, procurement, and human resources. In addition, auditors should consider how important the projects are to the financial statements, how reliant the stakeholders are on controls, and how many controls exist. Auditors should review the development process and procedures for how they are implemented. The process of development and the quality of the final product may also be assessed if needed or requested. A business may want the auditing firm to be involved throughout the process to catch problems earlier on so that they can be fixed more easily. An auditor can serve as a controls consultant as part of the development team or as an independent auditor as part of an audit.<br/>Businesses sometimes use formal systems development processes. These help assure that systems are developed successfully. A formal process is more effective in creating strong controls, and auditors should review this process to confirm that it is well designed and is followed in practice. A good formal systems development plan outlines:</p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The survey shows that most projects encounter cost and time over-runs (Williams Ackermann, Eden, 2002,pl92). According to Wright (1997)'s research, a good rule of thumb is to add a minimum of 50% to every time estimate, and 50% to the first estimate of the budget (Gardiner and Stewart, 1998, p251). It indicates that project is very complex and full of challenge. Many unexpected issues will lead the project cost and time over-runs. Therefore, many technologies and methods are developed for successful monitoring and control to lead the project to success. In this article, we will discuss in the construction phase, how can a project manager to be successful in time and budget control. Another part we will discuss what pitfalls will wait for the manager in his endeavors to monitor and control the project.<br/>An activity duration estimate must be based on the quantity of resources expected to be used on the activity. The estimate should be aggressive, yet realistic. Throughout the performance of the project some activities will take longer than their estimated duration, others will be done in less time than their estimated duration, and a few may conform to duration estimates exactly. Over the life of a project that involves many activities, such delays and accelerations will tend to cancel out one another.<br/>In order to establish a basis from which to calculate a schedule using the duration estimates for the activities, it’s necessary to select the estimated start time and required completion time for overall project. These times define overall window or envelope, of time in which the project must be completed. The projects required completion time is normally part of the project objective and stated in the contract. Once the, estimated duration for each activity in the network and an overall window of time in which the project must be completed, you have to decide whether the activities can be done by the required completion time. <br/>The key to effective project time control is to measure actual progress and compare it to planned progress on a timely and regular basis and to take necessary corrective action immediately. The project time control process involves regularly gathering data on project performance, comparing with the planned performance. This process must occur regularly throughout the project. <br/>It starts with establishing a baseline plan that shows how the project scope will be accomplished on time and within the budget. Once this baseline plan is agreed with the customer the project starts. A regular reporting period should be established for comparing the actual progress with the planned progress. Reporting may be daily, weekly, or monthly depending on the complexity and the duration of the project. During each reporting period, two kinds of data or information need to be collected.</p> <p><strong><br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS </strong><br/>Ackermann, Eden, Howick and Williams (2000) point out the pitfall of using 0. They are:<br/>a) When a network is resource-constrained, there is no agreed definition of what a 'project time control ' actually is.<br/>b) Many effects, such as change orders, impact many activities simultaneously. In such cases, single-activity analyses in PRC do not really work, and more sophisticated analyses or network simulation is needed.<br/>c) PRC cannot take account of soft factors such as demotivation. Disruption affects productivity in a fashion that means it varies over time, PRC times do not usually take account of changes in productivity, let alone when it is a variable factor.<br/>d) project time control (PRC) does not take into account management actions to deal with delays and disruptions.</p> <p><strong>Adding resource</strong><br/>Adding resource is most common methods for shortened project time. But there are limits, such as some of activities cannot be shortened by adding staffs and equipment and some time the relation between staffs size and time shorten is not linear. Adding resource, you cannot achieve as your want.</p> <p><strong>Overtime</strong><br/>This is the easiest way to add more labour and not add more staffs. But need to face the challenge of team numbers' antipathy and the low efficiency in the overtime work.</p> <p><strong>Outsourcing</strong><br/>This is also a common method to shortening the project time by subcontracting the activities. The issue is most of the time, the subcontractor need to warm up before start their project jobs.</p> <p><strong>NPV</strong><br/>The problem that exists within the field of NPV is that after getting a project authorized.<br/>There will be no further consideration given to the project's NPV until a post investment appraisal can be carried out. However, at this point the damage has been done (Gardiner and Stewart, 2000, p252).</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>Erel and Raz (2000) state that the project time control cycle consists of measuring the status of the project, comparing to the plan, analysis of the deviations, and implementing any appropriate corrective actions. When a project reach the construction phase, monitor and control is critical to deliver the project success. Project monitoring exists to establish the need to take corrective action, whilst there is still time to take action. Through monitoring the activities, the project team can analyze the deviations and decide what to do and actually do it (Gardiner and Stewart 2000,p252). The purpose of monitor and control is to support the implementation of corrective actions, ensure projects stay on target or get project back on target once it has gone off target (Erel and Raz, 2000,p253).<br/>a) Do unstarted activities really have to await the completion of other activities before they can start? If no, start the activities<br/>b) If an activity has to wait for the completion of other activities, can that activity be broken down into sub-activities and some of the sub activities completed at an earlier date? If no, break down the activity into sub-activities and start the urgent one at once.<br/>Herroelen and Reyck (1999) also state that managers have to tackle the challenging problem of scheduling activities to minimize the project duration, in which the activities (a) are subject to generalized precedence relations, (b) require units of multiple renewable, non-renewable and doubly constrained resources for which a limited availability is imposed, and (c) can be performed in one of several different ways, refected in multiple activity scenarios or modes.<br/>Optimal timing<br/>Considering optimal timing of project monitoring and control points is significant to success (Falco and Macchiaroli,1998). Falco and Macchiaroli suggest that we should determine the optimal frequency of the monitoring and reviewing to different activities in different stages. It can help us to efficient monitor and correct control so as to reach time and cost target.<br/>Crashing<br/>In recent years, network crashing was developed along with the project time control method (PRC ) for planning and controlling large scale project. The purpose of crashing is the minimization of the pessimistic time estimate in PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) networks by investing additional amounts of money in the activities on the project time control . Sometimes, crashing methods are required to combine in the monitoring and controlling process when the duration of the activity that has to be completed within a specified time (Abbasi and Mukattash,2001,pl81).</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/>Is Probabilistic moment of risk: An activity (task) in most real-life processes is not a continuous uniform process. Tasks are affected by external events, which can occur at some point in the middle of the task. <br/>Why is it that event chains: Events can cause other events, which will create event chains. These event chains can significantly affect the course of the project. Quantitative analysis is used to determine a cumulative effect of these event chains on the project schedule. <br/>Critical events or event chains, is it the single events or the event chains that have the most potential to affect the projects are the “critical events” or “critical chains of events.” They can be determined by the analysis. <br/>Project tracking with events: Even if a project is partially completed and data about the project duration, cost, and events occurred is available, it is still possible to refine information about future potential events and helps to forecast future project performance. </p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The best means of ensuring that the costs are kept to a minimum during any project is by utilizing a commercial construction costs management service. This is an establishment which is able to realistically look at the capital costs for any commercial building construction project. They not only look closely at the planning costs but also cost control services. Plus this service will ensure that the proposals provided on the construction project are documented as well as being completed within the pre-arranged costs and time framework. They will also establish the most economical means of ensuring that the project does not run over budget. Each construction project should employ an independent and professional cost manager or quantity surveyor who can police as well as have a clear overview of everything that is going on. This is to protect the financial interests of the individual who is having the construction project done. These people use their engineering skills and experience which they then apply to scientific principles and techniques. This allows them to analyze and develop the best action that should be taken in order to provide a good estimation of the costs involved. This will also enable them to control the commercial building construction costs once the project starts on site. By using a good set of cost management principles the cost manager or quantity surveyor will ensure that the construction project stays within the budget limits and still meets performance and quality targets. When a commercial construction project is being prepared the cost manager or quantity surveyor is an integral part of the team and can bring added value to any construction and design team. However if there are problems relating to commercial building construction costs exceeding the budget, then this may well cause problems for the person who was asked to control the costs initially.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFIANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>Engaging a general contractor or construction manager earlier in the process is a good way to control time in the initial planning phases. These experts understand all legal requirements and can ensure all documentation is filed methodically and in a timely manner, reducing schedule delays early on. Some building owners are taking a more active role in the overall process and are functioning as a team member to streamline communications and drive faster completion of projects as well. Developers and business owners should encourage these approaches and work with general contractors, who have good relationships with established suppliers. This enables them to increase their aptitude to project and budget construction costs accurately through to the end of the building construction process.</p>\n\nPROJECT TIME CONTROL IN BUILDING CONSTRUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROJECT TIME CONTROL IN BUILDING CONSTRUCTION", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div>     <p><strong><em>INTRODUCTION</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>It is believed that one of the prevailing problems of construction industry in Nigeria is the impact of delays in project delivery. It is very important for both public and private projects to be completed on time and within budgets. Normally, achieving the projects within predetermined time, budget and quality is the basic purpose of construction project control. Construction delays is simply the time during which some part of the construction project has been extended beyond what was originally planned due to unanticipated circumstances.<br/>Project success is basically to gain the project objectives that are classically defined by the need to complete a project on time, within the budget and with appropriate quality. Hence any disruptions to the project objectives will certainly contribute to project delays with the specified adverse effect on project objectives. Delays can give rise to disruption of work and loss of productivity, late completion of project, increase time related costs, third party claims, abandonment or determination of contract. Delays are costly and often result in disputes<br/>and claims. Furthermore, delays effects the feasibility for project owner and retard the development in construction industry<br/>Before determining the effect of delay on project, one must determine whether the delay is critical. Additionally, all delays are either excusable or non-excusable. Both excusable and non-excusable can be defined as either concurrent or non-concurrent. Delays can be further broken down into compensable or non-compensable delays. Unfortunately, many construction projects cannot be delivered within specified time and budget. Many project shows massive cost and time overruns, in some cases client has to increase project time and cost. In an attempt to solve these problems, there are various strategies applied which will be discuss at the course of this presentation.<br/>Delays are perhaps the most common form of construction claims or even disputes. The problem is that, the parties involved in the process could hardly identify the reason and responsibility of each one in the specific task. Delays and claims resulted from works which are not carried-out precisely as the contract required. Accordingly, avoiding delays is a crucial concerned not only with good practice during the planning and execution of the works but also with the proper operation of the contract machinery.<br/>This project seeks to identify the impact of delays on project delivery in Nigeria construction industry. Appropriate strategies to<br/>control delays and develop a guide him of information management for prevention and control are also covered in this work.</p> <p><em><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></em><br/>Project delays have been one of the most prevailing problems in construction projects in Cross River State. This delays has it impact on project delivery which findings shows that cost overrun, time overrun and project abandonment is the effect experience by delay in construction project in Cross River State.<br/>Improper planning, poor contract management, slow decision making, design errors and cash flow problems were the major causes of delays in most of the project.</p> <p><em><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>The major purpose or aim of this study work is to examine critically the causes and impacts of construction delays on project very in Cross River State. This project would make attempt to resent suggestive solutions to the problems of delays faced by construction industries, so as to ensure effective execution of future projects without these problems and also meet the pre-determined contractual date of completion<br/><strong><em>THE AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS AS FOLLOWS:</em></strong><br/>(a) To identify and evaluate the effect of delays on building project execution in Nigeria.<br/>(b) To assess the effect of delay on completion time of building projects.<br/>(c) To examine the impacts of delay on the cost of construction project.<br/>(d) To bring to the knowledge of parties the actual causes of project delay.<br/>(e) To identify and describe current good practice in managing, handling and settling the impact of delays (claims) in construction project.<br/>(f) To investigate how the effects or impact of delays can be minimized.</p> <p><em><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>It has been observed that most contracts in Cross River State has its inability to keep to the targeted contracted period of time and it all turns out in the increment of stipulated period and associated excessive cost maximization thereby causing unwanted and unnecessary delay.<br/>The purpose of this research work, this is significant in that it has given the researcher challenges and opportunity to conduct an in-dept study of the subject. This act could be sourced from either of the party involved in the contracts, which could turn to be due to the negligence of fulfilling the oblig2tions awarded to either of them. Furthermore, the impacts of the causes of the delays of these construction projects have to be known and solutions identify in other to minimize it, if possible rectify the faults.</p> <p><em><strong>1.5 SCOPE OFTHE STUDY</strong></em><br/>This study appraises delays and it impacts on project delivery in construction industry, and more especially in the Nigeria context. This is with the view of finding solutions and making constructive proposals to rectifying, minimizing and finding a long costing reduction for the future efficient project execution. Research work in project construction delays generally will be very voluminous and this would mean researching into all aspect and methods of contract procurement. I therefore hope that all the detailed information required to achieve my aim and objectives of<br/>this project has been accomplished.</p> <p><em><strong>1.6 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>During the course of carrying out this study, the researchers encountered the following under listed problems<br/>(a) The limitation was the unwillingness of some respondent to complete the questionnaire administered. This is because of the fear that such information may lead to their superior.<br/>(b) The lean financial position of the researchers also contributed to the limitation of this study.<br/>(c) The time limit for this research also contribute a serious constraint to the production of a full scale report, though study of this nature will need comparison with many of such settlements within and outside the study area so as to give a sound judgment and recommendation.</p> <p><em><strong>1.7 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></em><br/>In order to accomplish the purpose of this study, these research questions were put forward to offer a general guide to the researcher.<br/>(a) From your experience in construction, have you ever suffered delay?<br/>(b) From which of the source is the delay experience?<br/>(c) What are the sources of delays usually experience in construction projects?<br/>(d) What are the impacts of delays in construction projects?<br/>(e) Who in your opinion suffers the most when there is prolonged delay?</p> <p><em><strong>1.8 ORGANISATION OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>It is worthwhile to state here that the project is divided into five chapters. Chapter one consist of the introduction, which gives us a brief insight of what the researcher is writing about, the objectives of the study, significance of the study, research questions, scope of the study, limitation of the study and definition of terms.<br/>The second chapter move on to reviewing related literature and conceptual issues.

It is been designed to serve some purpose for a specific time. As it can be seen in engineering work, the life span of a road is always an important factor that must be taken into consideration as one of the criteria for the construction. This really depends on the factors like construction procedure and consideration, the soil water relationship, quality of workmanship during the construction and the type of maintenance culture adopted.<br/>Many roads (Highway mostly) are seen widely as attaining the state of failure and show signs of distress before the expected life span used for construction is reach, due to the lack of factors such as lack of maintenance culture etc. many of our road today serve as death trap and hang out for hoodlums going by the number of accident recorded daily on them as a result of bad paved road.<br/>Pavement failure can be defined as the failure of the constructed layer of durable material of specified thickness, usually of concrete, asphalt or bituminous materials assigned to carry wheeled vehicles. Due to the number of load passing through a pavement structure, some deflection of the surface and underlying layers occur. The deflection can be as a result of the excess load, poor material usage, and poor road foundation resulting from the nature of the soil or groundwater rise in the area of high groundwater level. If layers are lacking in strength, repeated applications causes roughening and cracking that ultimately lead to failure of the pavement structure.<br/>The construction of the Eliozu-New Airport road, which was constructed a while ago, sudden failure due to improper investigation of either the soil composition or traffic capacity situation in the said section of the road networking, lack of proper drainage to control the effect of rise in groundwater level. The pavement thickness of the road section as measure was about 3.87inches (98.3mm) and the width of the dual carriage way about 7.9m with no proper shoulder and drainage provided.<br/>The effort of put in controlling the rate of failure and provision for annually increase of traffic capacity has been a thing of burden to the government of the River State in particular and the Federal government in general. By questioning and observation, failure of the said Eliozu-New Airport road as it problem from compounded presence of water coming out at a particular points on the road surface poor material and workmanship and pressure from increasing traffic capacities on the road pavement of which the government is making provision for overhead bridge which is currently in construction and it is found out that most at a point like Eliozu junction by ABC shuttle, the pavement bituminous material on the road have disappear.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</em></strong><br/>The major objective of this investigation is to ascertain factors that likely lead to the failure of Eliozu-New Airport road in Obio/Akpor L.G.A. of River State in particular and Nigeria Highways in general and how it affect national stability and development. This project work stand at a point to unveil the very facts behind why most of the roads fail soon after construction.<br/>The count carryout will broadly provide information on the actual traffic volume and the capacity of traffic and will help in used for possible traffic planning and design.<br/>It shall lead in proper construction of highway and remedy that will possible give a lasting solution and reduction in road failures. The several test such as test on asphalt, test on soil will provided better facts to the cause of the failure of the case study.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT STUDY</em></strong><br/>The whole section of the road was visited (Reconnaissance) and failure pattern noted.<br/>The project scope includes:<br/>- Assessment of kind of failure and causes on the Eliozu-New Airport road.<br/>- Soil samples collection and testing and analysis to determine the sub-grade, sub-base strength of the road foundation.<br/>- Assessment of underground water level and its affect on the pavement. <br/>- Assessment of traffic capacity intensity on the networking plan of the road and volume determination.<br/>- Assessment of drainage condition and proper drainage provision.<br/>- Assessment of the proportion and amount of bitumen and finer used in the Asphalt mixture used for the surface course.<br/>- Classification of the soil according to ASSHATO classification system.<br/>- Enumeration of possible pavement distresses that are found along a road section.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF THE STUDY AREA</em></strong><br/>The location of which this investigation is been carryout is a road network located at Obio/Akpor L.G.A at the out script of Port-Harcourt, River State.

Salt water has salinity of about 3.5%. in that, about 78% is sodium chloride and 15% is chloride and sulphate of magnesium. The result gotten from the experiment being carried out shows different result from the mix design, casting, curing and crushing of different dates of each cubes. The compressive strength of each cube was also determined e.g. for the compressive strength of mix design 1.2.2:4 for both salt water and fresh water for different days such 7,14,21,28 days are \"for fresh water\" 26.0N/mm2, 33.1N/mm2, 3.8.4N/mm2, 4/06N/mm2 \"for salt water\" for different days such as 7, 14, 21, 28days which results are 25.9N/mm2, 28.3N/mm2, 36.3N/mm2, 38.9N/m. For compressive strength of Design Ratio \"1:1:5:3:3\" for different days such as \"7, 14, 21 and 28 days respectively which are “43.3N/mm2, 47.7N/mm2, 48.4N/mm2, 47.3N/mm2 for fresh water and that of salt water are as follows, 42.1N/mm2, 44.9N/mm2, 46.3N/mm2, 47.26N/mm2. For mix design ratio \"1:3:3:5:8\" we have their compressive strength to be 16.3N/mm2, 21.8N/mm2, 25.03N/mm2, 29.6N/mm2 for each respective days for fresh water and that of salt water to be 16.2N/mm2, 20.3N/mm2, 23.57N/mm2, 27.6N/mm2, which also helps in the plotting of the graph of compressive strength against the curing days, to determine the strength of each cube. </strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>1.1 WHAT IS CONCRETE </strong></em><br/>Concrete is an artificial engineering material made from a mixture of Portland cement, water, fine and course aggregates, and a small amount of air. It is the most widely used construction material in the world.<br/>Concrete is the only major building material that can be delivered to the job site in a plastic state. this unique quality makes concrete desirable as a building material because it can be molded to virtually any form or shape. Concrete provides a wide latitude in surface textures and colours and can be used to construct a wide variety of structures, such as highways, and streets, bridges, dams, barge buildings, airport runways, irrigation structures, breakwaters, piers and docks, sidewalks, soles and farm buildings, homes and even barges and ships.<br/>Other desirable qualities of concrete as a building material are its strength, economy, and durability. Depending on the mixture of material used, concrete will support, in compression, 700 or more kg/sq cm (10,000 or more 1b/sq in). the ensile strength of concrete is much lower, but by using properly designed still reinforcing, structural members can be made that are as strong in tension as they are in compression. The durability of concrete is evidenced by the fact that concrete columns built by the Egyptians more than 3000 years ago are still standing. <br/>There are however, many different types of concrete, the names of some are distinguished by the types, sizes and densities of aggregates e.g. eight weight, normal weight or heavy weight. Concrete are similar in composition to mortar, which are used to bond unit masonry. Mortars however, are normally made with sand as a hole aggregates.<br/>Whereas, concrete contain much larger aggregates and this usually have greater strength. As a result, concrete have a much wider range of structural application, including pavements, footings, pipes, unit majoring, walls, dams and tanks. Because ordinary concrete is much weaker in tension than in compression, it is usually prestressed or reinforced with a much stronger material, such as steel, to resort tension.<br/>There are various methods employed for carting ordering concrete. For very small projects, sacks of prepared mixes may be purchased and mixed on the site with water, usually a drem-type, portable, mechanical mixer.<br/>For large projects, mix ingredient are weighed separately and deposited in a stationary batch mixer or a continuous mixer. Concrete mixed or agitated in a truck is called ready mixed concrete. In general, concrete is placed and consolidation is forms by hand tamping or pudding around reinforcing steel or by spreading at or near vertical surface. Another technique vibration or mechanical pudding, which is the most satisfactory one for achieving proper consolidation. <br/>CONSTITUENT OF CONCRETE <br/>The two major components of concretes are cement parts and inert materials. The cement parts consists of Portland cement, water, and some air either in the form of naturally entrapped air voids or minute, intentionally entrained air bubbles. The inert materials are usually composed of fire aggregate, which is a material such as sand, and course aggregate, which is a material such as gravel, crushed stone, or slag. In general, fire aggregate particular are smaller than 6.4mm (.25mm) in size, and course aggregates a particles are large than 6.4mm (.025mm). Depending on the thickness of structure to be built, the size is used, when Portland cement is mixed with water, the components of the cement react to form a cementing medium. In properly mixed concrete, each particles of sand and course aggregates is completely surrounded and coated by this paste, and all spaces between the particular are filled with it. As the cement part sets and hardens, it binds the aggregates into a solid mass.<br/>Under normal conditions, concrete grows stronger as it grows older. The chemical reactions between cement and water that cause the parts to harden and bind the aggregates together require time. The reactions take place very rapidly at first and then slowly over a long period of time.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 SALT WATER (SEA WATER)</em></strong><br/>Sea water has a salinity of about 3.5%. in that about 78% is sodium chloride and 15% is chloride and sulphate of magnesium. Sea water also contain small quantities of sodium and potassium salts. This can react with reactive aggregates in the same manner as alkalizes in cement. Therefore, sea water should not be used even for Pcc if aggregates are known to be potentially alkalie reactive. It is reported that the use of sea water for mixing concrete does not appreciately reduce the strength of concrete although it may lead to corrosion of reinforcement in certain cases. Research workers are unanimous in their opinion, that sea water can be used in un-reinforced concrete or mass concrete sea water slightly accelerates the early strength of concrete. But it reduces the 28day strength of concrete by about 10 to 15percent.<br/>However, this loss of strength could be made up by redesigning the mix. Water containing large quantities of chlorides in sea water may cause efflorescence and persistent dampness. When the appearance of concrete is important, sea water may be avoided. <br/>Granite, limestone, sand stone, or basaltic rock are crushed for use principally as concrete aggregate or road stone.<br/>ADVANTAGES OF CONCRETE<br/>Under normal conditions, concrete grows stronger as it grows older. It is the most widely used material (construction) in the world, because it is the only major building material that can be delivered to the job site in a plastic state.<br/>Concrete can be molded into different form or shape due to its unique quality. Other qualities of concrete as a building material are its strength, durability, and economy, depending on the mixture of material used.<br/>Concrete provides a wide latitude in surface texture and colours and can be used to construct a wide variety of structures, such as highways and street bridges, dams, large buildings, airport runways, irrigation structures, breakwaters, piers and docks, sidewalks, silos and farm buildings, home and even barges and ships.<br/>DISADVANTAGES OF CONCRETE <br/>• Ordinary concrete are much weaker in tension, than in compression.<br/>• Concrete is a bottle material and presses very low tensile strength, limiting ductility and little resistance to cracking<br/>• Internal micro cracks as inherent present in the concrete and its poor tensile strength propagates such micro cracks and eventually leading to bottle failure of concrete.<br/>• Concrete containing micro silica is vulnerable to plastic shrinkage, cracking and therefore, sheet or mat curing should be considered.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE OF STUDY</em></strong><br/>The purpose of the study is to know the adverse negative effect the water (salt) may have on concrete. <br/>Water is an important ingredient of concrete as it actively participates in the chemical reaction with cement. Since it helps to form the strength giving cement gal, the quantity and quality of water is required to be looked into very carefully. Sea water has a salinity of about 3.5percent, in that , about 78% is sodium chloride and 15% is chloride and sulphate of magnesium. It is said that the use of salt water (sea) for mixing concrete does not appreciably reduce the strength of concrete through it may lead to corrosion of reinforcement in certain cases. The aim of the experiment is to prove whether or not, if the sea water can reduce the strength of concrete.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY </em></strong><br/>A popular yard-stick to the suitability of water for mixing concrete is that, if water is fit for drinking, it is fit for making concrete. This does not appear to be a true statement for all conditions. Some water containing imparities may be suitable for other purpose, but not for the mixture of concrete.<br/>Some specification requires that if the water is not obtained from source that has proven satisfactory, the strength of concrete or mortar made with questionable water should be compared with similar concrete or mortar made with pure water. Sea water has a salinity of about 3.5percent, in that, about 78% is sodium chloride and 15% is chloride and sulphate of magnesium. It is reported that the use of sea water for mixing concrete does not appreciably reduce the strength of concrete although it may lead to corrosion of reinforcement in certain cases.<br/>The purpose of the experiment is to prove the doubt of people whether or not if salt water has an effect on concrete.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 DEFINITION OF TERMS </em></strong><br/> ACCELERATION:- There are substances that speeds up rate of a reaction, for photography, an accelerator speeds the action of a developer. For structural engineering, an accelerator speeds the setting of concrete. In the manufacture of plastics, an accelerator is used to speed up the curing of epoxy and other resion-type plastics.<br/> GRAVEL:- Gravel, loose material consisting of rock or mineral fragments. Gravel fragments are larger than sand particles and smaller than boulders specifically, gravel particles are larger than 2mm (0.08m) in diameter and smaller than 256mm (10m) in diameter. Gravel is a constituents of concrete, which is used in construction.<br/>Gravel is produced by the weathering and erosion of rocks, strong river currents or glaciers often transport gravel greats distances before it is disposited. Rock fragments in gravel that has been transported by water are worm and rounded, while theso carried by ice usually have sharp angular edges. The rock fragments in gravel transported by rivers also vary in sizeless than those transported by glaciers. Gravels are also found on beaches where there is strong wave actives are very round and smooth.<br/> SAND:- Sand loose incoherent mass of mineral materials in a finely gramilar condition, usually consisting of quartz (silica) with a small proportion of mica, feldspar, magnetite, and other resistant minerals. It is the product of the chemical and mechanical disintegration of rocks under the influence of weathering and abrasion. When freshly formed, the particles are usually angular and sharply pointed, becoming smaller and more rounded by attrition by the wind or by water.<br/>QUARRY AND QUARRYING <br/>Quarry and quarrying, open excavation from which any useful stone is extracted for building and engineering purpose and the operations required to obtain rock in useful form from a quarry. The two principal branches of the industry are the so-called dimension-stone and crushed stone quarrying. In the firms, blocks of stones such as marble, are extracted in different shapes and sizes for different purposes. In the crushed-stone industry.</p> <div>CHAPTER TWO</div> <div> <div>Chapter two of this Effects Of Salt Water On Concrete” research work is available. Chapter Two of “Effects Of Salt Water On Concrete Contains: Literature Review, Admixtures, Quality Of Water For Preparing Concrete, Batching, Proportioning And Mixing Of Concrete, Comparison Of Salt Water And Fresh Water, Cement Hydration, Workability And Shrimp Of Fresh Concrete And Curing Of Concrete.</div> </div> <div>CHAPTER THREE</div> <div> <div>Chapter three of this Effects Of Salt Water On Concrete” academic work is available.  Chapter Three of “Effects Of Salt Water On Concrete\" Contains: Materials And Methods, Collection Of Fresh/Tap Water Sample, Analysis Of The Water Sample, Grading Of Course Aggregates, Batching And Mixing Of Samples Materials Required, Curing Of Concrete Cubes, Determination Of The Compressive Strength And Density Of The Concrete Cubes And Mix Design.</div> </div> <div>CHAPTER FOUR</div> <div> <div>Chapter four of this Effects Of Salt Water On Concrete project work is available.Chapter Four of Effects Of Salt Water On Concrete Contains: Data Presentation, Calculations And Analysis.</div> </div> <div>CHAPTER FIVE</div> <div> <div>Chapter five of this Effects Of Salt Water On Concrete material is available. Chapter Five of Effects Of Salt Water On Concrete Contains: Conclusion, Recommendations And Reference.</div> </div>\n\nEFFECTS OF SALT WATER ON CONCRETE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF SALT WATER ON CONCRETE", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><em><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></em> </p> <p><em><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND</strong></em><br/>Building can be explained as a structural that provides shelter to lives and properties, it could be a school, church, shop, or factory that has roof, walls. A lot of building specifically in Port-Harcourt and Lagos state have collapsed and thereby causing a huge economic waste and lost of lives of people and properties.<br/>Building failure can be defined as the collapse of structure, while building disaster gives evidence of a structural member being unsafe before the actual collapse. Building failure in a construction sector is an indispensable factor that must be considered with great care and skills (Field, 1986 pp 7).<br/>From the experiment done so far by the researchers, it is being observed that building failed and superstructure failed. Bearing capacity failed due to high moisture content and differential excessive settlement.<br/>However, investigation of structural failure in building is an extensive research work, a lot of laboratory test, observation and analysis, but for the purpose of this project, effort have been made to reduce the research on those aspect considered very relevant.<br/>There are so many factors that could lead to failure in building and these failures have various modes with which they occur, it should be realised, however that errors are major causes of structural collapse and no matter how they are derived they are little help in preventing collapse resulting from them.<br/>Some examples of structural collapse are as follows:<br/>Terrorist attack, Pentagon, Washington DC 2001<br/>Herron Road Bridge, Ottawa 1996<br/>Terrorist Bombing, Murrah Federal Building, Owahoma City, 1995<br/>Second narrow Bridge, Vancower 1958<br/>Tank failure, Ashland oil co, Pitsburgh 1988<br/>Quebec bridge (1907, 1916)<br/>(www.du.edu/jeaivert/failurehtm).</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 AREA OF STUDY</em></strong><br/>The research work took place in Port Harcourt Area of Rivers State which is in the capital city at plot 308 Abacha Road Rumueme, Port Harcourt Rivers State.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS </em></strong><br/>It is observed that plan review and performance standard are very important to everyone involved but most contractors and engineers have abandoned this practices. <br/>The problems which has lead to failure are intended to be studied in this research are listed below. <br/>i.

A case study of Naze Junction to Futo Gate Road, this study talks about the existence and development of tacks, researches made to discover the causes and remedies of road deterioration, the road structure/road maintenances. <br/>This project covers the methods used to determine the cause of the road deterioration by conducting, soil test and traffic census. It includes the pictures of the deteriorated spots of the road. The result of the test done and their general analysis.<br/>It covers also the conclusion of the study causes, based on the literature search and results of experiments and finally the recommendation of the study.</p> <p><em><strong> INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></em><br/>The importance of highways for the prosperity of any country cannot be over emphasized. The development of roads starts a chain reaction of atomic nature. It opens up new avenues or increases employment in the agriculture, industry, commerce health and sanitation sector by inherent virtue of being a communication and transport link between the developed areas.<br/>The road, so necessary an instrument of social well being that in every new country it is one of the first things that is being thought of. The great essence or need for roads came about due to the invention of the wheel, some 5,000 years ago. The increasing rate of highway deterioration has become a source of great concern to both the Engineers and the people using it. There is a great need to ascertain the various causes of the deterioratory state of our roads. And some of the ways to ascertain the causes of deterioration is to carryout trial bore hole,site investigation, and also traffic census.<br/>The major reason for unsatisfactory state of road construction in Nigeria, is the low priority given to road development and maintenance, also responsible, is the lack of concern for human life and proper qualification and experience to do a particular job. The construction of roads, require expert’s in the field, so that the road will be able to carryout its basic function effectively, and survive its life expectancy of years. This is in order to avoid the premature failure of our roads, which is an existing fact currently in Imo State, particularly on the road leading from Naze Junction to Futo Gate which forms the basis of this project. There is not just one type of road failure, so the issue of the premature deterioration of our roads requires finance, and experienced knowledge.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 AREA OF STUDY</em></strong><br/>The road leading from Naze Junction to Futo Gate is located in Owerri, the capital of Imo State. The road was constructed in the year 1977/1978, by Mezu construction company during the honourable regime of Late Dr. Sam Onunaka Mbakwe the, then executive governor of Imo State.<br/>The road leading from Naze Junction to Futo Gate is a ring road, provided to enable the free flow of traffic. It has a total length of about 6.00km, and has a lane width of about 7.3m. The road was constructed of Asphaltic Surfacing. It is a Surface dressed flexible pavement of single carriage way which has no shoulder. The routine maintenance work is been handled by the office of the Ministry of Works, housing and transport Owerri and currently the maintenance work has been awarded to Hardel and Erice construction company, a company owned by Chief Iwuanyanwu.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>The road leading from Naze Junction to Futo Gate has lost its original shape and design. It has deteriorated to the state that the Asphaltic Surfacing of some parts of the roads have gone off. This state of deterioration is a problem because, it does not effectively serve one of the purposes of construction which is to convey people and goods effectively. Due to its deterioratory state, when rain falls it is difficult for people and cars to ply the road because of it’s bad nature, this results in the breaking down of vehicles in the middle of the road and rendering the occupants of the vehicles helpless, and this broken down vehicles in turn, causes traffic congestions.<br/>If this road is not properly reconstructed and maintained properly so many lives would be lost and goods would be wasted. And the area will be totally inaccessible.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</em></strong><br/>The following are the objectives of this study: <br/>1. To evaluate the cause of the deterioration of the road leading from Naze Junction to Futo Gate.<br/>2. To uncover the pains which the people of this area are subjected to as a result of the deplorable condition of the road.<br/>3. To find and comment on the economic importance of the Naze Futo Gate road to its people and the people of Imo State.<br/>4. To proffer solution which will be suitable enough to remedy this road from deteriorating.<br/>5. Finally to suggest measures to help minimize or stop the occurrence of the deterioration of our Nigerian roads.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 SCOPE AND LIMITATION </em></strong><br/>There are so many ways of determining the cause of road deterioration and they include, soil test, drainage designing, CBR test, compaction, traffic count, test on the various layer of the road structure, Atterberg limit etc. But due to the circumstances surrounding this study and my inability and unavailability of machines/equipments to carryout some of this test. This project is only limited to the determining of only the soil test, Atterberg limit, and traffic count of the road.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE</em></strong><br/>The significance of this project include:<br/>1. To prepare a paper that will serve as an academic tool, to help students handle related projects in future with confidence.<br/>2. To state its value to the inhabitants of the Naze Junction to Futo Gate Road, as it will in no small measure help to alleviate transport and traffic problems currently being experienced by its people, and users.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 DEFINITIONS OF TERMS</em></strong><br/>1.

DETERIORATION: It is a gradual process whereby a structure losses its initial quality or value due to age or defective construction. If not given attention from time to time.<br/>3. HIGHWAY: In a road system the important road like national highway and provincial highways are called highways.<br/>4. PREMATURE FAILURE: This is said to occur when the material what ever it is, i.e wearing course, surface dressing or structural concrete etc, has failed before its predicted design life has expired.<br/>5. ROAD: It is defined as a convenient way over which vehicles and all sots of traffic can law fully move. <br/>6. RING ROAD: It is a road constructed around an Urban Area to enable free flow of traffic.<br/>7.

The characteristics of many terrestrial ecosystems, for example are heavily influenced by water availability, in the case of aquatic ecosystems, the quantity and quality of water in rivers and aquifers is fundamental to human, aquatic life and many activities. Most obviously agriculture use, industry use, power generation, transportation and waste constraint on economic development. Consequently, there have been a great many studies into the potential effect of climatic change on hydrology (focusing of cycling of water and water quality aspects with its proper analysis and assessment).<br/>The majority of these studies have concentrated on possible changes in the water balance for example, the quality of stream water, impacts of the changes in the gravity of water such as the reliability of a water sources (supply) or the risk of contaminated source. This study focuses on techniques adopted to determine the quality of water, by carrying out chemical text, biological text and physical text on Otammiri River to ascertain its quality and beneficial use of water.<br/>Water And The Hydrologic Cycle<br/>Water begins its never ceasing cycle as vapour in the atmosphere as well as the water in the lakes and oceans, provides protection against extremes of both heat and cold. Hydrologic cycle refers to the complete movement of water from the atmosphere and below the earth surface. It includes water precipitation as rain, snow, hail or dew, it journey over around and through obstacles above on and below the earths surface and its eventual evaporation and return to the atmosphere. It is the longest water purification system known to man.<br/>Water<br/>Water is essential for man’s existence, it is needed in large quantities and in all wholesomeness despite the requirements for potable supply, water is needed for power generation, irrigation, recreation, industrial production processes and in waste disposal. The importance of water made it possible for nature to distribute it all over the regions of the earth. The planet earth contains about 70% water in form of oceans, seas, rivers, lakes and ground water. Water provided for human consumption should receive minimum possible treatment, though the best supply is one which needs no treatment at all. Public health is vulnerable to the danger of incidence of diseases, mainly through water borne, water related and water washed diseases. These diseases include cholera, typhoid and para-typhoid fever, malaria, yellow fiver, schistosomosois and guinea worm. Consequent to the incidence of disease, water treatment processes become a preciosity that require careful while handling. For an acceptable quality of water supply the international standard for drinking water established by World Health Organization (2007) states that water intended to human consumption must be free from organisms and from concentration of chemical substances that may be hazardous to health. Supplies of drinking water should be pleasant to drinking as circumstance permit.<br/>The quality of water must be wholesome and palatable. Wholesome water must be free from organisms, poisonous and excessive amount of mineral, turbidity taste, odour, and must be well aerated.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This project laid more emphasis on the assessment of the contribution of hydrologic cycle to the water quality of Otammiri River. To understand how contamination of the River occurs, it is necessary to understand the contributions of the hydrologic cycle to the Rivers, the water quality along its profile from the confluence of Otammiri and Nworie River. Water bodies can be fully characterized by the three major components; hydrology, physic-chemistry and biology. Therefore this project describes a complete assessment of water quality based on appropriate monitoring of these components.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The aim of this project is to provide understanding of;<br/> The assessment of the contributions of hydrologic cycle to Otammiri River from the broadest perspective.<br/> Water quality potentials of Otammiri River<br/> Physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water<br/> Water quality control and management.<br/> Water quality in the environment, sources of contamination, effects of common impurities in water and self purification of water.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The scope of this project is the proper assessment of the contribution of hydrologic cycle to Otammiri River which include;<br/>a.

The following was needed to determine the water quality conditions.<br/> Three different samples would be collected from difernt reaches of Otammiri River<br/> The samples should be taken undisturbed and moved to the laboratory immediately for proper analysis.<br/> The presence of the following should be determined; copper, zinc, magnesium, iron, sulphate, phosphate, nitrite, chloride and sulphite.<br/> Also, the following should be determined; pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, alkalinity, total hardness, turbidity, total coliform, etc.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/> This project provides an account on how to make hydrologic cycle and water quality fit for human use.<br/> The various treatment method of contaminated water<br/> It provides information on how the River is being contaminated along the reaches of the river.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>In the course of carrying out this project, some difficulties were encountered which includes;<br/> Unavailability of research material like test books<br/> Unsteady power supply that delayed the laboratories experiment<br/> Difficulties encountered when analyzing different water sample<br/> Non availability of equipment needed for water quality analysis.</p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF HYDROLOGIC CYCLE TO THE WATER QUALITY PROFILE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF HYDROLOGIC CYCLE TO THE WATER QUALITY PROFILE", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project work was aimed at determining the effect of effluent on Aba River. This became pertinent owing to the fact that companies discharge their effluent into the river without treatment. Four different samples were collected from four locations and analyzed, which include Upstream Sample (A), Unilever Effluent (B), Nigeria Breweries Effluent (C), and Down Stream Sample (D).<br/>The results obtained indicated that there is industrial input of metals like Iron, Copper, Zinc, Calcium and non metals like Sulphate, Phosphate, Chloride, and Carbonate. This parameters were higher when compared with WHO’s standard.<br/>The microbiological analysis showed that the river is highly polluted. <br/>Finally conclusions were drawn and recommendations made.</p> <p><em><strong>NTRODUCTION </strong></em><br/>Effluent impact on water quality is a point of great concern. This is because, it has been observed that the quality of water people use has a great effect on their health. If proper care is not taken to ascertain the characteristics or composition of the discharged effluent, then environment is exposed to numerous hazards. <br/>One may ask what an effluent really is. An effluent is defined as an industrial liquid waste. It is characterized by the components used in such industries. This implies that the composition or characteristics of effluent varies from industry to industry. <br/>Impact at the other hand is defined as an effect felt as a result of an action taken or a process carried out. It becomes pertinent to carryout Environmental Impact Assessment of possible action to be taken or projects to be carried out. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is defined as a management tool used to assess and evaluate any potential change in the environment (including air, water, land, natural resources, fauna flora, humans and their interaction) whether adverse or beneficial, wholly or partial, that results from an organisations activities, products or services (Ofunne, 2002).<br/>We are really concerned with the effect the discharge of liquid industrial waste (effluent), from Unilever plc and Nigeria Breweries Limited; have on the quality of water obtainable at the river where they are discharged. This impact that is our point of concern is dependent of the various compositions of the effluent and its degree.<br/>Wastewater ought to be collected or a sewer system and transported to plant for treatment prior to disposal (Mark and Mark, 2008). Dilution into a surface water course and purification by nature yield additional quality improvement. The feat of this effluent discharge is that of collecting the water before complete rejuvenation for municipal. <br/><br/><em><strong>1.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></em><br/>The hazardous effect of the effluent flows from Unilever Plc and Nigeria Breweries Limited to Aba River is our point of concern. This becomes a problem because the waste ought to be channelled to a sewer treatment plant before being discharged finally into the river. This is to help reduce the intensity of the wastewater. <br/>It is therefore pertinent to ascertain the composition of these effluents and relating it with the effect the have on the river quality. This is so because if it not ascertained the environment is exposed to a lot of risk.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVE </em></strong><br/>1. To ascertain the level of pollution of the river due to the discharged effluents. <br/>2. To compare the physical, and chemical parameters in the river with the World Health Organizations acceptable standard for drinking water.<br/>3. To suggest or recommend the best ways of discharging effluent in the river. <br/>4. To suggest ways of enforcing the methods of effluent discharge.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 AREA OF STUDY</em></strong><br/>The project is based on the analysis of the different water samples collected from Aba River in Aba North Local Government Council of Abia State, (where Unilever Plc and Nigeria Breweries Plc discharge their effluent).</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>1. To help bring to the notice of the companies the effect their waste is having in the environment.<br/>2. To proffer solution on the best ways of discharging effluent into rivers.<br/>3.

Geochydrology has an identical connotation, and hydrogeology differs only by its greater emphasis on geology. Utilization of groundwater dates from ancient times, although an understanding of the occurrence and movement of subsurface water as part of the hydrologic cycle has come only relatively recently.<br/>SCOPE: Groundwater referred to without specification is commonly understood to mean water occupying all the voids within geologic stratum. This saturated zone should be distinguished from an unsaturated, or earation zone where voids are filled with water and air. Water contained in saturated zone is important for engineering work, geologic studies and water supply development consequently, the occurrence of water in this zones will be emphasized here. Unsaturated zone a re usually found above saturated zones and extend uquad to the ground surface. Because this water includes soil masture within the root zone, it is a major concern for agriculture, binary, and soil science. No rigid demarcation of water between the two zones is possible, for they possess an interdependent boundary and water can move from owe zone to the other in either direction. The interrelationships are described more in some higher hydrogeology texts.</p> <p><strong>HISTORICAL BACK GROUND AND GROUND WATER THEORIES</strong><br/>Groundwater development dates from ancient times the Old Testament contains numerous references to groundwater, springs, and wells, other that dug wells, groundwater in ancient times we supplied from horizontal wells known as QAUNATS. These persist to the present day and can be found in a band across the regions of the South Western Asia and North Africa extending from Aghanistan to Morocco. A cross section a long a qanat ie shown in fig 1.1 typically, a gently sloping tunnel dug through alluvial material leads water by gravity flow beneath the water table at its upper end to a ground.</p> <p>FIG 1.1</p> <p>A vertical cross section along a qanat surface outlet and irrigation canal at its lower end. Vertical shafts dug at closely s paced intervals provide access to the tunnel. Qanats are laboriously hand constructed by skilld workers employing techniques that date back 3000 years.<br/>Iran possesses the greatest concentration of qanats; here some 22,000 qanats supply 75 percent of all water used in the country. Lengths of qanats extend up to 30km, but most are less than 5km. The depth of the qanat mother well (see fig 1.1) ie normally less than 50m, but instances of depth exceeding 250m have been reported. Discharge of Qantas varies. Seasonally with water table fluctuations and seldom exceed 100m3/hr.</p> <p><strong>GROUNDWATER THEORIES</strong><br/>Utilization of groundwater greatly preceded understanding of its origin, occurrence, and movement. The writing of Greek philosophers to explain origins of springs and groundwater contain theories ranging from fantasy to nearly correct accounts. As late as the seventeenth century it was generally assumed that water emerging from springs could not be derived from rainfall, for it was believed that the quantity was in adequate and the earth too impervious to permit penetration of rain water for below the surface. Thus, early Greek philosophers such as Homer, Thates and Plato hypothesized that springs were formed by seawater. Conducted through subterranean channels below the mountains, then Aristotle suggested that air enters cold dark caverns under the mountains where it condenses into water and contributes to springs.<br/>The Roman philosophers, including Seneca Pliny, followed the Greek ideas and contributed little to the subject. An important step forward, however was made by the Roman architect Vitnvius he explained the now accepted infiltration theory that the mountains receive large amounts of rain that percolate through the rock strata and emerge at their base to form streams.<br/>The Greek theories persisted through the Middle Ages with no advances until the end of the Renaissance. The French Poffer and Philosopher Bernard Palissy (1510 – 1589) reiterated the infiltration theory in 1580, but his teachings were generally ignored. The German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571 – 1630) was a man of strong imagination, who likened the earth to a huge animal that takes in water of the ocean, digests and assimilates it, and discharges the end products of these physiological processes as groundwater and springs. The seawater theory of the Greeks, supplemented by ideas of vapourizaton and condensation processes within the earth, was restated by the French Philosopher Rene’ Descarfes (1596 – 1650).<br/>A clear understanding of the hydrologic cycle was achieved by the latter part of the seventeenth century. For the first time theories were based on observations and quantitative data. Three European countries made notable contributions, although others contributed to and supported these advances. Pierre Perrault (1611 – 1680) and estimated runoff of the upper sein drainage basin. He reported in 1674 that precipitation on the basin was about six times the river discharge, thereby demonstrating false the early assumption of inadequate rainfall. The French Physicist Edme Mariotte (1620 – 1684) made measurements of the same of paris and confirmed paraults work. His publication appeared in 1686, after his death, and contained factual data strongly supported the infiltration theory. Meinzer once stated. Mariotte probably deserves more than any other man the distinction of being regarded as the founder of groundwater hydrology, perhaps I should say the entire science of hydrology”. The third contribution came from the English astronomer Edmund Halley (1656 – 1742), who reported in 1693 on measurements of evaporation demonstrating that sea evaporation was sufficient to account for all springs and stream flow.</p> <p><strong>RECENT CENTURIRES</strong><br/>During the eighteenth century fundamentals in geologic were established that provided a basis for understanding the occurrence and movement of groundwater. During the first half of the nineteenth century many artesian wells were drilled in France stimulation interest in groundwater. The French hydraulic engineer Henry Darcy (1803 – 1858). Studied the movement of water through sand. His treatise of 1856 defined the relation, now known as Darcy’s law, governing groundwater flow in most alluvial and sedimentary formations. Later European contributions of the nineteenth century emphasized the hydraulics of groundwater development. Significantly contributions were made by J. Boussineq, G.A. Daubree, J. Dupuru and A. Thiem. In the twentieth century, increased activity in all phases of groundwater hydrology has occurred. Many Europeans have participated with publications of either specialized or comprehensive works. There are too many people to mention them all, but R. Dachler, E. Imbeaux, K. Keihack are best known in the United States. <br/>American contributions to groundwater hydrology date from near the end of the nineteenth century. In the past 90 years, tremendous advances have been made. Important early theoretical contributions were made by A. Hazem, F.H. King while detailed field investigations were begun by men such as T.C Chamberline, N.H Darton through his consuming interest in groundwater and his dynamic leadership of groundwater activities of the U.S geological survey, stimulated many individuals in the quest for groundwater knowledge. In recent decadeds the publications of M.S. Hantush, C.E. Jacob. Within the lat 20 years the surge in university research on groundwater problems, the establishment of professional consulting firms specializing in water resources, and the advent of the digital computer have jointly produced a competence for development and management of groundwater resources that was nonexistent hereto fore.</p>\n\nGROUNDWATER DEVELOPMENT FOR PORTABLE WATER SUPPLY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GROUNDWATER DEVELOPMENT FOR PORTABLE WATER SUPPLY", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This thesis on a project undertaken by the author is aimed at providing explanation of the basic theory of the work of road design and its associated activities also, to cover practical methods of working.<br/>In pursuit of the meaningful completion this project a lot of investigation was embarked with principles and practice of road construction. The total distance of route was determined and stations established bearing in mind the intervisibility of the stations.<br/>Leveling was carried out to obtain information on the profile of the route for proper earthwork knowledge which theodolite traversing was carried out to obtain the plan and horizontal alignment of the route<br/>Soil analysis, gave the proper constitute of the soil which was also carried out to and in the pavement design. Therefore the pavement design of the route was abased on the results obtained from the soil analysis using the CBR method.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>The importance of road to life and activities can not be overemphasized. Roads have important role to play in the transportation system of the country. Good transportation system through the pavement design has in the recent years provide to be of much significance commercially and otherwise history testifies that the provision of roadways is necessary to draw a country out of a state of uncivilization, but that civilization is not attained until good road network between neigbours is made so easy that the local difference which brench narrowness is minimized.<br/>However this project has been designed strictly to modern design standards e.g ASSHO method and it centers on the route survey and pavement design of the road to meet with the present day effective services.<br/>Moreover, this project work could really sever as a future guide in making a new rural road, down to industrial layout to connect mass comm..<br/>Therefore being in a school environment a good transportation system will improve the healthy studying condition of the new road pavement and maintenance of the existing one.</p> <p><strong>1.1 RELEVANCE OF PROJECT</strong><br/>The roadway linking Federal Secretariat industrial centre and Mass Communication Department is an earth road of about 0.620km in length whose origin can be traced back to the origin of the I.M.T campus III environment.<br/>The project work has its relevance centered on the general design of a roadway which will link federal secretariat, industrial centre and Mass communication Department in order to ensure a hitch free traffic especially to the lecturer, visitors and students making use of that industrial centres<br/>However the improvement of this roadway would grieve the students and lecturers the service of belonging as it gives easier access to masscom. Department.</p> <p><strong>1.2 SITE INSPECTION</strong><br/>This project site which is the roadway linking Federal Secretariat industrial centre and Mass Communication Department was inspected to ascertain its location and the present state of the road. It was vividly observed that the area was a dusty roadway throughout its length and had been graded without siderains, spanning about 620m length with the width of 85m.<br/>To obtain these information, a preliminary survey was carried out which also helped to ascertain the geological and soil conditions likely intervals forming the chainages to be referred to until the construction id\\s brought to a completion.</p> <p><strong>1.3 EVALUATION OF ROAD NETWORK W NIGERIA</strong><br/>There are three types of roads in Nigeria<br/>- Grade I: Surface dressed road<br/>- Grade II: laterite on natural soil road<br/>- Grade III road on nature soil<br/>Road, which were built earlier in Nigeria, were built as grade III roads, which consist of roads built on level earth. This grace of road was subsequently improved to grade II roads, which comprises of stone laterite on soil and on general surface roads.<br/>Ultimately, the road was improved to grade I which is laterite road with good surfacing. The surfacing is either asphalted concrete for flexible pavement (in this project work flexible pavement will be considered).<br/>The progressive method of road construction produced very durable roads but because of this rapid growth of traffic on the grade I and II this method of road construction was discontinued and surface dressed roads were built.<br/>Road development receive a set back due to the development of railway in the country between 1895 and 1910 but was only revitalized early 1960when highways were built to connect various party of the country. Today, there is virtually on state capital (if not local government area headquarter) that is not linked directly by a highway.</p> <p><strong>1.4 MOTOR VEHICLE CHARACTERISTICS THAT AFFECT ROAD DESIGN DATA</strong><br/>In design of road, the current physical characteristics of ehicle in use and the anticipated future improvement in se are all essential. These vehicles are evaluated in terms f a standard vehicle known a design vehicle. The design data for a road stretch include: aix load, axle space, overall length, eight and width of the design vehicle.<br/>1. Length: The length of the vehicle will affect the extra widening at curves and minimum turning radius the passing sight distance the road capacity and parking facilities for example 12m are recommended for a single unit truck while 20m (19:812m) for Troilus<br/>2. Width: The width of the vehicle will affect the lane width the width of shoulders and the width of parking spaces. AASHO recommends a maximum width of 2.59m.<br/>3. Height: The height of the vehicle will affect the overall height distance provided under structure such as: bridges, overhead bridges electric services lines etc. the maximum height for vehicle should not be more than 4m.<br/>4. Weight: The weight of vehicles affects the thickness of the pavement, ruling and limiting gradient and design of bridges.<br/>5. speed: vehicle affects horizontal and vertical alignment design elevation limiting radius, signal distances, width of pavement on straight and curves for the purpose of this project a design speed of 30km/n is been considered. He design speed is the maximum speed maintainable throughout the journey with compatible safely and comfort)</p> <p><strong>1.5 DRIVER AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS</strong><br/>A driver could be a vehicle rive, cyclist or pedestrian. There are no average drivers as the capabilities of a driver changes under such effects as fatigue ,frustration, monotony and alcohol. Much speed is the primary cause of accident.<br/>Drivers have different visual perception capabilities to tract promptly to conditions requiring positive action<br/>The major driver characteristics considered are:<br/>1. Reaction time: this is the period of time, which elapses from the period the eye of a driver registers a sene to the time muscular reaction occurs.<br/>2. perception time: this is the period of the much elapses before reaction time begins. AASHO recommends combined reaction plus perception time tobe2.5 sec and can be taken as 3 sec in complex situations.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY</strong><br/>This is a quick type of surveyor rapid examination of the ground and its adjacent natural features usually made with out survey instruments to limit the alternate route in terms of cost tone or two.<br/>In the cause of this project, there reconnaissance survey was carried out in order to obtain a first hand view of the road by walking through the length of the road thereby having a clear picture of the entire roadway. This is also helped in determining the most suitable way of carrying out the project economically in time and energy. During the process of reconnaissance, survey stations were chosen and marked.</p> <p><strong>1.6.1 CHAIN SURVEY</strong><br/>The method adopted in marking linear measurement is the linear measurement in which a employed in making a direct measurement is dependent of the degree of accuracy required. However in cause of this project, accuracy in measurement was maintained to a moderate level. Obstacle such as rough ground, pedestrian traffic and motor cycle traffic were avoided as much as possible.</p> <p><strong>1.6.2 STATION MARKING</strong><br/>The survey stations were marked in such way that will fulfill the following requirement. <br/>a. The stations where to be easily and quickly found during survey operations.<br/>b. They were to be fairly permanent so that pedestrians will not easily remove them.<br/>c. They were marked using bottle tops and nails at the center line of the road for easy location of these stations, temporary stations were established at the edge of the road using wooden pegs.</p> <p><strong>1.7 FACTORS AFFECTING THE CHOICE OF STATION</strong><br/>These factors include the following<br/>1. Easy meaning condition: stations are to be chosen in such a way as to avoid obstructs during draining or tapping exercise.<br/>2. Inter-visibility: stations are to be chosen and placed in such a manner that no station on struts the line of sight of another stations. This was considered for both traversing and leveling.<br/>3. Traversing at close distance should be avoided in order to avoid angular errors being introduced if targets at short range are not properly bisected.</p>\n\nDESIGN OF ROAD PAVEMENTS DESIGNING OF ROAD PAVEMENT LINKING FEDERAL SECRETARIAT INDUSTRIAL CENTRE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN OF ROAD PAVEMENTS DESIGNING OF ROAD PAVEMENT LINKING FEDERAL SECRETARIAT INDUSTRIAL CENTRE", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>   </p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>In other to provide information to contractors in a construction industry for works to be carried out on sites, drawings are produce, which serves as means of communication are used by designers in every engineering specters.<br/>For those reason, the works are mostly work of a structural engineer to design a construction of structure for sheltering to be completed, such as road, bridges, railways, dams, buildings and other relevant construction work.

The intensive exploitation of the land disturbed the natural soil vegetative cover and exposed its, surface to the effect of erosive agents and to introduce such forms of agriculture that did not destroy the land the devastation of land by erosion often led to the down fall of civilization e.g in Mesopotamia Syria, China and else where. </p> <p>According to Robert. M. (1984), Erosion is manifested by the determination of soil surface effected by exogenous forces, especially water. Ice wind and, man as the significant anthropogenic factor. The disturbance of soil surface is accompanied by the removal of the detached soil particles by the force of kinetic energy of some of the erosion agents, namely water and wind and the deposition of this matter with a decrease in this energy. Erosion is caused by surface num off and result complex natural process. Water erosion is caused by precipitation. Areas with a low precipitation usually have a small surface num off because precipitation water infiltrates into the soil is consumed by vegetation erosion which may also be broadly cause by a natural factor organ.</p> <p>It can also be carried by improper channeling neglect of natural sewage systems and obstruction of naturally sewage by buildings. Form land and other unplanned structure causes a great deal of damage. </p> <p>Although the nature of soil within the area under consideration is mostly sandy with a very low water storage capabilities. Practical observation orchestrated form visit to those site prone to erosion have shown that their may be possibility of erosion if the nun off water is not properly channel e.g the nature of the soil. In sandy soil they can form a very good soil material but danger exist if the water table is near or surface nun off is not adequately channeled. The sandy easily eroded a way from it position their by causing or may lead to fully erosion. </p> <p>Furthermore, erosion is seen as one of the most serious defects in contemporary residential buildings, it is observed here that apart form it causing rapid destruction of structure / buildings, it also result to severe damage to the soil and in severe case it adversely affect the health of the occupants. </p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>A certain condition or factor can make a soil or structure / building to loose their Sharpe effectively or ineffectively attain their maximum structural physical and economic life span. It has been seen that a number of fact observed to be responsible for the in-adequate or in-appropriate functioning channeling of sewage surface nun off water at the due time. These in turn expose the building site to the danger of erosion which accelerate their dilapidation. Among the factors or improper channeling / neglect of natural sewage system and obstruction of natural sewage by building without following the local authorities rules dropping of refuse in the drainage ways. Erosion plays a critical role in dilapidation of building and visible in construction industry as one of the most serious defect in contemporary residential buildings. All soils can suffer erosion but some are more vulnerable than others. Soils with dispersible subsoils, for example, are subject to serious erosion by funneling and gully formation. </p> <p><strong>1.3     RESEARCH AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>The major purpose of this study is to determine.

It focused on the type and magnitude of erosion at site in Anambra state and also looked at the specific remedial techniques to that building site will function effectively and efficiently. Attempt should be made to look into laboratory experimentation of the material used for effective control of erosion in building site prone to erosion. Ekwulobia erosion is gully erosion-gully erosion is of concern due to periodically intense rainfall and a large average of erodible soils. Effective design of gully control system must consider the gully network as a whole and be based on geomorphologic indicators such as type of network, order and stage of development.  </p> <p><strong>1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>According to Grolie (1990). Erosion is the wearing away of the earth surface by the action of water. </p> <p>According to Milos Holy (1987). Building is permanent or temporary structure enclosed within exterior walls and a roof and including all attached apparatus. Equipment and fixtures that cannot be removed without cutting into ceiling floors or walls. In the year 1960 Bernard Huss define soil as the top layer of the earths surface in which plants an grow consisting of rock and mineral particles mixed with decayed organic matter and having the capability of retaining water. </p>\n\nEFFECTIVE WAYS OF CONTROLLING EROSION IN A BUILDING SITE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTIVE WAYS OF CONTROLLING EROSION IN A BUILDING SITE", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The successful implementation of building projects may be impaired without a good knowledge of the environmental factors that contribute to building projects abandonment and this abandonment makes it difficult to achieve the benefit to be derived from the projects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the environmental factors that lead to abandonment of public building projects, with a view to proffering solutions to public building projects abandonments in Abuja . The study identifies the characteristics of abandoned public building projects, examine the environmental factors that are responsible for public building projects abandonment and also assess the effects of public building projects abandonment on the environment. The research adopted the quantitative method in which the checklist was developed to obtain the inventory of abandoned public building projects in Abuja. A structured questionnaire was also designed and administered to the in-house consultants of the F.C.D.A. Data was analyzed using statistical tools like Means, Percentages and Relative Importance Index (RII) and presented using Charts and Tables. The study revealed that 67% of the public building projects are abandoned after the contract period has elapsed. It also revealed that lack of funds constitute about 50% of the factors affecting completion as well as none of the abandoned public building projects achieved 50% completion. The study found that inadequate working capital is the highest ranked factor among the other environmental factors with a RII of 0.87. The study also revealed that cost overrun is the most significant effect of abandonment of public building projects with a RII of 0.81. The research concluded that the inadequate working capital, importation of materials and equipments, instability in governance, type of contract, civil conflicts and unexpected geological condition are the environmental factors that contribute largely and immensely to the abandonment of public building projects. The research recommends that there should be proper cost analysis of the project to be embarked upon.</p> <p><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The construction industry contributes greatly to the growth of any nation even though it contributes less than the other industries. Therefore, it is a key player in the socio-economic progress of several countries internationally (Usman, Kamau and Mireri, 2014). Also the Nigeria construction industry is a broad variety of loosely incorporated organizations that jointly erect, adjust and restore a large range of different buildings and public engineering projects. The building industry is also defined as financial activities that center on the construction of physical projects, such as buildings and road and rail network, despite of the construction being land or maritime based (Osman, 2006). The success of a project is a very critical issue in the industry.</p> <p>Unluckily a lot of these projects in Nigeria are out rightly abandoned still at commencement (Olapade and Anthony, 2012). Dahlan (2001) contends that, from the development point of view, the word „abandoned project‟ refers to a project in which the construction job has been delayed, even though planning consent has been approved to the developer. Also, Olapade and Anthony (2012) defined abandoned project as a project in which the client refuse to provide maintenance and working services to a building. However, this study view abandoned building project as a project in which the construction work is incomplete and suspended. Therefore, the importance that the continual abandonment of projects would bring numerous effects on real properties and its values and the financial system cannot be overemphasized since some of the building projects provide the fundamental services that should improve the real properties developed (Ihuah and Benebo, 2014). By most accounts, abandoned buildings have numerous risks and danger associated with them.</p> <p>The abandonment of building projects most especially the public building projects scattered across the length and breadth of Nigeria. According to a report by Nasir (2012), there are about eleven thousand, eight hundred and eighty-six (11,886) abandoned projects that will cost an expected N7.78 trillion to complete! These shocking figures are from the statement of the Presidential Projects Assessment Committee (PPAC) set up in March 2011, by The President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria to look into cases of abandoned projects. If the government does not begin any fresh projects, it will take more than five years budgeting about N1.5 trillion yearly to finish them all – and that is assuming no cost-over runs or delays.</p> <p>However, Faniran, Love and Smith (2000) recommended that there is a need to build up proper management tools and techniques particularly modified to the project environment of developing countries. According to Ajayi, Ogunsanmi and Ofili (2010) the four most significant external environmental factors in declining order include community issues, weather conditions, economic situation (boom or meltdown) and government policy.</p>\n\nAN EVALUATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT LEAD TO ABANDONMENT OF PUBLIC BUILDING PROJECTS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN EVALUATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT LEAD TO ABANDONMENT OF PUBLIC BUILDING PROJECTS ", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ASTRACT</p> <p>Building, civil engineering and heavy engineering projects are major contributions from the construction industry to national development.

These new processes also reduce environmental impact of a completed building.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>\"It is not easy being green\" - Kermit the Frog, (1972). There is no single definition of what constitutes a green building, but it can be loosely defined as one in which all the materials and systems are designed with an emphasis on their integration into a whole, for the purpose of minimizing their impacts on the occupant and their environment. This includes such issues as building siting, materials selection, energy efficiency, water conservation, construction waste management, indoor air quality and others.</p> <p>The green refers to a method of design and construction that minimizes burden on our natural resources and the environment. A building which adopts the best practices of environmental technology, for optimizing the use of natural resources for providing the clean and cost effective working ambience. Green building concept has the following attributes:-</p> <p>1.       Eco-friendly structure and environment.</p> <p>2.       Utilizing minimum natural resources and preserving them for future generation.</p> <p>3.       Sustainability i.e. having internal means of generating</p> <p>resources as far as possible.</p> <p>4.       Conservation of energy by means of smart device.</p> <p>5.       Using recyclable materials.</p> <p>6.       User-friendly environment, work practices and discipline.</p> <p>7.       Create a quality building that is commercially viable.</p> <p>As an innovation in the Nigeria construction industry there should be a holistic approach to the design and construction of buildings. All the resources that go into the building be the materials, fuels or the contribution of the users need to be considered if sustenance architecture is to be produced.</p> <p>Producing green buildings involves resolving many conflicting issues and requirement. Each design decision has environmental implications. A green building places high priority on health, environmental and resource conservation performance over its life cycle. These new priorities expand and complement the classical building concerns.</p> <p>Most green buildings are of high-quality buildings, they last longer, cost less to operate and maintain, and provide greater occupant satisfaction than standard development. Sophisticated buyers and lessors prefer them and often prefer to pay a premium for their advantages. What surprises many people unfamiliar with this design movement is that good green building often cost little or no more to build than conventional designs. Commitment to better performance, close teamwork throughout the design process or stages, openness to new approaches and information on how these are best applied are more important than a large construction budget.</p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The fundamental purposes of green building as innovation in Nigeria construction industry is to have the ability to adapt, respond and to take advantage of opportunities offered by natural ventilation, lightening, heating, and cooling resulting to savings by cutting down in its imported energy requirement. However, green building utilizing sophisticated monitoring technology and are able to alert occupiers to imminent faults thus saving the more costly maintenance at a latter day. By providing an environment that is capable of adapting to individual or collective requirements, green building can produce a comfortable atmosphere and help to raise the productivity of the people who live and work within it.</p> <p>A green building should be robust in its design allowing it to respond to a personal or organization changing requirement mood and taste. It is on this background that the benefit of green building should be measured in terms of its environmental, economic, and social impacts.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Traditionally, buildings are viewed as a passive element of Workplace or dwelling. Today's innovation is seeking it to be as a dynamic structure that supports the people and evolving technologies to make the physical environment more comfortable, interactive, secure, productive and cost effective. The traditional building materials and other construction/industrial waste are recycled economically and beneficially for the Nigeria construction industry.</p> <p>How can the government and construction industry in Nigeria are convinced to start implementing changes in material selection that would result in decreased environmental loadings and see the need to start demanding the use of environmentally less damaging construction materials, processes and activities. The problem now is how these can fully be embraced as an innovation in Nigeria construction industry.</p> <p><strong>1.3.1 AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p> <strong>1.3.1 AIM: </strong>Professionals in the construction industry opine that, conventional building development and construction practices are no larger sustainable and that green building design and construction can greatly reduce the effect of construction industry on the environment.</p> <p>Hence, green building concept today is becoming part of standard practice the world over especially in Europe and United States of America. Its development has been very encouraging despite inherent potentials.</p> <p>Thus the project work seek to examine, analyze and profer solution to the attendant problems.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2 OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The proposal came up with the following objectives: -</p> <p>1.       To ascertain whether green building are eco-friendly     structures and environmentally friendly.</p> <p>2.       To encourage regular use of recyclable materials.</p> <p>3.  To create quality building that are commercially      viable.</p> <p>4.  Adopt environmentally sound and healthy work practices during both construction and occupancy.</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.       What are the similarities, differences and components of green building?</p> <p>2.       Are green building more expensive?</p> <p>3.       Does green building minimize external pollution and    environmental damage?</p> <p>4.       In what ways can the problems associated with the      green building be solved?</p> <p>5.       Is green building of high quality over conventional</p> <p>          building?</p> <p><strong>1.5     SCOPE AND DELIMITATION</strong></p> <p>A major challenge to green building as innovation in Nigeria construction industry is the apparent lack of knowledge on green building concept by the built environment professionals. This knowledge gap impedes the ability of construction professional to fully apply knowledge in the design and construction of green buildings.</p> <p>This project work seeks to increase the awareness that green building and its components are more valuable, </p> <p>Cheaper and impact less on the environment than the conventional ones. However, it was not possible for the project to cover all aspects of green building as innovation rather it is just a few to exciting possibilities that are being explored at modern age.</p> <p>The work is not made to be exhaustive, rather it serves as an introduction to some ideas that could revolutionalize the way building are designed and constructed with materials that are eco-friendly, cheaper, durable, attractive to tenants and intelligent.</p> <p><strong>1.6     JUSTIFICATION AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Statistics has shown that pace of change and innovation is now so great that in construction industry, we are now experiencing a technological growth similar to that of the entire industrial revolution every 12 months. This shows the level reached so far by construction industry and it’s professional to the effect of green building.</p> <p>Building construction and design are changing in response to many divers environmental concerns, globalization, increase in less maintenance cost, advance information technology and so on. This project work discusses few of the possibilities that are being explored at the Nigerian building industry.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>A.      Intelligent Building:</strong> - An intelligent building is any building that incorporates technological communication systems that do everything from controlling the buildings environment, lighting and security to maintaining high-speed data network and emergency backup generators.</p> <p> <strong>B.      Green Building: -</strong> These are buildings that adopt the best practices of environmental technology for optimizing the use for natural resources for providing the clean and cost effective working ambience</p>\n\nGREEN BUILDING AS INNOVATION IN NIGERIA CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GREEN BUILDING AS INNOVATION IN NIGERIA CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The management of people at work is an integral part of the management process. The aim of this research is to evaluate the motivational factors of employee consultants in the Nigerian construction industry, with a view to improve motivational practices which leads to growth and sustenance of the Nigerian construction industry. The objectives of this research are the factors of motivation that influences the performance of employee-consultants, the practices of management of consulting and construction firms in the motivation of employee-consultants, the impact of motivation in developed and fast growing consulting/construction firms and the challenges to management motivation and demotivational factors of employee-consultants in Nigerian construction industry. The research work focused on employee-consultants as the key players in the construction industry. A sample size of 108 construction/consultancy, and 150 employee-consultants firms were randomly selected to answer the two set of questionnaires. From the research findings, the ranking of motivational factors reveals the first six factors as outlined in order of their significance from the research: Job security (0.9), salary (0.89), working condition (0.87), reward (0.84), Training and development (0.83) and Leadership respectively (0.82). The absence of the necessary support needed to carry out work was identified to be the most significant demotivational factor from the employee-consultant, while the management of construction/consulting firm has to deal with the Amount of</div> <div>Fee paid (workers‘ wages) as their major hindrance to motivation. The survey concluded that majority of employee-consultants were generally dissatisfied with the level of motivation in their organizations. The Research recommends that new incentive schemes, such as flexible working hours, subsidies can be engaged.

(Robbins, 2005) The key components of a manager‘s work involve leadership, negotiation role, decision making, and communication. Managers have formal authority over the organizational units which are divided into interpersonal, informational and decision role categories.</div> <div>Managers‘ work has a lot of varieties and the interaction with personnel is considered to be the core of management (Thomas, 2002).</div> <div>What defined construction work in the past rare not the same today as work has become more dynamic, the employer-employee relationship is less hierarchical and more transactional. Oyewobi <em>et al.,</em> (2011) identified that the Nigerian construction industry‘s contribution to GDP between 1980 and 2007 had dropped due to poor performance and low productivity. Similarly, Idrus and Sodangi (2007) asserted that the Nigerian construction industry produces nearly 70% of the nation‘s fixed capital formation yet its performance within the economy has been, and continues to be, very poor. This also can be attributed to the movement of Employees away from long-term employment relationships and long-term rewards and the effort are focused on short-term rewards. (Eisner, 2005) The workplace has also undergone radical changes and organizations are becoming more heterogeneous which involves a lot of key players including consultants, the workforce is also becoming more diverse and Managers need to recognize that people.</div>\n\nEVALUATING THE MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS OF EMPLOYEE-CONSULTANTS IN THE NIGERIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATING THE MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS OF EMPLOYEE-CONSULTANTS IN THE NIGERIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>Abstract</strong></div> <div>Timber isa construction material with unparalleledenvironmental credential. Howbeit, limitations of span and crossectional dimension, strength reducing defects and anisotropy limits its engineering application. Mechanical methods of jointing to address the earlier challenge has introduced serious wood fiber failure and increased the embodied energy in timber as a green material. However, developed societies have established in literature the possibility of overcoming these limitations to utilize timber beyond the traditional application in Nigeria being glueable for developing engineered wood products like glued laminated timber (glulam) using their timber species. Conversely, while little or no interest is shown in timber as a structural material in Nigeria, many of the few researches in timber have focused on solid timber elements leaving its limitations unattended. Consequently, its structural capabilities is yet unappreciated. Nevertheless, the fact remains that reconstituting natural timber as glulam is an effective way of optimizing this green material for limitless structural use. Whether these qualities are achievable with local timber is the main thrust of this research. The research therefore conducted laboratory experiments on selected timber species namely; Ire (<em>Funtumia africana</em>), Awun (<em>Alstonia congensis</em>) and Oriro (<em>Antiaristoxicaria</em>) being readily available and widely used species with no information on Oriro and Ire in NCP 2 of 1973. The aim was to assess their strength properties as glulam elements with the view to improving their structural capacity.It also set out to determine their glueability, the effects of temperature variation on compressive strength parallel to grain for glulam short columns by subjecting specimens ofequal dimension for the three species to different temperatures of 0 0C, 40 0C, 50 0C, 70 0C, 100 0C and room temperature for 4 hours in an electric oven prior to testing; to compare the mechanical properties of solid and glulam elements. In furtherance, specimens were prepared and tested for; static bending strength, compression parallel and perpendicular to grain, density and moisture content in line with ASTM D193, EN 408(2003) and EN13183-1(2002). The research established that the species are; structurally glueable, that due to temperature increase compressive strength is lost in glulam columns from control temperature (30 0C and 27.90C) to 100 was 41% 14.4% and 21.6% in Ire, Awun and Oriro. Results showed that glulam elements developed 55%, 95% and 143% of clear solid wood bending strength and that bending strength of 65.22N/mm2; 36.44N/mm2, 26.15N/mm2; 25N/mm2 and 14N/mm2; 20N/mm2 in solid and glulam in the species are structurally significant.The study has therefore demonstrated that the timber species studied can be engineered to load bearing glued laminated structural elements using polyvinyl acetate glue without severe loss of strength below and above room temperature.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>The versatility of timber finds wide application in the construction industry spanning from simple framing in housing projects to large scale public facilities. However because sawnwood hasrestrictionsto spans and cross-sectional dimensions due to size of tree as well as strength reducing features which occur at growth, its value as a structural material for extensive structural applications is limited. Engineered wood products such as glue laminated timber (glulam) were thereforedeveloped to improve the use of natural timber beyond its natural limitations.</div> <p>Structural glued laminated timber is an engineered structuraltimber glued up from suitably selected and prepared pieces ofstress graded lumber either in a straight or curved form with the grain of all pieces essentially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the member (APA, 1996; Manja <em>et al.,</em> 2010). According to the American plywood association (APA, 2013), glulam has remained the most resource-efficient approach to wood building products when it comes to optimizing products from a carefully managed timber resource. Glued laminated wood can be built out of defective wood without losing its strength properties as reported by Regina<em>et al.,</em>(2010). The application of glue laminated timber as a construction material would therefore make many species of timber previously regarded as non-merchantable useful for structural purpose. Clearly, this has the potential to revamp the forestry industry making it a massive employer of labor. Glulam can also be manufactured from small diameter fast growing tree, thereby bridging the supply deficit from slow growing trees(Evalina<em>et al.,</em>2010). According to the American institute of timber construction.</p>\n\nCOMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE STRENGTHS OF SOLID AND GLUED LAMINATED TIMBER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE STRENGTHS OF SOLID AND GLUED LAMINATED TIMBER", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></div> <div>Title Page</div> <div>Abstract</div> <div>Table of Contents</div> <div>List of Symbols and Abbreviations</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div>1.0       INTRODUCTION</div> <div>1.1       Background of the Study</div> <div>1.2       Statement of the Research Problem</div> <div>1.3       Justification for the Study</div> <div>1.4       Aim and Objectives</div> <div>1.5       Scope and Limitation</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></div> <div>2.0       LITERATURE REVIEW</div> <div>2.1       History of Earth Materials and Traditional Clay Buildings</div> <div>2.2       Traditional Methods of Earth Construction</div> <div>2.2.1    Adobe Blocks</div> <div>2.2.2    Cob</div> <div>2.3       Modern Methods of Earth Construction</div> <div>2.3.1    Compressed Earth Block</div> <div>2.3.2    Stabilised Soil</div> <div>2.4       Stabilisation Techniques</div> <div>2.4.1    Mechanical Stabilisation</div> <div>2.4.2    Cement Stabilisation</div> <div>2.4.3    Lime Stabilisation</div> <div>2.4.4    Bitumen Stabilisation</div> <div>2.4.5    Gypsum Stabilisation</div> <div>2.4.6    Pozzolanas Stabilisation</div> <div>2.4.7    Other Stabilisers</div> <div>2.5       Hydraform Blocks</div> <div>2.5.1    Suitable Soil for Soil Cement Block</div> <div>2.5.2    Tests for Soils</div> <div>2.6       Compressive Strength of Hydraform Blocks</div> <div>2.7       Moisture Movement</div> <div>2.8       Chemical Analysis of SCB</div> <div>2.9       Durability of Hydraform Blocks</div> <div>2.10     Deterioration Mechanisms in SCB</div> <div>2.10.1  Water Related Deterioration in SCBs</div> <div>2.10.2  Temperature-Related Deterioration in SCBs</div> <div>2.10.3  Chemical-Related Deterioration</div> <div><strong>CHAPTE THREE</strong></div> <div>3.0       EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE</div> <div>3.1       Materials</div> <div>3.1.1    Properties of Soil</div> <div>3.1.2    Shrinkage Test</div> <div>3.1.3    Aggregate Grading (Sieve Analysis Test)</div> <div>3.2       Properties of Hydraform Blocks</div> <div>3.2.1    Water Absorption</div> <div>3.2.2    Wet Compressive Strength Test</div> <div>3.2.3    Dry Compressive Strength Test</div> <div>3.3       Chemical Analysis of Cement, Laterite and NPK Fertilizer</div> <div>3.4       Hydraform Experimental Procedure</div> <div>3.4.1    Preparation of NPK Fertilizer Solution</div> <div>3.4.2    Compressive Strength Test after Exposure to NPK Solution</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></div> <div>4.0       DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONS</div> <div>4.1       Data Presentation and Analysis</div> <div>4.2       Properties of Soil</div> <div>4.2.1    Shrinkage Test</div> <div>4.2.2    Result of Aggregate Grading (Sieve Analysis Test)</div> <div>4.3       Properties of Hydraform Blocks</div> <div>4.3.1    Moisture Absorption Test</div> <div>4.3.2    Dry Compressive Strength</div> <div>4.3.3    Wet Compressive Strength</div> <div>4.4       Chemical Analysis</div> <div>4.4.1    Chemical Composition Analysis of Dangote Ordinary Portland Cement</div> <div>4.4.2    Chemical Composition Analysis of Laterite</div> <div>4.4.3    Chemical Composition Analysis of NPK</div> <div>4.5       Compressive Strength Test Results</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></div> <div>5.0       SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</div> <div>5.1       Summary of Findings</div> <div>5.2       Conclusions</div> <div>5.3       Recommendations</div> <div>REFERENCES</div> <div>APPENDICIES</div> </div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The large number of farmers, especially the rural farmers, make use of NPK fertilizer for farming. These farmers lack adequate storage facilities for storing farm products. This study is aimed at determining the compressive strength of soil cement blocks (SCB) in contact with NPK fertilizer with a view to study the chemical reaction and ascertaining the suitability of the SCB in the construction of ware houses for the storage of NPK. The SCBs were obtained from a Hydraform block firm constructing an estate in Kuje, LGA Abuja. A total of 150 samples of the SCB, the soil used to produce the SCB, obtained from the site in Kuje LGA. The properties of the soil that determines the cement content and properties of the blocks were investigated in accordance with BS EN 771-1:2011 and BS EN 772-1:2011 respectively. The shrinkage has a value of 5.8% and sieve analysis (clay and silt 0.95%) indicates that the cement content can be increased to improve</div> <div>the  strength  of  the  SCB.  The  wet  compressive  strength  (1.8N/mm2)  was  78%  of  the  dry</div> <div>compressive strength (2.3N/mm2) and less than 80% as recommended by BS EN 772-1:2011. Chemical analysis of the cement, soil and NPK were carried out, a saturated solution of NPK was determined to produce different concentrations. The solutions were prepared and three blocks selected at random were immersed for 7days, 14days, 21days, 28days, 56days and 90days respectively to ensure adequate exposure to the NPK solution. The compressive strength tests shows that the behaviour of the control differs from those in the solution. It was observed that the control experienced leaching of calcium hydroxide from the cement paste with low compressive</div> <div>strength of 1.64N/mm2. Whereas, the compressive strength of the SCBs in NPK solution was</div> <div>higher at 7days (1.7N/mm2, 1.74 N/mm2, 2.12N/mm2, 2.13N/mm2, 2.11N/mm2). After 56 days and 90 days, a white layer was observed to form within the SCB exposed to high concentrations of NPK. This was related to the likely ions exchange reaction with calcium hydroxide. The SCB were found to be suitable for use in the construction of ware houses to store NPK fertilizer as long as the selection of the soil and block production was based on standard code and the structure is kept dry from moisture.</div> <p><br/><br/></p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF THE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF SOIL CEMENT BLOCK EXPOSED TO NPK FERTILIZER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF SOIL CEMENT BLOCK EXPOSED TO NPK FERTILIZER", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Clay soils have been used locally in Sokoto to make bricks without stabilizing the soil.

This research aims to assess the effect of lime-stabilization on strength of bricks made with Sokoto Red Clay Soils with a view to determining the physical properties of the soil and the optimum level of lime-stabilization required in the case of Sokoto Red Clay Soil (RCS). RCS used in this research were stabilized by lime and the method adopted for the stabilization is additive method. The method involves addition of certain percentages of stabilizer(s) to soil to improve the strength properties and durability of the soil. This study carries out laboratories work on the physical tests of the soil sample and the compressive strength test on the bricks produced. The Optimum Moisture Content of the soil and stabilized soil were determined to be 14.6% and 16.8% respectively. Percentages of lime-stabilization used in this research are 0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, 15%, 18% and 21%. A total of 120 bricks were produced and tested for compressive strength after stipulated curing period. The curing method adopted is moist curing method for 3, 7, 14, 21and 28days. The results of compressive strength at 0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, 15%, 18% and 21% in 28days are; 0.5N/mm2, 1.35N/mm2, 1.24N/mm2, 0.85N/mm2, 0.82N/mm2, 0.63N/mm2, 0.47N/mm2 and 0.37N/mm2. A continuous increase in compressive strength of the bricks from 3days to 28days in both 3% and 6% stabilizations were further observed. At 3% and 6% stabilization, the highest average compressive strengths recorded in 28days are 1.35N/mm2 and 1.24N/mm2 respectively.. However, the highest value is not up to 2.8N/mm2 as stipulated in BS 5628 part 1 (1978). This might be as a result of the low value of plasticity index (10.4) and the stabilizer used. It was also found that the highest compressive strength of the bricks at 0% stabilization was 1.11N/mm2 in 21days and the compressive strength reduced to 0.50N/mm2 at 28days. The reduction in compressive strength derived at 0% stabilization in 28days might be as a result of cracks showed on the surface of the bricks which may be attributed to lack of stabilization. Compared to 3% stabilization, compressive strength of 1.11N/mm2 was recorded in 3days due to the effect of lime on the bricks. The highest value recorded at 3% stabilization indicates that lime alone cannot be used to stabilize red clay soil for brick production. This shows that lime should be used together with one or two stabilizers to stabilize red clay soil so as to improve the strength properties of the bricks. It is also recommended that red clay soil with higher plasticity index should be adopted for lime-stabilization.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1</strong>                                                         <strong>Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>Different types of stabilizers have been used in different parts of the world to enhance the engineering properties of laterite (Moh, 1962). The most common ones are cement, lime and bitumen and the choice of a particular stabilizer depends on the soil type and degree of effectiveness of the stabilizers (Rahaman, 1968). Mustapha (2006) defined soil stabilization as the treatment of soils to enable their strength and durability to be improved such that they become totally suitable for construction beyond their classification if left untreated. Stabilization as viewed by Afjman (1994) is the process of blending and mixing materials with a soil to improve certain properties of the soil. Afjman (1994) further explained that stabilization process may include the blending of soils to achieve a desired gradation or the mixing of commercially available additives that may alter the gradation, texture or plasticity or act as a binder for cementation of the soil. Stabilization can be used to function as mechanical stabilization, additive stabilization or modification.</div> <div>Mechanical stabilization is accomplished by mixing or blending soils of two or more gradations to obtain a material meeting the required specification. The soil blending may take place at the construction site, a central plant or a borrow area. Additive stabilization is achieved by the addition of proper percentages of cement, lime, fly-ash, bitumen or combination of these materials to the soil. The selection of the type and determination of the percentage of additive to be used is dependent upon the soil classification and the degree of improvement in the soil quality desired.</div>\n\nEFFECT OF LIME-STABILIZATION ON STRENGTH CHARACTERISTICS OF BRICKS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF LIME-STABILIZATION ON STRENGTH CHARACTERISTICS OF BRICKS", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong></div> <p><em>The major purpose of this study was to determine the needs for environmental friendly materials for building construction.

In line with the desire for environmental friendly materials, some government have change their legislation setting targets for the sustainability of public and residential buildings.  On the other hand, statistics show that an important factor for the well-being of the inhabitants is the choice of building materials, “unhealthy” materials cannot only cause environmental problems but can equally cause asthma and cancer and therefore it is extremely important to choose low emitting building materials. We spend most of our times indoors and building materials influence the “health” and safety of the indoor environment.</div> <div>        The building industry in Anambra state is rapidly changing-new building materials are all the time emerging on the market and new construction techniques are being developed and more and more challenging designs are being developed to be built it in the expectation that the next building generation will be of low energy and sustainable building materials. The first step towards environmental friendly construction is the appropriate choice of building materials.

external material in building production simply means using timber on the external part of the building such as timber work covering, timber external walls, and timber external windows, doors and frames.</p> <p>Timber use practices in building production industry is endowed with a variety of tree species in her nature forests and in recent years there has been an increase in the establishment of exotic trees species such as pine and eucalyptus on plantations. Despite the abundance of wood resources, wood has been under utilized with a view that it is material to be avoided due to its perceived unreliability, variability and unknown properties. </p> <p>Generally, timber research has been academic and has concentrated on a few tree species, resources have not explored the key indicators of wood strength such as bending stiffness and bending strength, they have concentrated on density which has been reported as poor surrogate strength. This is purely the reason timber users cannot accept lesser-known timber. Limited studies have been done to predict the allowance load from bad deflection relationship. This is probably the reason timber users prefer timber with proven truck record, a practice which unfortunately exerts pressure on well-known timber species leading to their building environment coupled with population growth and dwindling wood resources globally necessitates research into optional use of multiple trees species with quality control procedures.</p> <p>The aim of the study was to examine timber use practices with emphasis on analyzing weakness and strength in the application of wood as an external material in building.</p> <p>Timber is a cellular material consisting of minute cell called fibre or trenched which have inter-communicating pits or values that allow water and solutions to be conducted through out the structure.</p> <p>The word timber described wood, which has been cut for use in building. Timber has many advantages as a building material. It is high weight material that is easy to cut, shape and join by relatively cheap and simple hand or power operated tools in the production of timber. Timber is used all parts of building such as farm work, doors and windows, frames, timber, wall plates, floors and also in roof carcass. Timber is a very important material in building production which helps to facilitate building construction. As a structural material it has favourable weight to lost of elasticity relations and coefficients of thermal expansion, values density and specific heat with sensible selection, fabrication and fixing and adequate impregnation or protection. It is a reasonable durable material in relation to the life of most building, wood burn at temperature of about 3500 and chairs, the chaired outer face of the wood protecting the unborn inner wood for period adequate for escape during fire in most building.</p> <p>Timber is the greatest renewable resources in the building material field. As a building material, it has inherent characteristics which determine its application in construction with a recent better understanding of timber coupled with availability of sound structural design of timber structures and development of economical processing and presentation process, greater or more efficient use in building made of timber in construction.</p> <p>Generally, timber offers numerous advantages in construction application like beauty, workability, low cost per kg, high strength to weight ration, good electricity installation and low temperatures.</p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Timber research explored the use of timber in building construction industry as one of the most important material in construction. Timber has been used in building in most parts of the world for thousands of years it is natural, renewable and easy to use material. Timber is only building material that properly used positively benefits the plants and our relationship to it. Wood as a building material has the further advantages of being low in the consumption of energy needed in its processing, and hence in its overall impact on the biosphere. The conversion of a tree into klin 5.3 mega joules a kilo, but 35mj/kg are needed to produce a kilo of steel and a staging 145 for aluminum. Timber is the only building material that has empathy i.e. quantities. We identify with wood from the cradle to the coffin it is the only really sustainably building material. It is the one which properly manage and abundantly used, can</p> <p>actually improve the quality of life in the planet because of the ability to look up carbon.</p> <p>Timber is one of the natural building materials. This has a lot of advantages; generally, timber is not toxic, does not leak, chemical vapour into the building and is safe to handle and touch. It also means that as timber ages it does so naturally and doesn’t breakdown into environmentally damaging materials.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>With my observation and research in building material, I observed that timber as a building material is at low cost. This is to say that timber is the cheaper material in building production, due to high cost of certain materials like aggregates, sand, cement and roofing sheets.</p> <p>Cost comparisons are difficult to make between timber frame and other construction materials. Actual constructions costs are probably a few percentage points higher for a typical timber frame over brick and block, architects and builders less experienced in timber frame construction tend to increase their prices to compensate for the extra time needed to ensure that the design is correct. This project is a comprehensive study of timber to ascertain the suitability of timber and usefulness as a building material.</p> <p>Generally, despite the numerous contributions of timber to the construction companies, there is still lot of problems associated with the use of timber in construction. Some of these problems are lack of knowledge in timber treatment methods, non-availability of standard timber connector. Cost effectiveness in the usage of timber, non conformity of timber available in market and many other problems associated with the use of timber as an external material in building production in hot climate.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong></p> <p>The main aim of this study is to assess the problems and prospects of timber as an external material in building production in hot climate.</p> <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p> <p>The following are the objectives of the study:</p> <p>1.  To determine the various problems and prospects of timber in building the external parts of the building.</p> <p>2.  To determine the functions of timber in building production.</p> <p>3.  To evaluate the quality of wood used by the contractors as external material building production.</p> <p>4.  To determine the factors militating against effective use of timber as external material in building production.</p> <p>5.  To suggest the best ways of minimizing the problems associated with the use of timber in building production.    </p> <p>6.  To regain the need and value of timber as a building material.</p> <p>7.  To achieve the natural quantity of timber as a building material i.e. aesthetics. </p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work will benefit so many people, the people who will benefit from this work are:</p> <p>To serve as source of information to building clients, building, designers, students and several others.</p> <p>The contractors will benefits immensely from this from this work, as the work will expose them to the problems and prospects of timber as an external material in building production in hot climate.</p> <p>The study would be significant to students who might wish to use it as a basis for further research; it will serve as a board from which further research might take off.

There are also the remote causes of lack maintenance such as force majeur, cultural problems, state of the economy, the receding global economic meltdown, lack of time and general illiteracy of the occupants of the building or structure and users of the facilities.</p> <p>However there has also been growth in the significance of building maintenance as a proportion of the output of the construction industry which takes place against a backdrop of mounting pressure on new build activity and a growing awareness of the need to manage the condition of the nation’s building and infrastructure more effectively (chanter 2007).</p> <p>Though, it is still the case that such maintenance activity takes place in a context that does not create a fully integrated approach to managing building performance and thus the full potential of many buildings and infrastructures are never wholly realized.</p> <p>Basically in virtually all the towns and city centers within the Nigerian, buildings and infrastructural facilities are gradually and systematically decaying, dilapidating and deteriorating with reduced or no degree of maintenance programme and activity.</p> <p>From a normal visual perception in the urban metropolis, it can be noted that majority of the</p> <p>(a)                constructed buildings both private and public</p> <p>(b)               road network</p> <p>(c)                water supply systems</p> <p>(d)               sanitary and drainage systems</p> <p>(e)                transmission poles and electricity lines</p> <p>(f)                government owned telephone networks</p> <p>(g)               telegraph and postal systems</p> <p>(h)               sign post and route l0ocation posts</p> <p>are deteriorated and badly in need of maintenance. The lack of maintenance of these buildings and infrastructures negatively affects the populace which thus affects the output of the working class, capacity of the populace is thus lost, time value for achievement of goals and objectives minimized , it also causes all forms</p> <p>2</p> <p><br/></p> <p>of ill-health and psychological effects thereby reducing the economic growth of the nation.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>          <strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>All three spheres of government, together with the state owned enterprise (SOEs), manage major portfolios of immovable infrastructural assets. While there is much emphasis on delivery of infrastructure, delivery does not in fact end with the commissioning of the infrastructural asset. Once the infrastructure has been commissioned, various activities must be carried out which are necessary to ensure that it continues to perform- such as the allocation of necessary budgets and the retention of appropriate staff to maintain the operation of the assets.</p> <p>“Delivery” needs to be universally understood as embracing not just constructing the infrastructure, but the appropriate operation and maintenance thereafter for the whole design life of the asset.</p> <p>There are so many problems associated with the maintenance of buildings and infrastructural facilities on the economy. One of the serious problems if finance; government financing as regards to maintenance of buildings (both public and private) is minimal. The grant towards maintenance of infrastructural facilities is on its lowest ebb. Most buildings and infrastructures have been neglected by subsequent tenures of government while the private sectors; the individual property owners have little or nothing to contribute towards effective maintenance of their buildings, so long as the buildings affords the owner annual income he could not care less for the maintenance and so long the interior of the building is</p> <p>3</p> <p><br/></p> <p>conducive for the occupants they could not care for outward appearance or other necessary maintenance activity. Another problem to effective maintenance of the built environment in Nigeria is corruption. Certain governments which have the welfare of the populace at heart will foster a well finance programme to cater for the maintenance of certain facilities such as road networks bore hole systems, bridge construction, elevation of the power grid for alleviation of suffering and eventual welfare of the populace but certain corrupted officials will channel these funds for personal aggrandizement. Another serious impediment to maintenance in Nigeria is the state of the economy, according to the united research on profitability index as regards to income per capita of nations of the world; Nigeria is rated as fifth poorest country (UN 2010), which implies that the average Nigerian lives below one dollar per day. As a result of this economic hardship residents and citizens has little or nothing to contribute in terms of effective maintenance of their abode thus leading to neglected effects visualized in our cities and metropolis.</p> <p>Also certain buildings in Nigerian cities were constructed during the pre-colonial era therefore most of these buildings are aged due to wear and tear, weathering and climatic factors over the years thus resulting in dilapidated nature which might not respond positively to modern day maintenance day techniques, the reason for this assertion being 51% repair – replacement strategy, such buildings, the cost of their repairs might equal over 50% cost of new construction.</p> <p>Buildings and infrastructural decay also stems from poor workmanship and poor supervision (Amobi 2003), most of these defects arises from the fact that the skill</p> <p>4</p> <p><br/></p> <p>employed during the production of these buildings are defective, the supervisory most at times is minimal or left in the hands of unskilled foremen thus creating a chasm which will be filled by unprofessional ethics thus resulting in failure in the life of the structure which will eventually be translated to the overall life span of the building/structure.</p> <p>This study aims to identify the shortcomings which militate against the effective maintenance of buildings and infrastructures. Therefore there is need for effective maintenance of all these buildings and infrastructures and also identify the external factors militating against effective maintenance of building and infrastructural facilities to perform its functional requirement.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>         <strong>Aim and Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research work is to discover how maintenance of buildings and infrastructures can be effected, effectively to help increase the workers output thus increasing labour efficiency and increasing the income of the nation leading to increased income per capita of the populace.</p> <p>The objectives of this research work are as follows:</p> <p>(a)                Have a proper look at the level of maintenance attention that buildings and infrastructures within Nigeria receive.</p> <p>(b)               Now the current building and infrastructural maintenance practice with a view to improve on them.</p> <p>5</p> <p><br/></p> <p>(c)                To pin-point the various difficulties and problems that hamper the efficient execution of an effective maintenance management on buildings and infrastructure in Nigeria.</p> <p>(d)               To examine the causes that lead to the deterioration and dilapidations of buildings and infrastructures.</p> <p>(e)                To proffer solutions to the menace of lack of maintenance of buildings and infrastructures within Nigeria.</p> <p>In emphasis, this project will show the need for proper maintenance schemes for buildings and infrastructures, that will help reduce maintenance cost, minimize loss of use, improve safety conditions, improve aesthetic values and improve appearance of buildings thereby reduces the cases of collapse of structures and the inherent dangers to life and investment.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>Maintenance of buildings and the general infrastructures has not been given full recognition as an activity of primary importance in Nigeria. Maintenance activities on building and infrastructures in the country are mostly based on expediency, which over a period of time represents a series of ad hoc measures and unrelated compromise between the immediate physical needs and the availability of funds. Thus only about 15% of the total maintenance are remedied. If serious deterioration are not adequately taken care of future generations will be faced with a major capital burden.(Amobi 2003).</p> <p>6</p> <p><br/></p> <p>It is therefore imperative that maintenance activities should be increased/ intensified in order to ensure that the nation’s stock of buildings( factors of production and accommodation) which are considerable investments are used effectively as possible.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong>         <strong>Scope and delimitations</strong></p> <p>This project work covers the entirety of maintenance as regards to buildings and infrastructures with requisite effect it has on the Nigerian nation with reference to shell-camp housing estate, owerri, Imo state.</p> <p>From the conception, design, construction and post construction, the various problems being faced by property developers, owners, users as regards to maintenance of buildings and infrastructures.

The study embarked on physical inspection of some public buildings, identified defect in the buildings, determined the cause of the defect and proffered remedies for them. Data for the study were collected through well – structured questionnaire administered to building industry professionals. Data collected were analyzed using frequency distribution table and relative signification in dex. The findings revealed that in the level of dilapidation of services in the facilities, kerosene cooking system ranked first (68% significance) followed by flush toilet (66%) while the pair system ranked least with (50%) significance considering the severity of detects in facilities, peeling of walls surface ranked first (50.8% significance) while foundation failure and sagging of beams were ranked with (42.8%) the cause of defects in the facilities were investigated and the use of untested or inferior materials (56.8%) was the most devasting factor. Availability of qualified and competent construction industry professional was generally believed to be the significant factor that would impact on the drive to achieve quality maintenance operation in Nigeria.       </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0    INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Various attempts have been made to give a comprehensive definition of maintenance and to explain vividly what it entails, BS3811 (1964), defined maintenance as the combination of any action carried out to retain an item in or restore it to an acceptable condition.</p> <p>          The standard and level of maintenance of building in any country like Nigeria is invariably directly related to the strength of its economy. As country becomes more developed, they are disposed to require higher standards for buildings.</p> <p>          One of the basic needs of man in life, is Sheller, which is required for virtually all human activities shelter is provided in form of building which are usually designed and erected for a specific use or purpose, such as residential, educational, hospital, etc in order for building to continue to serve their purposes, they should be made to remain in the state for which they were constructed and this can only be achieved through adequate maintenance which in most cases is not carried out leading to various defects which may ultimately prevent these buildings from continuously serving the purpose for which they were built.</p> <p>Maintenance is required throughout the life span of the building so that the various elements are kept to standard consistent with the overall policy. Feedback from user to designer is important to indicate success or failure of specified components.</p> <p>A list of the prevalent maintenance problems in both residential and public buildings in Enugu urban used as a case study for this project includes: leakage roof, rot in roof timber, damages to internal plaster and decoration, possible damage to contents and effect on health of occupants, damages to ceiling board, flaking of wall paints, cracking of walls, broken tiles, wearing – off of floor finishes, broken , broker PVC pipes and damage to soak away pit.</p> <p>One of the main contributions to the deplorable state of our buildings is the attitude of our building owners. The problem with most Nigeria building owners is that they do not know what they want in their buildings when completed. This therefore compounds problem to designers during briefing and decision making. The owners may need a complex building without considering the convenience of construction. They may not even be ready to involve themselves with high cost buildings which they need. </p> <p>Question put out to owners of buildings as regards maintenance plans for their buildings could not be answered because there was no maintenance plans in place for their buildings.</p> <p>The need for maintenance is prevalent in Nigeria because of the complex nature of design of the building which are finally erected without considering the needs of maintenance at the design stage. Owners are usually concerned with the aesthetic nature of the design and the building appearance without considering the needs for maintenance of the ways of going about to effect repairs should defects occur. Some of the main cause of maintenance problems are; new material and construction techniques, poor workmanship, poor placement of materials, poor materials been used poor supervision of construction work, lack of quality control and monitoring.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>It is often said that building defects start on the drawing board. Design deficiencies could result in a building disaster if adequate attention is not given to the design of the bearings support, calculations, errors, deformation, shrinkage problems, errors in assumed loading (wind force), all these could contribute to building failure and disaster in Nigeria work and also make it easier to perform, since good maintenance begins on the drawing board, therefore some of the problems are as follows:-</p> <p>•       Inadequate architectural design</p> <p>•      Inadequate structural, electrical and mechanical design</p> <p>•      New material and construction techniques</p> <p>•      Lack of quality control and monitoring</p> <p>•      Poor workmanship, poor placement of materials and poor supervision of construction work.</p> <p>•      Use of defective materials</p> <p>•      Lack of routine or preventive maintenance department and lack of maintenance manual.  </p> <p>In Enugu urban used as a case study, the prevalent maintenance problems in both residential and public buildings include leaking roof, rot in roof timber, damages to internal plaster and decoration, possible damage to contains and effect on health of occupants, damages to ceiling board, flaking of wall paints, creaking of walls etc all these are the likely maintenance problems in Nigeria by extension.</p> <p><strong>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to investigate the common problems of building maintenance in Nigeria so that ways of over coming the problems may be adopted.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The main objectives of this study are. </p> <p>•        To spell out the need for and benefits of maintenance manual to buildings owners and the occupiers in the maintenance processes.</p> <p>•      For the government to put in place maintenance policy that will require government owned building to be maintained from time in Nigeria.</p> <p>•      To go for market survey in terms of making choices on the type of materials to be used and go for good quality material e.g. paint, timber, ceiling board tiles, pipes etc.</p> <p>•      To make provisions for good workmanship, to work according to the specification, to do the job as required in terms of construction techniques and also make sure the job is well supervised at the early stage.</p> <p>•      To provide a good design plan to avoid effects as time goes on and to make sure the structural, electrical and mechanical engineers carried out their jobs properly.</p> <p>•      The government should also provide a maintenance department especially for public buildings.</p> <p><strong>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong> </p> <p>The question this research intends to find answers to are:-</p> <p>•       Do the owners and occupiers of buildings know the benefit of building maintenance manual?</p> <p>•      Does the government have maintenance policy that will enable them own a building to be maintained in Nigeria?</p> <p>•      Do the owners and occupiers of building go for good quality material?</p> <p>•      Do the owners and occupiers of building make good use of available workmen and artisans, work according to specifications, construction techniques and supervision of the work at the early stages of construction?</p> <p>•      Do the architect; structural, electrical and mechanical engineers carry out their jobs properly at the early stage?</p> <p>•      Are the public building owners and occupiers aware of maintenance department?</p> <p><strong>1.5    SCOPE AND (DELIMITATION) OF THE STUDY </strong> </p> <p>          This research shall be limited to some selected public buildings in Old G.R.A Enugu State. Most of them are quite easily accessible and in terrible state of disrepair. This study focuses on types of maintenance, maintenance policy formation and methodology, concept of maintenance, maintenance manual maintenance management and execution of maintenance work.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY    </strong></p> <p>The significance of this research work is that:-</p> <p>•       It will benefit the researcher on the above topic based on the fact that the topic of discussion is from her discipline, because no knowledge is a waste and it will also be of benefit to the forth coming researcher (student) who may wish to carry out similar or related research work in the above study and as such it can serve as reference material to the researcher. It also be of benefit to government.</p> <p>•       The study will also benefit the building industry on how to manage and up date their information technology level so as to meet up with customer expectation in their daily transactions.</p> <p>•      The study will also be of profit to the society at large because maintenance is highly needed in our society especially in building industry.</p> <p>•      It will be of benefit to the management of building industry in terms of employing capable hands as staff in the organization.</p> <p>•      The study will be of benefit to the owners of the building even to the occupants as well.</p> <p><strong>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>•        <strong>MAINTENANCE: </strong>This is the combination of any action carried out to retain an item in or restore it to an acceptable condition.</p> <p>•      <strong> RETAINING AND RESTORE: </strong>Retaining process can be interpreted as the work carried out as a preventive nature in anticipation of failure of certain building elements or services. The restoring on the other hand can be related to those work carried out after failure of the elements or a service has occurred like. Paint, work, roof, wall, foundation etc.</p> <p>•      <strong>ACCEPTABLE CONDITION: </strong>There is no specific standard as the phrase “acceptable condition’ it is obvious that what is acceptable to “A” may not be acceptable to “B” in that sense the acceptable condition, varies from  person to person, one community to another, nation to nation and so on.</p> <p>•      <strong> BUILDING MAINTENANCE MANUAL: </strong>This is comprehensive guide, which will include appropriate from and log books for maintenance of a building prepared by a consortium of registered Architect, registered building and registered engineers. </p>                                                          \n\nCAUSES AND REMEDIES OF POOR MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC BUILDING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CAUSES AND REMEDIES OF POOR MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC BUILDING", "id": 26}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>According to business dictionary, an online dictionary, “the construction industry is that sector of the national economic engaged in preparation of land and construction, alternation and repair of building, structures and other real properties.</p> <p>The industry is engaged in many types of building and civil engineering jobs. These include jobs in carpentry, road construction, bridge development and home design. The industry occupies a very important position in the whole world because it is responsible for creating infrastructures for cities, towns, and countries. Oyefeko (1991) as cited in Building construction industry …(2014). National housing Policy (NHP 2006) as in Building construction industry (2014) also confirmed this assertion when it revealed that the industry  has an output of 11% Gross domestic product (GDP) and employs 3% of employment nationwide.</p> <p>Construction industry achieves its aims by combining land other factors of production including variety of raw materials and semi-processed components. This process of resource combination involves all usual elements and functions associated with production of commodity. Most times, because of some challenges facing this sector of business management, capital funds are required based on long-term source of finance to purchase materials coordinate and organize the factors of production. Detailed design of the product must be carried out and all these need to the financed. These therefore constitute challenges, Many indigenous building construction firms especially those ones who have inadequate financial base grapple with. Further aggravation to the problems of the indigenous firms is seen in the government award of contracts to foreign and big time contractors only and leaving no room for the participating of the indigenous contractors to national development. In support of this assertion, Enwegbara (2012) sees the Nigeria’s construction industry as remaining at a cross road because government policies all these years have favoured awarding construction contracts to foreign contractors instead of their national counterparts. The reason explained above makes it obviously difficult for the indigenous firms to be reasonably established in the industry. The situation thus spells doom for the national economy because if the indigenous building contractors are forced out of business dues to the challenges, their death from the industry becomes imminent.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The rate of influx of foreign construction firms in Nigeria and Government’s continued patronage of them, when critically analyzed does not communicate any good news to national economy. It has been argued by the public that the so called foreign constructors have little or no qualification for the jobs they are awarded. the uncertainty of their technical base does not guarantee safety of the facilities produced by them. On the contrary, some of our indigenous contractors are well known persons in the area services they render. However, the tendency of not patronizing indigenous construction firms subsequently keeps them perpetually in the lower rung of financial development. When critically studied they only but paint to the death of these indigenous contractors in the future.</p> <p>On the other hard, if the foreign contractors eventually go back to their countries the situations leaves the indigenous ones not prepared to bear the burder of national development. The time is therefore ripe to proffer lasting solution to the challenges facing indigenous contractors who are the future developers of the national economy.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to critically analyze the various factors that affect the progress of the indigenous building construction firms so that solutions to aid their growth may be adopted.</p> <p>The specific objective of this research work is as follows:</p> <p>1.  To study the effects of government policies and procedures on indigenous.</p> <p>2.  To x-ray the effects of poor financial structure on the indigenous building construction firm.</p> <p>3.  To suggest was of solving the problem facing the indigenous construction firm.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The following questions are generated for the study</p> <p>1.  What are the effects of government policies and procedures on indigenous building construction firms?</p> <p>2.  Will building up a strong financial base aid the growth of indigenous building constriction firms?</p> <p>3.  What are the factors and challenges militating against the growth of the indigenous building construction firms in Nigeria?                                                                                                    </p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is delimited to the indigenous construction firms in Enugu urban only. The study will focus on the structure of the indigenous construction firms, the effect of government policies and other socio-economy factors that affect the indigenous firms like scarcity and high cost of materials, scarcity of quality labour, state of plants and equipments, the problems of personnel development in the industry, poor management of resources and method of contractual procedures.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the importance or the usefulness of this study:</p> <p>1.  Researches’ data the study students studying  any of the converses in constructor a clear cut dea of what challenges existing practetiance are already facing and be prequiped to face them when it and when they accede to establish their aim firms.</p> <p>2.  This research work will also be helpful to individuals who will want to develop and own their own construction firms in the country to know the challenges facing the already existing ones in the country and to know how to tackle these challenges.</p> <p>3.  The result of the findings will help building clients the government, builders, professional bodies and building team of specialist to jointly improve working conditions to building professional members in organizing seminars, workshop and conferences.</p> <p>4.  The upcoming researchers will also find this research work very useful because it will serve as a reference material while carrying out a research on similar or a related research topic.</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the limitation of this research work.</p> <p>1.   <strong>Time</strong>: Time is one of major constraints to the success of this research work. Because of other activities the researcher is involved in, the study is carried out under a limited time.</p> <p>2.  <strong>Finance</strong>: Insufficient finance militated against the success of this research work. Much literature were not reviewed and also few library were visited due to insufficient fund.</p> <p>3.  <strong>Respondents: </strong>Indeed some of the attitude of the respondents are discouraging in the sense that some are out rightly snobbish.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Construction industry</strong>: This is the sector of national economy engaged in preparation of land, repair of building structures and other real properties.</p> <p><strong>Building Construction</strong>: Is a process of adding structure to a real property or construction of buildings.</p> <p><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong>: Is the market value of all officially recognized final goods and services produced within a country in a year, or period of time.

and motivation of human element in construction industry, a case study of construction industries in Abuja, Nigeria. The research objective and question were formulated to guide this work, descriptive research design was adopted and the five construction industries in Abuja were randomly selected for this research work and appropriate question were distributed to 100 engineers in the construction industries. According to the results it shows that there are importance of motivation and incentives of human elements in construction industry and also there are factors that influence and challenges the motivation and incentive of human elements in construction industries in Nigeria Thus it was recommended that increase in salary; promotion, overtime and holiday with pay should be used as motivators for increase in performance of construction workers and Promotion should be done regularly and should be based on performance of workers.</p> <p><strong>Table of content</strong></p> <p><strong>Chapter one</strong></p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>1.1 Background of the study</p> <p>1.2 Statement of the problem</p> <p>1.3 Objective of the study</p> <p>1.4 Research question</p> <p>1.5 Scope of the study</p> <p>1.6 Limitation </p> <p>1.7 Definition of terms</p> <p><strong>Chapter Two</strong></p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>2.1 Conceptual framework</p> <p>2.2 Theoretical Framework  </p> <p>2.3 Empirical Review</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>Research Methodology</p> <p>3.1 Research Design</p> <p>3.2 Area of the Study </p> <p>3.3 Population of the Study</p> <p>3.4 Sample and sampling techniques</p> <p>3.6 Instrument for data collection</p> <p>3.7 Validation of Instrument</p> <p>3.8 Reliability of Instrument</p> <p>3.9 Method of Data Collection</p> <p>3.10 Method of data analysis</p> <p><strong>Chapter Four</strong></p> <p>Data presentation, Analysis and Interpretation</p> <p><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p> <p>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation</p> <p>5.1 Summary</p> <p>5.2 Conclusion and Recommendation</p> <p><strong>Reference </strong></p> <p><strong>Questionnaire</strong></p> <p><strong>Chapter one</strong></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong> <strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Construction sector is diverse as it contains contractors, element, designers, owners, and others. Construction projects suffer various problems. There are undue cost overruns, delays and loss of productivity associated with construction projects everywhere. In today’s era, one of the biggest concerns for any organization is to increase their productivity, representing the powerful and efficient conversion of resources into marketable products and determining business profitability. With the business environment becoming highly competitive, it is essential that organizations improve construction productivity performance for survival because construction is a man power oriented industry and human resource is the flexible resource available for the management, focus of the majority of the researchers and practitioners has been on improving construction human resource productivity. Improving productivity of the construction workforce is crucial to the success of any construction firm as human resource costs comprise a considerable share of the overall project cost. Losses in construction human resource productivity have often been attributed to poor management of construction projects and construction professionals. Construction man power productivity is influenced by a multitude of factors. Though considerable research exists on productivity factors little effort has been carried out to find the relation between man power productivity and motivation of the humans. The Construction industry all across the world is an important indicator of the development as it creates investment opportunities across various related sectors.  </p> <p>The sector is labor-intensive and, including indirect jobs, provides employment to more than 35 million people. India is on the verge of witnessing a sustained growth in infrastructure build up. The construction industry has been witness to a strong growth wave powered by large spends on housing, road, ports, water supply, rail transport and airport development. Construction industry forms an integral part of the economy and a conduit for a substantial part of its development investment, is poised for growth on account of industrialization, urbanization, economic development and people's rising expectations for improved quality of living. Construction constitutes 30% to 50% of India's capital expenditure on projects in various sectors such as highways, roads, energy, airports, railway, irrigation, etc and is the second largest industry in India after the agriculture. Since in India 80% of the project has cost and time overrun which in turns affects the quality of the project not because of poor material but because of poor management which leads to human labor. As Construction industry in labor intensive but no research has been done the in the past on the human elements which effects the quality of the project.</p>

APPROACH TO OVERCOMING EXCESSIVE COST ON BUILDING SITES", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Today‘s construction projects become more complex in nature. The complex,relational and lengthy process of designing and building makes construction a process in which disputes are virtually ensured. Furthermore, the involvement of multidisciplinary in the construction project also leads toconflicts among the parties. It seems that conflict and disputes are inevitable to the construction industry especially when most of construction projects are facing with so many uncertainties.</p> <p>A study by Kumara swamy&amp;Yogeswaran provided a good reference of the common sources of construction disputes that are largely related to contractual matters, including variation, extension of time, payment, quality of technical specification, availability of information, administration and management, unrealistic client expectations and determination. In other research by (Kathleen, 2003a) highlighted conflicts may develop as a result of limited resources such as not enough time, money, labour, materials and/or equipment. Smithdescribes conflict and disputes as an endemic problem in the construction industry. Conflict may difficulties communications between individuals, breaks personal and professional relationships and reduces effectiveness.</p> <p>Conflict produces tension and distracts team members from performing the task. According to Cheung &amp;Suen, if dispute are not properly managed, they may cause project delays, undetermined team spirit, increase project costs and above all, damage continuing business relationships. Thus it is not surprising that many construction stakeholders still overwhelmingly view conflict as negative and something to be avoided or resolved as soon as possible. However, there are many authors have pointed out conflict is a phenomenon that may give rise not only to functional but also dysfunctional effects on individuals, groups and organizations. As today‘s claims and disputes keep increasing, the construction industry struggles to find ways to equitably and economically to resolve them. According to Shin, managing disputes should become a part of normal project management during project operation because disputes in construction projects are common place and the resolution need to occur immediately on the project site.</p> <p>Brown et alhighlighted that conflict is doubt or questioning, opposition, incompatible behavior, controversy or antagonistic interaction and disputes is one of the range of events considered as conflict. According to Kumaraswamy&amp;Yogeswaran, a dispute can be said to exist when a claim or assertion made is made by one party is rejected by the other party and that rejection is not accepted.‖ This shows that disputes is more likely occur when the conflicting parties shows an action or arguments to a controversy. Referring to Vorster, a dispute is defined as an argument about an issue concerning project operations, usually resulting from a debate over differences in two or more parties‘ understanding of situation.This statement is supported by another statement by Deutsch that defines conflict as incompatible activities; conflict occurs when the behavior of one person is interfering or obstructing the actions of another. There are perhaps as many definitions of conflict as there are occasions for its occurrence. According to Thomas there are three themes among the definitions of conflict. The first is that whether conflict exists or not is a perception issue. The perceived difference may not be real but conversely if the difference is real but not perceived there is no conflict. The second common theme is that there is interdependence among parties (i.e. each has the potential to interfere with the other). Third, there are issues of blockage, opposition, and scarcity. Resources, for example, money, power and prestige, arelimited. Their scarcity creates blocking behavior. When one party blocks the means to a goal or interest of another, a state of conflict exists. These numerous definitions show that scholars are looking at conflict from different angles but are there a difference between conflict and dispute and if so, should we concern ourselves with the difference? Some authors do not differentiate as Moore manages to mix the two terms in the first paragraph of his Chapter 1. However, most of previous research defines conflict and disputes shares the same definition that is generally involves disagreement regarding interests or ideas and that was adopted for this research. The important issue is both of the terms has historically been viewed as undesirable, something to be avoided.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the problem</strong><br/> No matter how strategic you are in attempting to resolve a difference of opinion with another person, as long as it is framed as a conflict and viewed by at least one of you in terms of one person being “right” and the other as “wrong” no real progress is made in the relationship. A battle will be won, but a war will rage on. The presence of right/wrong dynamics in a relationship indicates a power struggle and not the process of co-creation by two equally respected partners. Whether deciding what to have for dinner, when and how to express shared intimacy or any other decision that affects both partners, ultimately it is the decision making process rather than the decision itself that speaks volumes about the quality of consciousness being expressed in the relationship.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Significance of the study</strong><br/> Conflict occurs inevitably, but preparing to deal with it in a rational, positive manner can save you from further disruption. Conflict occurs when people have different opinions, lack respect for each other or simply misunderstand intentions. Resolving conflict involves communicating effectively and reaching a compromise. Ignoring dissension eventually takes its toll both mentally and physically. Positive conflict resolution in a team results in better long-term team dynamics.<br/> This paper significantly overview the conflict resolution in construction industry which is hoped to give clearer scenario to all project teams. Conflict would arise due to behavioral problems such as poor communication among project team, multicultural team problem and reluctant to check for constructability, clarity and completeness of project. Besides that, conflict also arises due to the factors of contractual problem which includes delay interim payment from client, client fails to respond in timely manner, application of extension of time and improper project schedules. Other than that, contractor’s quality of work, error of pricing or costing, late instructions from architect or engineer also considered as the factors of conflict which is due to technical problems. This paper was hoped to be a useful reference to the project team in managing conflicts for future construction projects.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Objectives of the study</strong><br/> 1.

It used analytic model and field studies on improper building maintenance to discuss the causes and remedial measures to be used. It was discovered that low level of awareness about building survey is the major problem of our building maintenance (i.e carrying-out maintenance programme without proper inspection or investigation to know the causes of the defects in building). The study tried to find out how building survey helps in maintenance of building in our society. It also identified the application and importance of sound building surveying for maintenance of buildings. In constructing this research project, the research had to review some literati on and subsequently embarked on data collection through observation, interview, and questionnaire. The objective of chapter one of the research projects is to introduce the topic which the need for the research is given and stated. The background of the study and other important aspects like the significant of the problem, the scope and limitation were given. The objective of chapter two is to present a piece of the extensive literature review carried out in order to reveal the expressed opinion of notable authors and scholar as regards to the relevance of the building survey. A case study of building survey on one storey residential building was included for reference purpose. Chapter three presents the research design and methodology.

The contribution of the construction industry to national economic growth necessitates improved efficiency in the industry by means of cost effectiveness and timeliness, and would certainly contribute to cost savings for the country as a whole. It is also common knowledge that the implementation of the construction project in the industry is usually accompanied with time delay and cost increase as well as owner dissatisfaction (Hafez, 2001).</p> <p>In general most (if not all), construction projects experience time delays and cost overruns during their implementation phase (Koushki and Kartam,2004). Numerous researchers, both in the developed and developing nations have also examined and identified the causes of time and cost overrun in the construction industry. Mansfield, Ugwu and Doran (1994), for example performed a comprehensive analysis of most important factors responsible for project delays and cost overrun in Nigerian construction projects. This analysis indicated poor contract management, financing and payment of completed works, change in site conditions, shortages of materials, design changes, subcontractors and nominated suppliers, other factors were price fluctuation inaccurate estimates, delays and additional works as factors responsible for project delays and cost overrun.</p> <p>A comprehensive classification of causes of construction delays has also been determined by Henesy (1993). The classification system included materials, labour, equipment and financial constraints, as the main contributory variable to causes of construction time overrun. The list of major factors causing construction delay in Thailand by Ogunlana and Proumkunting (1996) included the inadequacy of resources supplies, client and consultant shortcomings and incompetence. Koushki and Kartan (2004) studied the impact of construction materials on project time and cost in Kuwait and identified the project related variable affecting the on time delivery of materials as material selection, time, type of materials and their availability in the local market.<br/> Time impacts are inevitable on construction projects, primarily because of the uniqueness of each project and the limited resources of time and money that can be spent on planning, executing and delivering the project.<br/> Time factors are inherent in all of project construction’s undertakings. Construction projects have long been recognized as particularly cost, time and risk-laden. Some of the time and cost factors associated with the construction process are fairly predictable or identifiable; others may be totally unforeseen. The constructed project may not perform as anticipated because the owner may have unrealistic expectations regarding the delivery time of construction forcing contractors into unrealistic gambles, corner-cutting or commitments that may not be realistic (Frimpong 2003).<br/> Project success can be defined as meeting goals and objectives as prescribed in the project plan. A successful project means that the project has accomplished its technical performance, maintained its schedule, and remained within budgetary costs. Project management tools and techniques play an important role in the effective management of a project. Therefore, a good project management lies in the management tools and techniques used to manage the project. Project management involves managing the resources—workers, machines, money, materials and methods used. Some projects are effectively and efficiently managed while others are mismanaged, incurring much delay and cost overruns and negatively affecting the economy (Frimpong 2003).<br/> Assessing construction projects’ delivery time is critical in today’s market-driven economy.</p> <p><strong>1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong><br/> Construction can be considered as a dynamic industry which is constantly facing uncertainties. These uncertainties and the many stakeholders in these kinds of projects, make the management of costs difficult which consequently causes cost overruns. Therefore, cost overruns are considered one of the most critical issues during the execution of construction projects (Chan<em>, et al.</em>, 2004; Doloi, 2011).<br/> As mentioned by Van Der Westhuizen and Fitzgerald (2005), the presence of cost overruns can be a reason for project delays or possible project failures. However this idea has been refuted by many authors who considered that project success depends on many other factors that should be assessed to conclude the success or failure of a project (Chan<em>, et al.</em>, 2004). Moreover, there have been many studies that suggest that the success of a project depends on the presence of certain critical factors which can also change depending on the objective to be met (Iyer and Jha, 2005). In other words, some authors ascertained that there are some critical success factors that help to improve cost performance and prevent cost overruns.<br/><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/> The main aim of the study is to examine various cost control techniques used in construction projects and the impact they have on project delivery. Specific objectives of the study are:</p> <p>·         To identify cost control technique frequently used by contractors in construction projects.</p> <p>·         To examine problems encountered by contractors in managing construction project cost.</p> <p>·         To determine the impact of costcontrol techniques on the duration of construction projects.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/> In-order to guide the study and achieve the above stated research objectives; the following research questions were formulated:</p> <p>·         What cost control techniques are frequently used by contractors in construction projects?</p> <p>·         What are the problems faced by contractors in controlling cost in the construction project process?</p> <p>·         What impact does cost controlling techniques have on the duration of construction projects?</p> <p>·         <strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>·         <strong>Ho:</strong> Cost control problems lead to project delivery failures.</p> <p><strong>       Hi:</strong> Cost control problems do not lead to project delivery<br/> failures.</p> <p>·         <strong>Ho: </strong>Cost Control techniques lead to construction delivery failures</p> <p><strong>        Hi: </strong>Cost Control techniques do not lead to construction<br/> delivery failures</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/> This study will be of importance to building professionals and the general public because it would not only clarify but also create awareness of the extent to which inadequacies in cost control techniques can adversely affect project performance. The study will also help contractors, clients, consultants and all parties involved in construction projects about ways of improving their current method of cost management and control.<br/> The study will also be of great benefit for other student researchers’ who may want to venture into the same subject matter. Having gotten results-both empirically and theoretically, the study will serve as a foundation for future research studies.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/> The study will cover some selected quantity surveyors from Owerri. All findings and recommendations from the study may not reflect the true view of the traditional roles and changing roles of quantity surveyors as the researcher could not cover a wider area due to financial and time constraints.</p> <p><strong>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>·         <strong>Construction:</strong> In the fields of architecture and civil engineering, construction is a process that consists of the building or assembling of infrastructure. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking. Normally, the job is managed by a project manager and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect</p> <p>·         <strong>Deliverable</strong>: Deliverable is a term used in project management to describe a tangible or intangible object produced as a result of the project that is intended to be delivered to a customer (either internal or external). A deliverable could be a report, a document, a server upgrade or any other building block of an overall project.</p> <p>·         <strong>Project management:</strong> this is the discipline of planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. A project is a temporary endeavour with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or deliverables), undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value.</p> <p>·         <strong>Time: </strong>This is a dimension in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them.</p> <p>·         <strong>Cost</strong>: A cost is the value of money that has been used up to produce something, and hence is not available for use anymore. In business, the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost.</p> <p>·         <strong>Cost overrun</strong>: occurs when the final cost of the project exceeds the original contract value at the time of completion.</p> <p>·         <strong>Good cost performance project: </strong>Project in which the cost overrun of the project does not exceed 10 percent of the initial budget.</p> <p>·         <strong>Poor cost performance project: </strong>Project in which the cost overrun of the project exceeds 10 percent of the initial budget.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong><br/> Aibinu A.A and Jagboro G.O (2002): <em>“The Effects of Construction </em><br/><em>Delays on Projects Delivery in Nigeria Construction Industry”.</em> International Journal of Project Management, 20, 593-599.<br/> Chan, A.P.C., Scott, D. and Chan, A.P.L.

Microsoft project software (MS Project) is one of such software that is a program developed  and sold by Microsoft which is designed to assist a project  manager in developing a plan, assigning resources to task tracking work progress, managing the budget ,analyzing work load schedule, upgrade information and communication status in building  project construction. Although this software use in our country Nigeria is still little but for those firms project Team/manager who uses it have seen it important to the project (building project).  Microsoft project offers easy productivity in building project construction like WBS, outline tasks assign resources/cost, tracking and reporting, collaborating information with project managers if any. Every about scheduling and management of building project are in place in this software and it allows one to choose from different alternative view point (Garth chart, Bar chart, pert and network diagram etc) it also help users “project team” to reselect, remove, correct and upgrade current or future information if any. Most managers or users are ignorant of what ms project does, it will be difficult for them to know its functions and understand them. Due to the fact our country Nigeria lags behind in meeting up with the standard of the world globalization system technology.</p>                                                         \n\nTHE IMPLICATION AND BENEFIT OF THE USE OF SOFTWARES IN BUILDING PROJECT CONSTRUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPLICATION AND BENEFIT OF THE USE OF SOFTWARES IN BUILDING PROJECT CONSTRUCTION", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>The control of materials on construction sites is handled carelessly by planning and purchasing departments, site supervisors and engineers as well as contractor’s organization and this have been posing various problems to contractors in realizing reasonable profit margin. The research centered on the assessment of materials management on building projects in Ondo-State Nigeria. This study assessed the current practices of managing materials on building projects, the problems associated with materials management and measures for managing materials in building projects in Ondo state. The study was carried out through the administration of questionnaire to professionals in both consulting and contracting firms and data collected were analyzed using percentile and mean item score. The study reveals that purchasing of materials, material planning method and transportation of materials are the most common practices of materials Management. The most severe problem militating against materials management was lack of proper work planning and scheduling while other problems include inadequate cash flow to contractors due to delayed payments, burglary, theft and vandalism. The study recommends that management should improve their supervision on site, materials should be adequately handled when delivered, care should be given to materials handling process and more awareness should be given to the knowledge of materials management on building projects most especially on construction sites</p> <p>Keywords</p> <p>References</p> <p>·         [1] Adedayo, A.O., Ojo, O. &amp; Obamiro, J.

This paper therefore examines the incidents of building failure/collapse in Nigeria. By focusing on six major states from each of the six geo-political regions of the country, the paper examined the contributory role of the informal sector to this decadence. The study indicated that the building failure and collapse stem principally from hasty construction, low quality workmanship, poor supervision, inexperience (use of incompetent hands), ignorance, evasion/ non-compliance with building regulations and non enforcement of building quality, standard and control on construction site/market. This study has revealed that more than 70% of the reported cases of building collapse in Nigeria stemmed from the informal sector. It further showed that 70-0%, 23-3% and 6.7% of the reported cases occurred in private, public and corporate organizations respectively.

Cost deviation from initial Cost plan, had been prevalent on Construction sites. However, little or no efforts has made to curtail the phenomenon, it is against this background that this research work attempt to study the factors that are responsible, so as to identify them and proffer possible  ways of tackling the menace. The study attempt this through chosen  construction practitioners as population and samples were drawn  to this effect at random from the category of professionals, using probability sampling methods. The Data were collected from primary source consisting of structured questionnaire designed in Likert Scale in rating Scale of 1 to 5, while the Secondary Data were collected through review of Journal articles and relevant Text books. The Data were analysed using Severity Index, Ranking and Simple Percentages. It was discovered from the analysis that factors such as Contractors inexperience, inadequate planning, Inflation, incessant variation order, and change in project design were critical to causing cost overrun, while project complexity, shortening of project period and fraudulent practices are also responsible. The study concluded with recommending, adequate planning using conventional techniques, Studying and applying project history, material bulk purchase, proper project design and establishing proactive fraud prevention system on sites, as panacea for effective cost performance on sites.</p> <p><strong>KEY WORDS: </strong>Performance, Cost, Construction, Factors.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Construction industry in Nigeria had been a major source of employment for 70% of labour force in the country, thus it controls the capital flow, as well as labour resources, which has cost implications. Adequate management of these resources is considered an important aspect of   project works; it determines to a large extent   the overall success of project works. So also if the resources are adequately harnessed, issues that pertains to cost overrun would not arise which could result to variations and claims. Some firms rely on claim as a result of variation incurred during the course of the project execution and afterward evaluate their profit after incurring necessary and unnecessary cost on a project.                                                 This however has tendency of positioning such in a disadvantageous profit position. An effective cost management strategy is therefore necessary, this could be achieved  through putting in place a proactive cost management strategy. (Love et al, 2005; Ogunsemi and Jagboro, 2005; Ferry et al, 1998).</p> <p>They described cost management system as a process that should be carried out throughout the life cycle of a project, from the inception to final completion and final payment to the contractor. In the light of this, the timeliness and cost effectiveness of various operation and decision carried out will determine to an extent the magnitude of cost that could be saved on the project. ( Kerzner, 2005; Ogunsemi and Jagboro, 2005).</p> <p>However Dissanayaka and Kumaraswamy,(1999) opined that Time, Cost, Quality target as well  as project satisfaction tend to be most important key to measure the overall performance of a project work. Furthermore, various research works have also indicated that most project records cost or time overrun during their tenure of execution.( Odusami and Olusanya, 2000).  (Mbachu and Olaoye, 1989; Madewsley, et al, 2004); opined that 51percent of average delay were experienced yearly which culminates in cost overrun, certain factors are responsible for this, to this end however this study attempts at investigating such factors and proffer solution to the pandemic.  The scope of this research work shall be limited to building construction sites within the selected area in Nigeria, Ogun state, Lagos state and Northern part of Nigeria. This is attributable to unique project environment they possess. The aim and objectives of the research are as follows: The research work is to determine the various factors that interplay in impacting project cost performance, investigating the order of severity of the factors, and recommending ways of curtailing the effects. Field survey was carried out with 100 questionnaire distributed  and 67 were used for analysis of response from construction practitioners selected randomly from population of construction firms, The primary data were collected with the aid of structured questionnaire designed on Likert Scale of 1to 4 rating scale.  Mean item score, Simple percentages and severity index were used as analytical tool of the generated data. SPSS (Statistical Packages for Social Science Students) was used in determining pattern of relationship among the cost determinants and variables. The factors were ranked in order of their degree of severity. It was discovered from the findings that, these factors are the major ones that results in cost overrun on construction sites.</p> <p>(i).Inadequate planning (ii) Contractors project inexperience (iii) Inflation (iv) Incessant  variation order (v) Change in project design (vi) Project complexity (vii) shortening of contract period and (viii) Fraudulent practices.</p> <p>In order to prevent occurrence of cost overrun or a practice action towards prevention of such, the following are recommended.</p> <p>(i)inadequate planning:  breaking of project planning into short term achievable goals, medium term planning and Long term planning ( ii)Studying of project history for possible application on another similar projects  (iii) Bulk purchase of material  (iv)Proper design of the project during design stage so as to avoid.

In some cases safety is considered a part of total quality management (TQM). In the international construction scene, the inclusion of both the traditional qualities and safety efforts within a TQM system is advocated by Dias and Curado (1996). They suggest that the TQM emphasis on the customer will lead to protection of the employee who is a vital customer. They write that safety record keeping would be improved and a needed safety culture comparable to the existing quality culture would result.<br/> Quality management has increasingly been adopted by construction companies as an initiative to solve quality problems and to meet the need of final costumer ( kanji and wong, 1998). As suggested by (Oakland and Aldridge, 1995) if ever an industry needed to take up the concept of total quality management (TQM),it is the construction industry. Alfred (1988) advances the view that construction very probably promises a greater pay back for performance improvement than any other service industry because of its magnitude.<br/> Over the years, a lot of attention has focused on the causes of occupational incident (Haslam 2005). When accident occur in the work place, it is important to understand what human factors may have contributed to the out come in order to avoid similar incidents in the future. Through developing and understanding of why and how incident occur, appropriate method for incident prevention can be developed (Williamson and Feyer 2002). In the past, any attempt to improve work safety or to control work place risk has focused on technical aspects and on the direct influence of human behaviour (Gadd and Collins 2002). Several papers have sought to identify specific safety management practice that acts as a predictor of safety performance (Mearns 2003). Through examining organization with good safety performance, it was intended to identify common features that are associated with good safety performance.<br/> This Research work will present a review of the literature on quality management and then on safety culture in construction industry. It will also use data from the studies on quality and safety in construction industry to further illustrate the problem of defining quality.<br/> 1.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/> It is commonly known that accident have serious implication to the construction industry both in financial and humanitarian terms. Construction accidents may cause many problems such as:<br/> 1 Demotivation of workers<br/> 2 Disruption of site activities<br/> 3 Delay of project progress and adversely affecting the overall cost, productivity and reputation of the construction industry (Mohammed, 1999).<br/> The primary problem to management system implementation success seems to be the nature of the construction process; the projects are very large; seldom situated in the same location and labour intensive; the work force tends to be transient; demand fluctuates, subject to the client is perception of the value of the construction project (Somerville, 1994). All of these are barriers or problems that have made implementation of management system to be almost impossible.<br/> Another problem to quality implementation is non- standardization. In the construction phase of a project, general contractors want to ensure quality through out the project. However, according to (Rowlinson and walker 1995), the construction industry is characterized by its non standardization. Very often, products are one- offs and the production processes are to some extent different from each other. Hence, no universal standard or specification can be applied to the product, which leads to difficulties in quality assurance. Changes to the design of a project are typical and may be frequent throughout the construction process. Quality is often at risk when there are excessive changes.<br/> 1.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/> The following questions are raised in the research.<br/> 1 what are the similarities between construction quality and safety?<br/> 2 what crucial factors are measured in improving quality<br/> and safety performance?<br/> 3. What are the benefits of quality and safety implementation?<br/> 4 what are the possible methods used in implementing them?</p> <p>1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVES<br/> This paper is aimed at examining the relationship between quality and safety and to explore how quality and safety can be operationalized in the construction industry.<br/> The following are the objectives to aid the achievement of the aim:<br/> 1 To investigate the impact of the working environment on safety and quality.<br/> 2 To investigate how the compliance to standards and specification in design affect safety and quality.<br/> 3 To evaluate the decision making pattern of contractors in ensuring quality during the design and planning stages.<br/> 1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/> Constructors, client and others in the design and construction team do see obvious benefits of quality and safety improvement. Chase (1998) concluded,<br/> “In the construction industry, application of TQM to the job site has been proven to speed – up project while increasing profitability”. Torbica and Stroh (1999) also concluded that, “for the first time an empirical study has confirmed that implementation of TQM is positively associated with home buyer satisfaction”. According to (McINtyre and kirschen man, 2000), Contractors do see benefits of quality improvement. More repeat customers and reduced rework.<br/> 1.5 SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS<br/> This research is restricted or limited to planning and implementing quality management and safety culture in achieving desired performance in the construction industry.<br/> The area location of this study will be limited to selected site at Asaba, Delta State metropolis. Some of the limitations to this research study are: lack of adequate finance, time restraint etc.</p>                                                           \n\nIMPACT OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY CULTURE ON CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY CULTURE ON CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract </p> <p>The occurrence of building failure and collapse has become a major issue of concern in the development of this nation as the magnitudes of this incident are becoming very alarming.

The study came as a result of the prevalent issues in the number of cases of building collapse in Nigeria especially in Lagos State. The descriptive research design was adopted for carrying out this study. Data were collected and analysed with the use of SPSS. The study had the following as the research objectives: to identify the prevalence of dampness in an existing building in Nigeria, to survey the effects of dampness in an existing building in Nigeria and to inquire the reasons for dampness in an existing building in Nigeria.</p> <p>   <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>A building delivered to the satisfaction of the client is one that is accepted as being of high standard and built using good machineries. This is bound on the premises of estimated cost. Recently, the Nigerian construction industry is currently witnessing a number of high-profile building collapses especially in Lagos State. During this year, the property and environment column of the Vanguard Newspaper emphasized the prevalent of collapsed building in all the nooks and crannies of the country, with Osun State inclusive. Building collapse is an occurrence that is beyond technological and scientific explanation. There can be no failure of a building without a prior failure of some building components. The technology of construction can never guarantee complete elimination of some degree of failure because of the fact that structures settle down, however slightly, on completion, as a result of consolidation of subsoil imposed by the weight of the structure.</p> <p>Depending on the magnitude of this movement, failure can develop. Professional bodies tend not to accept the responsibility for the incidence of building collapses as a result of component failure in Nigeria but rather put the heavy blame on the occupants. Rather, each of the bodies that represent town planners, quantity surveyors, engineers, architects, builders and building organisation will often seek to attribute blame outside the profession. The loss of materials and money cost of remedial measure, infliction of permanent injury, loss of life and so on, which result from building component failure, are both monetarily and psychologically significant. The rate of failure of building components in Nigeria is a cause for concern and as such demands urgent attention. Precautionary measure will start once designers take a total measure of their designs and become sensitive to the financial and psychological implication of any failure of the building components both during and after completion.</p> <p>Some numbers of Nigerian structures are often inadequately maintained and even badly situated in term of location and windows, doors and other building elements and facilities frequently show evidence of lack of maintenance and repair. Certain residential and office buildings in Lagos, Nigeria have not seen right significant maintenance or show little signs of maintenance since they were constructed, some years back. This is evident as there many cases of building collapse in the state. This lack of maintenance by authorities and occupants of these structures often leads to reduced lifespan of these buildings as stated by Melvin (1992), which invariably defeat the purpose for which they are put i.e. to ensure that the nation’s stock of buildings, both as a factor of production and accommodation, was used effectively as possible.</p> <p>Studies have revealed the effects of countless factors affecting maintenance and defects of buildings. Adejimi (2005) revealed twelve factors affecting the maintenance strength of building as design resolution, structural strength, specified materials strength, maintenance manual, safety measures, skill maintenance personnel, maintenance plants and  environmental factors. While Olagunju (2012) identified factors that influence the level of maintenance of public building standard. In the study eight factors were identified to be significant to physical condition of public building. The variables include architectural components condition, interior and exterior factors like; electrical wiring, toilet facilities, roofing, discharge of waste water component condition of walkways within the building surroundings. To evaluate the factors affecting building defects, Addleson (1977) concluded that natural factors can be summarized into three group of dampness, movement and chemical and biological change. Lack of adequate care and fallibility of people that initiate, design, construct and maintain buildings, accentuated by their educational, practice and commercial environment are the ultimate factors responsible for defects of building.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Most buildings in Nigeria are faced with maintenance challenges resulting in decreasing and ultimate defects of various levels. While the 1984 version of BS 3811 defined maintenance as the combination of all technical and associated administrative actions aimed at retaining an item and bring it to a level in which it can be performed its expected function, BS 3811(1974) defined building maintenance as work done to keep a building in, or restore it to its initial state, or to a currently acceptable standard. To retain implies that defects are prevented from developing by carrying out work in anticipation of failure. To restore means that minor defects had already occurred before they are corrected. For facilities to continue to perform its expected functions, some degrees of improvement are therefore needed on the longevity of the building as standards of comfort and amenity arise where there are primary requirements for maintenance. The acceptable standard must not be less than that necessary to meet them and the acceptable standard must sustain the utility and value of the facility. This study will therefore investigate the assessment for controlling of dampness in an existing building in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Research Questions</strong></p> <p>This research will be carried out to answer the following research questions:</p> <p>i)             what is the prevalence of dampness in an existing building in Nigeria?</p> <p>ii)           what are the effects of dampness in an existing building in Nigeria?</p> <p>iii)         what are the reasons for dampness in an existing building in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.4   Objectives of the Study </strong></p> <p>The broad objective of this study is to investigate the assessment for controlling of dampness in an existing building in Nigeria. The specific objectives include:</p> <p>i)             to identify the prevalence of dampness in an existing building in Nigeria</p> <p>ii)           to survey the effects of dampness in an existing building in Nigeria</p> <p>iii)         to inquire the reasons for dampness in an existing building in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.5   Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>        This study will help to intimate the government by giving them power to enforce law  and safe guard the lives and properties of the citizenry that lives in housing general and life of the buildings by ensuring strict enforcement of housing and safety policies. It will also enlighten developers on the needs for them to involve professionals in construction in order to avoid structural failure and collapse of buildings. It will serve as a foundation upon which research of this kind can be conducted and will also add to the related literature in the area of urban and regional planning.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will be carried out among selected housing estates in Lagos State, Nigeria. Information collected from these workers shall be subjected to further analysis and the results got from it shall be final.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Limitation of the study</strong></p> <p>The study will be faced with a lot of challenges and one it the problem of finance. There is not going to be enough funds to print questionnaires and to also transport the researcher to meet the desired respondents. Another one is time; the researcher is currently busy with the demand of his academics. A lot of assignments are available for the researcher to do and coupled with his desire to read and learn at the same time. These are the major challenges of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.8   Definitions of Terms</strong></p> <p>The following terms were used in the course of this study:</p> <p><strong>Assessment: </strong>the evaluation or estimation of the nature, quality, or ability of someone or something.</p> <p><strong>Building collapse:</strong> A building undergoes progressive collapse when a primary structural element fails, resulting in the failure of adjoining structural elements, which in turn causes further structural failure.</p> <p><strong>Controlling:</strong> determine the behavior or supervise the running of.</p> <p><strong>Dampness:</strong> the presence of unwanted moisture in the structure of a building, either the result of intrusion from outside or condensation from within the structure.

While mean statistics was employed to analyze relating to research questions.1-4 based on the findings of the studies. The following recommendations were made, Correct mix ratio should be properly follow to avoid building cracks. Walls and other parts of the bridling should be properly cured after being constructed. Soil test should be conducted so as to ascertain the strength of the soil. There should be proper design to avoid building cracks. Use of unclean materials should be avoided.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Modern building of engineering structure are complex and require Architect, structural engineers, quantity surveyor, good contractor and supervisors for detailed planning, safe design and efficient use of appropriate material. When these requirement are not made adequately, failure becomes more probable? According to Evelyn (September – 2004) cracks in building elements may constitute a defect in a variety of ways. In many cases a particular crack occurrence may result in more than one type of defect. A serviceability defect and an appearance defect. And according to Shri M.M Goyal (2004) occurrence of various crack patterns in the building during construction and after completion, when it is subjected to super imposed loads and during service life, is a common phenomenon. A building component develops cracks whenever the stress in the components exceeds its strength. Stress in the building components caused by external applied forces, such as dead, live, wind or seismic leads, foundation settlement e.tc or it could be induced internally due to thermal movements, moisture changes, elastic deformation, chemical action e.t.c</p> <p>The occupants of buildings may served as good tenants or occupants, Since their knowledge of the facility in many ways have contributed in checking failure and defects in residential buildings. It is important for the tenants to understand the causes of cracks in structures e.g.</p> <p>Non structural cracks – these are mostly due to internally induced stresses in building material and do not endanger safety of a building but may look unsightly. Or may create an impression of faulty work or may site a feeling of insatiability. In some situation due to penetration of moisture through them, non structural cracks may spoil the internal finishes thus adding to the cost of maintenance or corrode the reinforcement, thereby adversely affecting the stability of the structure in long run, e.g vertical crack in a long compound wall due to shrinkage or thermal movement.</p> <p>Cracks may appreciably vary in width from very thin hair crack barely visible to naked eye to sapling crack. Depending upon the crack width cracks are classified as: thin crack – less than 1 mm in width, medium crack- 1 to 2mm in width, wide crack – more than 2mm in width and crazing – occurrence of closely spaced line cracks at the surface of a structure or material.</p> <p>The cracks that occur are of uniform width some are narrow at one end gradually widening at the other, the above pattern of cracks usually occur on the surface of plaster or rendering of the structure of building, and those patterns some occur on the walls of the building such as; straight, toothed, stepped or map pattern. The random type crack may be vertically or horizontally or diagonally e.t.c</p> <p>Therefore, there is need for the occupants of the residential buildings to periodically examine and critically assess the stability and ability of the structure of their buildings.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Crack is a kind of universal problem of building and if not checked may destroys the foundations or walls and affects the building artistic.

The specific purposes of the study were to find out the importance of building maintenance among landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District, find out the responsibilities of landlords and the rights of tenants in building maintenance practice in Niger Central Senatorial District and determine the factors affecting building maintenance practice among landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District, e.t.c. Three research questions were designed and used to guide this study. The sample population of the study is 30. The study adopted descriptive survey research design and the area of the study is Niger central senatorial zone. The test retest method was used to establish the reliability of the instrument.Based on the findings, recommendations were made which include that; There is need for good preventive maintenance through regular inspections to avoid breakdowns and repairs, which costs more, There is need for public awareness on the danger of lack of maintenance and the advantages of good maintenance, Laws enforcing every occupant to carry out proper maintenance should be enacted and agencies to enforce the law should be established, In order to avoid the use of sub-standard materials as an alternative to the high cost of good quality materials, there should be a research into how the government can help with the local building materials industries in the country to survive.<br/><br/><br/></em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Over the years, there has been increasing abandonment of houses and infrastructural facilities in Niger central Senatorial District which has led to the dilapidation, degradation and deterioration of buildings and infrastructural structures. Recently there has been a lot of research investigations and analyse which points unshakably to the fact that certain factors such as client’s perception, cost of maintenance works, unskilled maintenance technicians, lack of Building Maintenance policy, Government legislations not being properly enacted, inability to prepare and follow maintenance schedules are direct causes of neglect which lead to dilapidations and deterioration of building structures, Draft National Building Maintenance Policy (2011).</p> <p>There are also the remote causes of lack of maintenance such as force majeure, cultural problems, state of the economy, the receding global economic meltdown, lack of time and general illiteracy of the occupants of the building or structures and users of the facilities.</p> <p>However, there has also been growth in the significance of building maintenance as a proportion of the output of the construction industry which takes place against a backdrop of mounting pressure on new building activity and a growing awareness of the need to manage the condition of the nation’s building and infrastructure more effectively, Draft National Building Maintenance Policy (2011).</p> <p>Though, it is still the case that such maintenance activity takes place in a context that does not create a fully integrated approach to managing building performance and thus the full potential of many buildings and infrastructures are never wholly realized. Basically in virtually all the areas of Niger Central Senatorial District, buildings and infrastructural facilities are gradually and systematically decaying, dilapidating and deteriorating with reduced or no degree of maintenance programme and activity.</p> <p>A lot of research have been done in regard to maintenance and management of low income housing especially controlled tenancy, but little emphasis has been laid to maintenance practice among landlords which is key to the overall management of the houses.</p> <p>From a normal visual perception in the urban metropolis, it can be noted that majority of the constructed buildings both private and public, road network, water supply systems, sanitary and drainage systems, transmission poles and electricity lines, sign posts and route location posts are deteriorated and badly in need of maintenance. The lack of maintenance of these buildings and infrastructures negatively affects the populace which thus affects the output of the working class, capacity of the populace is thus lost, time value for achievement of goals and objectives minimized, it also causes all forms of ill-health and psychological effects thereby reducing the economic growth of the nation. Therefore, this study will appraise Building Maintenance Practice among Landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District.</p> <p><strong>1.2  Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The primary aim of maintaining a building and its environment is to ensure that the building continues to serve its purpose for which it was intended, yield optimum return and ensuring safety, health and comfort in its usage. Management of housing and infrastructure in required continuous source of funding for provision of services such as garbage collection, lawn mowing, street lighting, cleaning and maintenance of ablution blocks, roads and drainage systems, sewer problems, security and care takers in the estates, without which the shared facilities become dilapidated, prompting for much more on cost of renovations. The rent collected is barely enough for the houses to be regularly maintained let alone the shared facilities.</p> <p>Failure of the landlords to quickly restructure buildings raised the emerging challenges that require a study to be conducted. Therefore, this study, “<em>Appraisal of Building Maintenance Practice among Landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District”</em> so as to ensure better building maintenance and improve the life-span of the buildings by pointing out the various challenges of property management and to enlighten people on the need to have a policy or law that will govern the maintenance of buildings and infrastructures within Niger Central Senatorial District.</p> <p><strong>1.3  Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to conduct a survey of Appraisal of Building Maintenance Practice among Landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District and come out with some basic information on this study below:</p> <p>1. Find out the importance of building maintenance among landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District.</p> <p>2. Find out the responsibilities of landlords and the rights of tenants in building maintenance practices in Niger Central Senatorial District.</p> <p>3. Determine the factors affecting building maintenance practice among landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District, e.t.c.</p> <p><strong>1.4  Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study, “Appraisal of Building Maintenance Practice among Landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District”. Will make contributions in the following areas:</p> <p>1. It will help Niger State Government to find a way of providing good policies for building maintenance practice among landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District.</p> <p>2.  It will enhance the landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District to be acquainted with skills for building maintenance practice in Niger Central Senatorial District.</p> <p>3. It will also enable landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District to clearly understand in the areas of Appraisal of Building Maintenance Practices among themselves.</p> <p>4. It will also enable the tenants to clearly know their rights regarding to maintenance in Niger Central Senatorial District.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>This study tends to answer the following research questions:</p> <p>1. What are the importance of building maintenance among landlords in Niger Central Senatorial District?</p> <p>2. What are the responsibilities of landlords and the rights of tenants in building maintenance practice in Niger Central Senatorial District?</p> <p>3.
