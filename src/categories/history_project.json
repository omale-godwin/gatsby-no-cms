Transparency international has been in the forefront in the fight against corruption in Nigeria. This research will attempt to look into the causes, effects of corruption in Nigeria and how successful transparency international has been in the fight against corruption in Nigeria. Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power private gain. Transparency International (TI) applying to both the public and private sectors. <br/>The Corruption Practices Index (CPI) of transparency international focuses on corruption in the public sector or corruption which involves public offices, Civil Servants or politicians1. The data sources used to compile the index include questions relating to the abuse of public power and focus on bribery of public officials in public procurement embezzlement of public funds, and on questions that probe the strength and effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts in the public sector2. As such it covers both the administrative and political aspects of corruption. In producing the index, the scores of countries territories for the specific corruption related questions in the data sources are combined to calculate a single score for each country3. <br/>    Etymologically, corruption is derived from the Latin world “corruptus” which means to break way or depart from morality, ethics and civil virtues. Corruption is a break away from what is good and right. Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary defines corruption as dishonesty (which in other in the mind, words is deceitfulness, fraudulence, untruthfulness, treachery, duplicity). The World Bank defines corruption as “the abuse of public office for private gains4. Public office is abused for private gain when an official accepts, solicits or extorts a bribe. It is also abused when private agents actively offer bribes to circumvent public policies and processes for competitive advantage and profit. Public offices can also be abused for personal benefit even if no bribery occurs through patronage and nepotism, the theft of state assets or the diversion of state revenue”. Microsoft Encartar Encyclopedia defines it as “wrong doing by those in a special position of trust5. <br/>    Section 2 of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission Act 2000 defines corruption to include “bribery” fraud and other related offences”6. The most common type of corruption by this definition is bribery which refers to the giving or taking of money or any kind of favour in return or exchange for undue advantage over other people. Other types include abuse of power in any form or degree, extortion, embezzlement, inflation of contracts, diversion of funds, falsification or suppression of records, perversions of justice, electoral malpractices, examination malpractices, drug trafficking, money laundering, abuse of selection, processes nepotism, sexual exploration, gratification and so on. All these exampled of corrupt practices are prevalent in Nigeria. There are many causes of corruption in Nigeria and especially during the Sani Abacha regime. Some  have attributed one of the causes of corruption to flagrant and penurious graft that exists in the country. Many blame greed and ostentatious lifestyle as a potential root cause of corruption. To some societies, in love with ostentatious lifestyle may delve into corrupt practices to feed the lifestyle and also embrace a style of public stanza and lack of decorum. The customs and attitudes of the society may also be a contributing factors. Gift giving as expressions of loyalty or tributes to traditional rulers maybe fabrics of the society7. Also, a political environment that favours toward elites or wealthy citizens may also be influenced by corruption8. Wealthy elites may resort to steaze in order to gain power and protect their interest. <br/>However, the bottom line surmised from the views of most Nigerians is that corruption is a problem that has to be rooted out. In Nigeria, another major cause of corruption is ethnicity called tribalism in Nigeria friends and kinsmen seeking favour from officials may impose difficulties strains on the ethical disposition of the officials. Many kinsmen may see a government official as holding necessary avenues for their personal survival or gain. <br/>    The menace called corruption is a big problem in Nigeria and its effects in the Nigeria society cannot be over emphasized according to M. Watts. In this research work, we are going to look at the devastating  effects of corruption as we have enumerated above. Added to that, corruption is a cankerworm that has eaten deep into the fabric of Nigeria society. It is a moster that all and sundry blame for the economic woes facing the country. This is because corruption is seen as one of the major impediments to the economic development of the nation. It is perhaps the only reason why nothing seems to be working. <br/>    Interestingly, successive governments pursued policies against corruption and it was the main reason why the military made incursion into politics. Despite various policies adopted by governments, corruption is ever increasing in the country. According to Kolawole  Olaniyan, corruption and the struggle to combat it has been there since the history of mankind9.<br/>    In this research too, solutions will be proffered to the hydra-headed corruption which has brought to the country to its knees. There are many literatures that proffered solution to corruption which was plaque the country. According to Oyinlola Ayobami in his book titled “Corruption Eradication in Nigeria: An Appraisal10, he outlined some solutions to corruption in Nigeria first, in order to prevent corruption from happening all, Nigerians should emphasis transparency, integrity, and accountability which we were lacking during the Sani Abacha  regime. Oyinlola claims that social transformation in education of the public is a necessary factor. There is need for formation and reformation, orientation and re-orientation of the minds and heart of Nigerians, for them to see that corruption is the enemy of development. <br/><br/>    Finally, Nigeria has been confronted with both the petty and grand corruption. It was this development that motivated the researcher of the study to examine the place of Transparency International, a non-governmental organization that monitors and publicized corporate and political corruption in international development in discouraging corruption in Nigeria  through its annual corruption perceptions index (CPI). Especially during the regime of the late dictator General Sani Abacha’s regime that lasted from 1993-1998. <br/>Aims and Objectives of the Study<br/>    The following aims and objectives of the study will highlight the essence of the study. <br/>i.    To examine corrupt practices under Sani Abacha. <br/>ii.    To study the reasons for the prevalence and persistence of corruption in Nigeria. <br/>iii.    To examine the place of transparency international in discouraging corruption in Nigeria through its annual publication of corruption perception index (CPI). <br/>Methodology <br/>    Methods of gathering data towards the success of this study include primary and secondary sources. The primary sources include newspapers, interviews, correspondences, government publication, private papers, archival materials while the secondary sources include books, internet materials, journals articles and theses. <br/>Scope of the Study<br/>    This research is divided into five chapters, this work will look at transparency international and the fight against corrupt practices in Nigeria using the regime of General Sani Abacha,1993-1998 as a case study. <br/>Significance of the Study<br/>    The significance of this study is that it will give us an insight into corrupt practices in Nigeria. Its documentation will further give us a bride-eye’s view of the menace  called corruption in Nigeria  and solutions will be proffered, because with corruption so prevalent in Nigeria, Nigeria cannot attain the lofty heights it has set. <br/>Literature Review<br/>    The literatures that  were reviewed are the ones that were relevant to the study. Some of the literatures, in this group include, Olaniyan Kolawole’s book titled “Corruption on and human rights laws in Africa1. This book highlights the fact that corruption is as old as humanity. It is relevant to the study in that it highlights the dangers of corruption to the socio-economic and political development of any society and that inspite of the concerted  efforts to combat this scourge at national regional and global levels, it continues to flourish with catastrophic consequences. In this book also, Olaniyan deflates the narrow understanding of corruption and has demonstrated in corruption and human rights law in Africa that corruption has its principal victims, the ordinary citizens who are usually the most vulnerable in the society, and who because of the lack of understanding of the real effects of corruption usually end up without any effective remedy. In this book, Olaniyan propound that “as a matter of justice and fairness, the (victim should ideally be entitled to an effective remedy through the anti-corruption legals framework or human rights law. Olaniyan concluded by proffered solutions to the menace called corruption. <br/>The book Ayobami Oyinlola titled “Corruption Eradication in Nigeria. An appraisal”2, it is also very relevant to this study because it deal on corruption its causes, effects and proffered solutions to the menace that is ravaging the country. According to Ayobami  Oyinlola, corruption is systematic in nature and can effect the whole life of society. He attributed the growing rate of corruption in Nigeria to people holding power at the federal state and local government levels. He claims that corruption does not involve just people in government, but also to people in both private and public. Positions and even traditional rulers. Ayobami further gave an insight on the effects of corruption on nation building. The effects of corruption as enumerated by Ayobami Oyinlola are those that are capable of crippling any nation. They are:<br/>1.    Diversion of development resources for private <br/>2.    Misallocation of talents <br/>3.    Lost tax revenue <br/>4.    Negative impact on quality of infrastructure and public services. <br/>5.    Slowing of economic growth <br/>In this book, Ayobami Oyinlola  proffers solutions to this lingering problem. He wrote that to prevent corruption from happening at all, Nigerians should emphasis transparency, integrity and accountability in all their private and public transaction. The author writes that there should be social transformation in education of the public, there is also need for formation and reformation, orientation of the minds and heart of Nigerian, for them to see that corruption is the enemy of development. He also claims that anti-corruption law should be enforced fully and without any fear and favour. <br/>    Mark, Pieth titled, Recovered Stolen Assets 3. It is also very helpful in this study, the book was relevant to this study is discusses the effects of corruption and looting of the public purse. According to Mark, Pieth, development efforts will remain frustrated so long as corrupt leaders continue to steal their countries wealth and dispose of these ill-gotten gains in foreign  jurisdictions. Mark, Pieth  claims that prevention of such looting, and the recovering of the stolen assets are this critical development issues and a cornerstone of the United Nations convention against corruption. According to the author, experience with assets recovering is limited and a  number of legal and other obstacles continue to impede progress. This  is the first comprehensive work on asset recovering.<br/>    Peter Lewis book “Growing Apart: Oil, politics and economy change in Nigeria and Indonesia”4. This is also very helpful to this study. Based on the authors detailed study of forty-years of economic change.     <br/>    Growing Apart offers insight into economic change in Nigeria and  Indonesia. It is  relevant to this study because it harped on why the economy of Nigeria has remained stagnated over the years. He attributed this stagnation to the way Nigeria confronted policy reform and developing institutions for economic growth. <br/>    Peter Eigen The “Web of Corruption5 a book written of Transparency International is also relevant to this study. According to the author, corruption is a global problem which not only wreaks economic  havoc but can also bring down entire political systems. This book analyses the logic and mechanisms of bribery as well as its catastrophic effects. It describes the work of transparency international, one of the most important non-governmental organizations <br/>    Anthony Oyewole’s award – wining book, titled  “Historical Dictionary of Nigeria” is one of the books that is helpful in the writing of this study6. This book is relevant to the study because it discusses in detail the history of Nigeria. According to Oyewole, the history of Nigeria has often been difficult to follow, politically country passed through  several democratic phases that were interrupted by regimes controlled by the military. Internally regions and states have been sporadically created and divided to counteract ethnic or other decisions existing between the peoples of this densely populated African nation. This book, historical dictionary of  Nigeria serves as a guide for knowing about the political  economic ad social history of this multi-ethnic nation. <br/>    Again, Chalkin  David book titled “Corruption and Money Laundering. A   Symbiotic   Relationship7 is also very useful to this study7. This book shows how corruption facilitates money laundering. Furthermore, it demonstrates specifically how the responses developed to combat one type of financial crime can product rely be employed in fighting the other. <br/>Siollun, book titled “Oil, Politics and Violence” Nigeria is a military coup culture8 gave a first hand knowledge of  how various factors in the military were able to hold onto power and resist civil and international pressure for democratic governance by exploiting the country’s oil wealth and ethnic divisions to its advantage. The book focuses specifically on the social tensions, the motivation and the methods of the series of coups that rent Nigeria. <br/>    Onaiwu Osahon’s book titled “The Ghost of Sani Abacha9 is another book that was useful in this study9. It is  relevant to this study because it chronicles the regimes of past Nigerian leaders and how they stole the nation dry. <br/>ENDNOTES <br/>1.    Olaniyan, Kayode, Corruption and Human  Rights Law in Africa, (Oxford:  Hart publishing, 2014), pp. 1-7. <br/>2.    Ayobami Oyinlola, Corruption Eradication in Nigeria: An Appraisal, (Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2011), p.1.<br/>3.    Mark Pieth, Recovered Stolen Assets, (Basel: Basel Institute Publishing, 2008), pp. 43-44.  <br/>4.    Hicks Bills, “Transparency International” Pinkin Industry. com, 2010.<br/>5.    Peter Lewis, Growing Apart: Oil, Politics and Economy Changes in Nigeria and Indonesia, (Michigan: University of Michigan Press, 2007), p.178. <br/>6.    Peter Eigen, The Web of Corruption, (Frankfurt: TI   Publishing Press, 2003), pp. 1-301. <br/>7.    Anthony Oyewole, Historical Dictionary of Nigeria, (Lanham: Scarecrow Publishing Press), 1987, p. 385. <br/>8.    Chaikin David, Corruption and Money Laundering A symbiotic Relationship, (Palgrave: Palgrave Macmillan,  2009), pp.12-13. <br/>9.    Siollun, Oil Politics and violence: Nigeria’s Military coup culture, (Algora: Algora publishing, 1976), p, 97.<br/>10.    Onaiwu  Osahon’ The Ghost of Sani Abacha, (Lagos: Obobo Publishing Press, 2010), p.3. <br/><br/>\n\nTRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL AND CHALLENGES OF CORRUPT PRACTICES IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF GENERAL SANI ABACHA 1993-1998)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL AND CHALLENGES OF CORRUPT PRACTICES IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF GENERAL SANI ABACHA 1993-1998)", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE IMPACT OF THE NIGERIAN CIVIL WARON THE URBANIZATION OF ONITSHA, 1970 -2016<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Introduction             -    <br/>Aim and Objectives    <br/>Significance of Study        -    -    <br/>Literature Review        -    <br/>Scope and limitation of the Study    -<br/>Methodology            -    -<br/>Chapterization        -    <br/>Endnotes             -    <br/>CHAPTER TWO: THEINVASION AND FALL OF ONITSHA <br/>IN 1967            -    <br/>Destruction of Infrastructural Facilities in Onitsha-    -<br/>Challenges faced by the People    -    <br/>Post-Civil War Communal Individual Self Help Efforts in Onitsha    <br/>Endnotes         <br/>CHAPTER THREEPost-Civil War Reconstruction of Onitsha Since<br/> 1970    -    <br/>Post Civil Reconstruction Programme    <br/>Reconstruction of Transport Facilities    <br/>Endnotes    -    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: THE IMPACT OF URBANIZATION OF ONITSHA <br/>AT THE END OF THE NIGERIAN CIVIL WAR IN 1970-<br/>Encouraged Rural-Urban Migration-    -<br/>Endnotes        <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Conclusion            -<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY         <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction<br/>    This research focuses on the urbanization process in Onitsha since the end of the Nigerian Civil War in 1970. The research examines the urban renewal of Onitsha after the destructive Nigerian Civil War when the city was a war theater war, and a place of fierce contest and battle ground between the Nigerian soldiers and the Biafran forces. The battle for the control of Onitsha was one of the interesting episodes during the war as the fall of the town had far reaching effects. The fall of Onitsha enabled the Nigerian Federal forces to make an inroad into the other parts of Igboland which eventually led to the defeat of Biafa. Due to the strategic position of Onitsha during the war, the federal forces caused a lot of devastations on the economic and social infrastructural facilities ranging from schools, pipe borne water, churches, residential houses, government offices, telecommunication equipment, hospitals and clinics and the famous Onitsha Main Market were destroyed. <br/>The civil war greatly affected the urban status of Onitsha which was left in ruins. This caused the a lot of deprivations, sufferings and the people were traumatized and left in abject poverty and want.  This research also looks at the various efforts made by the Federal Government under General Yakubu Gowon and Dr. Ukpbi Askia, who was the administrator of the East Central State, the indigenes, social clubs and other interest groups and self help measures they adopted  in the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure and brought them beyond the pre-civil war levels. These made Onitsha to wear a new look better than its former urban status. It will highlight the benefits and challenges of this process to the inhabitants of the town.  <br/>Historically, Onitsha according to oral tradition is believed to be a 17th century kingdom founded by a group of emigrants who moved away from a part of disintegrating Benin Empire under the leadership of a legendary character, ‘Ahime’ later corrupted to ‘Chime’. According to chief Egharevba of Benin, the people of Onitsha left Benin to seek a new place of settlement in the reign of Oba Esigie (1504-1550) during the period that Christianity of the Roman Catholic Sect. was established in Benin by the Portuguese.1<br/>This is clearly demonstrated in the full traditional name of the town ‘Onitsha Ado N’Idu’, which literally means ″Onitsha of Benin origin″. However, many scholars like Onyejekwe do not seem to support the Benin origin of Onitsha, but claims that Onitsha is an Igbo settlement formerly under the influence of the imperial Benin Empire. Though this claim deems reasonable, it does not in any way debunk their movement from Benin towards the Niger, leaving behind them, the tired and the aged who later became the founding fathers of nucleus of towns such as Onitsha Ugbo, Onitsha Olona, Onitsha Ukwu, Onitsha Ibabo and Uku, Obior, Ibuza and Ezi where hitherto, they proudly refer to themselves (or identify themselves) as ‘Umu Ezechima’ meaning ″Children of Chima″. The clash between ‘Chima’ or ‘Ahime’ and the Oba of Benin must have been the major cause of the migration of the Onitsha who subjugated the Oze people and Ogbolo Igbo, the territory northeast of the riverbank, where they finally settled. Four other villages also migrated to Onitsha from Igala kingdom in the upper Niger namely Obikporo, Umulkem, Mgbelekeke and Ogbotu.2<br/>Geographical Location of Onitsha<br/>Onitsha is currently the headquarters of Onitsha-South and Onitsha-North Local Government Areas of Anambra State. Onitsha is situated at the confluence of Anambra and river Niger. It lies within the latitude 6̊ 07N and longitude 6̊ 48̍ and is situated within core areas of high population density of Igboland.3 The land is bounded to the north by Nkwelle and Oze villages, to the east by Nkpor and Obosi communities and to the south by the River Idemili which forms a natural boundary in the south with Odekpe in Ogbaru Local Government Area. Onitsha is not more than 700ft above sea level and lies between the grassland and forest belt.4 As a result of this, the town is blessed with two marked periods of annual rainfall. Moreover, it lies along the only navigable part of the river Niger as one move from the west, which further extends to the hinterland and up to the northern middle belt. The river can admit large boats during high tide. Onitsha is blessed with two seasons, rainy and dry, with a light harmattan, making the climate relatively warm with tolerable humidity.<br/>Aim and Objectives of the Study<br/>The aim of the study is to examine the urbanization of Onitsha since the end of the Nigerian Civil War in 1970. The specific objectives of the study include the following:<br/>i.    To examine the level of urban growth of Onitsha before and after the civil war;<br/>ii.    To investigate why Onitsha suffered such much devastation during the war<br/>iii.    To investigate  and identify the damaged facilities and how they were reconstructed at the end of the war in 1970<br/>iv.    To examine the roles played by the Federal government. East Central State government in the reconstruction of Onitsha<br/>v.    To assess the role of the indigenous Onitsha people in the reconstruction of the home.<br/>Research Questions<br/>The research is set out to provide answers to the following research questions:<br/>i.    What was the level of urbanization of Onitsha before the Nigerian Civil War?<br/>ii.    What was the nature of devastation of the town during the Civil War<br/>iii.    What role did the Federal Government and East Central State government play in the reconstruction of Onitsha after the war<br/>iv.    What role did the community and individuals play in the post-war reconstruction of the town.<br/> Significance of the Study<br/> This work sets out to find out how in the devastating effect of the Nigerian Civil War on Onitsha, and how the basic infrastructure and amenities were restored in the city after the war. In other words, the work tends to give a historical account of the urbanization process of Onitsha from the end of the Civil War in 1970 up to the present time. The significance of this study lies in the fact that it attempts to provide a historical perspective to trajectory of Onitsha`s urbanization process. This is to enable us comprehend the various stages through which the town passed before attaining its current status as one of the commercial and trading emporium east of the Niger and Nigeria at large.  This work will be relevant to government policy makers, urban developers, stakeholders in estate business, and scholars who wish to conduct research on Onitsha on related subjects. Further research in this vital area of Onitsha history is possible and encouraging.<br/>Literature Review<br/>The existing literature on the experiences of the Onitsha people during and after the Nigerian Civil War is very few, given to the limited scholarly works in the subject of study. The works reviewed include those that border on the war on Onitsha, the impact of the war on the city and works on the post civil war reconstruction of Igboland as a whole. Among the works reviewed include the following:<br/>S. I. Bosah, Groundwork of the History and Culture of Onitsha5 is one of the prominent works on Onitsha. It presents the history of origin, growth and development of Onitsha. It explores the political, social, cultural and economic aspects of Onitsha`s history. It also documents the post-colonial developments in Onitsha before the outbreak of the Nigerian Civil War in 1967. It assesses the contributions of indigenous Onitsha elites ranging prominent chiefs, politicians, to those in the medical, educational to other professions such as the role of Dr Nnamdi Azikwe, Askia Ukpabi, Dr. Chike Obi among others to the development of the city. Although the work concentrates on the pre-colonial, through colonial and post-colonial history of Onitsha before the war, it is a relevant to this study as it is used in examining the development of infrastructures before the war such as the Onitsha Main Market which was built in 1955 and other facilities that contributed to the urbanization of Onitsha.<br/>E. N Aghalogu,`s work ″The Structure and Morphology of Onitsha Urban″6 is one of the promising works that deals on the urbanization of Onitsha. It highlights the processes of the urban growth of Onitsha as well as presents other indices of development which include the provision of social amenities, good road network, trade and commerce which Onitsha is well known for and provisions of good health care, schools and churches. Aghalogu asserts that it is the interconnectedness of these variant social facilities that placed Onitsha on the part of urban growth and expansion since the period of the Christian missionaries and European merchants establishment of churches, schools and trading companies in Onitsha in the pre-colonial era. It is a sociological work which is very useful to the present study; hence the author utilized the data fully in this research.<br/>Chinua Achebe in his book, There was a Country7 is a personal account of the author during the Nigerian Civil War.  It identifies the causes of the war and the killings and devastations that rocked Igboland. Achebe employs a peculiar dimension in locating the experiences of the people of the Eastern Region during the civil war and the fall of Onitsha, which marked the Federal troops taking of other parts of Igboland. The book is relevant to this study as it considers the fall of Onitsha as one of the strategic loss to the Biafrans as other towns in Igboland followed suit until the surrender of Biafra to the Nigerian troops on 15th January 1970 which marked the end of the Nigerian Civil War.<br/>  Achuzia`s work titled Requiem Biafra,8 gives a personal account of the author`s military exploits during the Nigerian Civil War. Achuzia was one of the prominent Biafran soldiers, who participated in the defence of the Asaba and Onitsha area against the Federal troops. The book explores the conduct of the war in Asaba and Onitsha sector and the events that led eventually led to the bombing of the Niger Bridge which linked Asaba with Onitsha. It is a vital source material which helps us to appraise the level of devastations that took place in Asaba and Onitsha especially the breaking the Niger Bridge and destruction of various roads in Onitsha.<br/>Paul Obi-ani`s book, The Post-Civil War Social and Economic Reconstruction of Igboland, 1970-1983.9 concentrates on the Federal Military Government of Yakubu Gowon`s efforts in the reconstruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the war torn Igboland. Despite the fact the book focuses on the reconstruction programme in the whole of Igboland, the book is a good source material for this research work because among the facilities that were destroyed during the Civil War were located Onitsha. In addition, the war provides us with insightful information on the reconstruction of critical infrastructure such as the Niger Bridge which connected Onitsha with Asaba, the telecommunication facilities, Onitsha Main Market amongst others. <br/>Elizabeth Isichei`s work, A History of lgbo People 10 focuses on the various aspects of the history of the Igbo people. It explores the origin, migration, causes of migration, and development of trade, commerce and religious beliefs of the Igbo people. Although the work is on the general history of the Igbo people both east and west of the Niger, it is relevant to this study. Elizabeth identifies Onitsha as the earliest missionary and commercial gateway to the heart of Igboland. She traces the town`s development and urban growth to the activities of the Christian missionaries and European trading merchants who established their stations in the area in the late 19th century.<br/>Daniel Olisa Iweze’s article titled ″The Importance of Inter-Modal Transport System in Nigeria with Reference to the Asaba-Onitsha Transport Corridor since the Pre-Colonial Period″11 focuses on the importance of inter-modal transport system in Nigeria with emphasis on the Asaba-Onitsha transport corridor since the pre-colonial period. The article contends that since a single means of transport could not adequately serve the transportation needs of the majority of Nigerians, the development of the Asaba-Onitsha inter-modal transport system would minimize traffic problems along the corridor. It is also of the view that the uni-modal nature of the transport system in Nigeria has adversely affected rapid socio-economic and infrastructural development in the country and calls for the construction of the second Niger Bridge in order to lessen the volume of traffic that plied on the old bridge as it is on the verge of collapse. The fact that the articles focuses on the inter-modal transport system between Asaba and Onitsha, it is relevant to this present study because the provision of good transportation facilities in Onitsha is one of the vital indices that stimulated the urbanization of Onitsha making the city to serve as a nodal point which linked various parts of the country.<br/>C.N. Ubah`s article, ″Military Factor in Urbanization in Nigeria: The Example of Kaduna″12 traces the process of the urbanization of Kaduna to 1913 and subsequently when it made the capital of Northern provinces of Nigeria when Zungeru lost its position. He opines that when federalism was introduced in the colonial period, Kaduna also became the capital of Northern Region and from there attracted other social service to the city. Ubah identifies the military factor as prominent which laid the foundation for the take off of the urban process which Kaduna would experienced in the preceding years. Other factors include the role of education, ex-service men, internal security, job creation, provision of medical services and the railway.  Although the work centres on Kaduna, it is still relevant to this present work as it was the provision of vital social service as obtainable in Kaduna that also laid the foundation for the urbanization of Onitsha after the Nigerian Civil War in 1970.<br/>It could be seen from the above reviewed works that there is no comprehensive research that has been devoted to the investigation of the nature of the urbanization of Onitsha from the end of the Nigerian Civil War to the present time. The works reviewed have provided us with useful data and interpretation and these works are complemented with oral data to enable us present the nature of urbanization of Onitsha since the end of the Nigerian Civil War.  This research work has therefore seeks to fill the existing gap in the literature on Onitsha history.<br/>Scope and Limitations of the Study<br/>    The work examines the urbanization of Onitsha since the end of the Nigerian Civil War in 1970 to the present time. The starting date of 1967 is chosen because it’s historical significance. It was the year the Nigerian Civil War came to an end after two years of war between the Biafra and Nigerian government which caused a lot of devastations in the East of which Onitsha being a border town was among the hardest hit. This work focuses on the experiences of the Onitsha people during and after the civil war examining the social, economic and political impact of the Nigerian Civil War on Onitsha and how the people were able to reconstruct their damaged homes complementing the both the Federal and East Central government`s  post-civil war reconstruction programmes in the period of our study.<br/>One of the greatest challenges that this researcher faced in the course of carrying out this research is paucity of data in relation to the subject of study. This challenge was overcome through persistent search for relevant sources by visiting various libraries at the University of Benin, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Delta State University, Abraka and Delta State Library, Asaba among others. Finance was another challenge in terms of number of travels for interview sessions with informants and photocopying of books, articles in journals and book chapters. The researcher was able to surmount these problems that usually cropped up in any research work through focus, perseverance and handiwork.<br/>Methodology and Sources<br/>    The data used in this study were generated from both primary and secondary sources. Primary sources were collected through oral interviews and observations by the researcher. Secondary materials include published and unpublished works, articles in journals, book chapters and internet sources. These sources were sourced from the Department of History and International Studies, University of Benin, Delta State University Abraka and Delta State Library, Asaba, University of Nigeria Nsukka, Nnamdi Azikwe University, Awka and so on. These sources were critically analyzed to either to validate, collaborate or debunk some views from oral sources and published works that dealt on the Nigerian Civil War during and after the war on Onitsha. These varied sources are collected and objectively assessed in line with the tenets of historical methodology.<br/>Organization of Chapters<br/>The work is divided into five chapters which are presented as follows: <br/>Chapter one is the general background to the study and it contains the introduction, aim and objectives, significance of the study, scope of the study, methodology and sources, literature review and organization of chapters. Chapter two dwells on the outbreak of the Nigerian Civil War and the Federal troop’s invasion of Onitsha. Chapter three focuses on the devastation of social, economic infrastructure in Onitsha.  Chapter four analyses the reconstruction of the damaged facilities by the Federal, East Central State governments as well as individuals. Chapter five is the summary and conclusion of the work. It presents the findings of the research.<br/>The Concept of Urbanization<br/>There has been diverse of opinions on when urbanization and city process began. According to Bulton, it was initially a slow process, which progressed from village life to urban life. The introduction of agriculture and replacement of the nomadic existence of Neolithic hunters and herdsmen necessitated the establishment of a more permanent and stable settlement. This must have been possible during the era of agrarian revolution when man gave up hunting and gathering as a way of living and settled down to rudimentary agriculture. Following this, came an expansion in commercial economic undertaking a trend, which accelerated as the size of villages grew and greater economics of specialization became possible. From the first development of cities many years ago, they have grown as the focal points of society’s activities and culture. These have tended determine their physical forms, the shapes and arrangement of their buildings, paths, and streets and other open spaces. Implicit in any type of arrangement obtained in cities of course the functions they perform. Urban settlement or city cannot be interpreted as a mass of materials in terms of name patterns but rather, it ought to be interpreted as organic parts of a social group.13 <br/>In terms of its four fundamental functions, viz. dwelling, work, recreation and transport, every city forms parts of an economic social culture and political whole upon which its development and growth depend. Using Onitsha as a case study, in further definition of this concept, the structure can be said to relate to the variables, namely: the plan or the layout of the city, land use and use and the function buildings and lastly, the architectural design of the buildings. These very independently and produce an infinite variety of city scene. It is not worthy to say that though a city is made up of various component parts, these should be studied together as a unit. <br/> Urbanization has been defined as the process whereby a settlement or a rural community undergoes change because of certain influences and movements of people and activities. The growth and development of cities have become one of the most impressive phenomenon of the 21st century city again have been portray by scholars in the field as being a large, dense and permanent settlement of socially heterogeneous individual not engaged in the production of its on food.  A city tends to comprise an inter-related network of economic markets, housing, land, transport and so on or a form of human organization devised over a thousand years as a means of organizing production, communities and other social relations within a densely settled area. One fundamental idea as regards cities is that of specialization of functions among humans who made them up through division of labour and this functional specialization involves the narrowing the range of activities of functions performed by an individual in a given period of time with a view to increasing his skill or dexterity in the performance of these activities.14 This obviously has a net effect of increasing the total goods and services produced by the community within a given period of time.<br/>A number of factors contributed to the growth and subsequent development of cities. One of the prominent factors is the agricultural system which provides a surplus good to support urban population. It also permits labour to be withdrawn from food production and used in production of capital goods. The second factor is the factory system which is a direct consequence of industrial revolution and which has made mass production possible through specialization. Thirdly, increased efficiency of the technology of transport and communication also contributed its quota to urbanization process which stimulates increased trade through access to markets. Industrialization has some relationships or links with urbanization because as the level of industrial development in a country, so does the level of urbanization and as these two related processes increase, so do the characteristics of heterogeneity of population. Though, this is not the case as the fact remains that those cities that existed in different parts of the world before the industrial revolution in Europe and up to this time, are yet affected by industrialization.15 The development of cities in the ancient civilization grew out of small societies through the introduction of irrigation system, metal working, and the production of foods including the internationalization of finance and trade which led to the rise of modern and ultra-modern cities across the world.<br/>           Endnotes<br/>1.    E.

The French who had already abolished slave trade after the French Revolution, although she later re-established it in her Caribbean states in 1803. But by the end of the Napoleonic wars, both the French and the British had purchased a majority of the slaves sold from the ports of Oyo.<br/>The end of European trading in slaves left a need for commerce between Europe and Africa (Yoruba) capitalist may have seen the light over slavery, but they still wanted to exploit the continent new legitimate trade would be encouraged.<br/>Legitimate trade was the trade which replaced the trade in slavery after the abolition in 1807. It came to stay in gradual process i.e because of the necessity of both the European and the Africans. The Europeans wanted raw materials, while the Africans wanted finished goods from the Europeans.<br/>AIMS OF STUDY<br/>This work will critically expatiate the legitimate trade that took place in Yoruba land prior to the 19th century. <br/>METHODOLOGY<br/>    The principle governing this research. The analytical method will be based on relevant materials such as history journal reports, documents, history text books and faculty scholar view. <br/>Contribution to Knowledge    <br/>This is designed to enrich and contribute immensely to the legitimate trade that took place in Yoruba land prior to 19th century. <br/>Chapterization<br/><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>Introduction<br/>Origin of the Yoruba<br/>    The origin of the Yoruba will be discuss in details in these chapter using different accounts available and will be backed up with the work of great scholars who has done a lot on the people of Yoruba. <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Yoruba People prior to Introduction of “Legitimate Trade”  <br/>    Prior to the coming of the European; trade existed in Yoruba land. This chapter will discussed the trade that existed then, the means, ways and the goods which the people traded on and the people which the Yoruba people traded with. This discussion will bring the knowledge on what was on ground before the introduction of legitimate trade.<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Legitimate Trade in Yorubaland - I<br/>    With the abolition of slave trade, there was a shift from illegitimate trade to legitimate trade. The people (European) who use to force the people who they either buy or kidnapped to Europe now wanted to trade on raw materials which they needed in Europe. Since the production has changed from manual to mechanical. These change led to the introduction of legitimate trade these chapter will focus on the origin of legitimate trade in Yoruba land and new goods introduced for trade.<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Legitimate Trade in Yorubaland - II <br/>    With the introduction of legitimate trade which was in a different way compared to the old trade practiced. The character of the various participants changed, for example the Africans who where given goods on first, never showed up to selfish interest or the character of the middlemen was now imposing their role on the people. The character of various participate the means of the trade and other features of legitimate trade will be discussed here. <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Conclusion: Impact and Effects of Legitimate Trade<br/>    Before the exit of the European or before amalgamation of the various ethnic groups in Nigeria, legitimate trade had impact on the people both positively and negatively. All will be fully discussed in this chapter.<br/>Literature Review <br/>    The relationship that emerged between the Yoruba people and the European after the abolition of slave trade was base on trust and it was the origin of legitimate trade, which later changed the history of the people. These relationship which lasted over a long period, took different form and it also has influence on the culture and life pattern of the Yoruba people. But one thing that battle my imagination is that many books have be written about the Yoruba’s concerning their origin, culture life styles political organization among others, but non focus on the legitimate trade. <br/>    Literature exclusively concerning it is virtually available. Those resembling it only talked on the origin and political organization. However, nothing much has been done on the legitimate trade in Yoruba lands hence it is a fertile ground for historian to exploit.<br/>    P.O Olatunbosun, P.O. History of West African, have it that, the moment slave trade was abolished, the European shifted their focus to trade in raw materials. Although, the European came with the intention of putting an end to slavery and bringing the claim superior religion to the people. <br/>Akintoye Stephen, A Short History of the Yoruba people, traced the origin and background of the Yoruba people, he gave various account which has being a question of argument among various scholars. He also gave detail information concerning the disintegration of various Yoruba land. <br/>L.I. Izuakor, Patterns of Pre-colonial exploitation, where he discussed the trade between the local people and foreigners. The pattern and different reaction of the people was pointed out in his work. <br/>    It is hoped that as this work progresses, more relevant materials would come to the researcher way.    <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE: ORIGIN OF THE YORUBA PEOPLE<br/>Introduction    -    -    <br/>Origin of the people     -    -    -    <br/>The Rise of Oyo Empire     -    -    <br/>Government of Oyo Empire    -    -<br/>Conclusion         -    -    -    <br/>Endnotes     -    --    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER TWO: YORUBA PEOPLE PRIOR TO THE INTRODUCTION OF “LEGITIMATE TRADE” <br/>Introduction    -    -    -<br/>Agricultural Produce    -    -    -    <br/>Leather Production    -    -    -<br/>Organization of Market     -    <br/> Currency used    -    <br/>Trade     -    -    -    -<br/>Transportation     -    -    -    -<br/>Slave Trade    -    -    -<br/>Conclusion     -    -    -    -    -<br/>Endnotes         -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER THREE: LEGITIMATE TRADE IN YORUBA LAND I<br/>Origin of Legitimate Trade     -    <br/>Parties involved in the Trade    -    -<br/>Goods Traded on    -    -    <br/>Reasons for the survival of Legitimate Trade    -<br/>Conclusion     -    -    -<br/>Endnotes     -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: LEGITIMATE TRADE IN <br/>YORUBALAND II<br/>Participants     -<br/>Character of the Participants    -    <br/>Change in the Character of Participants    -<br/>Conclusion -    -    -    -<br/>Endnotes     -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Conclusion         -    -    -    -<br/>Bibliography     -    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Origin of the Yorubas<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>    Ile – Ife was believed to be the home to all Yoruba because of her historical position to them. Ile-Ife was believe to be the origin of the Yoruba (place where the world was created) before they expanded and grew so large leading to the finding of new territory like Oyo, Ondo, Owo, Ekiti even Benin and the more younger ones like Ibadan, Abeokuta, Modakeke1.<br/>    Although, there are various account of the origin of the people, but the two which are popularly recognized, well sited and accepted by scholars will be discussed in full i.e both the hermetic and the myth of Yoruba creation. When the Yorubas was founded in Ile-Ife many years ago, they grew up either by conquering their neighbours or in a mutual relationship established their role in new places which led to the expansion and growth of the Yoruba people.<br/>    Even with the growth and expansion of the Yoruba people to different location, there was one thing unique about their political organization. Its all the same every where even if its called different names, but they all practiced their system of government for example every Yoruba land or kingdom has a head which can either be called Kabiyesi (king) or Awujale (Ijebu) and there are also the king makers in all Yoruba land. In discussing the political organization of the Yorubas, Oyo will be used as an example of political situation in Yoruba land and it will be discussed in assumption of Yoruba political system. <br/>Origin of the People <br/>    The Yoruba was one of the largest homogenous groups among Africans2. They inhabit a continuous territory and speak the same language. They are town dwelling people who built kingdoms and empire along before they came into contact with Europeans. Their level of political sophistication and technological advancement is high.<br/>       Although Yoruba kingdom just like other ethnic groups in Nigeria is still subject of controversy. There are various or several version of origin of the popular and quoted by great scholars like Rev. Samuel Johnson Clapperton and many more was the claim that the Yoruba  migrated from the northeastern area of Africa (variously supposed to be Egypt, Yemen ancient meroe and Arabia), and settled in Ile-Ife after a journey which took them centuries. The migration was being embark upon as a result of rift that occurred over religion.<br/>    Another version, which scholars termed myth i.e the claim that the Yoruba land was the centre from which the whole world was created. It tells of a period when the whole earth was covered with water and god sent messengers to go and create farmland out of the Liquid mass. The party that was sent by god to create the world was being led by Obatala (Orisa Nla or Orisa Alase) as leader somewhere on the way, the tradition claimed Obatala got drunk with palm wine and Oduduwa seized the pararciphernalia3 of authority from him and eventually led the delegation to the world. Oke Oromfe in Ife is the site on which these messengers landed, when the party got to the world, it was covered with water, the snail given to them from heaven was turn which sand fell from and the fowl4 made to spread it. These led to the creation of the world by Oduduwa.<br/>    In comparing these two account of origin of the Yoruba, both have one thing in common Oduduwa appeared as a leader who either led the people to their present abode or who has being able to organize the people politically. Following the oral tradition or investigation that the origins of Ife are much older than the Oduduwa period6. Other evidence tend to support this interpretation. If traditions remember the names of such kings as Kutukutu Oba Igbo and  Osangangan Obamakin7, who were much older than Oduduwa fragments of Ikedo,  almost all source of Yoruba history, have been collected and preserved8 and they tend to show that the antecedents of the Yoruba are older than the Oduduwa period.<br/>    Oduduwa after establishing himself at Ile-Ife, he decided to send out his children to go and establish new territory in new places which led to the dispersal of his children. All of them are virtually unanimous, though some gave more details than outers. According to one of them to go and found kingdoms of their own, giving each one a royal symbol9. Before the children left Ile-Ife they all met at Ita Ijero (the place of consultation) where they agreed which way each would go and how they were to maintain future contacts some of the princes went north-westwards and south west wards, some eastwards and settled at Ado, Owo and Benin10. These migration resulted to the foundations of many new kingdoms, through it is probable that some only had a change of rulers11. The ebi system of government which later grew into a concept of societal organization12.<br/>    Ile-Ife was now seen as the father-kingdom and Yoruba national headquarters had a unique type of constitutional and historical growth. Completely surrounded by other Yoruba kingdoms that acknowledged its fatherhood, Ife who had no standing army of its own, fear no attack form any quarter if there will be need to fight war13, other Yoruba territory comes to her and since they all see Ile-Ife as their spiritual home. The other Yoruba town also look up to up to Ile-Ife for spiritual support14, for example every Yoruba king come to Ife to be confirmed king.<br/>The Rise of Oyo<br/>    The position of Oyo was one of the reasons for its rise to power. Its foundation has been attributed in the traditions to Orunmiyan15. The soil around old Oyo was very fertile for farming16 not only that it’s position along the trade root and as a leading commercial centre, south of the Niger, was also an advantage. Trade routes connected Oyo with many important markets in those days. It was at a terminus where products of the guinea forest were sold to the people of the savanna in addition to being at the savanna terms of the trans-Saharan trade17, Oyo also traded with the Europeans at the coast through Porto Novo. Its situation at the Savanna belt made expansion easy. Iron ore was also available.<br/>    It was not the mere existence of geographical advantage that contributed to the rise and growth of Oyo. The people made very good use of the geographical advantages. The trade routes were protected. The industrial skill of the people also enhanced the growth of the empire, the skill in weaving, dyeing, carving and decorated arts attracted traders from far and wide. The Oyo also had knowledge of iron-working made and used good tools and weapons.<br/>    During the reign of Alafin Oronipoto, horses were first imported into Oyo. This formed the basis of the political power of Oyo, Oyo had a large, cavalry which made Oyo the scourge and terror of most of her neighbours and with which it fought wars of expansion. The leadership and valour of Oyo warriors also contributed to the military effectiveness. The Are-Onakaka-nfo was the commander-in-chief of the army. By tradition, he lived in a frontier18 province of strategic importance to prevent foreign attack on the capital. This also prevented him from interfering in the central politics19.<br/>Government of Oyo Empire<br/>    The Alafin was the Supreme head of the empire20. Ife was responsible for peace order and good government. Although constitutionally he was the final authority, he was not in the centre of power, politics and influence because he was a divine emperor who had to honour many taboos which secluded him from his subjects.<br/>    His duties included setting of disputes between territories in his empire and between rulers and their subjects. As the fountain of honour and patronage, he distributes honours, awarded titles and appointed Provincial governors, military officers (by merits), and confirmed appointments of rulers of conquered territories. It was also his duty to protect vassal states from external attacks.<br/>Oyo Mesi: This was the executive council of state made up of seven members who were king-makers. They consulted Ifa oracles before appointing a new Alafin so that the new Alafin would be the choice of the gods. The Oyo Mesi2 was the body that took important decision for the empire, formulated policies and gave advice to the Alafin. <br/>Bashorun: Bashorun was the head of the Oyo Mesi and was the prime minister. He was in the centre of politics, power and influence. In addition to the above, certain other factors enhanced the position of the Bashorun, these are decision of the Oyo Mesi and the Ogboni. The decision of the Oyo Mesi were communicated to the Alafin through the Bashroun. Although the Oyo Mesi and the Ogboni could not depose an Alafin but they could ask the Basarun to present an empty calabash (a calabash in which parrots egg are kept) to the Alafin. Then the Bashorun would pass a sentence of rejection on the Alafin in the words.<br/>            “The gods reject you,<br/>            The people reject you, and<br/>            The earth rejects you”.<br/>    Tradition requested such Alafin to commit suicide by taking poison (many Alafins honoured this tradition but Oyo chronicles contain instances when few Alafin kicked against it). The Bashorun was also in charge of the religious divination held annually to determine whether or not the Alafin retained the favour and approval of the gods. In these ways, the Oyo Mesi, the  Bashorun and the Ogboni acted as limitations or checks and balances on the power of the Alafin.<br/>The Aremo: Aremo was the eldest son of the Alafin. Until early in the 19th century,  he was barred from succession22 to the throne he was with other personal officials of the Alafin had to die with the Alafin. This was to prevent the Aremo from displacing their father from the throne and secondly, to give freehand to a new Alafin to select new officials from among those who were loyal to him. <br/>The Ogboni Society: Ogboni Society was another important factor in the government of Oyo. It was a secret society which owned its political importance to the following factors first, the Oyo Mesi could not take important decisions without the support of the Ogboni society. Secondly, the leaders of society had right of free access to the Alafin. Thirdly the voice of the Ogboni was either respected or feared and was regarded as the popular opinion backed up by authority of the religion. In this way, the Ogboni society acted as limitation on the powers of the Alafin.<br/>Organization of Army: The imperial army was strong enough to back up the imperial structure not only because it possessed a strong Calvary but also for its good organization and high standard of discipline. The Are-Ona-Kankanfo was the supreme commander and the head of the Army. By tradition, he lived in a frontier town of strategic importance to prevent foreign attack on the empire. The second reason for his living far away from the capital was to prevent him from interfering in central politics. <br/>    The are-Ona-Kankanfo and other war chiefs were appointed on merit and their imposition were not hereditary. The war chiefs constituted a society known as the Eso Commanders who won victories were honored. Publicly but if the Are-Ona-Kankanfo or any other commander was defeated in battle or die. The Are-Ona-Kankanfo mustn’t flee from the battle field. If he was defeated, he would either commit suicide or go to found a new state. This prevented the Are-Ona-Kankanfo and other generals from remaining in office when their military ability was in a decline. This is another instance where the constitution placed very great importance on the success of the empire: any important functional be he the Alafin or the Are-Ona Kankanfo who failed must die so that the empire might survive.<br/>Organization of Trade: Trade was well organized. There were taxes of different types which provided sufficient revenue for the empire. The trade routes were protected, Oyo benefited greatly in both the trans-Saharan trade and trans-Atlantic trade. It controlled the southern extension of the trans-Saharan trade and later controlled the interior trade with the last through Porto-Novo. <br/>Provincial and Local Government: The provinces and the conquered territories were given a great measure of local autonomy in their internal affairs. They were allowed to select their own chiefs from among their traditional ruling houses, subject to confirmation by the Alafin, with or without full aid against a troublesome neighbor vassal states and provinces must send tributes regularly to Oyo and could be asked to collect special festival taxes on behalf of the Alafin thirdly, they must pay homage and demonstrate their festivals.<br/>The Ilari: The Ilari were imperial (royal) agencies who represented the imperial interest in all the government of the provinces and the vassal states, (most of them were eunuks). They acted as a link between the central and local governments and ensure adequate central supervision in a local government system that enjoyed adequate survive.<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>    The origin of the Yorubas either through migration to conquered the people they met at Ife, before they were able to organize themselves into a state and further expansion which led to the establishment of new territory or the claim that Yoruba was the saddle of world creation. But one thing was certain, which was the fact that Oduduwa was the leader of the Yorubas who had led them to their settlement at Ile-Ife before they were able to further grow into different location. <br/>    Because of the position of Ile-Ife as the centre of emergence of the Yoruba people and the very place where all other Yoruba state claimed to have emerged from. They now see Ile-Ife as their home and which, no Yoruba state must attack and also will come to her need in times of war to provide army which fight her wars, Ile-Ife was also the spiritual head of all Yoruba kingdom, every Oba comes to Ife for prayer and confirmation before ascending the throne.<br/>    Oyo was one of the early state which became powerful and very big after the migration of the children of Oduduwa from Ile-Ife to found their own state. Since all Yoruba state emerged form the same origin, they all adopted the same pattern of political system with slight difference either with name recognition or limitation of duty. For example most Yoruba kingdom in various places has an Alafin (king), Aremo (first son of the Oba), Iya-Oloja, Organixation of Army, secret society who protect the state spiritually, then the chiefs who head the provincial and local government. <br/> Endnotes<br/>1.    I.T.

This phenomenon is due largely to her contact with neighboring Kingdoms and communities such as the Benin Kingdom, the Ibo’s, Ibodo Community, the Ishans and other communities; Another factor that explains the growth and development of Idumuje-Ugboko and perhaps the most important was her contact with the Europeans who came in the early years of the 20th century to convert the people of Ugboko to Christianity.1<br/>    IDUMUJE-UGBOKO is a compound word. IDUMUJE means a 'community’ and Ugboko means ‘thick forest’. This initial forest was turned to a farm settlement by inhabitants of a neighboring community- “IDUMUJE UNOR” – According Ovibo Chiazor “As farmers moved to Ugboko to farm, they sometimes, slept there, thus providing farmers the opportunity to hunt at night2. This process led to the1 evolution of Idumuje-Ugboko into a community of its own as distinct from Idumuje-Unor”. <br/>Ugboko was attractive to her early settlers due to her extensive fertile land for farming and hunting purposes, as well as spring water for domestic purposes.3<br/>There is a controversy regarding the dating of the establishment of the community. Some records state the year 1678 as the most probable year while other sources puts it at the latter part of the 18th century, with the balance in the favor of the former.4<br/>          Before the coming of the Europeans (1902) and even till date Idumuje had and still has several shrines which are believed to be the abodes of the gods and goddesses of the land. Some of these shrines includes: Oli Okoli (god of healing and child delivery), OHAI (god of healing), Idigwu (god of iron), Iyoo (god of the stream), OGOZA (god of fertility) and so on.5. These gods and other gods not mentioned are seen as the intermediaries between the people and the Almighty God. This is because it is believed that the Almighty God is too big and awesome for them to approach on their own.<br/>    The advent of African Christian missionaries (1899) and white Christian missionaries in 1902, brought far reaching changes to Idumuje-Ugboko community: Christianity, Bible education, Churches, western medicine and monogamy were introduced. Furthermore, some indigenes of Idumuje-Ugboko left the community to other communities in order to spread the gospel of Christianity.6.<br/>     Be that as it may, there were resistances to the incursion of the white man and the new religion-“Christianity’’. This resistance manifested itself in a series of uprising in 1902 and in 1909 which became known as the Ekwumekwu conflict. However, Christianity was largely successful in penetrating Ugboko.7.<br/>    In the kingdom of Idumuje-Ugboko, the ’Obi’ is at the apex of the social strata. The Obi presides over all meetings with palace chiefs and festivals.  Furthermore, there is the general assembly which makes pronouncements on policies and development programs. Next in line, is the council of chiefs which in turn is followed by the obi-in-council, which is similar to the “state council” of the Bini Kingdom. Further still are the Ndi Onotu’s (titled chiefs led by the Iyase); Ikpala (old men); Ndi Iche (those exempted from the labour force); the Ikolo (labour force of the community)and the youths.8.<br/>     It has been noted earlier on, that Idumuje-Ugboko has experienced developments in terms of infrastructure. For instance: Ugboko now has schools, an ultramodern market, a post office, a hospital, a community bank, modern housing, pipe borne water, electricity and so on. Nevertheless, Ugboko still has some obstructions to further growth and development. These include: conservatism, absence of co-operation, criminality of youths, migration of talented men and women, land disputes and so on.9.<br/>    Hence this research work is designed to examine in detail, how, why and in what sense Idumuje-Ugboko has developed qualitatively and quantitatively from 1900-1960, socially, politically, economically and in terms of infrastructure. This work, also examines in detail, the origin of the community and the challenges to further growth and development of the polity.<br/>1.2    Aim and Objectives of Study<br/>         This study examines the growth and development of Idumuje-Ugboko Community in Delta-state, 1900-1960. Specifically it seeks to:<br/>1] To examine the origin of Idumuje-Ugboko.<br/>2] To discuss the growth and development of Idumuje-Ugboko.<br/>3] To expatiate on the impact of Western Missionaries on Idumuje-Ugboko Community. <br/>1.3    Scope of study<br/>This study covers the period: 1900-1960-from the arrival of the Christian missionaries to Idumuje-Ugboko, till the end of colonial rule in Nigeria. This research work seeks to bring to light all the indices of growth and development of Idumuje-Ugboko community in Delta state, Nigeria from 1900-1960.<br/>1.4    Methodology<br/>The methodology of research of this project work will be analytical. Both primary and secondary source materials will be used.<br/>1.4.1    Primary Sources <br/>The primary sources of this research work will be oral interviews with resource persons and authorities in Idumuje-Ugboko. <br/>1.4.2    Secondary Sources<br/>The secondary sources of this research work will be published books.<br/>1.5. Definition of Terms    <br/>    It is perhaps not out of place, to examine some of the key terms which will be used throughout this work. The terms referred to, here, are: “Growth”, “Development” and “Community”.  <br/>      1.5.1                Growth<br/>    According to Rich Goldstein: “Growth is the act, process, or manner of growing; developing or gradual increase”.10. Goldstein, meant that “growth” is simply “a process of increasing positive changes. Furthermore, he describes “growth” as simply being “a development, from a simpler stage to a more complex stage”.<br/>    Similarly, Wikipedia, defines “growth” as a positive change in size or maturation, often over a period of time”. Furthermore, “growth can occur as a process towards fulfillment, or can perpetuate endlessly”.11.<br/>    According to the Merriam – Webster Dictionary: “Growth is a stage in the process of growing”. Also, “growth can be defined as an increase or expansion in size”.12.<br/>    The “free dictionary”, defines “growth”, as a “development from a lower or simple form, to a higher or more complex form”. Thus, “growth” is seen as an increase in size, number, value and strength.13.<br/>    Indeed, there are varying definitions of growth. Nevertheless, one key-point can be deduced from the above definitions of growth.- “increase” – thus, growth simply means an increase in the status of a phenomena. It is pertinent to note that while some objects (such as an animal) have limited growth, other phenomenon’s (such as a polity) have unlimited growth. <br/>Since the concept of “Growth” has been satisfactorily examined, we shall now confine ourselves to the concept of “Development”. <br/>1.5.2    Development? <br/>According to the “Business Dictionary”, “Development” is “the systematic use of scientific and technical knowledge to meet specific objectives or requirements. Furthermore, “development” is the process of economic and social transformation that is based on complex cultural and environmental factors and their interactions”.14.<br/>Similarly, the “Merriam – Webster dictionary” defines “development” as “the act, process, or result of development”. Also, “Development is the state of being developed”.15. <br/>Furthermore, the “Cambridge Dictionary”, defines “Development” as the “process in which someone or something grows or changes and becomes more advanced; it is also defined as the process of developing something new”.16.<br/>Also the “Your Dictionary”, defines “Development” as the process of growth. It also defines “Development” as “the act of developing and advancing, or the state of being developed. Still, “Your dictionary”, defines “Development” as the application of techniques or technology to the production of new goods or services”.17.<br/>Nevertheless, the “Longman Dictionary” defines “Development” as the “process of gradually becoming bigger, better, stronger, or more advanced”.18. <br/>Also, there is a form of development, called “sustainable development”: “Sustainable development” is “a form of development that is able to continue without damaging the environment”.19.<br/>According to Shelly Shah: “Development” refers to “improvements in ways of managing an area’s natural and human resources, in order to improve lives and create wealth”.20.<br/>Dudley seers, while elaborating on the meaning of “development” suggests that it should be a universally acceptable aim of development to make for conditions that lead to a realization of the potentials of human personality.21. Seers outlined several conditions that can make for the achievement of this aim: <br/>(i)    The capacity to obtain physical necessities, particularly food,<br/>(ii)    Equality; and <br/>(iii)    Literacy.22.<br/>    Finally, on the concept of development, “Amartya Sen”, makes it clear that “development is not simply an increase in income; rather, it encompasses other aspects: such as Health, education and living standards.23. Thus, “Sen” is of the view that “development must be judged by its impacts on the people and not only by changes in their incomes.<br/>    Thus, development carries a connotation of lasting change, in that it conveys something about the capacity of economic, political and social systems to provide the circumstances for human well-being on a sustainable long term basis. This leads us to the concept of a “community”. <br/>1.5.3               Community?<br/>    According to the “Merriam-Webster Dictionary”: “A community is a group of people with a common characteristic or interest living together within a larger society; it is a group linked by a common policy; it is a body of persons having a common history or common social, economic and political interests; it is a unified body of interacting individuals living in a particularly area.24.<br/>    Similarly, the “OXFORD DICTIONARY”, defines a “Community” as a social group of any size whose members reside in a specific locality, share government and often have a common cultural and historical heritage; it is also a social, religious, occupational or other group sharing common characteristics or interests and perceiving itself as distinct in some respect from the larger society within which it exists.25. <br/>According to Wikipedia, the word “Community” is derived from the old French word -“Comunete” – which comes from the Latin word - “Communitas”, - which means “public spirit”. Thus, A “Community” is “a small or large social unit (a group of people) who have something in common, such as norms, religion, values, or identity. “Often – but not always – communities shares a sense of place that is situated in a given  geographical area”.26.<br/>The English Oxford Living Dictionaries defines a “Community” as “a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common”; it is “a group of people of people living together and practicing common ownership”; “it is also considered as a particular area or place considered together with its inhabitants”; still, a community is described as “a body of nations or states, unified by common interests; and lastly, a “community is composed of the people in a district or country considered collectively especially in the context of social values and responsibilities.27.<br/>Similarly, the “Business Dictionary” defines a community as a “self-organized network of people with a common agenda, cause, or interest, who collaborate by sharing ideas, information and other resources.28.<br/>Furthermore, the ‘Cambridge Dictionary” defines a community as a people living in one particularly area, or people who are considered as a unit because of their common interests, social group or nationality.29.<br/>It is helpful to note that a “Community” can also be seen as a value (Frazer 2000: pp. 76).30. As such, it may well be used to bring together a number of elements: for example, solidarity, commitment, mutuality and trust. <br/>From the above definitions, it is clear that “community” is a “group of people living together in the same place of having a particular characteristic in common; it is further revealed that “it is the condition of sharing or having certain attitudes and interests in common”.<br/>1.6    Literature Review<br/>    Chief professor Somayina Nwoko writes: ‘’when the western missionaries arrived Ugboko in1902, the reigning king-obi Omorhusi, welcomed them warmly, erected a mission house for them and gave his son the crown prince to them to train. Nevertheless, the earliest church missionaries met a culture and custom that thrived in secrecy, where the road to development was resented, where white people were seen as people who could desecrate traditional homes and shrines and opponents of killing of twins. This resentment led to the Ekwumekwu war in which great destruction took place at Idumuje. Houses, the church of the church missionary society and school were burnt down.14. <br/>This account, shows that the early white missionaries who came to bring growth to the community, faced great animosity from the indigenes of Ugboko. It also shows that one major factor which influenced the growth and development of idumuje-Ugboko, was the arrival of the Christian missionaries in 1902. However, it also displays the fact that the natives of Ugboko were opposed to the missionaries, as wel as the new ideas, which they (white Christian missionaries came with). Although, this account tells us that the church of the C.M.S., the Houses of the missionaries, as well as the school was burnt down, as a result of the people’s surprising against the Christians, the fact that for the first time, Ugboko had a school and a Christian church, was in itself, an expression of growth and development.<br/>    According to Oyibo Chiazor: open violent conflict between tradition and Christianity has died down. What now exists are taboos, inquisitions, marriage ceremonial requirements, conscription to general street maintenance labour, general rejection of ceremonial dance and rejection of traditional titles. Through this means, tradition holds Christianity between her thighs and Christianity tries to rear its head.15. <br/>The above exposition shows that while there is no full scale war between progress and conservatism, a form of antagonism is ongoing. This account, also agrees with the fact that Christianity was a major factor that influenced the growth and development of Idumuje-Ugboko, from 1900-1960. It also makes it clear that the progressive tendencies of Christianity was inimical to the traditions of the land (Ugboko) and thus, spured negative reactions from traditional elements. Nevertheless, this account neglects other factors that influenced the growth and development of Idumuje-Ugboko from 1900-1960, such as: the people’s response to their environmental circumstances; inter-group relations and the forces of modernization, resulting from colonial rule.<br/>    In related literature, Chijioke Okolie states: Idumuje-Ugboko is a conservative society; more so, there is the phenomenon of suppression of healthy assistance in Idumuje-Ugboko regarding infrastructural developments; furthermore, our youths are metamorphosing into criminals; still, talented men and women make themselves unavailable for consultative purposes regarding town issues. In addition, the spirit of cohesion is not very strong.16.<br/>Obviously, Chijioke neglected all the indices of development in Ugboko, (1900-1960) such as the establishment of a church, a school, a community Bank, a post office, and a dispensary. In short in his work, he focused only on the conservative aspect of Ugboko community. He also neglected the various factors that influence the growth and development of Idumuje-ugboko community from 1900-1960s.<br/>    These reviews show that while Idumuje-Ugboko has grown since 1900 both socially, politically and in terms of infrastructure, the polity still has a long way to go. This is due to several limiting factors, some of which have been mentioned.<br/>1.7    Chapterization<br/>Chapter one: Introduction / Background to the study<br/>    This chapter is the general introduction to the essay.

It cannot be completely separated from inter-relationships that exist among individuals and communities. Conflicts is therefore a natural occurrence among human beings whenever people gather together in the family or social and political groups there are bound to be conflicts which according to Alagoe, could lead to “struggle of various level of intensity, extending to violent combat which could lead to the destruction of the group”.1<br/>    Pre- colonial African societies are reputed to hold secrets of peacemaking and conflict resolution embedded in their customs and traditions before the disruptive activities bough about by colonization. The pre-colonial Benin societies had well defined social political institutions that helped to facilitate conflict resolution. Like every great nation or society of such a state, is usually not an easy birth. The Brith of the Benin kingdom which become one of the great empires of the world at her peak of success had a humble beginning with Igodo who become the father as it were and the first Ogiso, king of Benin Kingdom. Igodo died after a long reign and was succeeded by his grandson Erehis reign was peaceful disposition as the king of his people, he acquired the appellation, “A Wua ne Ere” which literally means that “quarrelling is forbidden by the Ere” and which carried during his reign the force of law and sanction it can therefore be rightly claimed that the Benin kingdom was founded on peace and accord, born of an idea, an idea that struck the people like a bolt of lightning in establishing the monarchy to search for truth, order, peace and greatness.2<br/>    It is on this ground that the pre-colonial Benin Empire will be examined bringing to light the causes and types of the conflicts they experiences, the management and resolution of such conflict and the impacts of such conflicts in the empire.<br/>Aims and Objectives<br/>    The main objectives of this work is to bring to the measures taken by traditional rulers in precolonial Benin to ensure the management of conflict in the empire. The specific aims of this project are<br/>1.    To give an historical background of Benin Empire<br/>2.    To give conceptual definition of conflict and conflict resolution<br/>3.    Unveil the types and causes of conflict that existed in the pre- colonial Benin Empire<br/>4.    Analyse the modes of resolution of these conflicts<br/>5.    Identify the impacts of such conflicts on the pre-colonial Benin Empire.<br/>Scope and Limitation of Study<br/>    This study focuses on the causes of conflicts in pre- colonial Benin and the modes of resolving these conflicts. The organization structures that were put in place to prevent the re- occurrence of such conflicts and penalties that were accorded people who made it a custom to flaunt the structure. This work therefore focuses on how conflict was managed in the pre-colonial Benin Empire.<br/>Significance of Study<br/>    The benefits of this study will include both intellectual and practical. This research will reflect findings which will be of great help to other researchers on the mode of resolving conflict in pre-colonial Benin. Also it will be very significant as an intellectual work as most works in this field regarding the benin empire are only related to the historical background and institution. Works have also been done on impact of Europeans on Benin culture. This work takes a different approach to reveal the causes of conflicts and their mode of resolution in pre colonial Benin.  <br/>Methodology<br/>    In course of research for this work, relevant data and information will be obtained from two main sources<br/>Primary Sources<br/>    Primary Sources that will be utilised in the course of the research include, Letter and Interviews.<br/>Secondary Sources <br/>    A systematic analysis will be derived from secondary sourced materials which included textbook, journals and Articles. Information obtained from these sources will help to guide and supplement materials from primary sources.<br/>Chapterization<br/>    This work is divided into five chapter as follow:<br/>Chapter One: Introduction and Background of Study<br/>    This chapter provides the summary of the project work showing the aims and objectives of this research work<br/>Chapter Two: Definition of Conflict and Conflict Resolution<br/>    This chapter examines the concepts of conflicts and conflicts resolution. It further talks a look into the history of the Benin people showing the origin of the people and their dynasty.<br/>Chapter Three: Types and Causes of Conflict in Pre- colonial Benin and Resolution<br/>    This chapter examine the types of conflicts that were present in pre-colonial Benin Empire. It further reveals the causes of these conflicts and the means of resolving such conflicts. The chapter also examines the machines and structures put in place to settle disputes that arose between members of the society revealing also the punishments accorded to offenders and law breakers.<br/>Chapter Four: Impact of Conflict in Pre- Colonial Benin<br/>    This chapter examines the impacts that conflicts situations had on the pre-colonial Benin Empire. These impacts were both positive and negative in nature.<br/>Chapter Five: Conclusion<br/>    This is the concluding part of this work.it presents an ramification of all that has been examined in the project.<br/>Literature Review<br/>    Pre-colonial Benin in his time experience a huge expansion incorporating small groups into it. In the process it had its moment of peace and conflict. In considering the mode of conflict resolution in pre-colonial Benin it is pertinent to first study the history of the people. Some literature to review include: P.A Igbafe in Benin in the pre-colonial Era.3  In this book the writer renders the origin of Benin in two aspect. The firist is the Origin of the People, while the other is the origin of the ruling dynasty. He furthered emphasised that a great deal of confusion has been introduced into the study of Benin history by the mixture of this two aspect by some writers. A.F C Ryder in his book Benin and the Europeans.4 in this book the writer also gave a brief history of the Benin people asserting that the origins of the kingdom are lost in myth and antiquity from which survives only a traditions of migration from the east that is common to many West African people.<br/>    Other works that are relevant in this  aspect are Chief S.O.U Igbe in his book From Birth to Death: A Benin Cultural Voyage5. He identify three period in the history of Benin kingdom further asserting that for the Benin as a people, the king and the people were the product of the period. The first period were the great period of the Ogiso from 900AD, the rulers were known as Obas although they ruled as kings with Igodo as the first if the 31 Ogiso. The second period of the Benin kingdom began with Oba Eweka 1 (1200AD) while the third period was from 1914 when Oba Eweka 11 came to the throne with death of Oba Ovoramwen. There was however a controversy in these work as to where to credit the origin of the Benin people. It was P.A Igbafe who clarified that the confusion in historical origin came up in the mix up of the two aspect of the Benin origin which are the origin of the people and the origin of the ruling dynasty. <br/>    The next work to be rewieved is Felix Ejukomenu Oghi “Conflict Resolution in Pre-colonial Benin”.6 in this article the writer brought to light the major causes of conflict in pre-colonial Benin which were activities of witchcraft, adultery, theft, inheritances, succession dispute and land dispute.  Aworom Annang “Conflict and Conflict Resolution in Pre-colonial Africa.7 in this article the writer gave the general causes of conflict in pre-colonial Africa. This work lacks the specific information needed for my research as pertaining to conflict resolutions in pre-colonial Benin.<br/>    More so, the literature of Francisca Akunna Ezenewoko and Joseph Inegbenebho Osagie “Conflict and Conflict Resolution in pre-colonial Ibo Society of Nigeria”.8 was very helpful in discovering the mechanism of conflicts resolution in pre-colonial Nigeria, it reviewed the principle of Ubuntu a concept that demonstrate the fact that Africa had over the years developed and tested varied method of conflict resolution. The lapses of this work was the constraints of their research to the Ibo society of Nigeria.<br/>    Finally, other method of conflict resolution in precolonial Benin were vested in the judicial system as contained in Phiph Aigbona Igbafe Benin under British Administration.9 This judicial system existed at the village level and quarter’s levels. At the quarter’s level, elders tried dispute between parties living in their quarters while the village head and his council exercise judicial as well as executivepower at the village level. Of all the literatures used this book was the most helpful in the course of my research.<br/>Endnotes<br/>1.    Francisca A Ezenwoka, Joseph I.

The Isoko region which is in the tropical rain forest area of Niger Delta, experiences high rainfall and high humidity, located entirely within the mangrove and fresh water areas of the zone rely heavily on fishing and food crop farming as the major occupation.1 The Isokos are a unique and delightful people, a distinct ethnic group made of seventeen clans namely:<br/>Aviara<br/>Ellu<br/>Emede<br/>Emevor<br/>Enive/okpolo<br/>Erowha/Umeh<br/>Igbide<br/>Irri<br/>Iyede<br/>Ofagbe<br/>Oleh<br/>Olomoro<br/>Okpe<br/>Owhe<br/>Oyede<br/>Ozoro<br/>Uzere<br/>According to a census conducted in 1999,isoko are a total of about 500,000 people.<br/>The Isoko farming population is formed by a large population of women. The main economic activity is food crop farming and the staple food crops includes cassava and yams.3 There is also the widespread production of palm oil and palm kernels.4 The Isoko women engage in trade of foods crops for cash to meet other basic household needs.5 On market days, it is common to see Isoko women peddling their assorted goods around neighbouring villages.6 <br/>The Isoko people never found a single social or political unit; local communities remain autonomous.7 Both men and women are grouped into age grades, each with particular responsibility.8 The duties of the women’s grades include the ritual surrounding fertility and childbirth and control of the market. Young boys perform single communal tasks; adult men do major community work and are the fighting and the executive unit of the village; older men form the nucleus of the village council.9 Membership in certain title organization is available on payment of fees and is an important source of political authority.10 <br/>Parents perceptions of the benefits of male and female influenced their preferences due to gender discrimination. The Isoko society basically is a patriarchal and patrilineal system characterized by the dominance of men virtually in all spheres of life. Women in traditional Isoko society were expected to be “sub-servant” to their husbands.11 Men’s views on family matters and production took the upper hand over that of women.12 The social norms which supported these gender relations were culturally transmitted from one generation to another through the process of socialization.13 From childhood a girl internalizes these social norms, including those that defined women’s status as sub-ordinate to those of men. Female autonomy was virtually non-existent.14<br/><br/><br/>Aim and Objectives of the Study<br/>The aim and objectives of the study include:<br/>i.    To examine the origin of the political structure of the Isoko people<br/>ii.    To also examine the roles played by women in the political development of the Isoko society<br/>iii.    To assess how the roles of the women affected the political organization of the Isoko people<br/>iv.    To examine the events that led to the changing role of women in the polity of the Isoko society.<br/>v.    To examine how the political growth of the Isoko society affected their organization; socio-economic and religious organization.<br/>vi.    To examine the general overview of the political, social, economic and religious organization of the Isoko society.<br/>Scope of the Study<br/>The study covers the whole of the Isoko society from the time of origin till the end of the pre-colonial period. In this work, the development of the political structure organization of the Isoko society is addressed. To place the work in proper perspective, it commences with the origin of the Isoko society, the origin of the political sstructure/organization of the Isoko society in the pre-colonial period and also the economic development of the Isoko people within the period. This enables us to examine the changing roles of women in the polity of the Isoko society within the stipulated period. The study examines the impact of the changing roles of women in the polity of the Isoko society. The study starts with the tradition of origin of the Isoko society and then to the overall organization (socio-economic, political and religious) of the Isoko society and laying analysis on the roles played by women in the development or underdevelopment of the Isoko society.<br/>Methodology <br/>In writing the essay a number of works have been consulted which range from primary sources to secondary sources. A good number of past essays, journal articles, newspapers and textbooks were consulted. The bulk of these works depends mostly on oral interview local tradition. Also contacted is the Ozoro and Emede community of the Isoko society, and journals by better life programme an arm of the local government. This publication, however, gives attention to the challenges of women in influencing the polity of the Isoko society and also the various roles played by women that led to the various organization of the Isoko people. It also looks at the segregation and discrimination faced by women of the Isoko society and how their reactions affected the course of the organisastion of the Isoko society.<br/>Literature Review <br/>Various people have appreciated the roles women play in the economy and have attempted to find out about its impacts whether positive or negative, its cultural perceptions through researches. It is for this purpose the present study had purpose the present study had undertaken a review of the relevant literature on the changing role of women in the polity of Isoko people and Nigeria at large. It would be of need to seek to understand the current status of women in Nigeria, using the Isoko society as a point of reference. Books consulted are not limited to works on economic development, social perceptions and gender, discrimination but emphasis also placed on books written by scholars on the segregation of women from education and the subordination of women to men.<br/>Olufemi Ekundare’s An Economic History of Nigeria’s helps to buttress the gender segregation in the apportioning of duties in the Isoko society, stating wholly the duties of the Isoko women been primarily child bearing and control of market activities while the men were basically in charge of the overall welfare of the society. It is important to note that politically in the Isoko society women were seen as weaklings and hence, the less responsibility granted them in the political set up of the Isoko society.<br/>Jessa Omokinioue Morrison (nr) expatiates on the irrelevance of the women folks in the political organization of the Isoko people” in the journal of Statistical Analysis, 16 where he further illustrates the gender value of both the men and women. Sexes of the Isoko xxxxx. The women of the Isoko society are seen as another acquired additional property of the man and as that does not allow the women any extended privileges besides producing and taking care of the men’s children and marketing the farm produce of the family and hence, the women are regarded as “sub-servants” to the men,<br/>Also relevant is K.O. Dike’s book titled Trade and Political in the Niger Delta17. The book also helps in revealing the origin and system of trade and politics in the Niger Delta in relation to the Isoko people. The book expresses the low profile roles given to women in the political organization of the Isoko people. the book expresses the low profile roles given to women in the political organization of the Isoko society where women were not allowed to partake in the political formation or participation of the Isoko peope; been that they are under their various spouses (ie. The men and so should allow their husbands oversee all affairs of the family both internally and externally.<br/>Dike, made obvious observations about the role of women in the commercial sector of the Isoko people, referring to women as marketers of the land. The further states that it is in one of the primary duties of the women to market the farm produce of the family and make gains that would hence, assist the family’s welfare.  It was in the economic organization of Isoko people that the women were more noticed and seen playing leading roles.<br/>Reginald Mba in his article, “women as economy pillars of Niger Delta”, provides information on the growth of the economy of Niger Delta in relation to the Isoko society. In his article, he praised the women for the economic development and organisation of the Isoko society and Niger Delta been that they are the primary figures when it comes to the trading aspect of the Isoko society. The position of women in Isoko society can hardly be described powerless. Women here constitute the nearest thing to any idea of a civil society, removed from the main-stream of the male dominated political establishment. It confers immense power on them, and they have done arexxx deeds with it. In 1927-1928, they threw the whole region into pandemonium and made life difficult for the colonial administration. The association of woman has been known to curse kings on their throne. It has compelled kings to trek great distances. There is no political authority in the area however powerful he may be that does not deal continuously with issues that affect women as a body.<br/>The Isoko society did not allow women to be famous for great works of art, which is not the same as saying that they do not know about arts and crafts. For probably ecological reasons, however, certain crafts and skills such as iron smelting, bronze works, the manufacture glass beads, the terra cotta tradition, the textile industry, etc, are generally absent. Of course cloth weaving had trived in the Aboh area and had spread subsequently to parts of Isoko and Urbhobo  areas; but it had hardly established itself before cloths of European manufacturers stultified the industry. It is however in the domains of canoe making, salt production, ceramics, and the technological basis of the one palm complex of industries that the Ijaw, the Itsekiri, Urhobo and Isoko have proved their best skills.<br/>From the foregoing, it is clear that many scholastic works on the segregation of women folks in the Niger Delta region, economic importance of women in relation to the Isoko society and the general roles of women in the society-economic, religious and political organization of Isoko society and Niger Delta at large have given different views on the subject of discuss but none has really thrown enough light on the changing roles of women in the polity of the Isoko people. hence, this study is justified because it looks at the changing roles of women in the polity of the Isoko people from an angle no one has research intensely into, and also trying to relate the roles of women as at the time of colonial role to the present day administration.<br/>There would therefore, be more concentration on the evolution of the changing roles of women in the separate organization sector of the Isoko society and how it affected the development or underdevelopment of the Isoko society and Niger Delta region at large. <br/> CHAPTERIZATION <br/>1.    Chapter one will deal with aims and objectives of the study, the scope of the study, the methodology and the literature review.<br/>2.    Chapter two will deal with the emergence and background of Isoko prior to colonialism.<br/>3.    Chapter three which is centered on historical development, deals with the area of agriculture, deals with the areas of agriculture, cultural model style of dressing in Isoko and marriage tradition in Isoko, traditional religion in Isoko and the Isoko traditions of hospitality to non indigenes<br/>4.    Chapter four will examine the role of women in the polity of Isoko and challenges, social and economic and political impacts.<br/>5.    Chapter five which is the concluding part of the work summarizes it <br/>Endnotes<br/>1.    A.D.

The Isoko people inhabit the area enclosed, roughly by longitude 60o5 and 6o25 east ad latitude 5o15 and 5o40 north in Delta state.2 The Isoko’s had various complex cultures and traditions which had been passed on from generation to generation, seen as the cultural attribute of the people. Nevertheless, the advent of Christianity brought an imminent change which reformed the belief system, cultural, structural and traditional aspect of the people to a large extent. <br/>    The Isoko’s had a complex traditional institution built up by various belief system in each clan.3 Over the years, the weakness of African culture has thus enabled Christianity to wax strong in the social African setting. One of the aims of this study is therefore to examine the impacts of Christianity. In Isokoland using Oyede clan as a case study, showing how Christianity reformed some of her obnoxious culture which glorified some certain customs and traditions that are not worth mentioning. <br/>    Over the years, this long aged culture and beliefs system had become the cultural identity of the Isoko’s which had been passed on from generations, not until the advent of Christianity in the early decades of the 20th century.5 Christianity brought a lasting impact in the social cultural and religious life of the Isoko people, as Christianity replaced the idolatry form of worship. Although, some still practice Christianity alongside with traditional worship. Today the Isoko people are reckoned with Christianity as the major religion in Isokoland which began to gain foothold from the mid 20th century.6<br/>    However, on the account of the advent of Christianity in Isokoland, it should be noted that the Isoko’s had no direct contact with the Early missionaries. At this same time, their neighbors; Agbor, Ijaw, Kwale and Urhobo had already established contact relations with the Early missionaries  during the early decades of the 20th century. It was through trading contact with the Ijaws in Patani,that the Early missionaries discovered that, the Isoko Traders came from another region. Thus, these missionaries  were determined to penetrate into Isokoland and propagate Christianity in this new found region. This led to the introduction of Christianity into Isokoland in the early part of the 20th century through trading contact.7<br/>Aim and Objectives<br/>    Basically, the aim of this study is to examine the impact of Christianity in Isokoland “a case study of Oyede clan”. <br/>    Some of these objectives are as follows: <br/>To examine Isoko community its socio-cultural organization as well as religious institutions. <br/>To illustrate the dynamics of Oyede clan as well as various institutions that exists in Oyede community before, the advent of Christianity. <br/>To examine the role and impact of missionary activities in the Oyede community. <br/>To shed light on the impact of Christianity in Oyede community and the transformation of the cultural social and religious institutions of the Isoko people.<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>    The significance of this study is basically to reveal the impact of Christianity in Oyede community as well as consider how the socio-cultural and religious structure of Oyede community had undergone some reformation, starting from early decades of the 20th century to the present day. However, observation and finds derived from a work of  this type will offer an expository account of how the various forms of fetish  customs  and primitive superstitious of the Oyede people attained its present modernized  stage. <br/>    Findings made in a work of this type will equally provide some vital information that will help anyone who deems it necessary to conduct further research in this areas subsequently. <br/>Scope of the Study<br/>    The scope of this study covers the Oyede community. In Isoko north local government area of forest belt region in Delta state of southern Nigeria. However, this project covers a period from pre-colonial times to the advent of Christianity which brought about the penetration of Europeans into the Isokoland in the late 20th century. This work focuses on the social, cultural and religious  institutions of the Oyede people before and advent of Christianity. Also, attempts were made to examine how this new religion (Christianity) sharpened, translated and directs the lives of Oyede community till date. <br/>Research Methodology <br/>    This study adopts the historical research methodology which depends on secondary, primary sources as well as oral interviews which would be clearly stated at the end of my project work. These primary sources contains oral interview, government ethical reports, newspapers, myths and Tolklores. While the secondary sources contain books and Articles written on the historical survey of the Isoko people and their traditional social and religious institutions.<br/>Literature Review<br/>    Making a concise analysis and research on the preferred topic, various books related to this topic must be reviewed on other to get broad analysis and information useful for this project. <br/>Obaro Ikime “The Ground Work of Nigerian History”8; The people and kingdom of the Delta provinces; this work provided and analysis on the geographical location of the Isoko people and their environs. O. Ikhime gave analysis on various origin of tradition of the Isoko people, of which some claimed to have migrated from the Benin Kingdom, some from nowhere while others claimed to have migrated from Egypt. His book reviewed on the origin of the Isoko and its existence of the seventeen clan in Isoko land which makeup the Isoko country in the precolonial times. <br/>    My Nabota, “Essential Topics in African Traditional Religion”.9 This book emphasizes on the relationship between the supreme being and other deities in the Isokoland. “The Isoko’s fear, respect and worship God despite the homage they pay to other smaller deities, yet they also have other object of worship”. My Nabota maintains in his book  that “these deities are brought into being by God and they are generally regarded as sons and daughters of God, they  have no absolute existence apart from God. Their power and authorities are meaningless apart form the supreme deity”….<br/>J.E. Okwoho, “Effect of Missionary Activities in Isoko Local Government Area”.10 This work emphasizes on the social organization of the Isoko people, their administration of Justice, social and cultural entities before the advent of Christianity. It also shed light on the various judicial and traditional law maintained in the society and various penalties placed on defaulters of these laws. The Author mainly focused more on the cultural institution. <br/>    Edward Foshole Luke Etal “Christianity in Independent Africa”.12 This book focuses on the advent of Christianity in Africa, the coming of various missionary societies such as C.M.S, Baptist, Jesuit, Catholic and other protestant missions in Africa.

It is one of the earliest clans that constituted the nineteen clans in Isoko land. While some people believed that the Uzere people originated from the Benin kingdom, others disagree1.Obaro Ikime, Professor of history at the university of Ibadan, state “if there is any aspect of the history of the various peoples of Nigeria about which no one can speak with any exactitude, it is that which deals with the origin of our peoples”. The belief that most of the Isoko groups of which Uzere is a part are of the Benin origin were view held and expressed in the 1960s and 1970s. These views were “decidedly simplistic and were based on British intelligence.<br/>    It was also believed that Uzei, the founder of the clan migrated from Benin and that Uzere is said to have been founded in about the mid-15th country or before that time. Uzei had three surviving sons, Uheri, Ezede and Uweye. <br/>    Geographically, Uzere clan falls within the evergreen fresh water swamp forest of Southern Nigeria, it lies between longitude 60 10 East and latitude 5012 North2. It is located in the South East part of Isoko South. It is about 12.5 kilometres, from the Local Government Headquarters in Olen, and six kilometers, from Asaba Ase which is located on the bank of the Ase creek of River Niger3. <br/>    The clan is bounded in the North- West by Aviara and her villagers, in the West by Ibide, in the South by Asaba-Ase while in the South-West by Erowa and Abari Village4. <br/>    The clan has three major quarters namely Uheri, Ezede and Uweye. In each of these quarters are streets such as Oto-Uheri and Obughe in Uheri quarter, while Araya, Uruse and Enye in Uweye quarters, and Urueche, Abo-Ezede and Eteri in Ezede quarter5. <br/>    Uzere is identified for its well-defined administrative set up, the Ovie is at the top with the nine edios, three from each quarters and others arms of government which protect or represent the interest of the clan and the common man in general. Offences consider to be too bad, were given capital punishment during this period. <br/>    The Uzere people are mainly fishermen especially the men folks. There is a saying in Isoko that “If you love fish, then marry an Uzere man”. One the other hand, the women are farmers. The land is not that fertile base on the fact that the area is subject to flooding, farming became hazardous. Yet the people depend on it for fishing, farming and palm produce for exports. Fish were for individual consumption but in the case of surplus, they were sold in exchange for other products that were not produced in the locality6. <br/>    The Uzere people are worshippers of African traditional gods or deities. There is a festival they normally do, which is known as “Eni Festival, is the most celebrated festival in the history of Uzere kingdom. The Eni deity was the most powerful. Eni deity is a “water spirit” who was said to have accompanied Uzei and his people from Benin. It had the power of detecting watches7. <br/>    There is no doubt that the coming of the Europeans did change the culture of the people of Uzere. The young men of Uzere to day have one way or the other abandoned the cultural and traditional ways of live of their ancestors and adopted the white man culture that is Christianity, which to a very large extent presented them inferior in the eyes of the white man.<br/>    Although, inspite of the overriding acceptance and influence of Christianity around the clans, series of customary rules and regulations which mainly emanated from the early disposition or displacement of the clan still subsist and revered as the early times. <br/>Justification of Research<br/>    This project essay will serve as a spring board to younger generations and researchers in further constitution of the history of Uzere. It will also enhance policy makers understand the complexity of organization of the people they formulate policy for. This project essay will create a way for proper understanding of the history of the people being reviewed, and by extension, help other group appreciate the importance and relevance of inter-group relations in all ramification of life of the people.<br/>    It also examined the impact created by the colonial authority and the re-assessment of the general development and population growth of the Uzere kingdom in future. <br/>Aims and Objectives<br/>The aims and objectives of this study include: <br/>To uncover the truth about the actual tradition of origin of Uzere kingdom. <br/>It aimed at exposing the conflicting versions given by different researchers. <br/>To educate people about the correct traditions of origin of Uzere and the traditional cultural heritage of their ancestors before the advent of the Europeans. <br/>It tends to highlight the various ways by which the Uzere people were involved in trade with their neighbours through their products such as fishing, farm produces, palm produce etc. <br/>Also to expose the power of Eni the “water spirit which brought so many other ethnic group such as Urhobo, Ijaw, Kwale, Aboh, Itsekiri and a host of others into Uzerewhich increased their fame and prestige, among its neighbours. <br/>And finally, to highlight the various ways by which the Europeans presence affected the total ways of life of the Uzere people.<br/>Scope of the Study<br/>    The scope of this study shall cover the history of Uzere traditions of origin, the coming of the European, their impacts and influence on the once thriving kingdom.

Information obtained from these sources helped to guide and supplement the materials obtained from primary sources. These sources helped to provide data for historical analysis of the impact of colonial rule in Uzere land. <br/>Literature Review <br/>    As a matter of fact, much work had not been done in Uzere history. There are however, certain literatures that deal on relevant aspect of the history of Uzere people. Other works on Uzere are those of ethnographic and anthropological survey, where Uzere loss partially touched to this extent, it therefore becomes imperative to review this available literature for this study. J.W. Hubbard, in his book, The Sobo of the Niger Delta, gave 1593, as the founding date when the first settlers arrived at Uzere clan, thus making it one of the oldest clan. It is the apostle of those who believed that Uzere migrated from Benin. He suggested that the distinctive characteristics of the Isoko people which Uzere is one are as a result of the super-imposition of neigbouring Ibo, and later Edo immigrants upon aboriginal strata who were already Edo type dialect. He also further stated that, the over little is said to have been institute originally by the Oba of Benin but later to have been conferred within the tribe. <br/>    Whitney P. Foster, in his book Pre-twentieth century Isoko ascribed the migration of Uzere from Benin to the refugee theory which explains the founders of the clan as those seeking to escape socio-political oppression from Benin. What he meant by this is that, the Niger Delta are ripped and physically improvise to escape trouble in their homeland. Once there, the physically barriers seems to have proven sufficient to provide the refugee the independence they sought both from each other and their homeland. <br/>Furthermore, within a short generations, the fear causing their fight probably had worn off, but by then other areas of refugee had become a familiar, it difficult environment for the refugees descendant to live and multiply8. <br/>    Actually the dominant theme of the traditions today that goes on within the Isoko clan pertaining to the reasons why a specific individual or group came to the area would agree with the refugee theory.  Prominent in this case is the geographical factors in an analysis of the Isoko” as they were to be founded in the early twentieth century. <br/>    Chadwick in the 1932 Ughelli Records, states that the Uzei got to the Niger and local South-in the testimony obtained, the elders said that due to Eni “the powerful water spirit” Uzere stay near the water, Ase Creek  Parallels to the Niger, and seems a possible route into the area Uzei settled9. <br/>    Obaro Ikime, in his book, The Isoko people pointed out categorically that, the tradition of Uzere claims, that the clan founded by Uzei, son of an Oba of Benin who had to flee Benin because he committed incest spread after founding of what is usually described as the parents town or clan centers. <br/>    R.E Bradbury traced the origin of Uzei people to Benin10. Also he claimed that Oleh clan and Irri came from Uzere but he refused to point out the reasons why the two clans became largely independent. He also stated that the Uzere people are noted as fishermen and he described the Uzere as a “reservoir” of fishers. He also pointed out the different ways for methods by which collection of fish were done. <br/>    In an edited book of O.S. Akorah, Uzere: A Kingdom of the Niger Delta, he stated two versions of Uzei decision to leave Benin. The first was Uzei fled Benin City after committing adultery with one of his father’s wives while the other is attributed to the actual cruel activities of a giant called “Oguara”. He refused to agree with one particular reason out of the two given above. He stated that, after the movement from Eruke, majority of the people migrated to Uzere present site while the minority moved along through the Onise Creek on the River Nun to settle at Odi. With this emphasis however, one should be able to conclude that, Odi is an offshoot of Uzere kingdom11. <br/>    P.M. Peek, described the Benin migrations, it appear to have been due to civil wars and personal discontent in Benin City. He also state how the first son of Uzei called Okugbo was sent to Benin and when he was returning he stopped at Aboh and slept with one of the Obi of Aboh’s wives which resulted to a war between the Uzere people and the Abohs. He also talked about how the Uzere people were able to rule themselves12. <br/>    I.B. Ifodoh, in tracing the origin of Ozoro-clan, emphasized that the Ozoro people traced their origin to Benin since the accounts are based on the elders of Ozoro. It is believed that majority and every Ozoro indigene knows that he or she is a descendant of Opute and Ozoro. As a matter of fact, however, this case could be compared with the one of Uzere situation. He also talked on the socio-political organization of Ozoro people, which to a large extent, could be compared with the one of Uzere.13 <br/>Chapterization<br/>    This topic is divided into six chapters as follows: <br/>Chapter One: Introduction <br/>This chapter provides a brief historical background of the Uzere people. It shows that the people have their distinctive history of origin and that Uzere is said to have been founded in about the fifteenth century. Some persons said that Uzere originated from Benin, why others disagreed with that postulation. <br/>Chapter two: Historically Background of Uzere<br/>    This chapter examines the historical background of Isoko and the Uzere people. Some historians believed that the Isoko people originated from the great Benin kingdoms, why others like Obaro Ikime, believed that the Isoko people did not originate from Benin. And that the views given about the origin of the Isoko people were decidedly simplistic and were based on British intelligence. It was also said that Uzei the founder of Uzere originated from Benin. In this chapter, focuses will also be at the political, social and economic institution. In This chapter, more emphasis we be examine on how the Uzere people ruled themselves before the coming of the European, also how did Uzere people socialize and how they trade with other neighbouring clans. <br/>Chapter Three: Colonial Rule and Political Institutions in Uzere<br/>    This chapter examines the conquest and imposition of colonial rule on the people. It shows the various stages of the resistance mounted by the people against British expedition forces. Within the successful conquest of the people, the colonial authorities set up various form of administrative institutions such as native authorities and native courts. To ensure the availability of funds to run the government, various forms of taxes were imposed on the people. As the people needed money to pay these taxes, they had no alternative but to cultivate cash crops which were said to the foreign trading firms. <br/>Chapter Four: Colonial Rule and Social Institutions in Uzere <br/>    This chapter discusses the social institutions of the Uzere people during the colonial period. For instance, how did the Uzere people change from their mode of worships and started practicing the white man’s doctrine? Also there was the establishment of schools by the missionaries to train teachers, clerk catechist, priest etc. <br/>Chapter Five: Colonial Rule and Economic in Uzere<br/> Before the coming of the white man, the Uzere people were large in subsistence farming, producing food crops such as cassava, yam etc. With the advent of the European, came the production of palm oil and this help to diversify the economy. <br/>Chapter Six: Conclusion<br/>    This chapter concludes this dissertation; it explained that the colonial rule did not live much legacy in Uzere. Despite the policies, the colonial authorities made, did not impact the people of Uzere positively, but there was the exploitation of the cash crops which was used to developed the white man’s country and living the Uzere people in total destruction. Any progress that may have been achieved by the people during the period, were based on their own initiative and not that of the colonial authorities. <br/> ENDNOTES<br/>W.

It is one of the earliest clans that constituted the nineteen clans in Iosco land. While some people believed that the User people originated from the Benin kingdom, others disagree1. Boar Ikime, Professor of history at the university of Ibadan, state “if there is any aspect of the history of the various peoples of Nigeria about which no one can speak with any exactitude, it is that which deals with the origin of our peoples”. The belief that most of the Iosco groups of which User is a part are of the Benin origin were view held and expressed in the 1960s and 1970s. These views were “decidedly simplistic and were based on British intelligence.<br/>    It was also believed that Uzei, the founder of the clan migrated from Benin and that User is said to have been founded in about the mid 15th country or before that time. Uzei had three surviving sons, Uheri, Ezede and Uweye. <br/>    Geographically, User clan falls within the evergreen fresh water swamp forest of Southern Nigeria, it lies between longitude 60 10 East and latitude 5012 North2. It is located in the South East part of Iosco South. It is about 12.5 kilometres, from the Local Government Headquarters in Olen, and six kilometers, from Asaba Ase which is located on the bank of the Ase check of River Niger3. <br/>    The clan is bounded in the North- West by Aviara and her villagers, in the West by Ibide, in the South by Asaba-Ase while in the South-West by Erowa and Abari Village4. <br/>    The clan has three major quarters namely Uheri, Ezede and Uweye. In each of these quarters  are streets such as Oto-Uheri and Obughe in Uheri quarter, while Araya, Uruse and Enye in Uweye quarters, and Urueche, Abo-Ezede and Eteri in Ezede quarter5. <br/>    User is identified for its well-defined administrative set up, the Orie is at the top with the nine edws, three from each quarters and others arms of government which protect or represent the interest of the clan and the common man in general. Offences consider to be too bad, were given capital punishment during this period. <br/>    The User people are mainly fishersmen especially the men folks. There is a saying in Iosco that “If you love fish, then marry an User man”. One the other hand, the women are farmers. The land is not that fertile base on the fact that the area is subject to flooding, farming became hazardous. Yet the people depend on it for fishing, farming and palm produce. for exports fish were for individual consumption but in the case of surplus, they were sold in exchange for other products that were not produced in the locality6. <br/>    The User people are worshippers of African traditional gods or deities. There is a festival they normally do, which is known as “Eni Festival, is the most celebrated festival in the history of User kingdom. The Eni deity was  the most powerful. Eni deity is a “water spirit” who was said to have accompanied Uzei and his people from behind had the power of detecting watches7. <br/>    There is no doubt that the coming of the Europeans did change the culture of the people of User. The young men of User to day have one way or the other abandoned the cultural and traditional ways of live of their ancestors and adopted the whiteman culture, that is Christianity, which to a very large extent presented them inferior in the eyes of the white man.<br/>    Although, inspite of the overriding acceptance and influence of Christianity around the clans, series of customary rules and regulations which mainly emanated from the early disposition or displacement of the clan still subsist and revered as the early times. <br/>Justification of Research<br/>    This  project essay will serve as a spring board to younger generations  and researchers in further constitution of the history of User. It will also enhance policy makers understand the complexity of organization of the people they formulate policy for this project essay will create a way for proper understanding of the history of the people being reviewed, and by extension, help other group appreciate the importance and relevance of inter-group relations in all ramification of life of the people.<br/>    It also examine the impact created by the colonial authority and the re-assessment of the general development and population growth of the User kingdom in future. <br/>Aims and Objectives<br/>The aims and objectives of this study include: <br/>To uncover the truth about the actual tradition of origin of User kingdom. <br/>It aimed at exposing the conflicting versions given by different researchers. <br/>To educate people about the correct traditions of origin of User and the traditional cultural heritage of their ancestors before the advent of the Europeans. <br/>It tends to highlight the various way by which  the User people were involve in trade with their neigbours through their products such as fishing, farm produces, palm produce etc. <br/>Also to expose the power of Eni the “water spirit which brought so many other ethnic group such as Urhobo, Ijaw, Kwale, Aboh, Itsekiri and a host of others into User which increased their fame and prestige, among its neigbours. <br/>And finally, to highlight the various ways by which the Europeans presence affected the total ways of life of the User people.<br/>The Scope of the Study<br/>    The scope of this study shall cover the history of User, traditions of origin, the coming of the European, their impacts and influence on the once thriving kingdom. It geographical location, the socio-economic and political institution of the clan, military and wars of expansion cum expansionist policies, intergroup relations with her neigbours. <br/>Research Methodology <br/>    The methodology to be employed in the acquisition of materials for this project shall be through critical analysis of sources such as primary source in the form of oral interviews aims the use of secondary materials like books, journals articles, chapters in text books and unpublished materials. Information obtained from these sources helped to guide and supplement the materials obtained from primary sources. These sources helped to provide data for historical analysis of the impact of colonial rule I User land.  <br/>Literature Review <br/>    As a matter of fact, much work had not been done in User history. There are however, certain literature that deal on relevant aspect of the history of User people. Other works on Uzere are those of ethnographic and anthropological survey, where Uzere loss partially touched to this extent, it therefore becomes imperative to review these available literature for this study.

She made mention of Eni oracle which helped the Uzere people and their neighbours in detecting witches and wizards. She pointed out how the Uzere here able to rule themselves with the help of Eni deity. She also stated how the Uzere people lost their cultural heritage as a result of the advent of the Europeans and their activities in the land. <br/>Chapterization<br/>    This topic is divided into six chapters as follows: <br/>Chapter one: Introduction of the topic:<br/>This chapter provides a brief historical background of the Uzere people.

Its aim is to get people scared.” It is a “strategy of intimidation and violence.”1 Terrorism as a premeditated, political motivated violence, perpetrated against non combatant targets by sub national groups, usually intended to influence an audience; political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear through the violent victimization and destruction of non combatant targets. Terrorism is a global menace. It is indeed, a scourge which needs to be frontally confronted. It is a violation of our fundamental human rights, especially the right to life and that of peaceful coexistence.2 The terror and tragedies that terrorists unleash on innocent and unsuspecting citizens pose a serious threat the stability of all societies. It threatens existing democratic institution. Emerging democracies are very vulnerable to tragedies which such terrorist attacks cause, that is why the international community must be very determined and firmed in their resolve to confront and defeat terrorist, their network and collaborators. Increase of terrorist activities has a significant effect on a nation’s security in which they take place.3 <br/><br/>Global Terrorism <br/><br/>Attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, on September 11, 2001, provided a grim reminder of Osama bin Laden’s reputation as the godfather of global terrorism. The Afghanistan-based millionaire and his umbrella organization of international terrorist groups, al-Qaeda, were soon identified as the prime suspects in the attacks. Intelligence analysts have linked bin Laden and al-Qaeda to a series of attacks, many of them in his self-declared jihad against the United States. American intelligence experts regard Osama bin Laden as a major funder of terrorist groups involved in the following attacks: firefight in Somalia in 1993 that left 18 Americans dead; bombing of a military training center run by the United States in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 1995; bombing of the Khobar Towers, an apartment complex that housed U.S. servicemen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 1996; the killing of 58 tourists at Luxor, Egypt, in 1997; bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998; and an attack against the USS Cole while it refueled in Yemen in 2000.4 He has admitted his complicity in the attacks in Somalia; expressed his admiration for the “heroes” responsible for the Riyadh and Dhahran bombings, while denying his involvement; threatened attacks against Americans who remain on Saudi soil; and promised retaliation internationally for cruise missile attacks. In 1998 he announced the creation of a transnational coalition of extremist groups known as The Islamic Front for Jihad against Jews and Crusaders.5<br/><br/>After the September 11 attacks, the United States declared a war on terrorism to capture Osama bin Laden. It destroyed al-Qaeda training bases in Afghanistan, and replaced the Taliban with a government less friendly to terrorists. Aerial bombing attacks destroyed al-Qaeda bases and helped a coalition of anti-Taliban forces called the Northern Alliance gain control of Afghanistan. The whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, however, remained unknown.<br/><br/>Osama bin Laden’s message resonates with the feelings of many in the Arab and Muslim world. A sharp critic of U.S. policy toward the Muslim world, bin Laden has denounced U.S. support for Israel, which he blames for the failure of the Middle East peace process. He has condemned U.S. refusal to censure Israel’s 1996 shelling of civilians in Qana, Lebanon, and U.S. insistence on continued economic sanctions against Iraq, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, especially among children. He has been equally critical of what he dismisses as “new crusades” in the Persian Gulf, in particular the substantial U.S. military and economic presence and involvement in Saudi Arabia. He has embraced populist causes such as the “liberation” of Muslims in Bosnia, Chechnya, Kashmir, Kosovo, and other areas.6 Bin Laden and other Islamic extremists justify their use of violence with the claim that most Muslim and Western governments are corrupt oppressors that resort to violence and terrorism. <br/><br/>These extremists use Islam to motivate their followers and rationalize their actions. However, they misinterpret and misapply Islamic beliefs. Claiming that Islam and the Muslim world are under siege, they call for a jihad. Although jihad refers to the right and duty of Muslims to defend themselves, their community, and their religion from unjust attack, extremists use the concept to legitimate acts of violence and terrorism.7 <br/><br/>People in various countries would prefer to live in an environment in which business and enterprise can flourish, leading to a healthy economy, a reasonable standard of living. Among scholars, lawyers, and policy makers, there is no general agreement on a clear definition of terrorism. In addition in attracting attention, terrorism also frequently has paid off in concrete terms. Terrorist generally have been remarkably successful in achieving their immediate goals relative to the costs incurred, repaid social and economic change has often been associated with violence. Clearly, the politics of controlling international terrorism is complicated due to the fact that the world’s governments are not universally opposed to terrorism or at least do not all define it in the same way.8 In UN general assembly sessions and in other forums where controls on international terrorism have been discussed states have often taken conflicting positions. In the early 1970s, the United States introduced a draft convention on terrorism requiring the extradition or prompt trial of hijackers and kidnappers, especially in cases in which hostages were government officials.<br/><br/>Generally, the United States and other industrialized states favoured the principle that terrorists are criminals and that the world community shares a responsibility to apprehend them and bring to trials. In contrast, less developed states, while deploring the deaths of innocent victims, tended to argue that terrorism is often the only available weapon of the oppressed, and that before it can be outlawed measures should be adopted to rectify the political and economic injustices perpetrated particularly by industrialized states and their allies. Increased global concern about terrorism was particularly evident after the slaughter of Israeli athletes by Palestinian commandos at the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, this led to the efforts to prevent both kidnapping and assassination especially international protected persons diplomat and other national representatives.10 The UN General Assembly passed a resolution on the status of such persons in 1973, and a UN convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against internationally protected persons including Diplomatic Agents was opened for ratification in the same year, a UN committee on international terrorism was established.<br/><br/>Terrorism and National Security<br/><br/>Terrorism affects national security in various ways, bombing historically has been the most common terrorist tactic. Terrorists have often relied on bombs because they provide a dramatic, yet fairly easy and often risk-free, means of drawing attention to themselves and their cause. Few skills are required to manufacture a crude bomb, surreptitiously plant it, and then be miles away when it explodes. Bombings generally do not require the same planning, organization, and knowledge required for more sophisticated operations, such as kidnapping, assassination, and assaults against well-defended targets. These play a significant role in exacerbating conflict that exact enormous human and economic cost, the causes of such conflicts lie in political economic, ethnic and religious differences and disparities.11 These factors are often aggravated by governance-related deficiencies, such as exclusionary and irresponsive policies, and lack of or weakness in democratic institutions, respect for rule of law and human rights observance. The accesses to porous international order further compound the problems of widespread proliferation, illicit trafficking and criminal of these weapons. The negative effects of have been far-reaching and diverse. Although most importantly, are the increased threat to global security.12 <br/><br/>Seven countries in Africa have taken a key commitment that they have entered into as part of the Bamako Declaration on an African common position on various terrorist Movements that have bedeviled the continent. Terrorism is by nature political because it involves the acquisition and use of power for the purpose of forcing others to submit, or agree, to terrorist demands. According to her, a terrorist attack, by generating publicity and focusing attention on the organization behind the attack, is designed to create this power. It also fosters an environment of fear and intimidation that the terrorists can manipulate. As a result terrorism’s success is best measured by its ability to attract attention to the terrorists and their cause and by the psychological impact it exerts over a nation and its citizenry. It differs in this respect from conventional warfare, where success is measured by the amount of military assets destroyed, the amount of territory seized, and the number of enemy dead.13 Not surprisingly, the frequency of various types of terrorist attacks decreases in direct proportion to the complexity or sophistication required. Armed attacks historically rank as the second most-common terrorist tactic, followed by more complex operations such as assassination of heads of state or other well-protected people, kidnapping, hostage taking, and hijacking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Endnotes<br/><br/>M.

One of such societies was EBRE WOMEN SOCIETY.</p> <p>Ebre women society was a ritual dance in honour of the ancestral mothers and was very popular in pre-colonial era because of its social, political, judicial and educational functions. Their contributions or influence was not limited to the village but extended to the village groups.2 They played important roles in moral education, political sensitization, sanction mutual aid and the preservation of the rights of the female sex.3 Moreso, it provided a forum for women to devise means of disciplining girls and training them on economic, moral and social ethics. They used this opportunity to formulate and discuss policies for the handling of girls during circumcision, fattening and during other significant events in their times.</p> <p>Ebre music or songs articulated the hopes and aspirations of the women and their references were drawn from the day to day experiences. When the ebre women danced, it was not only for entertainment but also as an instrument of social control while some were a deliberate protest against what they regarded as male chauvinism.4 Moreso, the vulgarity of some of their song texts and ballads reflected their desire to inculcate moral discipline, obedience, respect in the youth and entire people. Ebre dance was accompanied by full orchestra of wooden drum, rattle and gong which were simple and locally made and were played by the members according to how each of them specializes on them.5</p> <p>The Ebre women raised their fund through the initiation fees paid by new members, heavy fines imposed on men who abused their wives and though the donations of well wishers whenever the Ebre dance was staged and through the money charge by them whenever they were hired to play and dance on special occasion. A typical Ebre women was identified with 2 pieces of wrapper which the eye of the owner considered superior, blouse, headtie and a string of beads tied around their neck. Among the important paraphernalia of this group are the Ekuriku staff which was also used by members of Idiong and Ekong societies and symbolized authority as well as “akpan Udua” (traditional woven basket) which depicts their occupation of farming and trading.6</p> <p><strong>EBRE SOCIETY </strong>existed as a traditional forum for the political participation of women. Whereafter, this society was suppressed or restricted in scope by the colonial administration. This society, as a political structure enabled women’s voices to be heard, their opinion consulted and their participation guaranteed from the family households to the councils in the larger society.7</p> <p>At the dawn of the contemporary period, Ebre society metamorphose into a political forum for women and are organized around definite political, social, economic, professional and class interest. They aspire for political development and representation as well as national development and they thrive alongside with male folk.8 They participate actively in politics by mobilizing and organizing women as interest groups, pressure groups and NGOs which helps in furthering the course of women9.</p> <p><strong>1.1    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The most outstanding problem that necessitate this research span from the total negligence of studies on Ebre women in the Nigerian historiography. It is observed that much has been written on the important role played by men in their various societies in pre-colonial era whereas “Ebre society” whose members form the bedrock of today’s women in politics have been neglected.</p> <p>On the otherhand, majority of the people regard women as necessary appendages with clearly defined and circumscribed roles which were calculated at advancing the pervasive interest of the male without recognizing the potential powers of women.</p> <p>On the whole, the researcher in carrying out this research, tries to demystify the conception that Ebre society was more of a fraternity than a social club.</p> <ul><li><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul> <p>The research is conducted to achieve the following:</p> <ol><li>It is an attempt to examine the roles, contributions and status of Ebre women in the social development of Mkpat Enin L.G.A.</li> <li>It is the intension of this research to evaluate the extent of women’s involvement in the governance of the society in the pre-colonial period.</li> <li>This work also intends to bring to limelight the place of Ebre women in contemporary society-politically.</li> </ol> <ul><li><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul> <ul><li>This work is an attempt to stem the tide of negligence as far as the study of Ebre women society in Mkpat Enin L.G.A. is concerned.</li> <li>This work will serve as a useful contribution to highlight that the women of Mkpat Enin L.G.A. has contributed substantially to the development of the area irrespective of their political affiliations.</li> <li>This work being an academic inquiry on Ebre women will justify the vibrant role played by women in the political scene today.</li> <li>This work will go a long way to boost the existing literature on women and thus fill the gap which exist on account of the death of written records about women.</li> <li>The work will serve as an eye opener to the government on the need to recognize women and their groups, and thus help government to give women the recommended 30% of elective and appointive positions in government.</li> </ul> <ul><li><strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></li> </ul> <p>This research work covers a wide range of areas. It incorporates all the necessary facts about Ebre Women Society.</p> <p>It discusses is full detail the activities and contributions of the society aimed at the socio-political development of Mkpat Enin society in pre-colonial time.</p> <p>The study extends to examine the roles and place of Ebre women in contemporary society – politically.</p> <ul><li><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></li> </ul> <p>Among the books reviewed include Daryll Forde and G.I. Jones (1950), <strong><em>The Ibo and Ibibio – Speaking Peoples of South – Eastern Nigeria,</em></strong> agrees that membership in Ebre was open to women of all ages; it has authority over unmarried girls; supervising the fattening house and other ceremonies concerning them. It also celebrate annually the harvesting of women’s yam known as Abre.</p> <p>Udo Udoma (1981),<strong><em>The Story of the Ibibio Union</em></strong>, maintains that Ebre society was exclusively for women of high distinction and moral probity. In his view, Ebre society was one of the institutions responsible for the wielding of power; having a well defined area of authority and it was a highly disciplined organization.</p> <p>Commenting further on Ebre women’s society, Edet A. Udo (1983), <strong><em>Who are the Ibibio?</em></strong>, tries to explain that the entrance fee was quite high but each woman received financial help from her husband, her relatives and well wishers just to become a member of this prestigious society.</p> <p>The work of Ekong Ekong (2001), <strong>The Sociology of the Ibibio, </strong>ascertains that women of easy virtue and thieves were exposed and expelled from this traditional society and in this way the society served mainly as a control on the morals of women in the society. In the same vein, Peter, Iwok and Uya (1994), <strong>Akwa Ibom State, the Land of Promise: A Compendium,</strong> gives a detail account that the female institution appears to be so named because it was especially established to check the stealing of this particular foodcrop. They maintain that members of the Ebre club were usually married women of proven reputation and integrity. Their function in the pre-colonial times was to regulate the conduct of its members to ensure good discipline and behaviour among them and all women generally. Most importantly they served the interest of men.</p> <p>Antia (2005), <strong>Akwa Ibom Cultural Heritage, </strong>presents Ebre women society as an exclusive women’s play consisting of morally upright, industrious and honest women. However, he did not explained their functions but emphasized on membership qualifications.</p> <ol><li>A. Talbot (1968), <strong>Women’s Mysteries of a Primitive people: The Ibibios of Southern Nigeria,</strong> describe Ebre as a play which started among the ubium Ibibios. She went further to describe the dress code of Ebre members which in her opinion was rather costly so that only the wealthy were able to join it. In her view, this association strike a note midway between freemansory and trade unionism and form the only safeguard of Ibibio women against the tyranny of their men-folk.</li> </ol> <p>Badejo (1985), <strong>Women in Nigeria Today, </strong>is a very important work on women in contemporary times. Badejo gives helpful insight into the modern place of Ebre women in the political scene. These women represent the voice of the oppressed masses of women and they participate actively in politics so as to further the course of women.</p> <p>Lemuel Owugah (2003), “Gender and Political Empowerment: The Nigerian experience” in <strong>The Art and Science of Politics, is</strong> an important article on women political awareness. She emphasized that it was the United Nations Decade for women that gingered the 1995 Beijing World Conference on women to shift in focus from Liberation to political empowerment in the struggle for Gender equality.</p> <p>From the foregoing, it is evident that there exists rich literature on Ebre society in the pre-colonial era but less effort has been made in trying to examine its place in the contemporary society. Thus, this project tries to argue that Ebre women and their social activities in the pre-colonial era forms a stepping stone to women appearance in the public political scene. Ebre women are therefore seen as active catalyst in the socio-political development of not only Mkpat Enin but also Ibibioland. This could be seen as the 1929 women’s war in Opobo (Ikot Abasi) had Ibibo women as participants, who paid the capital price with their own lives for the historical and political development of Nigeria.</p> <ul><li><strong>METHODOLOGY / LIMITATION</strong></li> </ul> <p>Women history falls within the same category as social history and therefore is basically multi-disciplinary in approach. The researcher as an indigene of Mkpat Enin is aware of the fact that only marginal mention has always been made by most writers about Ebre society in text books. Most of these writers hardly adhere to the call by E.A. Afigbo to review women’s study with a view to portraying the women’s action especially the 1929 event in the right perspective. On the otherhand, most of the write-ups on women take to western theories, and thus, make such monographs on Ibibio women to lack the insiders approach. With these difficulties, the researcher employed circumspection in sighting the relevant materials from the irrelevant ones.</p> <p>From the above, it could be seen that materials for this project were collected from oral and written sources. Oral tradition can be defined as “all verbal testimonies which were reported statements concerning the past”.10 Oral tradition also has to do with oral literature including myth, poetry, epic, folklore, legend, eye-witnesses accounts or oral history.11 Great wisdom is however contained in oral tradition and if carefully analysed, can provide materials for the reconstruction of history of extinct communities. By and large, knowledgeable people who exhibited good knowledge of the functioning of Ebre society in the Mkpat Enin area were interviewed and written materials were also collected from private, public and the university libraries.</p> <p>This project was not completed without certain constraints. For instance, there was no archaeological excavation in Mkapt Enin L.G.A. and this posed some problems in the area of writing out the origin and migration of the Mkpat Enin people. The research into Ebre society in Mkpat Enin is confronted with several problems. The most important and most obvious is the death of relevant materials about Ebre society.</p> <p>For this project, it must be emphasized that written sources can not be exclusively relied upon as complete and comprehensive resources. One reason is that most of the earlier records derived from Europeans and Arabic sources must be considered external source materials subject to distortion and misrepresentation characteristic of such data. Thus, oral tradition must be considered a vital source for the purpose of corroboration and clarity. According to E.J. Alagoa, “Oral traditions is historical information transmitted orally by processes peculiar to each community and which should be studied first in the context of its culture before being made available for cross-cultural analysis and comparison”.12 This is moreso when we remember that writing does not succeed in capturing all the vital information even in societies in which writing is fully established.</p> <p>The issue of selection and processing of data posed another problem for the researcher which was confirmed in the eloquent expression of E. J. Alagoa that “the ethnographic present in which most traditional anthropologists wrote makes their works problematic for historians seeking to reconstruct the pre-colonial past. Deciding on how to use these works in a historically sensitive manner is among the most demanding methodological tasks of African social historians.13</p> <p>On the otherhand, the field study of this project was undertaken within a comparative short period. Apart from the tight schedule of most informants which made it difficult for them to keep appointments and resulted in repeated visits to certain areas by the researcher, she was also exposed to some financial problems as a self sponsoring student. Moreso, the attitude of some informants in respect to questions asked had posed a great deal of impediments to the researcher’s efforts. For instance, some informants refused to talk about certain areas like ritualism and burial rites which they felt they were not well informed. Others who agreed to talk related their information in a fragmented manner. This confirmed what E. J. Alagoa said that “oral tradition are faced with the problem of datation and chronology, reliability and techniques of analysis all bothering on the temperament of the writer”14.</p> <p>Despite these constraints, the inter-disciplinary approach to historical writing was adopted. This resulted from the fact that the different sources of historical reconstruction are all related. Therefore, the weakness of a particular area was complemented by the strength of the other and vice versa. The study was also made possible because of the researcher’s courage, sense of purpose, gentle persistence from door to door enquiry and my painstaking explanation of the research as being solely educational.</p> <p>On the whole, there is no claim to perfection of any nature as far as this study is concerned. It should rather be seen as an attempt to interpret historical phenomenon within the limits of available resources. Blame of whatever nature should go the researcher and scholarly reactions provoked as a result of this study are welcomed. This is in accordance with the view of Arnold Toynebee that “for a person to make meaningful contributions to the advancement of knowledge, his studies must have provoked some criticisms and further researches.15</p> <p>From the foregoing, the above chapter gives an insight into the “Ebre women society” in pre colonial Mkpat Enin while the next chapter will trace the origin of Mkpat Enin L.G.A. as well as the origin and status of Ebre women society.</p>\n\nTHE EBRE WOMEN SOCIETY AND IT'S CONTROBUTIONS TO THE SOCIO-POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EBRE WOMEN SOCIETY AND IT'S CONTROBUTIONS TO THE SOCIO-POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Conflicts, civil wars, communal and ethnic violence are central to the problems confronting many African states especially in the post-colonial era. These faces and phases of national insecurity and volatility are triggered by a diversity of factors some of which have remained perennial to Africa. For example, in the Nigeria political realm, most conflicts could be ascribed to leadership factor (Achebe:1989). In Nigeria, the question of Aburi Accord (a political factor activated largely by leadership discordances) is at the root of the Nigerian Civil War which took place between 1967 and 1970. Although Aburi Accord was a clear attempt at resolving Nigeria’s accumulated political discrepancies since the colonial and early independence era yet the negotiators and contributors dented the process by reclining to ethnic chauvinism and personal atavism. As a result, Aburi, a prospective instrument of peace turned out the sword of Damocles that hung over the head of its negotiators such that once peace became a nearly impossible feat; the generals took to arms to settle their differences. This research identified two major factors as being responsible for the breakdown of Aburi agreement considered successful at the point of round table diplomacy. First, the spoilers’ activities from outside actors heightened tensions after the post conference publication of an abridged version of the agreement. Secondly, the spoilers’ actions did not satisfy the expectation of the aggrieved Easterners at the point of implementation. The latter wanted no more; or less than Siamestic replications, through implementation, of the Aburi agreement. The Nigerian government, after a “perceptive” gaze at the policy frames of Aburi reneged and opted for what could be termed a partial implementation. Against these backgrounds, the obvious questions are: were the federalists right with the partial offer? Was the renege actually a move to save the country from collapse? Were the Easterners wrong in pressing home for a fuller implementation? What could have become of the Nigerian state if the parties had compromised their positions? It is upon these questions, that the study would attempt to identify its objectives. However, findings in the study further reveal other Aburi intricacies that, to a large extent, triggered the war. They include; lack of respect and contempt for policy decisions by the federal government after an initial acceptance in Ghana; lack of preparation, casualness and ineptitude on the part of the negotiators; parochialism and quest for political relevance by the post-conference policy analysts; and most importantly, the calibre of leadership that presided the crises period. The Study is not only focused on the shenanigans of blame game but also reflects a pragmatic response to practical problems of public policy implementation and leadership drawbacks for reasons of national unity and all-round sustainable development.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul> <p>Many scholars believe the Aburi question and its implication on the Nigerian Civil War has its origin in the creation of the Nigerian state. That is, the debate over the implementation of the Aburi agreement was the problem of how the origin  of the Nigerian state became tied to the issue of the future association of the constituent units within the nation. In the views of Adebayo Oluoshi and Osita Agbu (1996), “the attempt by the military officers to prevent the nation from experiencing a bloody conflict merely fudged the question of Aburi and complicated it further with the consequences of civil war”.</p> <p>Precisely, on January 1, 1914, Britain, a former colonial power gave birth to the nation, Nigeria through series of diplomatic initiatives and conquests that led to the amalgamation of the ethnically and cultural incongruent Northern and Southern Protectorates. This, unquestionably, according to Eleazu, explains that Nigeria became a British colony as a result of the diplomacy of imperialism than a matter of choice for any of the peoples that were to be enclosed within this grid that came to be recognized and administered as one territorial unit called Nigeria (Eleazu, 195:61-71). From the time of its amalgamation in 1914, to independence in 1960 and beyond, the nation’s stuttering part to survival was marred by a quantum of serious conflict issues that climaxed into the civil war that took place between 1967-1970. Obviously, this history of crises was a result of the decision to merge the various incompatible entities as one.</p> <p>Incompatibility among the various groups was further aggravated by political disturbances that engulfed the Nigerian especially the early post-independence years. Threatened by a state of total collapse after a period of bloody military coups the Nigerian Army went to Aburi in search of peace. Aburi, Ghana and the failure to implement Aburi ratifications regarding the country’s unity, resulted in the 30 months civil war. Many years after the war the present leaders of the nation ought to have learnt a great lesson of history. But  religion politics and the economy have remained virtually unchanged and in almost the same guise as in the pre-civil war years, the country seem also to be on the part of disintegration The obvious pointers to these assumption are the general state of insecurity and political instability characterized by  regular abrogation of the rule of law, official corruption and incompetence, kidnapping, armed robbery, militancy, vandalizing of crude oil flow stations and pipeline that almost crippled the economic mainstay of Nigerian economy, the unabated  religious/ethnic conflicts in Jos. More recently, a new form of crisis reminiscent of the 1966 pogrom is engulfing other states in the north including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja (Amamkpa:2012:6). A Muslim fundamentalist sect going by the name Jama’atahl al-sunna li-da’wawa-l-quital, popularly known as Boko Haram (Western Education is forbidden), has gained a stranglehold on the region unleashing terror most especially on non-Muslim indigenes of the North. Very unfortunately, 46 years after Aburi and the civil war, the current trend of insecurity still cast shadows of doubts on national unity prompting plethora of demands for national conference, sovereign national confab, true federalism, political autonomy, restructuring Nigeria into six geo-political zones, financial autonomy to local government and a resistance to any change of status quo.</p> <p>In a build-up to Aburi and the Civil war, 1967-1970, scholars and experts have reeled out a number of factors responsible for crises of those ominous years. These factors which include: political, social, economic, religious, etc are interwoven and could not be considered as <em>terra incognita</em> as far as the geo-political developments in Nigeria are concerned. Amidst the myriad of political sub-factors, the role of Aburi Accord in starting the war was, more often than not, considered the last straw. One of the oft-quoted statements of this period was reflected in Obasanjo’s My Command: [Aburi]…was the last ditch of effort to save Nigeria from collapse (Obasanjo, 1980:145). This statement was corroborated by several other scholars who pointed to the Aburi Accord as the last gap in that circle of conflict.</p> <p>In a build-up to the Aburi conference, Nigeria was dragged to the brink of the abyss by two military coups in 1966. One of the far-reaching implications was a stalemate between two military leaders (Gowon and Ojukwu). The reason for the face-off, which invariably dominated the agenda of the Aburi conference, was predicated on the following:</p> <ol><li>The leadership and restructuring of the Nigerian Army</li> <li>The compensation and relocation of victims of the 1966 Pogrom</li> </ol> <p>After several unfruitful attempts to bring (Gowon and Ojukwu) to the negotiating table, Aburi, a more secured venue, in Ghana, was mutually agreed upon by both parties while General Ankrah offered to host them in a bid to restore the country from the brink. Given this obvious national exigency, it was expected that both parties will have the ample time to iron out any seemingly irreconcilable differences and as such must be armed to the teeth in terms of preparation. However, by one party’s lack of preparedness and more, the Accord, (though duly acknowledged by the negotiators), came under a serious scrutiny from (the spoilers) those who felt Ojukwu took undue advantage of his academic prowess to negotiate in favour of the Eastern region government. The implication of the bargaining capabilities of Federal side in the negotiation entailed, rather, another more besetting monster of the Nigerian system- the challenge of policy implementation. Failure to implement the agreement accordingly simply highlighted the obvious: Nigeria’s bad records of policy implementation. And historical excursion into the annals of public policy in Nigeria reveals that, if all the policies formulated in the country over the years were implemented accordingly, Nigeria, no doubt, would have been on a fast lane of development. It conjures the meaning that a full implementation of the Aburi Accord could have saved the country a great deal of human and material resources lost during the civil war.</p> <p>Finally, the major fault line of the Accord was the policy frame itself which was in very many ways considered by its formulators as significant and strategic to the survival of Nigeria but following a post-conference appraisal from (spoilers) “experts”, was delineated with mixed feelings. Apparently, this prospective tool of unity incidentally became an apple of discord among Nigerians. The nexus between the exponents and contrary opinions generated around the Accord is what this study is set to explore.</p> <p> 1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </p> <p>The decision by the warring parties (Ojukwu led Eastern government and Gowon led Nigerian government) to meet at Aburi in Ghana brought glimmers of hope for the much bartered entity called Nigeria. To many Scholars, this decision was the last chance towards avoiding war and evolving a more stable and peaceful entity /achieving peace. In finding the answer, it required, in part, a political dialogue to reach a consensus on how best the ethnic bodies would exist without having unnecessary frictions This was the main thrust of the Aburi Agreement. Against the background of full implementation of the accord, the Nigerian government therefore resorted to the famous lines of John F. Kennedy: “he, who makes peaceful resolution of conflict impossible, makes war inevitable”… (Afflerbach:2007).. Quasi-implementation of the Aburi Accord, overtime, became the oft-quoted instance for the Civil war. However, a little stretch beyond this hackneyed conclusion has revealed otherwise that conceding to the demands of   decree number 13 was capable also to rip the country apart. This study highlights the misinterpretation of the Aburi document; proposes important constitutional variables needing urgent national attention.</p><p> 1.3       AIM AND PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>The study seeks to explore the circumstances that led to the question of failure to fully implement the Aburi Accord and the subsequent consequences it had on the Civil war and beyond. It aims at highlighting lapses, historically, in pre-conference, Aburi document and post-conference report dilemmas surrounding the Aburi Accord.</p> <p>The study further examines, historically, the circumstances that gave birth to the meeting at Aburi on the 4th and 5th of January, 1967 under the auspices of General Joseph Ankrah of Ghana.</p> <p>The work also analyzes, in critical terms, the content of the Aburi Agreement as a constitutional document that seeks to achieve a slightly decentralized form of government with the aim of handing the regions some level of autonomy in their quest for social, political, economic independence.</p> <p>It shall also examine the operations and performance of key actors in the conference and the strategies adopted to score vital points and influence the outcome of the conference.</p> <p>The works also aims at assisting the need for government to revisit the Aburi documents with the intention to apply and coordinate some or even all the recommendations the conference (political, economic, military, and diplomatic) to achieve national unity objectives.</p> <p>The work will also critically analyze the roles of various individuals and groups and to what extent these groups influenced the outcome of the January 1967 agreement reached between Gowon and Ojukwu in Aburi Ghana. These individuals and Bodies include</p> <p>(a)        Delegates to the meeting</p> <p>(b)        The host</p> <p>(c)        The Federal Government Permanent Secretaries</p> <p>(d)       The delegates from Eastern Nigeria</p> <p>Finally, the study is concerned with developments and issues generated forty-six years after the Aburi Accord was signed and abandoned. The major consideration here is how relevant is the Accord to current political issues that look every inch like the political climate of 1966.</p> <p> 1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS </p> <ol><li>What was the actual agreement reached at Aburi</li> <li>Were the federalists right with the partial offer?</li> <li>Was the partial implementation actually a move to save the country from collapse?</li> <li>Were the Easterners wrong in pressing home for a fuller implementation?</li> <li>If the Aburi Accord was adhered to could there have been the Nigerian Biafran Civil War?</li> </ol><p>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>This study seeks to determine the extent by which the Aburi Accord helped in escalating the crisis that led to the Nigerian Civil War from 1967-1970. First, the Accord was to serve as the last resort to the problem of political instability but the outcome blindly guided the negotiators to the point of no return. The impacts of the Accord on the Civil War were those orchestrated, on the one hand, by the two factions in the conference spear-headed by Ojukwu and Gowon, and on the other hand, by the Federal government permanent secretaries who made a post-conference analyses and recommendations to General Gowon. Thus, the work covers the roles of these individuals in the saga.</p> <p>The importance of historical past- especially a well-documented one- to contemporary events cannot be overemphasized. Again, behind every event in history is a deep-rooted cause traceable to certain preconditions and precipitants. To this end, this work is neither centered on the events that took place at the Peduase house at Aburi, nor is it concerned with its impact on the war alone. Rather, it traces the idea of hosting the meeting in Ghana to series of tensions created before and after the 1966 coups. The work also covers the post-civil war era as it relates to the relevance of the Aburi Agreement to the present day political development.</p><p> 1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>This study intends to meet a variety of needs. It has enough substance to serve as literature on the subject. It will serve as a source for future researchers having interest on this topic.</p> <p>Apart from this, the work will inspire greater confidence in revisiting and ensuring a continued research on, unarguably, the most decisive moment on the nation’s history- a history that is virtually unknown to the present generation. The timing of the work is invariably analogous to the events of 1966 citing the current wave of systematic killings in the North perpetrated by members of Boko Haram against Easterners. Since history appears to be replaying itself, it must not be allowed to de-generate to another helpless state of total war as it is currently clamoured from different quarters (Godwin, 2012). Therefore, this study presents a practical reference point, as to what lessons can be derived, following the breakdown of Aburi negotiations. It creates greater awareness on the need for the present and the upcoming generations to learn from the dynamics of that momentous history and use the available information to construct a future that will give no place to such disastrous history.</p> <p>It has been my desire to intimate the general public on the importance of the researching on the implications of the Aburi Accord on the Civil war and the post-civil war Nigeria. The research will open up other dimensions and perspectives of analyzing the Aburi agreement. Besides, the work will expose the many problems thrown up as a result of partial implementation by the Federal Government or the uncompromising stance by Ojukwu’s East to stick to the last letters of the Agreement.</p><p> 1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS/CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS </p> <p>It is most appropriate to begin the study of Aburi conference and its aftermath by attempting a review of some related concepts such as conflict, peace building and Conflict Resolution, Peace spoiling and Peace spoilers, War and Peace treaties/agreement etc. The reason is understandably due to paucity of published works which have specifically dealt on the Aburi Accord. There hardly has been any separate and conscientious effort to study this highly controversial and unresolved national question.  Virtually all the texts-both foreign and local- consulted on the Nigerian Civil War have devoted few chapters and a number of pages, while others at best have made a passing mention of the subject. Hence, reviewing literatures on Aburi specifically (apart from the concepts mentioned above) derives from articles, commentaries and excerpts of the original document of the Aburi Peace Accord.</p>\n\nABURI ACORD: IT'S IMPLICATION ON THE NIGERIAN CIVIL WAR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ABURI ACORD: IT'S IMPLICATION ON THE NIGERIAN CIVIL WAR", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A HISTORY ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT  AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (NEEDS) AND HER CONTRIBUTION TO POVERTY ALLEVIATION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>TABLE OF  CONTENTS<br/></p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1      Introduction</p> <p>1.2      Objectives of the Study</p> <p>1.3      The Significance of the Study</p> <p>1.4      The Scope and Limitation of the Study</p> <p>1.5      Research Methodology</p> <p>1.6      Literature Review</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF NEEDS, ITS  PROGRAMMES AND IMPLEMENTTATION AS A MEDIUM TERM PLAN</p> <p>2.0     Introduction</p> <p>2.1      Needs Promoting Private Enterprise</p> <p>2.2     Needs maintaining the environment</p> <p>2.3     Needs improving infrastructure</p> <p>2.4     Needs improving Agriculture</p> <p>2.5     Needs promoting industry</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>DEVELOPMENT PLANNING IN NIGERIA BEFORE NEEDS</p> <p>3.1 Introduction-</p> <p>3.2.

Since according Nwachuku development planning must be controlled and directed toward the desire goals.2 It is imperative for the federal government to include not all levels of government towards moving the same direction but sick all and sundry namely: the private sector, the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the general public in cooperative activities in pursuit of developmental goals,.</p> <p>However, like the previous development planning especially from the first attempt in 1946 and in the opinion of scholars like Rodney Obikeze and Obi,3 NEEDS as a plan contains all the envisaged policies and programme of the federal government. It is not only a macro-economic plan document, but also a comprehensive vision, goals and principles of a “New Nigeria” through re-enacting core Nigeria value like respect for the elders, honesty, accountability, corporation, industry, discipline, self confidence and moral courage. As established NEEDs document, “NEED” significantly want to eradicate poverty and promote self-reliance, entrepreneurship innovation, and rewards hard work. As rightly observed by the National Planning Commission and Central Bank of Nigeria 4</p> <p>Thus, development plans is not understood in terms of economic development alone and so to scholars like Todaro and Rodney 5 it is multi dimensional.</p> <p>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Evaluating the present Government policy via its achievement of ‘NEEDs’ core objective seem to portrait the government no different from the .previous ones in ways and manner of pursuing and realizing the ideals of her development plan. However, this research work is designed to understand the imperative path to be followed by the federal government at achieving desired goals, and dissert the way it does things.</p> <p>Osagie, however laments on this approach to economic analysis when he writes that:-</p> <p>“Ideological confusion and mystification encouraged by naïve ideologies have successfully diverted attention from real issues to peripheral and esoteric click-ridden polemics along narrowly focused dogmatic lines. This attitude to analysis of economic phenomena in Nigeria tends to produce simplistic solutions to problem which give the impression that either economist are unrealistic in their analysis.”6</p> <p>Thus, the objective of this research work is to awaken the government of its weaknesses, because it is evident that the government has not achieved much of the professed objectives of NEEDs which are: employment generation, poverty reduction, wealth creation and value reorientation, in any significant measure in the medium term, if any thing, the impact has not been evident on the general well being of Nigerian.</p> <p>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work envisages to afford helpful background information to other researchers that would desire to source further in this sphere of study. However, this research is an incentive that provides an insight to academic and moral achievement of the reader to join the government in the nation building task, according to “jhingan” “one cannot expect economy and efficiency in administration unless the people posses high ethical and moral values.7</p> <p>The importance also serves as an encouragement to the government to put more effort in promoting private enterprise, infrastructure, agriculture, industry and other sectors for the purpose of Nigerian security, international relation and economic development, since it is a prospect that you cannot isolate economy like Nigeria and be successful, thus Edegbe 8 in the Nation Newspaper asserted that Nigeria is a market that cannot be ignored with her size, population and culture. Therefore, more effort is needed by the government.</p> <p>THE SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research will tackle the shortcomings of NEEDs from completely realizing its core goals and the efforts on Nigerians, since the welfare of the population is the ultimate evidence of development. This explains why Rodney sees development as a many sided process but defines it in relation to the individual. As he states, “at the level of individual it implies increased skills and capacity, greater freedom, creativity, responsibility and material well being.9</p> <p>For the purpose of this research, it will cut-across those vital aspects of NEEDs policies, programs and implantation and make it profoundly improve on its key objectives of poverty eradication, wealth creation, employment generation and value re-orientation.</p> <p>The principal problems faced by the researcher include the following, recognition of the branches, broadness of this field as well as shortage of necessary materials, time constraint and financial predicament. Thus, it is also part of the task of NEEDs to provide a standard educational system to resolve the aforementioned limitations.</p> <p>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>Due to the nature of this research, data would be collected through secondary sources with descriptive method. The mono-source nature of this research is as a result of some visible constraints that may form part of the factors in sourcing for primary data such as accessibility i.e NEEDs as a recent historical frame work has not being subject to archival installation, oral interview &amp; questionnaire, but it embraces the scrutiny of all the available published journals, periodicals, Newspapers, magazines, and text books etc which are relevant records on NEEDs.</p> <p>LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>In reviewing the relevant literature, books, write ups and articles would be examined.</p> <p>One of such work is “NEEDs Challenges and Leeway” by  Oche,10 he asserts that as an agenda for reform and a blue print for economic growth the NEEDs policy look towards ultimately reducing  poverty and unemployment, and establishing gradual but steady progress towards the generation of wealth on a country wide basis. He further state that it has some of its intermediates goals, the redefinition of the government’s role in the national economy: the creation of an enabling environment for the private sector: improving the delivery of basic social services: investing the country’s greatest asset, its people, and ultimately laying a strong foundation for  the future development of Nigeria human capital. The teleology NEEDS revolves around changing the prevailing value system in the society towards one of entrepreneurship, efficiency and selfless service.<br/>Another work is “Nigeria’s Currant Economic Reforms” by Egbon 11 in relation to this research he states that, the timing of reform can surely by influenced decisively by political leadership. Effective communication can translate the vague sense that something is wrong in to a broad perception for the need of change. However, existing evidence shows that reform governments do not stand a very good chance of being re-elected, given that the benefits of reform just do not come through quickly enough to fit in to the electorate cycle.</p> <p>Moreover, deep reforms are typically not recovered. He cites for example, in Chile, the democratically elected Social Democratic Government that follows the Pinochet autocracy opted to preserve much of the Chicago reforms that had being imposed by the previous non democratic regime. There also exist evidences that when government researches the point in a reform process where the prospects for re-election become dim, one more or less lose by continuing with the reform (e.g Gerhard Scroedar) Hamburg debate),12France, where electoral set back seems to have driven the reform agenda more deeply underground. There is therefore a definite role for suicide in politics.</p> <p>The Central Bank of Nigeria CBN 13 Annual report and statement of accounts states as follows: the policy thrust of NEEDs focused on Empowerment, Wealth Creation, employment generation, and poverty reduction as well as value re-orientation, under NEEDs a substantial progress was made in the implementation of structural reform, including a comprehensive banking sector consolidation programme, growing the non-oil sector, liberalization of  Nigeria’s import tariffs regime transaction, introduction of a Whole sale Dutch Auction System (WDAS) for foreign exchange, fight against corruption, and in structuring and privatizing state owned enterprises, in order to improve the environment for private – sector led growth and increase investor’s confidence.</p> <p>The economic and development planning by Jhingan listed, among his twelve point that are relevant to a successful development planning, firstly, he asserts that it is vital to have a planning commission with adequate organizational structure and qualified expert in various relevant field like economists, statisticians, engineers etc, dealing with various aspects of the economy. Apart from this is the availability of statistical data which also curtails setting up of a central statistical organization with a network of statistical bureau for collecting statistical data and information.14</p> <p>Another point he asserts is having an education base that guarantees high ethical and moral standards, 15 also ensuring economy in administration “particularly in the expansion of ministries and state development all this aforementioned aimed at developmental purpose of a state.</p> <p>No doubt, this research essay, believes that NEEDs despite its unaccomplishment and failure has contributed considerably to the Nigeria development planning.</p>\n\nA HISTORY ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT  AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (NEEDS) AND HER CONTRIBUTION TO POVERTY ALLEVIATION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A HISTORY ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT  AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (NEEDS) AND HER CONTRIBUTION TO POVERTY ALLEVIATION IN NIGERIA", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD) 2001-2010</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1   Introduction</p> <p>1.2   Aims and Objectives</p> <p>1.3   Significance of the Study</p> <p>1.4   Scope of the Study</p> <p>1.5   Research Methodology</p> <p>1.6   Literature Review</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>The Historical Evolution of NEPAD and it’s achievements</p> <p>2.1 Introduction</p> <p>2.2   Historical Evolution of NEPAD</p> <p>2.3   Aims and Objective of NEPAD</p> <p>2.4   NEPAD and the African Union ( AU)</p> <p>2.5   Nigeria’s Strategies in achieving the NEPAD objectives</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p> CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>Nigeria’s Strategic achievement in Economic, Political, Diplomatic and Psychological spheres in realizing the NEPAD objective</p> <p>3.1   Economic role of NEPAD on Nigeria Economy</p> <p>3.2   The Political will of NEPAD objectives</p> <p>3.3    NEPAD and Diplomatic maneuvers</p> <p>3.4   The Psychological motivational role of Nigeria on NEPAD Objectives</p> <p>3.5   Criticisms of NEPAD aims and objective Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>Summary and Conclusions</p> <p>4.1   Summary</p> <p>4.2   Conclusions</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The phrase “Nigeria as the giant of Africa” has been known by many nations because of the leading roles she plays in policy-makings and their implementations.  Also, these leading roles are prevalent in her military prowess, landscape, natural and human resources and natural endowment.  The larger world as well as other African nations has in contemporary time looked up to Nigeria as the “Savior” of African race given the enormity of the resources that mother nature had endowed her with in comparison to other African states.1<br/>Sequel to the above, Nigeria has also played leading and significant roles towards the establishment of various agencies such as Organization of Africa Unity (OAU), Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and African Union (AU) among others.  This same philosophy informed her strategic roles aimed at establishing and realizing the objectives of the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD). 2   To this end, the thrust of this research revolves around the enormous issues, challenges and prospects of this African project called NEPAD.</p> <p>The phrase “Nigeria, the Giant of Africa” has been so used by Nigerians especially our leaders that people of critical mind sometimes wonder what has been the basis for this judgment. In other words, analysts and scholars from time to time have attempted to look at Nigeria’s claim to leadership in Africa from various perspectives. The most popular and noticeable reasons always for these include Nigeria’s population, military strength, land mass, natural and mineral resources, etc. 3</p> <p>In addition, the larger World has in contemporary time looked up to Nigeria to play a leading role in African Affairs, given the enormity of the resources that nature has endowed on her as compared to other African states. Whether Nigeria has been able to justify this confidence is yet another thing</p> <p>What this research seeks to do essentially therefore is an appraisal of what contributions Nigeria has made in realizing the aims and objectives articulated in the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD).</p> <p>1.2   AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</p> <p>As is traditional with programmes of this nature, statements articulating aims and objectives, both long-term and short are always in abundant supply. Whether these aims and objectives are later realized however depends on availability of resources and the kind of determination of the promoters of such programmes.</p> <p>The aims and objectives drawn up by African leaders who are the main promoters of the programmes are all embracing, covering almost all areas of problems, needs and general aspirations of the African continent.</p> <p>However, the long term objective of NEPAD as contained in public enlightenment series published by the Justice Development and Peace Commission of the Catholic Diocese of Ijebu Ode are:-</p> <ol><li>to eradicate poverty in Africa and to place African countries both individually and collectively on a path of sustainable growth and development, and thus halt the marginalization of Africa in the globalization process and</li> <li>to promote the role of women in all activities.</li> </ol> <p>Specific goals of the programme, which are many, include the followings:</p> <ol><li>to achieve and sustain an average percent (7%) per annum for the next 15 years.</li> <li>to ensure that the continent achieves the agreed International Development Goals (I.D.G) as thus:-</li> <li>Reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015.</li> <li>Enrolment of all children of school age in primary school by 2015.</li> <li>Making progress towards gender equality and empowerment of women.</li> <li>Reducing infant mortality ratio by two third (2/3) by 2015.</li> <li>Reducing maternal mortality ratio by two third (2/3) in 2015.</li> <li>Providing access for all who need reproductive health services by 2015.</li> <li>To implement national strategies for sustainable development by 2015 so as to reverse the loss of environmental degradation 1 pollution. 4</li> </ol> <p>1.3 Significance of the Study</p> <p>This work is very significant because it sought to throw light essentially on an African problem that has been begging for an African solution because charity they say must begin at home. If Africa must achieve development then laudable goals and objectives the likes of NEPAD must be pursued and articulated by none other than Africans themselves. The idea therefore conceived by the founders of NEPAD becomes very essential if Africa is to move forward so all efforts at actualizing this is very significant in like manner whatever findings from this research may help in its own contribution towards achieving this development.</p> <p>1.4 Scope of the Study   </p> <p>The scope of the research shall cover the period when Nigeria and other African leaders like South African Thabo Mbeki, Nigeria’s Obasanjo Bouteflika of Algeria met to formulate what then was known as The Millennium African Plan (MAP) in 2000. The birth of NEPAD was 23rd October, 2001 in Nigeria capital city of Abuja. The scope therefore shall be between the years 2001-2010 5</p> <p>1.5 Research Methodology</p> <p>Firstly, historical – critical method will be employed to the study that is, investigating the events, developments and experiences of the past, both in Nigeria and Africa’s Economic Development. This method is handy because it will provide data for background information and contextualization. Data will be obtained from primary and secondary sources. From the primary sources, this research will use aggregate data, official documents, texts, journals, bulletins, magazines, and other periodicals. The internet and other broadcast media will also be utilized. From the secondary source, personal interviews will be conducted</p> <p>1.6 Literature Review</p> <p>This not the first time African leaders have come together to fashion out plans for the development of the continent and all this have been done under the auspices of various names and programmes which scholars like Eyinla 6 have opined that there is a need to avoid duplication, this was what saw the birth of NEPAD on the 23rd October 2001. In his view the harmonized versions of the likes of the Millennium African Plan and New African Initiatives (NAI) was what eventually brought about the NEPAD. Akinsanya 7 on his part had this to say “perhaps, it may not be out of place to remind ourselves that other development initiatives both at the national and continental level such as Nigeria’s vision 2010 and Africa’s Lagos Plan of Action (LPA) have existed as preludes to our current plan (NEPAD).”</p> <p>One of the distinguishing features of NEPAD however is the emphasis on African ownership, integrated development and partnership with developed countries in the South.  NEPAD is basically on African led strategy for sustainable development and poverty reduction in Africa.  It recognizes Africa’s responsibility to create conditions for development by ending conflict, improving economic and political governance and strengthening regional integration. Olaniyan 8</p> <p>Understandably, most institutions like the IMF, World Bank, European Union to mention a few have placed a lot of emphasis on good governance, financial discipline, respect for human rights and provision for conducive atmosphere for living and learning, NEPAD basically is also based on this line of reasoning.</p> <p>Olaniyan 9 as a matter of fact went further to opine that NEPAD is premised on the principles of good governance as a basic requirement for peace, security and sustainable political and socio economic development.  The underlying truth here is that there can never be any kind of meaningful development in the absence of peace or in the midst of anarchy and war.</p> <p>This situation is best understood in Eyinla 10 when he cited the Economist more than anything; African people need to regain their self confidence.  Only then can Africa engage as an equal with the rest of the world devising its own economic programmes and development policies.  Its people also need the confidence to trust each other.  Only then can they make deals to end wars and build political institutions that they actually believe in.</p> <p>One fundamental flaw in African development has been that of leadership.  This part of the NEPAD agenda believes that:</p> <p><em>The resources including capital, technology and human skills that are required to launch a global war on poverty and underdevelopment exist in abundance are within our grasp.  What is required to mobile these resources is and to use them properly is bold, and imaginative leadership.11 </em></p> <p>The cheering news or silver lining for African continent is the view of the European Union when the NAI/NEPAD was presented to her was that it was a welcomed and long overdue initiative based purely on the objective of democracy, transform good governance and human rights.</p> <p>Every cloud has a silver lining and therefore to the pessimistic of NEPAD it is another play in beggar/donor relations.  Eyinla aptly captured it thus when he asserted that it appears  NEPAD is attempting to make Africa’s begging bowl more attractive by adopting various fashionably and political correct spin to a fatigued donor community.12</p> <p>Although Africa leaders themselves seem to think otherwise because they believe that:<br/><em>In this regard, we are not asking for favors, but for fairness and justice, a better life for Africans and secure future for humanity.  This programme is premised on African ownership, African control of the projects and programmes, with African leaders accepting openly and unequivocally that they will play their part in ending poverty and bringing about sustainable development </em>(Africa Forum 2003).13</p> <p>The contribution of Olokun, an economist cannot be overlooked although the work focused in the quest of the Journey so far of the Organization of African Unity to African Union, his contribution through a material.”The role of Nigeria in the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) the material gives us an opportunity for this research because he carefully x-rayed some of the core aims and objectives of the NEPAD agenda thus;</p>

women in the Otukpo clan in Idoma land in the 20th century. However, a brief origin of the Idomas is imperative at this stage. This introduction therefore is intended to go into the polemics of the origin of the Idoma nation.</p> <p>Tamuno1 in his essay on the people of Niger Benue, asserted that”with the exception of the Iyala, the Idoma claimed that their ancestors had a Wukari (i.e Jukun) origin. Such passive comments on the Idoma nation ran throughout almost all the historical works existing, until recently, when Professor E.O Erim of University of Calabar delved into origin of the Idoma nation in his book “The Idoma Nationality”</p> <p>According to Erim2, the Idoma people claim their ancestral home to be Apa, the region that harbours their historical neigbours the jukuns within the plains of the lower Benue. The Idoma nation is made up of twenty-two districts with sixteen Idoma proper and six non-Idoma speaking people comprising of Igede, Etulo, Akpa, Utonkon and Ulayi3. On the other hand, another theory on the origin of the Idoma added Ishake on the southern side living side by side with the Igbo settlers4.</p> <p>However, what is today known as Idoma that lies south of the River Benue with a population that has been estimated at slightly over one million by 2006 census figure, and it’s  area of land located within the broad valley of the Benue River and cross River basin has remained home for the Idomas over the century. The main thrust of the land is a contiguous belt of territory, which stretches from southern banks of River Benue to the northern fringes of Igbo land. These territories lie within latitude 600-300 north and longitude 800east and cover a total land area of approximately 5.955 square kilometers5.</p> <p>The River Benue bound the Idoma people to the North, by parts of Igbo and Ogoja to the South, by the Tiv and Igede to the East and by Igala land to the West. The Idoma unanimously traced their traditions of origin to Apa (Beipi) tentatively associated with one time capital of the legendary kwararafa confederacy, which before the 15th century was under Abakpawatiga. The term Idoma is used to describe the decedents of a migration leader, Idu6. Informants from various ethnic groups for instance Adoka, Ugboju of Otukpo local government among others terrace their genealogies back to certain Idu who was their “putative founder” and the founder of different groups in Idoma land.</p> <p>The king lists of this distinct trace their genecology to the mystical Idu or Idom. There is no doubt that Idu was a historical figure. A typical Idoma genecology shows that Idu is the “father” of the different groups that came to their locations from kwararafa and at different phase of migration</p> <ul><li>Objective of the Study</li> </ul> <p>This study is chosen because of the significant role played by women in Idoma land particularly their cultural responsibilities to the Otukpo clan</p> <p>What stimulated the researcher to embark on this writing is to contribute to knowledge. Nothing much has been written on the significant role played by Idoma women in the area of their cultural responsibilities particularly in Otukpo clan. This study focuses on the cultural responsibilities of women to the Otukpo clan in Idoma land which form a large bulk of the economic activities of the present day Benue state of Nigeria. The study aims at an evaluation of the specific roles of women in Idoma land. It is for the purpose of this work to focus on the various developments achieved by women in Otukpo local government of Benue state which include socio-cultural development, economic development and to bring such significant role played by women into lime light from the period under review</p> <p>Attempt shall be made in this essay to give some knowledge of the nature and diversity of the role of women in the cultural developments of Otukpo clan. The researcher shall also assess the religious, cultural and other factors shaping their various roles and examine policies that have attested the position of women in Otukpo clan during the period under review. Basically, emphasis would be placed on gender relation in the society and how this might have influenced the various activities involving women.</p> <p>This essay focuses on women mainly because their cultural roles have not been sufficiently emphasized in historical writings. They are rather discussed most times as passing references. It is important to note that unless one goes into the field to specifically find out about the cultural contribution of women, there is the tendency of not pursuing in detail the role played by them.</p> <ul><li>Scope of the Study</li> </ul> <p>This essay would endeavor to look at women and their socio-cultural and economic responsibilities in Otukpo local government area of Benue state in the 20th century. Therefore, the study covers the period from 1900 till date. Women activities in Otukpo Local Government will be discussed which will include societal view on women in Otukpo Local Government area of Benue state. Women in economic activities will be discussed, the socio-cultural and economic development of women in Otukpo will be highlighted which include the socio-cultural responsibilities of women in Otukpo, the position of women in the family, the role of women in community service, the role women in festivals, women in commerce and other factors shaping their various roles. It will examines polices that have affected the position of women in Otukpo during the 20th century.</p> <ul><li>Research Methodology and Problems</li> </ul> <p>Since this study is aimed at identifying the role played by women in Idoma land to the Otukpo clan in the 20th century, it is therefore mainly based on oral source and fieldwork, since secondary source materials often deals with activities in the region without specific reference to women. Group inferences were also conducted with those in the same ward in other to determine the various roles played by women in Otukpo clan. Information was also gotten through individuals interviewed.</p> <p>The secondary sources that are consulted for this work are either on things written on the area of study, reports, journals and textbooks from the Archives and libraries.  As might be expected, all the source of information had their limitations. It is found out that there are little or no reference to the cultural activities of women in Otukpo clan and where materials are found on women it centre’s more on feminism and their liberation, and those found relating to the work are not of great relevance to the work.</p> <p>At the Archive, most of the files and textbook asked for on women are not available and at times when found it is of no importance or some pages were completely torn off. The fact that a large number of people is interviewed does not eliminate problem from the oral source, the reason being that the women could not spare their time for interviews even though previous arrangements has been made for it. It is found out that the information contained there are the same as those already gathered. There is also problem in the area of provision of dating for specific events, and also, on how much profit they do realize from their economic ventures.</p> <ul><li>Literature Review</li> </ul> <p>There are no doubts that several literatures abound on Idoma economic and socio-cultural history, with a handful of them on Otukpo Local government in particular. Anthropologists who are not skilled in the discipline of History, and other well renowned historians did not put some of these works together. Our review of literature however aims at presenting a variety of some views put together by different scholars on the subject of our research with the aim of bringing out specific issues that are considered imperative to this wok. It is pertinent to assert that there are certain areas, which these literatures did not cover which this research sought to cover.</p> <p>In Okpeh’s contribution <em>“Studies in the History of Central Nigeria vo11</em>” Okpeh in 10th chapter: “<em>The Pre-Colonial Organization of the Idoma People,</em>” dwelt more on the pre-colonial setting evolving his analysis around the Ojira which according to him was no doubt a very powerful organization in Idoma land7. This author also was able to give us the Idoma setting in pre-colonial period. On the other hand, his work while shedding light on the part of women and their contributions in pre-colonial period, did however, not cover much on our aspect of research.</p> <p>In V.G. Okwu’s book; “<em>The Establishment of Colonial Administration in Idoma land 1921-1930,” </em>Okwu8 started by tracing the origin of Idoma land and went on to discuss the government attitude towards the Idomas in his works and with reference to Otukpo Local    Government area. In this book, he was able to give the origin of Idoma land, which is useful to this research. On the other hand, it did not mention any activities of women in his analysis.</p> <p>Another book consulted in the course of this study was the book of E.O Erim9 who is one of the foremost writers of Idoma literatures, spent more time of his book <em>‘Idoma Nationality’</em> tracing the origin, migration and settlement pattern of Idoma people. He also devoted his time to their ways of life and traditional institution. It is important to note that his work inspired subsequent writers of historical work or literature on the Idoma nation. Hence almost every Idoma literature has his masterpiece referred to. Again given the large ovation that has been generated by his work, the work does not cover every aspect of this research work but was helpful when giving the background of the Idoma people and their origin.</p> <p>Another book that was reviewed in the course of this research was <em>‘Women Marginalization and Politics in Nigeria’ </em>by Jibrin Ibrahim and Amina Salihu. The book is about women in politics in Nigeria and their achievements as far as Government offices,10 are concerned.  The work went further to talk of how women were being marginalized in Nigeria politics in this regard the book was able to give useful information in the aspect of the role played women in politics in relation to the changing roles of women in Nigeria. However, the book is of limited use to this work because the setting of the work is based on Nigeria as a whole with no reference to Otukpo Local Government of Benue State.</p> <p>Another book consulted was “Studies in Igede Development” volume I, (eds) Adagba Okpaga, Indu O. Ode and Godwin E. Ogah11. This book talks about the various developments that have taken place in Igede community of Benue state. While this book is relevant to this study it is limited because of its setting which had no particular reference to Otukpo Local Government Area.</p> <p>In the book by Bernard Obeya Nelson and Prof. J.I. Elaigwu12, tilted <em>“Ucholo kal’ Idoma, A compendium of Apa Heritage</em>. In this book, we were able to see the origin and foundation of Idoma kingdom and in general have been able to provide us with information concerning the Idoma Heritage which is useful in the course of this research and also provided information on the Idoma political development in Benue State. On the other hand this book has omitted some information especially the activities of women in Idoma land and where there is available information much reference is not placed on women activities in Otukpo Local Government area of Benue State.</p> <p>Another book consulted is <em>“Women and Politics</em>” written by Vicky Randall13, published in 1982. The work centers on women participation in politics, impact of polities on women in relation to policy making, their social position in politics and political behavior of women. This work is of limited use because the setting of the work was based on Britain and United States and not on Nigeria it however provided useful insight into women administration and governance in political position.</p>\n\nA SOCIO-ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY OF WOMEN IN OTUKPO CLAN IN THE 20TH CENTURY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SOCIO-ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY OF WOMEN IN OTUKPO CLAN IN THE 20TH CENTURY", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ASPECT OF THE SOCIO-POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC HISTORY OF OWU-IKOSI,AGOWA LAGOS STATE UPTO THE 20TH CENTURY</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background of the Study</p> <p>Objectives of the Study</p> <p>Scope and Limitation of the Study</p> <p>Research Methodology</p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>THE OWU IN THE CONTEXT OF YORUBA HISTORY (1821-1830)</p> <p>Geographical Location</p> <p>Tradition of Origin</p> <p>Socio-Political Organization</p> <p>The Owu war and the dispersal of the people</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>THE OWU-IKOSI OF LAGOS STATE (1860-2000)</p> <p>The Owu Arrival at Ikosi</p> <p>Settlement Pattern</p> <p>Socio-political life of the people</p> <p>Economic Activities of the People</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>OWU-IKOSI AND HER NEIGHBOURS</p> <p>The relationship between Owu-Ikosi and her Immediate neighbour</p> <p>Their Common Heritage</p> <p>The Impact of Federation of Owu People on</p> <p>their Environs</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>Appendix</p> <p>                                                                                       CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1     Background to the Study</p> <p>The history of the Owu-Ikosi cannot be isolated from the history of the Yoruba speaking people in general and of Oyo empire in particular.</p> <p>Owu came to lime light around 1821 and 1828 in what has been known in Yoruba history as Owu war. The war started partly as a result of the struggle between various Yoruba districts as well as the attack on Ife towns by Olowu Amororo, an action considered as sacrilegious because of the sacredness of Ile-Ife in Yorubaland, the supposed birth place of the Yorubas’s.</p> <p>The result of his action became a disaster for the Owu people in their original abode and threw the whole of Yoruba land into war.</p> <p>The Owu were thoroughly defeated by the combined forces of Ibadan and Ijebu. The Oni of Ife, the spiritual head of the Yoruba’s ordered with his constitutional authority that the Owu capital, Orile-Owu must be totally destroyed.</p> <p>As a result of this untoward event, the Owu became scattered people and however formed substantial communities in various parts of Yoruba land.</p> <p>In this study, our focus is on the Owu-Ikosi in Lagos State, were they are referred to as Owu-Eko.</p> <p>Ikosi was found by some of the Owu who fled from their original abode, looking for settlement. At their arrival at Ikosi, they found evidences of inhabitant in some areas. The Owu however looked for a fresh land and decided to stay there. But later it was discovered that it was war that drove the original inhabitant.</p> <p>However, some of the Owu’s later encouraged the people to come back and promised them security and since then, there had never been war. They therefore both named the area as Agbowa, hence Owu-ikosi is a district territory from Agbowa territory.</p> <p>This work is aimed at reconstructing the history of Owu-Ikosi people in Agbowa community in Lagos in the 20th century. Also to show the importance of Owu-Ikosi in the content of their origin, settlement pattern socio-economic and political organization.</p> <p>1.2     Aims and Objectives of the Study</p> <p>The general objectives of this study are to examine the history of Owu-Ikosi town in Agbowa Lagos State in the 20th century.</p> <p>The specific objectives are:</p> <ol><li>To examine the historical origin of the Owu people.</li> <li>To discuss administration structure of Owu land and evaluate its consequences.</li> <li>To examine the socio-cultural, economic and political development of the people under review.</li> <li>Discuss the relationship between the Owu-Ikosi and their neighbour.</li> </ol> <p>1.3     Scope and Limitation of the Study</p> <p>The scope is designed to have a deep insight on the history of the Owu-Ikosi town. The essay will focus on political, economic and socio-cultural activities of the people, along with the changes that were instituted between Owu-Ikosi and its neighbour in the early 20thcentury. Hence, this work covers the period between the turn of 19th 1830 century to 20th 1950 century. Ever then it is still necessary to go far back into time as it is only through such past, against which background the present is ranged that this study with its time – frame could only be appreciated.</p> <p>In other word, this research work covers the time between 1821 when Owu came to limelight in what has been known in Yoruba history as Owu war to the late 20th century.</p> <p>As regard the limitation, the major problem in the course of this research is non-availability of written document or materials on the history of Owu-Ikosi. Another problem encountered was during the oral interview in which the people saw it as a threat to them in knowing their history. They felt it could be used against them hence didn’t want to disclose it. However it took a lot of time before they eventually disclose the information.</p> <p>1.4     Significance of the Study</p> <p>Basically, examine the history of the Owu-Ikosi Agbowa community, Lagos State will enhance our understanding of the history of this people. Because this people have been known to be scattered around the country, a particular study of this nature will help to bring the bits and pieces of their history together.</p> <p>1.5     Research Methodology</p> <p>This study would be approached from a multi-disciplinary perspective. This will involve the use of primary and secondary. Primary sources are mainly derived from oral interview as well as archival materials. Oral interview would be conducted among informed members of Owu-Ikosi people. Bearing in mind the major limitation of oral sources, attempt would be made to confront these sources with secondary sources in order to attain some measure of objectivity. A number of secondary sources exist for the history of Yoruba land generally. Same can be said for the history of Owu-Ikosi. Nevertheless archival materials would be supplemented with the available literature with the Owu-Ikosi people.</p> <p>1.6     Literature Review</p> <p>A numbers of work which are related to the topic were consulted as a background to this study. There is although no specific book written on this topic. But some works have been done on the history of the Owu people which however paved way for the understanding of the people in their early history.</p> <p>The work of A.L. Mabogunje and J.D. Omer-cooper “Owu in Yoruba history”1, gave a brief account of the wider content within which the history of Owu must be seen. It explains the position of the Owus among the Yoruba speaking peoples.</p> <p>Tradition suggests that Owu in Southern Yoruba land was one of the earliest and most important sub-group2. It further explains the outbreak of the Owu war, in which its fall marked a turning point in the history of Yoruba land. Explaining the factors that led to the war, firstly, there was the political crisis in Oyo and the decline of Oyo power both within Yoruba land and outside it. Secondly there was the growth of the slave trade on the coast and in particular the rise of Lagos as a slaving point. Finally, there was the Islamic renaissance in the interland and the spread of Jihadist ideology to the northern confines of Yoruba land3.</p> <p>The deficiency of the book was that it was biased in its explanation to Owu today. In that it recognized only the Owu in Ijebu province, the Owu in Egbaland, the Owu in Ibadan and Oyo provinces. Howbeit, the present study is aimed at explaining the origin of the Owu people in Ikosi in the content of their origin, settlement pattern, socio-economic and political organization.</p> <p>A number of other work were consulted in this duration, Oba I.B. Akinyele’s “Iwe Itan Ibadan”4 is sufficient so also sundry material which are primary in nature derived from the Olowu of Owu kingdom in Abeokuta.</p> <p>It is also gratified to find that in spite of the spread of education, published versions of historical tradition such as Johnson’s history of the Yoruba’s had not obliterated variant accounts which were essential to a clarification of the chain of event.</p> <p>Also, the article “migration”, contributed by William Peterson in David L. Sills (eds.) “international encyclopedia of the social sciences” vol. 9, as well a Edgar Kant’s “classification and problems of migration” that appeared in Philip L. Wagner and Mama W. Mikesch (Ed.) “Readings cultural Geography were consulted on migration as a phenomenon inherent in human nature since the beginning of civilization5.</p> <p>However, as useful and important as the above works are, they still leave gaps that are readily filled by learned journals, national dailies, pamphlets with useful information.</p> <p>It is opposite to state here, however, that most of these printed materials are most useful on the early history of Owus generally, hence the researcher relies almost entirely on oral source on the history of the row vis a vis the theme of this work.</p>\n\nASPECT OF THE SOCIO-POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC HISTORY OF OWU-IKOSI,AGOWA LAGOS STATE UPTO THE 20TH CENTURY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASPECT OF THE SOCIO-POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC HISTORY OF OWU-IKOSI,AGOWA LAGOS STATE UPTO THE 20TH CENTURY", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MUSHIN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF LAGOS STATE (1976-2013)</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE: GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MUSHIN LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION</p> <p>1.1    Introduction</p> <p>1.2    Aims and Objectives of the Study</p> <p>1.3    Scope of the Study</p> <p>1.4    Research Methodology and Problems</p> <p>1.5    Literature Review</p> <p>1.6    Chapterization</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA </p> <p>2.1    Pre-colonial Political Institution in Nigeria</p> <p>2.2    Historical Origin of Mushin Local Government</p> <p>2.3    Organizational Structure of Mushin Local Government</p> <p>2.4    Local Government and Traditional Institution in Mushin</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE: OBLIGATIONS AND DUTIES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCIL       </p> <p>3.1    Socio-political Obligations</p> <p>3.2    Economic Obligations</p> <p>3.3    Educational Obligations</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF MUSHIN LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION     </p> <p>4.1    Introduction</p> <p>4.2    Prospects</p> <p>4.3    Conclusion</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>Appendix</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MUSHIN LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION</p> <p>1.1   INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The need to critically examine the Local Government Administration in Nigeria with specific reference to Mushin cannot be over-emphasized. In the first place, scholars have focused attention on general discussion of the structure of Local Government Administration without looking at the evolution of individual Local Government Administration. This examination would be discussed in phases: pre-colonial, colonial and post colonial phases.</p> <p>Indeed, Local Government Administration in Nigeria has pre-colonial trait. In the first place, the traditional institution was in charge in various Emirates, kingdoms and states. The Emirs, Obas and Obi’s had retinue of chiefs with portfolios in the running of their Local Government Administration. The most striking responsibility of the pre-colonial rulers was the maintenance of law and order within their locality.1</p> <p>The amalgamation of the Northern and Southern protectorates of Nigeria into one administration in 1914 by Lord Frederick Lugard perfected the system of Indirect Rule in Nigeria as it was in India. In other words, indirect rule was a form of local administration2 and the only unique thing about it was that it governed indirectly by making use of the existing traditional structure.</p> <p>The military intervention during which we have many reforms and including the 1976 Local Government reforms. The 1984/1985 reform, the 1988 civil service reforms, as well as the 1989-1991 reform have far-reaching effects on the Local Government which will be discussed in subsequent chapters.</p> <p>Under the 1989-1991 reform, the Federal Government brought the local government into special focus by introducing the presidential system to the Local Government. In 1991, the president in his Budget speech to the Nation granted both financial and administrative autonomy to the local government, and the doctrine of separation of powers came into play.3 This gave rise to:</p> <p>(a)      The office of the chairman and vice-chairman</p> <p>(b)     Secretary to the local government</p> <p>(c)      The executive and</p> <p>(d)     The legislative council was constituted by the legislative council comprised the chairman, vice-chairman and supervisors.</p> <p>At the third tier level of government local government level which is the focus of this research, members of a council ward elected a councilor to represent them in the local government council. All elected councilors within a local government authority meet and take decisions on behalf of all the people who live in that area.</p> <p>The political head of the local government is called chairman who is elected by the members of the local government. The chairman is the head of the executive arm which comprises himself. Vice-chairman and four supervisory councilors. The legislature on the other hand comprises of councilors and headed by the clerk of the house.4</p> <p>There is no way we can talk about local government without knowing the real definition of the term and we must note that there is no consensus among scholars as to the exact meaning of local government. This has led to different definitions of the concept by different scholars, authors of the concept by different scholars, authors and intellectuals. Infact, several studies, researches, projects etc have been undertaken by scholars in various aspects of local government ranging from its finance, problems and prospects, structure, staffing, administration. Development and training, and to the study of the concept of local government itself with the view of giving if the appropriate meaning it deserve. Hence there is no universally acceptable definition of local government, but attempt would be made to harmonise various definitions by different authors and scholars alike.</p> <p>According to Barber, local government means authority to determine and execute matters within a restricted areas inside and smaller than the whole state. The variant, local self government is important that it emphasizes the freedom of the local unit. To a greater or lesser, extent to decide and act on its own initiative and responsibility.5</p> <p>This implies that local government involves the administering of services on a local level by local bodies and in attempting to construct an adequate definitions certain basic distinction must be drawn.</p> <p>Hickey asserted that what local self government means is as follows:</p> <p>The management of services and regulatory functions by locally elected councils and officials responsible to them under statutory and executive with enough financial and other independence to admit of a fair degree of local initiative.</p> <p>From this above definition, it can be deduced that local government is established by law, composed a generality of the people, and subject to the control of National government.6</p> <p>Adebayo conceptualizes local government “As government at local level exercised through representative council established by law to exercise specific functions within a defined area”. He explain that it is this functions that gives the council reasonable control over local affairs as well as staff and financial power.7 From the various definitions of local government, one can say local government means the third-tier of government established by law to carry out specific functions.</p> <p>Hence, the 1976 local government reforms marked the beginning of the development of modern local government system in Nigeria. Local government can be regarded as the connecting rod between the people at the grassroot and central government.</p> <p>Local government is built on the premise of administrative efficiency and political education at the grassroot level. As a result of the importance of local government, it is better placed than other levels of governments to accelerate the pace of socio-economic and political development of Nigerians. It was believed that local government was able to carry out these responsibilities more effectively than both the state and central or federal governments due to its closeness to the people and it ability to easily articulate their needs and demands so that appropriate solutions can be sought. Therefore, local government is in a better position to provide services which require intimate local knowledge and sensitivity.</p> <p>1.2   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The objective of the research, it to examine the growth and development of Mushin Local Government administration. Indeed, many works have been written on local government, but none has specifically been concentrated on Mushin Local Government. This work will therefore be focusing on a neglected area. The case study will highlight the growth and development of Mushin Local Government administration.</p> <p>1.3   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>In the course of carrying out this study an examination of cogent reasons for dividing Lagos into various local government areas would be done. These councils are Badagry, Epe, Ikeja, Ikorodu, Lagos, Agege, Ayerom-Ifelodun, Alimosho, Amuwo-Odofin, Apapa, Eti-Osa, Ibeju-Lekki, Ifako-Ijaiye, Kosofe, Lagos Island, Lagos Mamland, Mushin, Ojo, Oshodi-Isolo, Somolu, and Surulere local government councils. The year 1976 marked the evolution of Mushin Local Government and the year 2003 was the first tenue of democratic spirit.</p> <p>1.4   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND PROBLEMS</p> <p>This research work shall draw heavily from secondary sources such as textbooks, journals, periodicals, articles and newspapers, magazines and from the primary sources such as personal interview to be carried out in the Local Government.</p> <p>1.5   LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>        In writing this essay, materials were consulted in the libraries, like University of Ilorin Library, Kwara State Library. Materials were also consulted in Lagos state library and visits were also paid to the office of Mushin Local Government headquarters. Besides, interviews I were conducted with some officers of the local government. Among the valuable books consulted include MAMSER – Report of the Political Bureau.</p> <p>MAMSER-ABUJA-1987. The book is of immense importance to this work especially the development local government. The book, among others, illuminates the local government performance. Some agree that effectiveness in the performance of local government derives primarily from excessive government control and interference unnecessarily in the councils affairs.</p> <p>The book also points out the structure of local government, functions of local the government and the definition of local government.</p> <p>Another book consulted is Olusegun Obasanjo and Akin Mabogunje’s Element of Democracy – ALF publication 1992. This book made mention of how the western people were being ruled by the ‘Obas’ before the military intervention of January, 1966.</p> <p>And under the 1963 constitution the Federal Republic of Nigeria made provision for each region, a House of Chiefs as a second chamber of the upper House to the House of Assembly, which had the legislative power of the state, but the intervention of the military in 1976 marked the beginning of a new dimension of change with regard to traditional rulership in local government administration.        </p> <p>        Also of immense value to this project is a hand book on Mushin Community titled “Mushin, centre of commerce”. The book talled about Mushin in general.</p> <p>Another useful book consulted is Local Government in Nigeria: the changing scene by G.O. Orewa and J.B. Adewuni, the book deals with the rise of modern local government areas in 1950’s and the decline of these local governments in the 1960’s and 1970’s and the reform introduced on a national scale in 1976.</p> <p>Another book consulted is “Who is Who in Mushin”. This book is a comprehensive detail of the notable traditional rulers. Companies and individuals in Mushin Local Government Area. The contribution of Alex Gboyega in his book titled Political values and local government in Nigeria. The book provided necessary information to the background of this work.</p> <p>1.6   CHAPTERIZATION  </p> <p>        Chapter two of this essay discuss the historical background of local government administration in Nigeria. In this chapter also the pre-colonial political institution in Nigeria, historical origin of Muslim Local Government and Local Government and traditional institution in Mushin will be discuss.</p> <p>Chapter three of this research work discuss the obligations and duties of local government council.</p> <p>Chapter four of this research work discuss the problems and prospect of Mushin Local Government Administration and the conclusion of this research work.                </p>\n\nGROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MUSHIN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF LAGOS STATE (1976-2013)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MUSHIN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF LAGOS STATE (1976-2013)", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>IBADAN NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA FROM 1991-2010</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>Background To The Study</p> <p>Aims And Objectives Of The Study</p> <p>Scope And Limitations Of The Study</p> <p>Research Methodology</p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>Pre 1991 local government system in Ibadan: Ibadan District Council, Ibadan .Native Authority, Ibadan City Council, Ibadan Municipal government.</p> <p>Ibadan District Council                            1861-1914</p> <p>Ibadan Native Authority 1914-1960</p> <p>Ibadan City Council                              1960 – 1976</p> <p>Ibadan Municipal Government 1976-         1991</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>THE MILITARY ERA OF IBADAN NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM 1991 – 1999</p> <p>Alhaji Bashiru Akinola‘S Regime From Sept- Dec. 1991</p> <p>Chief Jacob Akinyemi Aboke From 1992 – Nov 1993</p> <p>Alhaji Solademi Adeyemo From April 1994 – Jan 1996</p> <p>Captain Peter Adebayo From January- March 1996</p> <p>Chief Olajire Obisesan 16th April 1997-26th July 1998</p> <p>Taiwo Akinleye Aug. 1998 – May 1999</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>CIVILIAN ERA IN IBADAN NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM</p> <p>1999 – 2010</p> <p>Olujide Ajao’s Regime May     1999 -2002</p> <p>Prince Remi Irefin’s Regime From June     2002 – June 2003</p> <p>Olugbenga Ayinde Adewusi From July,    2003 – 2010</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background to the Study</p> <p>The History of the Local Government in Nigeria can be conveniently traced to the native administrative system introduced by the colonial government during the colonial era.</p> <p>After the amalgamation in 1914, Lugard proceeded to extend the system of indirect rule to southern Nigeria.</p> <p>In Western Nigeria, Lugard saw the Yoruba states headed by the Oba who traditionally owed some allegiance to the Alafin of Oyo as set-up similar to the Northern emirates under the Sultan of Sokoto. So, using the Obas as Emirs, he imposed his system of indirect rule in the west. But it did not prove successful as in the North. This most of the already independent Obas of Yoruba land were not prepared to countenance. The situation was even worsened when the British made Ibadan subordinate to Oyo. The study shall examine the pre-1991 Local Government system in Ibadan and the performance of Local Government in terms of development under both the Military and Civilian Administration.</p> <p>The focus shall be on Ibadan North East Local Government administration.</p> <p>In 1975, there was nothing like Ibadan North East Local Government, because it was not in existence during that period (1975) it was the local government that existed in Nigeria when Nigeria became a country.</p> <p>Oral tradition has it that when Nigeria became a country from 1861 to 1914, the Local Government in Ibadan Land was called Ibadan District Council (I.D.C).</p> <p>From 1914 to 1960 when Nigeria got independence Ibadan District Council was changed to Ibadan Native Authority. Then from 1960 to February 1976 when 19 states were created in Nigeria, it was called Ibadan City Council (I.C.C) and from February 1976 to 1991, Ibadan City Council was changed to Ibadan Municipal Government and from Tuesday August 27th 1991, Ibadan Municipal Government was former had been recognized as a leading Yoruba state in the 1890s.</p> <p>Secondly, the British thought that the Yoruba Oba possessed autocratic powers as the Fulani Emir. But the Oba’s powers were limited for he could not act without the consent of his council of traditional title-holders. So, the British could not control his people by controlling him.</p> <p>Above all, the idea of taxation, without which Indirect Rule could not function, was strongly disliked and was only slowly and reluctantly accepted.</p> <p>Going down the memory lane, it was recorded that the native Authority system continued until 1976 reforms which attempted to find solution to the problems of Local Government in Nigeria split into 5 Local Government. Namely:</p> <p>Ibadan South East Local Government with its headquarters in Iwo Road</p> <p>Ibadan North Local Government with its headquarters at Bodija</p> <p>Ibadan North West Local Government with its headquarters at Onireke and finally, Ibadan South West Local Government with its headquarters at Oluyole Estate Ring Road, Ibadan.</p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that out of these above Local Governments, our concern here is Ibadan North East Local Government.</p> <p>Ibadan North East Local Government was created on 27thAugust 1991, by the administration of former Head of State General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida. It was carved out of the defunct Ibadan Municipal Government and derived its name from the metropolitan nature of the area. It covered then (12km radius with the Mapo as the centre).</p> <p>The local Government has its administrative headquarter located along the Iwo Road axis of Ibadan a major entry point through, Ife/Ibadan express way end of the Oyo State Capital.</p> <p>The inhabitants of the local Government are predominantly Yoruba, although it is highly heterogeneous, accommodating people from various other tribes who either engage in commercial activities or work in the public service,</p> <ul><li>Aims and Objective of the Study.</li> </ul> <p>Following are the objectives of the study</p> <ol><li>To examine the pre-1991 Local Government System in Ibadan: Ibadan District Council, Ibadan Native Authority, Ibadan City Council, Ibadan Municipal Government</li> <li>To provide General information of the Military Regime of Ibadan North East Local Government.</li> <li>To describe the Civilian Regime of Ibadan North East Local Government.</li> </ol> <ul><li>Scope And Limitation of the Study</li> </ul> <p>The study will cover the pre-1991 local government system in Ibadan: Ibadan District Council, Ibadan Native authority, Ibadan City council as well as Ibadan Municipal Government.</p> <p>On the course of writing this thesis there were many limitation factors that research was encountered. Apart from financial and time constraint of the researcher, several difficulties were encountered on the course of interviewing the interviewer off the study.</p> <p>There were several problems encountered during the process of data collection process. The researcher found it very difficult to collect adequate information or data about all the previous administrators of Ibadan North East Local Government apart from the incumbent chairman Hon. Gbenga Ayinde Adewusi. Some informant did not divulge all the needed materials or information’s about the subject matters because they counted such information sacred and confidential, making it difficult to get some certain facts.</p> <p>Furthermore, the archival materials concerning Ibadan North East Local Government were not available except ones on the Nigeria Local Government. Some of the materials were not completed owing to age and leading to constraining information gathering secondary information, gathering to be. This is because the closet library, the schools library did not have in stock adequate relevant materials. This has caused me to have to travel to Ibadan to make use of the main library of the University of Ibadan and that of Ibadan school of History.</p> <p>Despite the above mentioned difficulties with much efforts and determination, I was able to gather enough information to write this project.</p> <ul><li>Research Methodology</li> </ul> <p>A work of this magnitude required the use of historical methodology in data collection. And this was judiciously used to execute this research work. For most researchers was able to consult the University of Ibadan library for text books and literature such as journals, old newspapers in the University library to have a pre-requisite understanding of the history of the local government</p> <p>Consequently, in the course of writing this project, I embarked on the use oral sources and other published materials to explore my- research work which was one of the sources of getting historical fact of the people therefore, both primary and secondary sources were used in writing this project in the course of writing this project, I embarked on interviewing fourteen people.</p> <ul><li>Literature Review</li> </ul> <p>In writing this project, secondary materials have not been so adequate, particular those that directly deal with the topic understudy. This is not withstanding in the books and other materials I had gathered, I have found a whole lot of help in them. Importantly, the hand books on Ibadan North East Local Government Incorporating highlights on the indelible foot prints of Hon. Olugbenga Ayinde Adewusi is particularly written to include a lot of the administration of Hon. Gbenga Ayinde Adewusi popularly known or called ”Arole”. To a great extent, it provides a lot to this work, the background history of the Ibadan North East Local Government. Apart from that, the Local Government administration in Nigeria Incorporating contemporary issues in Governance and National Directory of Nigeria Local Government Councils edited by Tayo Orekoya and Tony Agbugba also contributed immensely to the opening aspect of this essay.</p> <p>The book which is reviewing the economic and political aspects of the Local Government right from the start of the colonial rule gives fact and figure of the relationship was like between the British and Africans in Nigeria in that period.</p> <p>Furthermore, other books contributed to work apart from the afore mentioned for example, a study of British Indirect rule in Oyo province 1894-1934 are book works on imperialism in Yoruba land  in colonial period.</p> <p>Apart from the materials mentioned above monumental impact. A compendium of Enduring Legacies of a Distinctive Democrat on Ibadan North East Local Government and Ibadan North East Local Government: “Heartily felicitate with Nigeria on the occasion of the celebration At 50 in regard of His Excellence Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan” are all books and thesis used in writing this work. All of them recorded past administrators and chairmen at a glance of Ibadan North East Local Government and the achievements of those past administrative chairmen including Hon. Olugbenga Ayinde Adewusi and how much these administrators have contributed positively to the standard of living of the Local Government.</p> <p>The book traces the Local Government Administration and also give us the relevant information of Ibadan North East Local Government. The book also gives us the detail that the present Local Government system in Nigeria is dated back to 1952 when the system was patterned along the British model which is based on the principle of indirect rule. It also recorded that the native authority system continued until 1976 reforms which attempted to find solution to the problems of local Government in Nigeria. In addition: the pamphlet and handbook compiled by information division Ibadan North East Local Government Agodi Ibadan titled The Ibadan North East Local Government also contributed a lot in writing this project. The book traces the origin of Ibadan North East Local Government and the past administrators and chairmen at glance both military and civilian regime. It also gives us the details about the British statistics of the five new Local Government created from the Ibadan Municipal Government. It also traces the Geography/Economy/the Education, Medical and Health matters of the Ibadan North East Local Government. It shows us the Wards Delineation and the Map of Ibadan North East local government.</p>\n\nIBADAN NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA FROM 1991-2010<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IBADAN NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA FROM 1991-2010", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>IJEBU-JESHA UNIONS CONFERENCE  AND THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF IJEBU-IJESHA 1919-2010</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0    INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4    RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND PROBLEM</p> <p>1.5    LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>REFERENCES</p> <p> CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>2.0    IJEBU-JESHA UNIONS’ CONFERENCE BEFORE 1946</p> <p>2.1    EGBE OMO ILU IJEBU-JESHA FROM 1919-1923</p> <p>2.2    IJEBU-JESHA UNION FROM 1923-1933</p> <p>2.3    IJEBU-JESHA UNION FROM 1933-1936</p> <p>2.4    IJEBU-JESHA UNION FROM 1936-1946</p> <p>2.5    INAUGURATION OF IJEBU-JESHA UNIONS’</p> <p>CONFERENCE IN 1946</p> <p>REFERENCES</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>THE REGIME OF EACH PRESIDENT FROM 1946 TO PRESENT</p> <p>3.1    DANIEL BOSEDE ALOBA’S REGIME FROM 1946-1966</p> <p>3.2    CHIEF F.O FATIREGUN’S REGIME  FROM 1974-1984</p> <p>3.3    CHIEF J.O AGUNSOYE’S REGIME FROM 1984-1991</p> <p>3.4    CHIEF D.B AGUNBIADE’S REGIME        FROM 1991-2002</p> <p>3.5    PRINCE OLATUNDE OLASHORE’S REGIME FROM 2002 TO PRESENT</p> <p>REFERENCES</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>4.0    THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF IJEBU-JESHA UNIONS’ CONFERENCE</p> <p>FROM 1946 TO PRESENT</p> <p>4.1    RELIGIOUS IMPACT</p> <p>4.2    EDUCATIONAL IMPACT</p> <p>4.3    SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT</p> <p>4.4    CONCLUSION</p> <p>REFERENCES</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference is the Umbrella Organization for all Social and Cultural Societies in Ijebu-jesha. An organization, according to the Oxford Dictionary means, a group of people who form a business, club etc, together in order to achieve a particular aim. Therefore, Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference is formed by some Ijebu-jesha indigenes in diaspora who share the same motives.</p> <p>This research work principally focuses on the gradual progressive unions right from Egbe Omo Ilu Ijebu-jesha in 1919 and to Ijebu-jesha Social Club in 1923, Ijebu-jesha Union in 1933 and finally in 1946, the Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference after gathering other states and zones all over Nigeria and some parts of the world. Also it focuses on the socio-economic development of Ijebu-jesha from 1946 to date. In order to appreciate this work, it is pertinent to briefly examine the origin of Ijebu-jesha and its people.</p> <p>Ijebu-jesha is one of the largest towns in Ijesha land in the present day Osun State of Nigeria. It ranks next to Ilesha in terms of historical significance, size and population. Ijebu-jesha town has twenty three settlements villages and small towns. Ijebu-jesha people have been known from time immemorial as adventurers who broke the barriers of the homeland to traverse many countries on the West Coast of Africa e.g Ghana, and every nooks and crannies of Nigeria. They were either as traders or as members of police and armed forces which in those days were commonly known as the West African Frontier Force (WAFF).</p> <p>1.2   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The concern of this project is to examine Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference Progressive Unions which first emerged in 1919, as Egbe Omo Ilu Ijebu-jesha. Therefore, we will look at the groups before 1933 and between 1933 to 1946. Also from 1946 when the Annual Conference emerged, till present.</p> <p>Furthermore, this project work will also examine the different progressive stages of development before the Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference in 1946, that is starting from the inception of the ‘Egbe Omo Ilu Ijebu-jesha from 1919-1923, the Ijebu-jesha Social Club from 1923-1933, Ijebu-jesha Union from 1933-1936, and from 1936-1946, the expansion of the Union to other branches, and finally the inauguration of the Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference on the 12th of January, 1946.</p> <p>Consequently, the regime of each president from 1946 till date will also be discussed and the Socio-economic development of Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference from 1946 to present will also be discussed, with Educational impact, religious impact and the socio-economic impact.</p> <p>1.3   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The scope of this research work is to examine Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference from 1933 to present, their impact and activities on the socio-economic growth of Ijebu-jesha town and Ijesha land, as a whole; also take a brief look at the events that occurred before 1933, when the Union emerged. How they operated before the Union, their impact and their contribution to Ijebu-jesha town. Also the structure made by the union.</p> <p>However, my research work will also examine the events that occurred between 1933 and 1946. The research work will also examine the various progressive and developmental stages in Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference. To do this, the work is divided into four chapters. The first chapter discusses the Introduction, Aims and Objectives, Scope of the Study, Research Methodology and Literature Review. Moreover, Chapter Two discusses the Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference before 1946. in it, is the Egbe Omo Ilu Ijebu-jesha from 1919 to 1923, The Ijebu-jesha Social Club from 1923 to 1933 and Ijebu-jesha Unions from 1933 to 1936 her expansion from 1936 to 1946. Also to conclude Chapter Two we shall discuss the inauguration of Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference in 1946.</p> <p>Furthermore, in my Chapter Three, I will discuss the regime of each president from 1946 to present, which include the regime of Daniel Bosede Aloba from 1946-1966, Chief F.O Fatiregun’s regime from 1974-1984, Chief J.O Agunsoye’s regime from 1984-1991, Chief D.B Agunbiade’s regime from 1991-2002 and Prince Olatunde’s Olashore’s regime from 2002 to present. While in my Chapter Four, I shall discuss the Socio-economic Development of Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference from 1946 to present, which includes: the Educational impact to the Society, Religious Impact and Socio-economic Impact.</p> <p>1.4   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>In this work, the researcher shall make use of the following sources for the collection of data;</p> <p>Primary Source: Information was obtained from old and active members of the Union, and also the indigenes of Ijebu-jesha town about the activities, achievements and constraints of the Union, since inception. Effort was also made to obtain document on the activities of the Union. Also about the history of the Primary School and Ijebu-jesha Grammar School, (I.J.G.S) and even the origin of Christianity and Islam in Ijebu-jesha.</p> <p>Apart from the Primary Source, I have got written account from a pioneer member, which I made use of, likewise the indigenes were interviewed in order to set first hand information. The internet was also consulted for information about the Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference.</p> <p>Moreover, the problems encountered was that, book was not found in the library that deals with Progressive Unions and the socio-economic development of Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference, but only books of Yoruba History, History of Ijesha etc were found.</p> <p>Perhaps, due to the fact that the topic of my essay in question has never been attempted before, and their has been no single work that has been done comprehensively of the Progressive Unions and the Socio-economic Development of the Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference from 1919 to present.</p> <p>However, the researcher faced the problem of lack of acute information on the topic. Therefore, I proceeded to the field to conduct interviews for Oral source. The Interviews were conducted in vernacular (Yoruba) and English, the interview were conducted at Ijebu-jesha and Lagos. Those whom I had personal interview with are the key members of the Union, like Mr.J.O Oginni, Pa Fademi, Mr D.B Agunbiade, Mr J.A Oderinde (Current Secretary), Mrs J.B Oluwi (The Current Treasurer) Prince Tunde Olashore (The Current President), Mrs Ojumu, Canon Ojumu, Engr. Ogundipe etc. therefore I did not only interview the members of the Union but also the indigenes who knew the Union, since her inception.</p> <p>Although some of the pioneer members that I interviewed are old and have lost some memories, their voice were barely audible, so the researcher had to take them to extremely quite place where their would be no distraction and the interview was conducted in their house. While the current members are of middle age, who have sharp memories.</p> <p>In essence this work will serve as an essay containing new information and analysis.</p> <p>1.5   LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>One major problem a researcher in history is bound to face is the problem of Secondary Sources. Most of the published works are pamphlets which can at best be described as a brilliant summary in most cases, rather than detailed work. The bulk of the written materials on my work, emanated from dissertation and few unpublished thesis. I also have some Oral Sources.</p> <p>Oni’s “A HISTORY OF IJESHA” examines the origin of Ijesha people in respect to Ijebu-jesha town. He also discusses the economic activities of the Ijesha people. He also describes the geographical location of Ijesha land.</p> <p>“THE HISTORY OF THE YORUBA” by Johnson gives a detailed history of the Origin of the Ijesha and also a description of the various Political Kinship Systems and economic activities of the Ijesha people. He further discusses the major occupation of Ijesha people and their religions.</p> <p>However, Yoloye’s “OLATUNDE OLASHORE’S ADVENTURES IN LIFE AND LIVING”, deals with the life and time of the current President of the Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference.</p> <p>Aribisala Oba Taiwo’s work “EGBOROLAND” discusses the origin of Ijebu-jesha. He goes further to examine how Ijebu-jesha was formerly known as Egboro land.</p> <p>Also, another work that needs to be mentioned in my research work is Fatiregun’s work “ITAN EGBE I.J.U” which discusses and narrates the events that occurred from 1919 when the I.J.U Lagos branch was formed till 1946. The event covered the period before the emergence of Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference.</p> <p>Another work that needs to be mentioned in my work is “en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ijebu-jesha”.</p> <p>Here it tells us where Ijebu-jesha is situated. Also tells us how the people of Ijebu-jesha are the core of Ijesha and they are noted for their dogged industry.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference in their work­ — “THE 70th ANNIVERSARY AND EGBORO DAY”– discusses the origin of Ijebu-jesha Union and the Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference journey so far, since her inception. Also they had the list of the past and current executives.</p> <p>“50 YEARS OF IJEBU-JESHA SOCIAL CLUB” by Akinyemi et al examines the relationship between Ijebu-jesha Social Club and Ijebu-jesha Unions’ Conference. Also the book discusses briefly the history of Ijebu-jesha and the founding of Ijebu-jesha and Local Government Administration in Ijebu-jesha. Also some pictures are given from this book.</p> <p>Similarly, another work that needs to be mentioned in my research work is Esugbohungbe et al’s work “A Comprehensive Factual History of Ijebu-Jesha”. In this work the writers discus a bridged factual history of the parental birth relation of the Oba Owa Ajibogun of Ijesha land and the Oba Owa Ojoba Agigiri of Ijebu-jesha. Also they discussed the history of the founding of the Anglican Denomination of Ijebu-jesha and the history of Ijebu-jesha Grammar School and Ijebu-jesha Mosque.</p> <p>These works have been a great deal of help to my research work.</p>\n\nIJEBU-JESHA UNIONS CONFERENCE  AND THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF IJEBU-IJESHA 1919-2010<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IJEBU-JESHA UNIONS CONFERENCE  AND THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF IJEBU-IJESHA 1919-2010", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INDIGENOUS IRON WORKS IN THE 19TH CENTURY IN BENIN CITY.</strong></p> <p>TABLE OF CENTENTS</p> <p>INDIGENOUS IRON WORKS IN THE 19TH CENTURY IN BENIN CITY.</p> <p>Table of contents</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1     Objectives of Study</p> <p>1.2     Scope of Study</p> <p>1.3     Significance of Study</p> <p>1.4     Methodology and problems of Research</p> <p>1.5     Literature review</p> <p>1.6     Historical perspective of Benin</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>INDIGENOUS TECHNOLOGY IN NIGERIA IN 1900</p> <p>2.1     Indigenous technology in Nigeria</p> <p>2.2     Development of Indigenous Technology in Nigeria</p> <p>2.3     Trade and market for existing Technology in Nigeria</p> <p>2.4     Impact of Traditional skill in Nigeria.</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>IRON TECHNOLOGY IN BENIN IN THE 19TH CENTURY</p> <p>3.1     Iron works in Benin</p> <p>3.2     Mode of production</p> <p>3.3     Product and values of the Industry</p> <p>3.4     Impact of Iron work in Benin</p> <p>3.5     Economic survey of Benin</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>THE GUILDS AND APPRENTICESHIP IN IRON INDUSTRY</p> <p>4.1   The feature of guilds</p> <p>4.2   Duration Apprenticeship</p> <p>4.3   Nature and categories of Apprenticeship</p> <p>4.4   Ritual Aspect of Iron works</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>INFLUENCE OF COLONIALISM AN IRON INDUSTRY.</p> <p>5.1    Advent of colonial Rule</p> <p>5.2    Colonial influence on the indecline of Iron technology</p> <p>5.3    Introduction of European goods and the incidence on from</p> <p>CONCLUSION                                                           </p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1:1      OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</p> <p>Technology as defined by Berry, Is “any Application of discoveries of the scientific methods to the problems of man and environment in peace and war” Adeniyi refers to it as ‘a process whereby an individual or a group of people acquire a skill necessary to operate a hand ware either from another persons or through development.</p> <p>To this end, series of meetings, conferences, seminars, tayslops and workshops have been organized and held on the indigenous production and the advancement of iron tools in Nigeria and Africa at large.</p> <p>Thus, the objective of this work is to debunk the Eurocentric belief that Africa has no technology worthy of studying before the arrival of European. Also, that Africa are not intelligent enough to process from technology. And also, to locate technology in the realm of the study, Iron industry \\ works in Benin.</p> <p>To this end, the research work is to study the general trend since inception of Iron technology in Benin down to it decline. As a result of competition pose by importation of purier and cheaper Iron bans from European in the 19th century.</p> <p>1:2                        SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>          West Africa people early learned to mine and utilize their supplies of three important metals-gold, Iron and copper. The production of gold at an unidentified place on the West Africa coast long before the birth of Christ. When Iron was first worked, and also it was first used at a large scale, is not really known. Yet it is certain that knowledge of Iron smiting was gained before the beginning of Christian era. Some historians believe of the knowledge was transmitted from Libya in about 500Bc others believed that it came from upper mile around 300Bc; we know that the rise of empire partially due to their possession of abundant Iron weapons and tools.</p> <p>Thus, this essay deals mainly with indigenous technology, a case study of Benin Iron works in the 19th century. The period covered the pre-colonial period, the incursion of Europeans and lastly, the period covered the impact of Iron works on the political and socio-economic character of the people, also the decline of Iron technology and technology as a whole in Nigeria at large.</p> <p>1:3      SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</p> <p>The existence of indigenous industries over the centuries in Nigeria is quite significant for study and history of Nigeria.</p> <p>The significance of this study is to illustrates, the interdependence that existed between the Sudan forest zones which in turn encouraged the movement of people, goods and ideas from North to south, east to west and vice versa. The study also give an insight into the nature and degree of interaction that Obtained among Nigerian peoples and this also support the argument for a pre-existing unity among people in the Nigeria area before the coming of Europeans.</p> <p>The significance of the study is to also analyze what obtain in Nigeria before the incursion of the colonial Rule, i.e. Nigeria communities engaged in trade which arose from the fact that different village specialized in different crafts depending on the available raw material.</p> <p>This however is an evidence used by Africa writers to debunk the Euro-centric on the fact that they developed Nigeria and Africa as A whole in term of technological advancement.</p> <p>Importantly, the study seeks to examine how objects were manufactured from Iron-ore with a case study of Iron industry in Benin. This effort is undertaken because, the indigenous techniques of production of Iron smithing in traditional societies have virtually atrophied due to neglect and disdain. The situation is born out of the fact that their position has been overshadowed by the importation of foreign goods and Equipment.</p> <p>Furthermore, the significance of the study is to show or draw attention to a hitherto neglected aspect of Nigeria history. Political history had been overemphasized in the past leading to a study of the spectaculation such as war and lives and activities of great men and rulers. By studying indigenous industries, we can now appreciate the place and importance of the masses who helped to bring great men into lime light and who helped to provide strong economic bases (sometimes through their crafts) that support the various governments.</p> <p>Thus, individuals, bodies and groups are to recognized indigenous traditional values and harness them into a sound base for technological take off and for Nation building.</p> <p>1:4     METHODOLOGY AND PROBLEMS OF RESEARCH</p> <p>Methodology is the set of methods and principles that are used when studying a particular subject or doing a particular kind of work (Longman dictionary 4th Edition).</p> <p>Primary and secondary source were basically used for this project works. The following methods used in obtaining the date for this research work. Content analysis of published and unpublished material, electronic device (internet Browsing). Oral interview and participant observation, like visitation to Archives.</p> <p>First place visited for content analysis of published material was the library; University of Ilorin library, Harri library. University of Benin, Ambrose Alli University Ekpoma, also state libraries was visited.</p> <p>In the area of primary source, oral interview was conducted on the families who practice Iron works popularly called Igun (Ogun) in Benin City.</p> <p>Observation which is the process of watching something for a period of time. Thus, the researcher participated by seeing and feeling during the research works.</p> <p>It should be noted that problems is that situation that causes difficulties. Problem encountered by the researcher was to get and gathered material because little was discussed on the research topic. At the archives, there are no files that contain direct information on Iron works in Benin and collections information were often scanty and rough because of the old nature and poor Handle i.e. they are not visible. And also, some files have been withdrawn from use because they are really damage.</p> <p>Another problems encountered is the area if finance. Before any interview could be made certain amount of money need to be paid to the interviewer. Another major problem was the mobility. The researcher did not have adequate knowledge of the environment.</p> <p>1:5     LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>          Benin been the home of Art work, had attracted many to have and maintain regular diplomatic contact with. Benin Iron works give plenty evidence of complex society as well as a university acclaimed artistic achievement.

The Edo speaking group of people covers an area extending from the broken, hilly country that boarder the igbirra and Igala in the North, to the edge of the coastal swap forest in the south, were their neighbors are Ijos and Itsekin. Their other  boundaries are with the Yoruba to the west and Igbo to the east.</p> <p>The origin of the Kingdom is lost in myth and antiquity from which survives only a traditions of migration from east that is common to many west Africa people.</p> <p>Tradition asserts that the Edo people became dissatisfied with the rule of a dynasty of semi mythical kings, the Ogisos, and in the 13thcentury they invited prince Oranmiyan of Ife to rule them. His son Eweka is regarded as the as the first Oba, or king, of Benin, through authority would remain for many years with hereditary, order of local chiefs. Late in the 13th century, royal power began to assert itself under the Oba Ewedo and was firmly established under the most famous Oba, Ewuare the great. (reigned c. 1440-80), who was describe as a great warrior and magician He established a hereditary succession to the throne and vastly expended the territory of the Benin kingdom, which by mid 16th century extended from the Niger river delta in the east to what is now Lagos in the west (Lagos was in fact founded by a Benin army and continued to pay tribute to the Oba of Benin Until the end of the 19th century).</p> <p>Ewuare was succeeded by a line of strong Obas, chief of whom were Ozolua the conqueror (c. 1481-c. 1504, the son of Ewuere) and Esigie  (early to mid 16 th century , the son of Ozolua) who enjoy good relations with the Portuguese and sent ambassador to their king. Under these, Obas of Benin became a highly organized state. It numerous craft men were Organized into guild, and the kingdom became famous for ivory and wood carvers. It brass smiths and bronze casters excelled making naturalistic heads, bas-reliefs, and other sculptures. All in all Benin attained her greatest glory and military achievement through the increase in metal works.</p>\n\nINDIGENOUS IRON WORKS IN THE 19TH CENTURY IN BENIN CITY.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INDIGENOUS IRON WORKS IN THE 19TH CENTURY IN BENIN CITY.", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>OIL PALM PRODUCTION IN EJIGBO COMMUNITY IN OGUN STATE 1960-2000</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/></p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1      OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2      SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND PROBLEMS</p> <p>1.4      LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.5      HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</p> <p>1.6      CHAPTER ANALYSIS</p> <p>1.7      NOTES AND REFERENCES</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO      </p> <p>THE ORGANIZATION OF THE INDUSTRY</p> <p>2.1      THE LABOUR</p> <p>2.2      TECHNIQUES OF OIL PALM PROCESSING</p> <p>2.3      THE PRODUCT OF OIL PALM</p> <p>2.4      NOTES AND REFERENCES</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>MARKETING OF OIL PALM PRODUCT</p> <p>3.1      THE LOCAL MARKET</p> <p>3.2      THE LONG DISTANCE MARKET</p> <p>3.3      PATRONAGE</p> <p>3.4      NOTES AND REFERENCES</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT</p> <p>4.1      DOMESTIC USE</p> <p>4.2      EMPLOYMENT</p> <p>4.3      ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</p> <p>4.4      THE SOCIAL VALUE</p> <p>4.5      NOTES AND REFERENCES</p> <p>CONCLUSION       </p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY   </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY.</p> <p>Indigenous arts in Nigeria are as old as time immemorial and contemporary as yesterday. They are as old because they have got their history back in antiquity and contemporary because they are still with us today. Often, when technology is being talked about, the attention of many people first goes to the advanced technologies in countries like Europe and America without paying attention to the simple arts and crafts which emanated from Africa. This research essay aims at pointing out that modern science and technology in Europe today derived their origin from simple arts and crafts. There are abundant of arts and crafts upon which, the traditional skills are based, but I shall focus on oil-palm production with a view to stressing the fact that had long been in existence in Africa as it was the case in developed countries like Britain and America. It is aimed at bringing into limelight the technology involved in the oil-palm production since the earliest times.</p> <p>Oil-production had for a long time been an important phenomenon in Nigeria localities. It developed with the people. Oil-palm takes great part and parcel of the cooking of food, making of bath soaps, e.t.c. Its importance, therefore cannot be over-emphasized. The research aims at showing the active participation of indigenous people through the harnessing and utilization of local materials and national resources. The essay will show that all the materials tools, skills, and techniques used are locally available.</p> <p>Furthermore, the study will show the various ways and systems by which the oil-palm is being produced which vary from one locality to another based on geographical environment and beliefs.</p> <p>The study will further show that the oil-palm production has also been useful in cooking of meals and making of bath soaps. It presents the various sites of the community and also shows that Africans also engage in indigenous occupation such as oil-palm production.</p> <ul><li>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>The scope of this research is from the period 20th century to 21st century. The different methods used in the industry i.e, oil-palm industry in Ejigbo community, Osun state. In this work also, attempt will be made at century prior to the 21st century.</p> <p>The researcher aims at showing the active participation of indigenous people through the harnessing and utilization of local materials and natural resources, and the different processing or processes used in the production of the oil-palm. Also, the production of the palm kernel in general which is being used for further production of other useful products.</p> <p>Through the oil-palm industry, quite a lot of needs of people were met in terms of local lamps which were used for illuminating in darkness. Oil-palm is being put on the local lamp which is made of clay with cotton on it. Oil-palm is used as medicine for treating ulcer and stomach-ache  and cough for adults and children.  It shall be seen at the end that indigenous industries have their rightful place in our local communities, abroad and areas where misconceptions are still rampant that Africans are technologically  backward.  The study will further show that oil-palm has also been useful by carpenters and wood workers to prevent decaying.</p> <ul><li>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND PROBLEM.</li> </ul> <p>In writing this essay a number of works have been consulted with ranged from secondary to primary sources. A good number of past essays and textbooks were consulted. The bulk of this work depends mostly on oral interview. Also contacted is the Ejigbo community library. Though, there is dearth of journals by better Life Programme an arm of the local government. This publication, however, gives less attention to oil  palm industry in Ejigbo community and other indigenous technology in the area.</p> <p>Furthermore, the researcher interviewed a number of people in the town who were major producers of oil palm in Ejigbo community. It is also important to note that during the interview, the researcher usually asked of the age of the owners of those oil palm industries.</p> <p>It is from the information gathered from these various sources that the researcher had finially attempted to present objective account of indigenous technology in Ejigbo community, a study of oil palm industry since 1960-2000.</p> <p>A work of this nature cannot be fully undertaken without some constraints such as the unwillingness of the informants to gives information to the researcher, because some of them thought that the interviews would be used for tax assessment. In solving this problem, the informants had to be convinced and englightened on the purpose of the interview before they could pass some information to the researcher.</p> <p>In spite of this, some still demanded for gifts before information could be given. These limitations not withstanding, the researcher overcame such constraints through determined efforts and repeated calls which had proved quite successful for the study.</p> <ul><li>LITERATURE REVIEW.</li> </ul> <p>Various people have appreciated the works of arts, especially, the indigenous industry and have attempted to find out about its origin, its technique and its development through researches. Its is for this purpose that the present study had undertaken a review of the relevant literature on oil palm industry in Ejigbo community. Books consulted are not only limited to works on oil palm, but emphasis also placed on books written by scholars on social and Economics developments of oil palm Industry.</p> <p>Martin susan’s oil palm and protest discusses the demand and market for the industry. Olufemi Ekundare’s  An economic History of Nigeria provides information on the economic development of oil palm industry to the people and even to Nigeria as a whole. Brouk B’s plant consumed by Man, helps to butteress the fact that oil palm as a product is essential and very useful in the society for domestic and some other uses, it also helps in the aspect of patronage.</p> <p>Also relevant is T.M Ilesanmi;s book titled, Ise Isenbaye. The book also is of help to me especially in the area of production and technique. It was more clearer to the reader without any problem.</p> <ul><li>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</li> </ul> <p>Ejigbo community is a major Yoruba town in Osun state of Nigeria. It is about 40kilometers from Oshogbo, the capital of Osun state. The 1963 Nigerian census estimated its population to  be 46,000 with a landmass of 25square kilometers. Populated to be 132,641 as at the 2006 cenus.</p> <p>According to oral history, Ejigbo is an ancient settlement founded by Akinjole Ogiyan, abbreviation of Ogiriniyan, right after the old Oyo. Ogiyan has a rich pedigree been a descendant of Oduduwa and the ruling family of Ife. Together with  his brothers, particularly the Akire , the founder of Ikire-Ile, they left Ile- Ile with Oranyan(oranmiyan),the founder of old oyo,to establish their own towns. The fact that ogiyan, is from Ile-Ife is confirmed by Ejigbo Mekun’ the name of a market in Ile-Ife. Akinjole settled many other villages spread around yorubaland. He is the paramount ruler and prescribed authority over many, if not all of them.</p> <p>The following towns and villages ,among others were under him, Ika, igbon,olosin ologede,inisa, aato, ijimoba, afake , ilawo, inisa edoro, isundunrin, olia,ado ori-oke,ayegunle, idigba, ibogunde, songbe, olorin osuntedo and iwata.</p> <p>Around 1835, Ejigbo came under Ibadan, when the Ibadan army moved  to protect Osogbo from Ilorin invaders. In fact, detachments from Ejigbo assisted the Ibadan army in the ijaye, jalimi, and kiriji wars between 1860 and 1866.</p> <p>Ajayi ogboriefon, balogun and leader of the Ibadan army in the jalumi war circa 1860 and 1878 was a native of Ejigbo from the Akala compound and his mother, Alagbabi was the daughter of an ogiyan of Ejigbo. In 1934, when the then government retioined to the terms of the 1893 treaty which recognized Ibadan’s independence and gazettes the bale  and divisional council of Ibadan as an independent native authority, five district Obas including the ogiyan were made members of the Divisional Council.</p> <p>The traditional markets are the ones in the centre of the town, and few others in some other quarters. There is now a traditional markets fixed for every Saturdays as is the case in many Yoruba towns. It is situated at the centre of the town, in front of the palace and it is also the most favored for night shopping and other social activities.</p> <p>In the past, it was used as recreational centre for the town, and therefore, was attended by many who even had nothing to buy or sell.</p> <p>Ejigbo did not escape foreign influence especially, the nineteenth century events that permeated Nigeria. Its people and culture changed with the flow. For example, many people have been converted to Islam and Christianity. The Baptist, being the dominant Christian mission in the town, now has a number of churches and it was through its efforts that the people of the town established the first fully fledged secondary grammar school; the Ejigbo Baptist high school followed the Asarudeen Grammer School. Ejigbo is tolerant of its diverse faiths. This is demonstrated in the joint celebration annual Orisa Ogigan festival.</p> <p>Although, there is no substantial evidence as to the exact date of the origin of oil-palm industry in Ejigbo community, but oral evidence suggests that the industry is as old as the emergence of the town around 14th century AD. But Ejigbo community and its province have relatively nitrous land, there seems to be enough food materials and farm produce which are being planted in large scale. The palm tree of which so many materials are being got from such as brooms which are meant for cleaning of the environment, palm wine, palm kernel, to mention few is a very good example.</p> <p>Moreover, oral evidence suggests that the availability of these products by and large, made and encouraged the expansion of Ejigbo community market. The market became expanded as a result of settlement in Ejigbo community by people from far and near who participated in this flourishing business of buying and selling of the product of these oil-palm industries.</p> <p>These markets became avenues for heterogeneous population with different cultural background. Therefore, availability of Ejigbo community, made oil-palm industries a flourishing one in Ejigbo community to date.</p> <ul><li>CHAPTER ANALYSIS.</li> </ul> <p>This research covers four chapters ranges from 1960 – 2000. The first chapter deals with the aims and objectives of the study, scope of the study, research methodology and problem, literature review and historical background of the industry. While the second chapter deals with the organization of the industry that is, the labour, techniques of oil palm processing, and the product of oil palm. While chapter three entails the marketing of palm oil product, that is the local market, the long distance market patronage. And the last chapter deals with the value of the product such as the employment for the people, impacts on local economic developments</p>\n\nOIL PALM PRODUCTION IN EJIGBO COMMUNITY IN OGUN STATE 1960-2000<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OIL PALM PRODUCTION IN EJIGBO COMMUNITY IN OGUN STATE 1960-2000", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL INSTITUTION IN IBADAN IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</p> <p>CHAPTERIZATION</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>Statement of the problem</p> <p>Objective of the Study</p> <p>Scope of the Study</p> <p>Research Methodology</p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO         </p> <p>The Evaluation of Ibadan and its Political Institution</p> <p>The Establishment of a New Government in Ibadan</p> <p>The Hierarchical Structure of the Political Institution</p> <p>Ibadan under Colonial Rule</p> <p>The Emergency of Olubadan Title and His Coordinating Roles.</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>New Socio-Political Structure in Ibadan</p> <p>Impact of British Intervention in the 19th Century Warfare</p> <p>Role of Ibadan in the Extension of British Influence in the Interior</p> <p>The status of Ibadan in the Political Order</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR       </p> <p>Ibadan as the Regional Capital  </p> <p>Reflections on the Contributions of Ibadan Indigenes</p> <p>Impact of Provision of Basic Amenities</p> <p>The Economic Order in Ibadan</p> <p>Impacts of Politics on Ibadan</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Notes and References</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The need to examine the changing role of Traditional Political Institution in Ibadan is considered to complement the existing literature on Ibadan as a polity. Indeed, various aspects of Ibadan history have been documented and by different scholar but a sequential appraisal of the changes witnessed by the Traditional Political Institution have been treated in passing. The desire to dedicate this project to the issue is to further illuminate an important aspect of Ibadan history.</p> <p>Even though, the project focuses on the 20th century. The events before the period, where the Traditional Institution played prominent role, will be accommodated to provide an holistic appraisal of the changes witnessed by the Traditional Political Institution at Ibadan.</p> <p>1.2    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The objective of writing on this topic is to examine the different changes that occurred within the Traditional Political Institution of Ibadan in the 20th century.</p> <p>Generally, change is the transformation of an event, a system, an object or a process. It may either be qualitative or quantitative or both. The concern of this essay project is primarily with the transformation and modification of an important event in the Institution of Ibadan society. These Institutions or units are the offices of the Traditional Ruler in Ibadan which bestows an identifiable status on the incumbent.</p> <p>Although, many scholars both Historians and non-Historians have given considerable attention to the Period Colonial Administration, not only in Ibadan but also in the whole of Yoruba land.</p> <p>Yet, there is no work which has studied the theme of this essay in the context of the changing role of the Traditional Political Institution of Ibadan in the 20th century.</p> <p>Finally, it is the desire to investigate what changes that occurred in the Traditional Political Institution of Ibadan in the 20th century in general.</p> <p>1.3    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study focuses on the events of the 20th century, that is to say from 1900-1999 but as an historical study, the need to apprise the period before the period of focus will provide necessary information that will illuminate the understanding of Ibadan history.</p> <p>To follow the period before 20th century, a full focus will be on the period to appraise the changes recorded in both the status and role of the Traditional Political Institution in Ibadan.</p> <p>The fact that the 20th century covered the period of colonial administration, the period when Nigeria became independent and under civil and military administrations, study of this topic will provide a better understanding of Ibadan history.</p> <p>1.4    RESEARCH METHODOLOGY / PROBLEM</p> <p>As an historical documentation on a city like Ibadan, that is known to be the largest city in West Africa, a multi-disciplinary research methodology was adopted.</p> <p>The study began with the study of available literature on various aspects of Ibadan history. This was followed with the visit to the National Archive at Ibadan and finally oral data collection was undertaken. Indeed, Questionnaires were prepared to obtain information on data based requirements.</p> <p>Indeed, the experience is worth while. A lot of informant’s were not readily available and others gave several promises before they eventually made themselves available.</p> <p>Finally, the land size of Ibadan, actually constituted another problem which directly overstress my financial provisions.</p> <p>1.5    LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>Since much has been written on the changes in the Traditional Political Institution in Ibadanland, they provide a good base for this study. For instance, books consulted like B.A. Awe: “The Rise of Ibadan as a Yoruba Power in the Nineteenth Century” and S. Johnson: “The History of the Yorubas” which agreed on the fact that Ibadan town was founded as a war camp in the 19th century and also, they agreed on the pre-colonial political setup of Ibadan based, as it were on the military.</p> <p>According to P.C. Lloyd in his book titled “The city of Ibadan”, Ibadan, that “ethnographic anomaly” as Peter Lloyd tightly terms the Yoruba cities, unique as an Obaless Yoruba city which clawed its way to the top eluting the enables and sometimes mindless nineteenth century Yoruba wars, Ibadan today is the capital of the Western province of Nigeria, the largest city (though smaller than greater Lagos according to A.L. Mabogunje) in the country and one of the largest black African cities on the continent.</p> <p>Also, according to I.B. Akinyele’s book titled “The outline History of Ibadan”, Ibadan was founded in the in the 16th century,. Around 1820, an army of Egba, Ijebu, Ife and Oyo people won the town during their wars with the Fulanis. After a struggle between the victors, the Oyo gained control in 1829. A system where the Baale line (civic) and Balogun Isoriki line (military) shared power was established by 1851, subject to a traditional council resenting both lines.</p> <p>Akogun Lekan Alabi’s work titled “Ibadan Chieftaincy System”, stressed the point on the recognition of the Royal Family who are expected to be headed by a male member called “Mogaji”. Anyone selected or elected rather to be the Mogaji of his family must have the majority support of the family, but a unanimous support is ideal.</p> <p>J.F.Ade Ajayi’s book titled “Background to Exalted Olubadan’s Throne” also gave a valuable information which shed more lights on the instability occasioned by the incessant wars which was one of the recurring themes in the History of Yorubaland in the Nineteenth century, and it was out of this morbid situation that Ibadan grew. He made use of oral Tradition that speak of three Ibadan.</p> <p>First and foremost, Ibadan came into existence in 1829 when Lagelu, the Jagun (commander-in-Chief) of Ife and Yoruba’s generalissimo, left Ile-Ife with a handful of people from Ife, Oyo, and Ijebu to found a new city, Eba Odan, which literally means ‘between the forest and plains;. According to HRH Sir Isaac Babalola Akinyele, the late Olubadan (king) of Ibadan (Olu Ibadan means Lord of Ibadan), in his authoritative book on the history of Ibadan, “Iwe Itan Ibadan”, printed in 1911, the first city was destroyed due to an incident at an Egungun (masquerade) festival when an Egungun was accidentally disrobed and derisively mocked by women and children in an open market place full of people. In Yorubaland, it was an abomination for women to look an Egungun in the eye because the Egunguns were considered to be the dead forefathers who returned to the earth each year to bless their progeny. When the news reached Sango, the then Alaafin of Oyo, he commanded that Eba Odan be destroyed for committing such abominable act.</p> <p>Secondly, Ibadan was historically an Egba town. The Egba occupants were forced to leave the town and moved to present day Abeokuta under the leadership of Sodeke when the surge of Oyo refugees flocked into the towns as an aftermath of the fall of Oyo kingdom. Ibadan grew into an impressive and sprawling urban center so much that by the end of 1829, Ibadan dominated the Yoruba region militarily, politically and economically. The military sanctuary expanded even further when refugees began attiring in large numbers from northern Oyo following raids by Fulani warrior. After losing the northern portion of their region to the marauding Fulanis, many Oyo indigenes retreated deeper into the Ibadan environs.</p> <p>Thirdly, Ibadan according to him represented the culmination of certain development which started from the old Oyo empire. He asserted that the Fulani caliphate attempted to expend further into the Southern region of modern-day Nigeria, but was decisively defeated by the armies of Ibadan in 1840.</p> <p>This work also examines the mutation of an institution in Ibadan society unit the office of the ruler nitrous of his role, responsibility and public image. The Ibadan Ruler in the colonial period was known as Baale and then he was nothing more than a primus Inter Pare (First Among Equal) at home, because of the Oligardiy rafure of the Ibadan Government. With the establishment of a colonial state, the Bale was curtailed both within and without Ibadan in the Twentieth century which did not satisfy his desire for more power.</p> <p>Ruth Watson, ‘Civil Disorder is the Disease of Ibadan’: chieftaincy and civic culture in a Yoruba city. This book captures the complicated process of acquiring titles and becoming a chief in a competitive political environment where many individuals defined their lifetime ambition as acquiring honour through chieftaincy. More importantly, the book reveals how these titles actually ascribed civic status. The book shows how a civic political culture had to be created, and how powerful figures operated within it. Without a civic community, there would be no chiefs. And without chiefs, one may argue, a civic community of the type described in this book could not have been created. Merging two eras in history the Pre-Colonial and Colonial. Watson elaborates upon the relationship between city politics and chiefs</p>\n\nTHE CHANGING ROLE OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL INSTITUTION IN IBADAN IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL INSTITUTION IN IBADAN IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE CONTRIBUTION OF ADESOYE HOLDINGS NIGERIA PLC.

Although, it has branches all over the country, but its headquarters based in Offa. Offa is a known town in Western Nigeria and it is a town in present day Kwara state. Offa is located on latitude 8100 North and longitude 4400 east on the map of Nigeria. The town occupied a prominent position in pre-colonial Nigeria history. Its eminence rested on the fact that it played a crucial role in the socio-economic and political events that took place in Yoruba land. For example, Moremi, an heroine in Yoruba history came from Offa to save the People of Ife from the incursion of the Igbos. Also, the Bashorun in AlaafinOjigi,s reign, died in a ditch while he was leading an expedition towards Offa.</p> <p>The town also played host to the Fulani Jihadists from Ilorin. The process of territorial conquest led to the subjugation of Offa in the 1830s. it featured prominently in the Ekiti-Parapo wars at the end of which the British came to dictate peace in 1893. All these demonstrated the socio-economic importance of Offa before and during colonial period. Apart from the above, however, Offa dwellers engaged in various commercial economic activities such as farming, craftwork e.g. weaving, blacksmith, goldsmith, pot-making and calabash decoration. It was noted through an interview that only fishing work is not prominent in the area.</p> <p>1.2      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>The Adesoye holdings is an economic organization that is non-governmental in funding, but has board of directors with Chief E.O. Adesoye as the chairman of the Board of Directors. The Adesoye holdings was sub-divided into groups with each of them producing one thing or the other, which have no doubt, better the lots of Offa citizen, Kwara as a whole, and Nigeria at large. The organization has its aim and objectives as “conformability and enjoyment at low cost”. Therefore, all the branches of the holding take part one way or the other in achieving this aims and objectives.</p> <p>This work is set to discuss the history of Adesoye Holdings, how it came to being, its early formation stages, various challenges encountered by the chairman board of directors in ensuring the sustainability of the age-long achievement of the holdings.</p> <p>Without mincing words, the study would let the entire holdings know the importance of the good work they are doing for the community that enjoyed their services, and as such should continue in the good work they’ve embark upon, thus it also aim at telling the society to be suggestive whenever they have any advice that can move the Adesoye Holdings forward, as they stand to lose a lot if the holdings fail in its productions.</p> <p>This essay is embarked upon to make an in-depth study of Adesoye Holdings in Offa.</p> <p>It also looks into the roles, aims and objectives of the Adesoye Holdings to the economic development of Offa, how it contributed to the spread and growth of more industries in Offa, it also aimed at evaluating and simplifying a number of growth within the holdings itself, most especially, the spread of its branches all over the country.</p> <p>The work tends to look at the financing of the holdings, and how, or the manner which the holdings use in sustaining the tempo and creating more awareness about the goods and services coming out of the holdings. It shall also inform the society, the extent to which the Adesoye holdings had use the human and natural resources in producing several goods which are of great use to the populace.</p> <p>It is also meant to sensitize the workers of the holdings on the importance of their contributions to the development of the holdings, and also the need for the workers to appreciate the board of directors for the employment given to them, which had assisted them in keeping their various families. It is also important to state that this study is not merely aimed at highlighting the empirical and theoretical writings of the study, rather, it aims at increasing our understanding in all ramifications of the study and to contribute to scholars by critically examining the roles of Adesoye Holdings in the economic development of Offa. In other words, this study would aim at throwing more light on the more practical aspect of this topic.</p> <p>1.3      SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The scope of the study is very wide, as the study attempts shall be made to trace the emergence of some firms in Offa before the coming of Adesoye Holdings in 1982. Thus, the establishment of Adesoye Holdings in Offa Local Government Areas of Kwara State, with its aims and objectives to be looked into. This work tends to bring out the various goods produce in each of the companies under the Adesoye holdings, and that is why the cheaper three of this project talks about various companies under the Adesoye Holdings like the Okin Biscuit Nigeria Limited, Adesoye College, Labande cereals and many others.</p> <p>The chapter four of the work deals with the economic impact of the Adesoye Holdings to the development of Offa most especially during the first early years of its establishment, when few firms are only in existence in Offa.</p> <p>1.4      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>In the course of writing this project both primary and secondary sources were consulted. It must be stressed that only few people had worked on the personality of the chairman board directors Adesoye Holdings, Chief Emmanuel Olatunji Adesoye being an industrialist, but the uniqueness of this project is that no one has deemed it fit to look into the aspect of the economic contribution of the Holdings, most especially to the Offa community, and Kwara State as a whole. Knowing fully well that there cannot be a successful community or state without the contributions of industries in order to boost the economic statues of such community or state.</p> <p>However, since is an attempt to contribute to human knowledge additional information (which forms one of the aims and objectives of the study), this provides a new insight, and an eye-opener about the operatives of the Adesoye Holdings.</p> <p>1.5      LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>In the course of sourcing for materials for this work, I was faced with the herculean task of knowing the location of the various companies under the Adesoye Holdings in Offa. When I got to those industries, the needed information given was not detailed, then I embarked on individual interview with important personalities at those companies. At the Adesoye college, a new principal Mr. Bradley Sailes had just taken over from Miss. J. Steward, therefore, he was not willing to grant an oral interviews, because, he does not want to be quoted. But after a much persuasion, he agreed to be interviewed. Also, I was faced with the problem of collecting conflicting information, especially in the aspect of knowing the exact kick-off date of the Adesoye Holdings. Although the dates given were correct, as some companies had been establish under the holdings in other part of the country like Adesoye was established in 1969, but this work is mostly concern with industries established in Offa under this holdings, and the first to be established is the Okin Biscuits Limited, which was established in 1982.</p> <p>In other to establish the validity of oral interview, attempts were made to cross check the information given. Thus, the researcher has been able to separate the truth from fallacy in the information obtained and was finally able to collate this project.</p> <p>Another constraint is the issue of fund. There was no enough fund at the disposal of the researcher to carry out a more field work, because there are series of interviews needed for the detailed assessment of the roles and contribution of industries under the Adesoye Holdings that were sited in other towns and states, to the economic development of the various towns and states which they were sited. In addition, relevant text could not be found in libraries as related to the Adesoye Holdings.</p> <p>There was also problem of time, because there were other students and researcher trying to reach the new principal of the Adesoyecollege, Mr. Bradley Sailes who came from America not quite long. Also, Mr FataiBabatunde who also have othe engagement and other activities of Labande Cereals Limited to attend to. This made the oral interview meeting time, to be rescheduled for more than two times.</p> <p>Furthermore, on realizing that the researcher was not one of them, they vehemently refuse to give out their information and therefore, he was subjected to series of interrogations and in most cases, cross examined as if in the law court to ascertain that the researcher is not on a spying mission into the activities of the holdings. Moreover, most of the libraries visited were not in any way useful.</p> <p>1.6      LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>Many scholars and writers had written on the economic development in Offa, but on a few had written on the contribution of Adesoye Holdings to the economic development of Offa. Therefore, the bulk of materials used were obtained through oral interview, some unpublished materials and a few published material etc. However, some works have been consulted, among which is “Itan Offa” by Rev. J. B. Olafimihan.Olafinmihan gave a clear look of Offa before the colonial masters, how the people earn living through war with other weak communities and enslaving them. Rev. J. B. Olafimihan extended his writings to the period of colonial masters, the socio-cultural heritage of Offa, but fails to bring out economic activities of the people of Offa.1</p> <p>Another relevant material is that of OkesholaToyinAdewuyi, “The growth of Industry in Offa/Oyun local government, 1960-1990’’ This project is very important to my work in the sense they, it’s about industries that had existed in Offa and Oyun local government area, but it fails to give details of the various industries which it talked about, in fact it was unable to mention all the companies under the Adesoye Holdings, not to talk about other companies in Offa, this is because its area of coverage is wide, it combined two local government area (Offa/Oyun), and this made the beauty of the work unable to be achieved.2</p> <p>Another important contribution to this work is ‘Ijakadi’, a quarterly publication in Offa, which talked about industrial growth in Offa. Not only that the magazine was brief, but also failed to point out the economic contribution of the Adesoye holdings to the people of Offa3. In addition, a yearly publication of Offa Students’ Union: ‘Offa M’ojo’, talked about some crisis that had rocked the holdings which led to the closure of Okin Biscuit Limited in the year 2008, but failed to tell, how the holdings overcame the crisis period, and bounced back to life, with Okin Biscuit Limited now working more efficiently than ever.4</p>\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTION OF ADESOYE HOLDINGS NIGERIA PLC.

This had brought about a growing concern on the part of Nigeria government, international agencies and some scholars over the “Brain drain” phenomenon in Nigeria and Africa at large, because of the continuous exodus of Africans from Africa since the late 1970’s1.</p> <p>            Despite this, there is still a close-tie relationship maintain by these Nigeria Diaspora and their home country. They usually send remittances back home and take part in the development activities in their hometowns. By these, they have collective impart on poverty alleviation and encourage gradual development in their Homeland.</p> <p>             In the last few years, the nexus between Diaspora and Development has emerged as a distinct policy field, driven by the Diaspora. This is because of the growing economic and human-resources potential of Diaspora communities, which needs to be tapped in order to benefit the overall development of the country. Kudos to modern and rapid communication that now enables the Diasporas to exert far greater influence on their homeland than ever before. This advantage enables Diaspora communities to buildup interesting social, economic and political bridges that link their new places of residence with the homeland. This gives the Diaspora communities a considerable advantage over traditional mainstream development organization operating back home and enables the Diasporas to make significant contributions to the overall development of their homeland. What was formally known as “Brain drain” has now translate to “Brain gain” because the homeland now reap development benefits, and even spur brain gain in the return of highly educated and skilled Diaspora to their homeland.</p> <p>            In the case of Njikoka Diaspora Community in Florida, which forms the centre of this study, most of them on individual basis remit great sums of money (through formal and informal channels) annually back home2. About 90% of such remittance flows directly to their respective families, thereby working to alleviate poverty and providing lifeline for those whose breadwinners had relocated outside the country. The remaining 10% are channel into investment, developmental pursuits and fund productive activities that accelerate the transfer of skills, knowledge and experience to firms in their homeland. Research had shown that these investments become important sources of employment sustaining many people who would otherwise have no way of securing livelihood3.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.2       AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            There is still a limited understanding of the concept of development within the context of Njikokans in Diaspora and their developmental activities back home. This arises because of the conceptual confusion over the meaning of the term “Diaspora and Development”. There is therefore, a need for more research into this, and more clarification of its precise conceptual denotation and its translation in practical terms. It is based on this premise that this study is aimed at broadening the conceptual understanding of what is meant by “development” within the context of Njikoka Diaspora and her role in development of her homeland.</p> <p>            The objective of this study is to improve our understanding of the other aspects of the field of Diaspora and Development, while seeking to analyze some key actors, structural features and recent developments in the field of Diaspora engagement in Njikoka.</p> <p>            It is also the objective of this study to generate knowledge and information within an area, which had not been properly studied despite its importance in the field of migration and development with regard to Njikoka and by extension Anambra state.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Before now, most research work in the field of Diaspora/Migration and Development was either confined to the host or home countries. Nevertheless, this study will try to transcend a limited country scope, which will be of interest to scholars and researchers in this field. This is because it sets an alternative research agenda focused on the nexus between migration and development, and hence advance the discussion in the field. It introduces a development-oriented perspective that captures the essence of the concrete development-related activities in which Diasporas are involved in their homeland.</p> <p>            This study is also of significant because it aims at making available information and knowledge to Diaspora organizations and policy makers in the homelands, who are currently largely left in the dark, about much needed access to useful and up to-date information which are lacking in this field.</p> <p>            More importantly, the study will further facilitate collaboration between researchers from host and home countries; facilitate the integration of Diaspora researcher and academic institutions thereby laying the foundation for a sustainable intellectual partnership between the host and homeland researchers. This will facilitate the cross-fertilization of ideas, knowledge and experience between the Diaspora and their homeland.</p> <p>            Above all the outcome of this study will be of high interest and value to policy makers concern with Diaspora and Development related issues both within and outside Njikoka community, while setting in motion a process that could lay the ground for regular and sustain contact and network between the Diasporas and their local communities.</p> <p><strong>1.4       SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY.</strong></p> <p>            The scope of this study will span across Njikoka in Nigeria and Florida in USA, with the primary aim of mirroring the roles and contributions of the Njikoka Diaspora Community living in Florida towards the development of their homeland. The inquiry into this study will look into the trans-continental context within which the Njikoka contemporary Diaspora operates. However, it will emphasize on why the Njikoka Diaspora community in Florida is one of the main global forces and catalyst shaping the directions and trends of development in Njikoka.</p> <p>            There is still limited understanding of how institutional cooperation exists between Diaspora communities and their local and state government, which is so disturbing. It is pathetic to state here that these states and local governments do not have much needed information/data about their Diaspora Communities, which Njikoka Diaspora Community in Florida is not an exemption.</p> <p>            However, owing to logistics, time and financial constraints, in depth and thorough review and consultation of widely available literatures was not fully achieved. There was also limitation with traveling, booking for interviews and acceptance to grant interview by some respondents. </p> <p>            Collecting data for this study is a little bit challenging because there are very few documented studies that address the engagement of the Njikoka Community Diaspora with their homeland, beyond transfer of remittances. Most of the study on Njikoka Diaspora studies concentrates on its historical and cultural dimensions. In order to come up with a fashionable work, gathering information will be sort from the scratch; despite the fact, some people decline to let out some information at their disposals.</p> <p><strong>1.5       RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>            Because of the diverse composition of the Njikoka Diaspora Community that is in Florida, USA, this study adopted a broad trans-continental framework of data collection and analysis from those in Florida (America) and Njikoka (Africa). Information will be collected from members of the community who had returned home, as well as those who are still in Florida through a telephone interview and e-mail.</p> <p>            Primary and secondary, as well as oral data sources was sought and used to complement the reviewed available literature. Consultations, direct observation at functions, discussions, site visits and casual interaction with relatives and beneficiaries of the Njikoka Diaspora community was employed for gaining additional insights.</p> <p>            In addition to formal and casual interactions, documentation regarding ongoing projects and completed projects in the general area of development by the Njikoka Diaspora Community in Florida at their homeland was sought. Such supporting documentation will range from Reports to Journals and newspaper articles.</p> <p>            All these put together will serve beyond a mere complementary role, but will provide a benchmark for assessing the accuracy of other response, and provides avenues for further probing and validation of information sources that appeared to be in conflict or contention.</p> <p><strong>1.6       LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>            The literature on Diaspora engagement in development uses divergent and at times discontinuous notion of “Migration”, “Diaspora” and “Diasporans” to describe the subject of the inquiries4,5,6. Orozco works within a narrow framework of the concepts while Brah and Brinkerhoff on the other hand, provide more complex conceptualizations of the Diaspora. But they only wrote on the host countries’ point of views on Diaspora. Zoomers and Schapendonk corroborated this point when they argue, “Given that funding usually comes from the North, research agendas are often biased, focusing on issues such as how to control migration”. As a result, the objective of development cooperation policy regarding migration and development are often subordinate to other issues that are regulatory in nature7.</p> <p>            In a discussion on the significance of human capital in the development of Africa, Richard Joseph noted thus: For Africa to fulfill at last its destiny to become a developmental state, she must urgently identify ways to benefit from the financial capital as well as the human capital of her Diaspora now spread over several continents8. The discretionary financial resources of these emigrants are urgently needed as are their resources in knowledge and professional behaviors”. Joseph goes on to recommend systematic and sustainable collaboration between governments of receiving countries in Africa and Diaspora organizations in order to marshal the financial and human resources of the Diaspora-resources that are needed to build viable and sustainable economies in Africa.</p> <p>            Supporting the Diaspora in the development of homeland is crucial if the many benefits of Diaspora engagement are to be effectively harnessed, the positive gains of migration are to be realized while the negative aspects of migration- both real and supposed- are to be reduced or eliminated.</p> <p>            Establishing concrete formalized institutional linkage across continents and working towards sustainable and productive cooperation between the various Actors involved in the field of migration and development is arguably the most effective way to support the Diaspora in their development efforts. According to P. Chudi Uwazuruike, “As a first step towards this goal, however, homeland must create favorable environment for Diaspora engagement and investment in the development of the homeland”9. Some challenges that need to be address in order to create an enabling environment on ground in the homeland include bad governance, political instability, lack of commitment and poor economic conditions as well as issues of personal freedom, basic civil rights, democracy and the rule of law. Such complex challenges which are often refer to as push factors of emigration, are prevalent in the homeland and often manifest themselves in widespread social upheaval, the disruption of economic production and growth, high level of unemployment, unsatisfactory or exploitative working conditions, poor physical infrastructure, the lack of adequate social service, the absence of democracy and the prevailing of human right abuses. In addition, the management of migration is in a state of flux at the global level, and the situation in the homeland is unstable and worrying.</p> <p>             In his own contribution, Adepoju opines: “An additional priority for encouraging Diaspora involvement in development efforts in the homeland is to ensure an integrated and comprehensive approach to the development and implementation of migration policy, involving all partners in the migration policy arena and especially government agencies, the private sector, civil society organizations, trade unions, and bilateral and multilateral development agencies”10.</p> <p>            An analysis of Diaspora developmental activities must take into account the diversity within the Diaspora groups. The context of developmental policies and analyses which often expose a lack of attention to and differentiations of what shapes the motivation of development agents is prone to instrumentalists approach which tend to unduly generalize, homogenize and implicitly essentialise the subject of their inquiry.</p> <p>            That is why this study will seek to both sidestep and counter such simplifying notions. One way to do this is through a careful differentiation between Diaspora as a concept describing groups of people sharing a common country of origin to which they retain ties and with which they engage in ways that motivate collective (re)engagement, and Diasporans as individuals or section of the larger entity whose agency is shaped by their concept of Diaspora, but also by their social and political background and context. Despite the fact that Diasporans increasingly succeed in finding common platforms for collective actions, they cannot be reduced to a singular collective actor. Thus, the differentiation between the concept of Diaspora and the diverse set of Diaspora actors who – in their diversity - comprise the groups whose activities are to be investigated, becomes a very interesting point for this research work. </p> <p>            In researching Diasporas, it is important to heed to Patterson’s and Kelly’s call that “linkage that ties the Diaspora together must be articulated and are not inevitable (….) the Diaspora is both process and condition. As a process, it is always in the making and as a condition, and is therefore situated within the global and gender hierarchies.”11  A simplifying notion of Diaspora is furthermore countered by an analysis that does not simply show Diasporan collective actions, but also different approaches and social differentiation within the groupings of the two national Diasporas. The complexity of the concept of Diaspora is aptly captured by Avtar Brah: 12</p> <p>            The concept of Diaspora concerns the historically variable forms of relationality within and between diasporic formation. It is about relations of power that similarise and differentiate between and across changing diasporic constellation. In other words, the concept of Diaspora centers on the configurations of power which differentiate Diasporas internally as well as situate them in relation to one another. Diaspora in the sense of distinctive historical experience, are often composite formation (…). Each such Diaspora is an interweaving of multiple travelling, a text of many distinctive, and perhaps even disparate narratives13.</p> <p>            In furtherance of the explanation of the above, Manuel Orozco has identified four critical factors which “enables the formation of a group into a Diaspora”14. These are</p> <p>v  The level of community – particularly elite and activist – consciousness about the need or desire for link with the homeland;</p> <p>v  The homeland perception of emigrants;</p> <p>v  The outreach policies by governments in the homeland; and</p> <p>v  The existence of relationship between sources and destination countries.</p> <p>            These four factors contribute to fostering a certain level of transnational engagement with the homeland. It is this transnational engagement with the home which creates a Diaspora commonality among committed Diasporans in ways that can partially transcend some of the important differentiation identified by Brah.</p> <p>            It is important to consider the three-pronged idea of development in the Diaspora, development through the Diaspora and development by the Diaspora. The first refers to the use of networks in the host country, which includes the formation of ethnic businesses, cultural ties and social mobilization. The second refers to how diasporic communities utilize their diffuse global connections beyond the locality to facilitate economic and social well-being. While the third, applies to the ramification of the flow of ideas, money and political support to the migrants’ homelands. This framework provides an important differentiation because it draws attention to the different methods of direct and indirect Diaspora engagement as well as the importance that only meaningful analysis of Diasporan developmental engagement has to focus on how the host country context influences Diasporan developmental activities.</p> <p>            Then, it may be far more rewarding to note the existential realities and challenges that the Diasporas have to contend with in their host countries, such as:</p> <p>i.        The priority of gaining an economic footing in a race-conscious society in which they have few ties;</p> <p>ii.      The inevitability of having first to build community and consensus of culture reaffirmation in a secular and highly mobile culture – for the sake of their children and families- from language, classes, gender-role acquisition and other rite of passage, marriage and births to schooling, work and funeral obligation;</p> <p>iii.    Moreover, at the same time, having to respond to request for assistance from those back home- mostly in the form, as mentioned earlier, of remittances, conferences, donations of scarce items such as computers, the sending of medical missions back home, refurbishing of hospitals, clinics, and establishments of businesses.</p> <p>Most do not couch their efforts in the language of “national development” as scholars understand it. Yet their contributions, in cash and in kind, are of developmental significance.</p> <p>            Speaking in London at the African Diaspora Leadership Forum in 2006, Joseph Legwaila of Botswana, had cause to weigh in on a topic group everywhere wanted to hear about it; “The role of Diaspora in support of Africa’s Development”; he called for a Diaspora emphasis on advocacy for the continent and the fostering of private sector development15. </p> <p>            There is no question that the Diaspora remains ready and able to play an energetic role in these efforts, as Zan analyses in his 2004 examination of Africa Diaspora’s contribution to national development using diverse channels. Noting that Africa has indeed, been quite proactive in recognizing the role that African Diaspora already dose and can potentially play in national development efforts16. Zan argued, “True national development requires priority-setting, planning, coordination and political will….” and hence the need for “policy intervention to coordinate and harmonize the efforts of the Diaspora with those undertaking by national and district institutions17”. But the way to truly “(unlock) the potential of the Diaspora” lies in the clarification of existing laws and policies, the development of appropriate new laws and policies, and the provision of appropriate incentives to stimulate a more suitable engagement of the Diaspora with national development.</p> <p>            While making his own contribution, the Toledo university-based professor Rubin Patterson, in his 2006 paper “Transnationalism, Diaspora-Homeland Development” seeks to weave the emerging interest in migration remittances and brain circulation to conventional theories of development18. Patterson makes clear that no developing country has gone far on the development trajectory since the Second World War without a strategic embrace of the opportunities presented by the USA. Countries like Korea to Israel, Taiwan to India, Singapore to Mexico and the tiger economy of china, all have moved forward when they became clearer about what they truly need with the combine efforts of both local and Diaspora communities.</p> <p>            Therefore, there is no gain saying the fact that Njikoka will need to make haste, and its surest best practice lies in wooing its high-level work force residing overseas, which includes scientists, researchers, engineers, medical personnel, academic professors and high-level students. Others are managers, business executives, industrialists and consultants for local and multinational firms in both public and private sectors. For this to bear fruits, it has been argued that the usual difficulties faced by skilled Njikoka professionals will need to be addressed. These include the lack of institutional support, along with weaknesses in the existing support mechanisms, the difficulty in conducting scientific and business partnership with local counterparts and lack of clear assessment of sectors for possible intervention by highly skilled Diasporans.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>NOTES AND REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>1.      Akunrang-Parry K.O.

It is following the regard of women as human legal entities who or which are endowed by nature or by law with the capacity to enter into legal relations such as contracts of employment, commercial contracts and marriage contracts without detraction from social constraints. Thus this study is concerned with the sum total of rights and duties concerned with the women as provided in the constitution by reason of their legal affiliation to the state-Nigeria.</p> <p>Rights, as used in this regard, are privileges or prerogatives that are conferred on a person or a group by law. In other words, they are lawful claims, which the state defined and is ready to protect.1Rights (both political and civil rights) according to Olakanmi Olajide, are fundamental freedom which all men and women, are entitled, without discrimination. These, he further noted, are based on the laid down philosophy of the international law which reads: “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”.2</p> <p>Rights are entitlements that are essential for human existence. Umozurike, Oji U. observes that these rights are third generation rights. The first generation rights, which were first to be recognized are: the right to life, liberty, dignity, etc; the second generation rights are: the right to education, health, work, etc; and other third generation rights include the right of self-determination, to develop, to natural wealth and resources, etc.3 However it must be pointed that in spite of the declarations for these rights, there are still agitations for freedom and rights which are evident in the different waves for the rights of women, thus showing that these rights are not being enjoyed by the people they are meant for.</p> <p>Chukwudifu A. Oputa says that every human being (i.e. both male and female) is a valuable creature on which justice is built. The Bible commands us to love one another, but justice asks that if we cannot love, at least we do not injure. For anything that constitutes an injury is thus against the law, after all the law cannot compel us to love. However, he maintains, it is pertinent to</p> </div> <br/> <div> <p>7</p> </div> <br/> <div> <p>note that the violation of rights, especially of women is the fault of the countrymen who have failed to cultivate law culture or acquire the virtue of reverence of law.4 Olisa Agbakoba submits that when injustice, discrimination and degradation of human value tend to thrive, human right groups such as women liberation movement or wave of feminism is very imminent.5</p> <p>There is no doubt that women have played dynamic and constructive roles and thus contributed tremendously to societal development, but those roles as well as their status are yet to break the chauvinistic and patriarchal dominance. They are socialized to accept inferior position to their male counterpart.</p> <p>Afikpo, the second metropolitan town in Ebonyi State, has the population of 61956 out of which women are 29864.6 Here the women represent about 48.9% of the population and also command numerical strength. But the age-long inferior status or perception of women that emanated from cultural and religions beliefs have continued to affect them (women). Some of these beliefs have been practiced for so long that they are embedded in the societal norms, and such that the laws of the land or constitutions and international instruments, which protect the rights of women, are flagrantly infringed in the guise of cultural and religions beliefs. Jivka Marinova notes that:</p> <p><em>We represent over half of humanity. We give life, we work, love, create, struggle, and have fun. We currently accomplish most of the work essential to life and the continued survival of humankind. Yet our place in society continues to be undervalued</em>.7</p> </div></div>\n\nRIGHTS OF WOMEN IN THE CONSTITUTIONS OF NIGERIA, 1960-   2007<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RIGHTS OF WOMEN IN THE CONSTITUTIONS OF NIGERIA, 1960-   2007", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Rights Of Women In The Constitutions Of Nigeria, 1960- 2007 Case Study Of Afikpo.</p> <p>This study is written in view of the growth of the waves of feminism, which pay special attention to women’s rights within the society that is more or less gender insensitive.

This is because a historical study of a given country, state and community cannot be complete without the study of certain individuals and actors who piloted and or contributed to the growth and development of the society they lived in. It is based on this premise that we identify with the popular notion that events of history cannot be studied in isolation, but in relation to the people involved. The activities of heroes, leaders, philanthropists, teachers, community leaders and other people who distinguished themselves in their chosen careers abound in the African communities. These people have in one way or another contributed immensely to making their communities what they are today.</p> <p>With the advent of colonialism and the consequent western form of education, African heroes seemed to have been eroded from the memory of Africans. This was because the Europeans taught African about European</p> </div> <div> <p>2</p> <p>and other foreign heroes like Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, Tsar Alexander the Great, Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill to mention a few. The studies of these foreign heroes suffice till date in the departments of History all over Africa. Also, with the growth of African nationalism at the dawn of colonialism, attention widened and the study of African politicians and Nationalists began gradually to creep into historical literatures.</p> <p>In recent times, the biographical searchlight beamed on community leaders and philanthropists who have encouraged hard work and selfless community service. The Igbo of Nigeria are known for community self-help efforts in the building of infrastructure and overall development of their communities. The reward for this is that those who have made a mark in their communities are entrusted with more responsibilities for the growth and development of their communities. These people most time are also honoured with chieftaincy titles.</p> </div> <div> <p>3</p> <p>Studying the biographies of these distinguished personalities who are either dead or alive, brings out their lives and Endeavours in such a way that the younger generation and the generation to come will appreciate their contributions. This is in line with the position of Nicolson Harold; that “biography is written with no other purpose than that of conveying to the reader an authentic portrait of the individual whose life is</p> <p>being studied”1. In studying biography, the researcher should as well ensure that the work be like the close of a drama which leaves behind its feeling of serenity and in which we will collect a small bunch of those sweetness of</p> <p>life2. By this, hard work, firmness and community service will be encouraged.</p> <p>Chief William I. Ojiako is a personality that cannot be shoved aside in the study of the history of Umuchu</p> <p>community3. W. I. Ojiako, in his 90-years sojourn on earth, lived for his immediate community in particular and the Igbo and Nigeria in general. As a teacher, trader,</p> </div> <div> <p>4</p> <p>community leader, employer of labour, church leader, and traditional prime minister of Umuchu, he distinguished </p></div>\n\nTHE LIFE AND TIMES OF WILLIAM IBENEME OJIAKO, 1916-2006<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE LIFE AND TIMES OF WILLIAM IBENEME OJIAKO, 1916-2006", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Impact Of Agricultural Development Programmes On The Economy Of Imo State, 1999-2007. </p> <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>This thesis focuses on the contributions of the Agricultural Development Programmes of the government of Imo State towards economic growth and development in the State between 1999 and 2007.

These complaints arise from the problems discovered in the manual system which not only include inefficiency, inaccuracy, time consumption and inconveniency but laborious and sluggish. These problems occasioned the computerization of the manual system as I have done in order to solve these problems associated with it. In this regards therefore, the researcher as one of the basic tools and features introduced to enhance admission processing, designed a problems solving algorithm using Visual Basic 6.0 Software Program.

What is today named Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education, Owerri (ATTC) established in 1963. This training college emerged indirectly as a result of the – Ashby commission and directly as a step taken towards meeting the nationhood Nigeria was attaining at that time in anticipation of the emerging manpower needs of the country. It is on record that in 1959, then the federal minister of education appointed a commission on post school certificate and higher education. This commission was the Ashby’s commission. The commission was charged with the responsibility “to conduct an investigation into the Nigeria’s needs in the field of post school certificate and higher education over the next twenty years”.</p> <p>Ukeje (1988) chronicled it that ATTC, Owerri was formerly opened on 10thSeptember, 1963, with a student population of 150 and 14 members of staff. Records have it that one A. J. Broaks was appointed the first substantive principal of the College seven days after the college opened formally and this was under UNESCO sponsorship. At the outbreak of the Nigeria Civil War in 1967, Mr. J.O. Nwachukwu, a counterpart principal under UNESCO management became the substantive principal. The headship of AT.T.C Owerri changed in 1970 when the civil war ended Mr. J.O. Munonye became the third principal of the college in 1970, when the Civil was ended, then the Government of the East Central State of Nigeria, though the Public Education Edict of 1970 took over the ownership and management of all educational institutions in the state including A.T.T.C Owerri. In consonance with the state ownership of the college, the name of the college was changed from advanced Teachers Training College, Owerri to Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri the college was given this name after one of the outstanding, Educationists of Igboland Mazi Alvan Ikoku, also the founder of Aggrey Memorial Colege, Arochuchukwu.</p> <p>The college became a federal institution in 2007. The federal ministry of education, Abuja in a letter to the provost of the college, PROF. C.N. Uwazurike, conveyed the federal government takeover of Alvan Ikoku College of Education Owerri in a letter SAF. 36/s.465/vol./0 of 17th July 2007. The college currently has their provost as Assoc. Prof. Barrister H.C.

One way or the other, people of different ethnic background were at one time or the other engaged in some sort of relations. At one time such relation was peaceful, at other times, the people engaged in violent confrontation. Whatsoever shape the relation assumed, it is important to uphold the fact that inter-group relations existed and still exist between and among the different ethnic groups in Nigeria. The relations existed before colonialism, it continued during and even after Colonial Rule. Among the different dimension of inter-group relations in Nigeria include but not limited to the following; marriage, trade, war, politics, and exchange of cultural troupes etc.</p> <p>Although, inter-group relations has an undertone of an affair between immediate neighbors, it is not limited to immediate neighbor only. However, the focus of this topic is on two immediate neighbours, namely: Annang and Igbo ethnic groups. Considering the division of Nigeria into six geo-political zones, the Igbo people occupies the five south eastern states, while the Annang people are a component of Akwa Ibom State which is in south-south region of Nigeria.</p> <p>Thus, among the five Igbo States – Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo, it is Abia State that are immediate neighbours to the Annang people. In Abia State, the communities that are immediate neighbours to the Annang are Ikwuano, Onicha, Ngwa, Abala, Ndoki etc. It is important, perhaps pertinent to use these Igbo groups that are immediate neighbours to Annang people since Igbo is a large ethnic group with many dialect and a variety of culture. Again, inter-group relation between Annang and Igbo could be seen clearer with these Igbo communities than with the entire Igbo ethnic group.1However, there exist some challenges in the discussion of this topic and these challenges include the following.</p> <p>Firstly, some scholars make no difference between some part of Annang and Igbo. This could be based on the level of migration between the two groups. Secondly, the people of Annang are seen as member of the Ibibio group rather than as a different group altogether.2 In discussing Annang and Igbo relations, using this mindset, one might think that the entire Ibibio is involved, thus giving the research work a different outlook.</p> <p>Thirdly, Eurocentric scholars with their attitude of describing Africa as war like people have often painted the Annang-Igbo relation as a war-like affair.3 Hence, the tendency of people being misled to think that these two neighbours does not live peaceful at all is high.</p> <p>Last but not the least, the traditional political system of Igbo and (Ibibio) Annang seems very similar especially as both of them are describe as decentralized societies4. It becomes very difficult to know if they were the same people that later separated from each other or because of their closeness they have this similarity. Language wise, there are some similarities5.</p> <p>Therefore, having noted all these, it is pertinent to note that this work will take an in-depth look into Annang-Igbo relation from 1959 through 1970. The concern of this research work is the relation between these two ethnic groups with the aim of investigating the areas of marriage, trade and commerce, warand diplomacy, culture, language, traditional beliefs system and religion values etc.</p> <p><strong>1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>As a discipline in academic institutions, the study of history has always involved national, continental and world topics. Apparently, there seems to be a neglect of local histories. As a result, many young historians are deficient in information on immediate local histories. However, this project is considered necessary in view of the fact that certain form of inter-group relations existed between the Annang group Igbo group which undoubtedly have some element of conflict.</p> <p>Thus, his research work would attempt to divulge the extent of inter-group relations that existed between the Annang ethnic group and that of the Igbo ethnic group between and 1970.</p> <p>On this note, therefore, the researcher intends to reveal to the general public the various factors of relations between both aforementioned ethnic groups, as well as the existence of certain conflictual events between both groups. This is necessary because, there cannot be a robust inter-group relations without clashes of interest which might eventually lead to conflict at a certain point. On the whole, some of these conflicts still serve as a continuation of inter-course between the aforementioned groups.</p> <p><strong>1.2     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Research work, as an academic exercise, is expected to be significant and meaningful. Therefore,</p> <ol><li>Making an addition to the existing body of knowledge constitutes the objective of this exercise</li> <li>Enriching the historiography of inter-group relations with special reference to Annang-Igbo relations is also an objective.</li> </ol> <ul><li>To critically examine the extent of their relations and also proffer idea on how to foster friendly neighbouring relations via a better understanding of socio-cultural affinities.</li> </ul> <ol><li>To equally divulge the impact of their relationship.</li> <li>Getting acquainted with the cultural practices and identifying the flaws in the existing relationship between these ethnic groups equally constitutes additional aim of the researcher.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study provides additional knowledge to the myriads of literatures on inter-group relations in Nigeria, with special reference to Annang-Igbo relations. This study reveals various socio-political, socio-economic, socio-cultural, traditional and religious belief practices which  have been playing tremendous roles in strengthening the relations of the aforementioned ethnic groups.</p> <p>In addition, this study will immensely guide any student or researcher who intends to carry outa research work on any of the aforementioned groups, as it contains some level of vital and credible information on both groups.</p> <p>Furthermore, the study will not only act as an instrument of revelation to the Nigerian populace on the existence of inter-group relations between Annang and Igbo ethnic groups, but will also educate them on the groups’ various socio-cultural practices which might differ from those within their scope of knowledge.</p> <p><strong>1.4     SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>A number of constraints were experienced in the course of this research work. The inadequacy of the opinions and views of some indigenes from both ethnic groups under discourse who were interview based on the scope of his study of this research work is the researcher’s regrettable limitation. Again, the inaccessibility to some titled chiefs from both ethnic groups who could have had a firsthand experience, which would have summed up as an eye-witness account under the scope of this research work is also a limitation of this study.</p> <p>Moreso, inaccessibility to most of the documents that is related to Annang-Igbo relations within 1959 through 1970 which would have aid the researcher in the course of this study is another serious limitation.However, the inadequacies will not affect the research findings as efforts have been made to forestall the limitations affecting the quality of the research. Nevertheless, these leave room for further research on the subject matter and the researcher will strongly welcome and appreciate criticism arising therefrom. This is in line with the view of Arnold Toynbee “for a person to make meaningful contributions to the advancement of knowledge, his or her study must have provided some criticisms and further researches6.</p>\n\nANNANG-IGBO RELATION, 1959-1970<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANNANG-IGBO RELATION, 1959-1970", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>There is hardly any aspect of Nigeria’s national life that has received so much attention in recent times as the role of women in the socio-economic development of the country. It is necessary to state here that the contributions of women are not a new phenomenon in Nigerian life. In pre-colonial Ibibio society “polygamy” was the accepted norm. With this institution, the Ibibio women was born, raised and given out in marriage. Her worldview, self concept and gender identity were nurtured within such an environment. Competition and survival was the name of the game which was played out endlessly among men and women. In such a highly competitive society, education, moral standards, taboos and expectations existed, all woven into an unwritten tradition and culture with sets of Divine punishment and records to enforce these beliefs. Well organized institutions existed to provide governmental and judicial instruments. Within that society, Ibibio women had well defined roles, not as slaves, but as indispensable complements to man in procreation and in socio-economic development. The roles Ibibio women played were mutually supportive and even integrated into their family life in a very high degree. According to Chief Sylvester Inyang, the village-head of Use-Offot, Ibibio women bore children and looked after their daily needs. They maintained the home and did the cooking. In so doing they were expected to provide the condiments-pepper, oil, vegetables and other soup ingredients. In Use-Offot village, he continued, the man provided the main substances of the meals, normally the yams, meat or fish, oil and firewood. This he said was not an invariable role or rigid arrangement. But agriculture or farming which was the main source of sustaining a living was essentially a co-operative venture. The major work involving clearing of the bush for farming was generally the man’s job, gathering and burning the resultant trash was a joint endeavour, the tilling of the soil, hunting, most of the fishing, harvesting the palm nuts were task performed essentially by the man.</p> <p>Marriage, according to Chief Nsini Ufeh, the village-head of Idu-Uruan, did not amount to a consignment of the women into slavery. It was usually a union of at least two families in which mutual honour was expected to be strictly observed and was generally so observed, thanks to the associated social and cultural sanctions. This element of mutual support and interdependence between male and female in pre-colonial Ibibio society is clear from the complementary nature of their roles. Almost invariably, every woman in Ibibioland, whether married or not, learnt a trade or occupation from which she supplemented the returns or earnings from agriculture. Some of these occupations like cloth-weaving and dying, hair plaiting or dress-making, pottery-making and the manufacturing of various foodstuffs such as garri, cow-meal added value to the family sustenance.</p> <p>It is true that women had inferior status as many sociologists, anthropologists and even some economists suggest that social and cultural norms consigned the women to an inferior status. There are standards to justify this claim. That the roles of women differed in many respects from those of the male is natural and understandable; however, they were, and remain, mutually supportive. During the pre-colonial era, the role of Nigerian women in development revolved mainly around their efforts in different sectors towards maintaining the kin groups, adding that, pre-colonial Nigerian economy was basically at a subsistence level and Nigerian women participated effectively in the economic pattern. (Talbot 1968:34). A woman who was totally dependent on her husband was not only rare, but was regarded with contempt. As the society moved away from this well ordered age towards modernity, due to European influences, the fabric that held the Ibibio women together started to disintegrate. Early Europeans writings about Ibibioland held the view, that a wife was her husband’s legal property, and was treated little better than a slave. It was viewed that their unfamiliarity with the people’s cultures might have led early Europeans to formulate such an opinion. As men, they were not privileged to interact freely with women. What they knew about women at that time came through male sources (interpreters and husbands), once that erroneous opinion was formed, it was upheld for a long time. It was exploited by the ruling classes, blacks or whites, who had early access to political power.</p> <p>The point is that women exist amidst external environments-human rights, religious barriers, labour laws etc. these environments must be perceived as integral to the women in development concept. Neglecting development issues when speaking of women is just as bad as neglecting women when speaking of development. Yet some development and some sex/gender approaches persist in doing both. Women and socio-economic development is an inclusive term used throughout in this study to signify a concept whose long-range goal is the well-being of society, the community of men, women and children. Over the years, there has been a great debate as to what extent women contribute to the socio-economic development of society. While it could be argued from two opposing ends, it is important to study this sociological problem with a view to finding out if women have actually been contributing to development. However, this research is about the prime contributions of Ibibio women to the socio-economic development of the society from the pre-colonial era and terminates at the on-set of the post-colonial era. The area under review being a patriarchal society explains why Ibibio women could not be relegated to the background completely during the pre-colonial period, but that it was the imposition of British rigid gender construction on the Ibibio traditional flexible gender system at the on-set of colonialism that helped to accentuate the exclusivity of women from the vital forces of change.</p> <p>Having discussed the role of women in the socio-economic development of the society, it was observed that the pre-colonial Ibibio women have transformed tremendously as could be seen in their educational attainment, population growth, technological advancement and feminine regime. A consideration of the historical, social and cultural institutions of women in Ibibioland showcases the fact that there was gender equality of both sexes in pre-colonial times. Women during the period were not regarded as second class citizens, but were seen to perform the task assigned to them by the tradition of the people. On the whole, patriarchal leadership in Ibibioland never oppressed women since women traditional institutions were parallel to those of the men and often, the role of these institutions over-lapped.</p> <p>As the society moved away from this well ordered age towards modernity due to European influence, the fabric that held Ibibio women together started to disintegrate.  Gradually Ibibio women started adapting themselves to the new wave of change. It was not a sharp practice or development, but a development Ibibio women had to understudy and inculcate as their new way of life. It was the external factors like slave trade, western education, Christianity, as well as the new forms of patriarchal concepts introduced in Ibibioland under colonialism that accentuated the alienation of women. In Ibibio society and Nigeria at large, gender relations had existed and had to a great extent determined both the individual development of the Ibibio women and the society. It is asserted by Nwokocha (2004:25) that, the development of any society derives it force from the personal and collective development experienced by members of that society-males and females. Thus, socio economic development derives from the consistent development of the individual components of the society.</p> <p>As events unfolded, Ibibio women started belonging to groups, organizations, trade and commerce. This awareness changed the horizon of the women. They started acquiring western education, their scope and knowledge began to change. It is this changing role from the two epoch of transition (pre-colonial to post colonial era) that this paper attempts to x-ray, to examine if there was any change in the transition of Ibibio women in their socio-economic role to the development of the society in general and in Ibibioland in particular. To seek to establish the changing pattern of gender relations among the Ibibio between 1885-1970. Most importantly, it seeks to examine the major contributions of Ibibio women to the socio-economic development of the society. This is based on the fact that socio-economic development is centred on humans, and it is devoid of gender exclusivity. It was therefore as a result of this gradual change and socio-economic role in the gender inequalities of women that prompted this investigation. It was generally observed that Ibibio women had shown excellent industry in their ability and resolves to be actively involved in activities favoured by the men. What gave them the impetus for these equal relations with the men? How can these equal relations be sustained? How did this situation impact on the socio-economic development role of Ibibio women to the society specially? How significant are the contributions of women to the development of Ibibio society? How can we remove impediments to their roles in the process of development? What do we mean by development? What measures should be taken to improve the participation of women in development? It is these and other posers that are the concern of this study.</p> <p>This study entitled “women and socio-economic development in Ibibioland (1985-1970)” is very crucial to Ibibio and Nigeria’s social history, especially in the light of paucity of literature which refers to the present study. Although considerable research has been carried out about the Ibibio: particularly about their origins, migratory-routes, languages and settlement patterns, none in their entirety had been wholly devoted to the theme of this dissertation. For this reason, the study is relevant as it seeks to fill the gap in the historiography of Ibibioland. This study seeks to investigate the major contributions of Ibibio women in the socio-economic development of Ibibioland during the period under study. This is against the assumption that almost every literature on Ibibio focused on the contributions of men to the society, neglecting those of the women. This in itself will constitute a significant contribution to Ibibio social history. The findings of this study will constitute a viable source of information thereby enlarging the mass of existing literature on Ibibio historiography.</p> <p>Moreover, the study has the potential to stimulate scholarly interests in feminism, gender studies and gender relations, hence contribute to knowledge in the sphere of Ibibio social history. This research work would be very useful in solving the problem of how women may be integrated more into the activities and programmes that promote the development of Akwa Ibom society and Nigeria at large. It would be of great assistance to the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS), which is the umbrella organization of all women bodies in Nigeria, in its future consultations with the government on how women could be better incorporated into development projects carried out in the country. The study would also be of immense value to the personnel of the Ministry of Women Affairs in their developmental potentialities. Most importantly, the work will be an immense guide to the Federal Government in formulating genuine national policy on women.</p> <p>From the foregoing, it is evident that little has been done on Ibibio women and their role in economic development. The available literature on Nigerian women has tended to merge the Ibibio with their dominant Igbo neighbours. While some of the ethnographic literature on the Ibibio refers to women, the historiography of the Ibibio pays little attention to women. The limitation of the written sources referred to above, means that his study is therefore an attempt to re-invent the socio-economic development roles, contributions and status of Ibibio women. It is the intention of this research to highlight the various anti-colonial protests and movements of Ibibio women to show that such was not limited to the Igbo women. Moreover, this research would show that the 1929 women’s political disturbances were not unique, but were part of a historical pattern. This dissertation argues that there were all kinds of differentiations based on gender conception and construction in Ibibio pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial societies that the self image and actions of Ibibio women were often gendered and as such embedded in complex interactive processes. The present study therefore examines the economic, political, social and religious institution in Ibibioland in order to outline the position of Ibibio women.</p> <p><strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>(i)         The present study has the following objectives:</p> <p>to assess the social and economic development process of Ibibioland within the period being studied;</p> <p>(ii)        To examine the contributions of women in the socio-economic development of Ibibioland;</p> <p>(iii)       To assess how gender (sex) has affected the contributions of women to the socio-economic development of Ibibioland;</p> <p>(iv)       To examine how the socio-economic development of Ibibioland has affected the status of women;</p> <p>(v)        To assess the socio-economic transformation in Ibibioland and its impact on women within the period.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>In keeping with the objectives of this study, the focus is mainly on Women and Socio Economic Development: A study of women in Ibibioland (1885-1970). That is, their strength and role in the socio-economic development in the society, the household, the factors which determined their participation, the question of the relationship between women’s participatory development and that of the men, their contributions to the social, economic, political development and the benefits accruing to them. The ways of improving these benefits and the modalities for uplifting the welfare of women in Ibibioland will be attempted. Thus, the issue of women’s welfare, empowerment, their past and present role in the informal sector, the characteristics of these roles and the activities they embrace, the framework of women development issues, women activities (informal) and the economic, social, political and their occupational status are assessed in this study. For the purpose of this study, Ibibio women and the socio-economic development of the society, has been chosen as the study area. The researcher made comparison with other ethnic nationalities in Nigeria to widen the scope of knowledge on the subject.</p> <p>For the purpose of convenience and clarity, this research considered Ibibio women and their socio-economic development role in the society during the pre-colonial periods and terminates at the on-set of the post-colonial era (1885-1970). What factors inspired their transition? The changes Ibibio women adapted were predicated upon the result of the missionary enterprise and attendant impact in terms of Western education, Christianity, new vocations, as well as the articulation of the Ibibio society with the capitalist world economy. During this period many traditional ties and values slackened, owing to the introduction of Christian doctrines.</p> <p>As research of this nature often portrays, a number of indices during the course of the study manifested to impede and impinge on data collection for the study. Paramount among these during oral interviews was the tendency on the part of some of the respondents to with-hold useful information. There were also constrains regarding the conduct of extensive interviews. The area of study was quite expansive and finance was glossly inadequate, thus constituting setbacks in the location of sources of data. Be that as it may, the data gathered from the sources at the researcher’s disposal are representative of the issues/factors investigated.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Methodology</strong></p> <p>This study employed the multi-disciplinary approach, for recourse was made to other disciplines such as sociology, economics, political science, literary arts, religion, psychology and anthropology. In the course of this study, effort was made to garner useful materials. These materials were obtained from the archives, books, relevant documents, journals, and oral interviews. In the final analysis, information was derived from the following sources.</p> <p><strong>1.3.1    Primary Sources</strong></p> <p><strong>(a)        Oral Tradition</strong></p> <p>Oral Tradition is the most important oral evidence. It covers virtually every aspect of life in society, except that they may not provide quantifiable data or may not adequately mirror unconscious change. In terms of reconstructing the socio-economic life of African community, oral traditions are really invaluable.</p> <p>Oral tradition a specialized kind of oral evidence has been defined by Vansina (1985:13), as all verbal testimonies which are reported statements concerning the past. The reality of oral tradition as document from the past resides in the whole body or corpus of the community traditions rather than in individual texts, and include their relation to the ethnographic record of language, culture and artefacts. Zerro (1990:54) defined Oral tradition, as being a testimony transmitted verbally from one generation to another. It special features are the fact that it is verbal and the manner in which it is transmitted. It is thus certainly more fragile, than written records, which are embodied in objects such as manuscripts for instance. It should be added however, that there may be several traditions of a single event and, conversely, there are stereotyped and fixed version of oral tradition.</p> <p>Oral tradition may originally be based either on an eye-witness account, or on an unsubstantiated rumour of purely personal inspiration, or else on an interpretation of other oral tests to produce an entirely new tradition. However, only tradition based from the outset on an eye-witness account are really valid.</p> <p>Marwick (1970:24) reasoned that Oral tradition which take us back beyond living memory, are specially valuable, for societies where the written words is little used.</p> <p><strong>(b)       Sources of Oral Information</strong></p> <p>This comprised oral interview which required that the researcher interact with the informants and where necessary ask questions with a view to collecting information on the subject of research. It involved travelling out of the locality where the researcher resides so as to obtain relevant information for the study. The researcher collected a lot of oral evidences and oral traditions from knowledgeable informants in Ibibioland. These informants were selected from different parts of Ibibioland for the purpose of emphasis and for averting ambiguities and inconsistencies.</p> <p><strong>(c)        Archival Materials:</strong> These were essentially documents and correspondences from the National Archive located at Calabar (NAC) which the researcher consulted.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2.   Secondary Sources</strong></p> <p>This comprised all information derived from printed sources such as text books, journals, articles, magazines as found in both, private and public libraries, electronic data as derived from world wide website and Microsoft Encarta DVD. Below is a breakdown of the secondary sources. </p> <p><strong>(a)        Private Libraries: </strong>The researcher made use of the private libraries of some reputable scholars where-in some textbooks and journals were consulted. Among these were those belonging to Ambassador (Professor) O.E. Nya, Professor M. B. Abasiattai, Professor Dominus Essien, Professor I.V.O. Modo, and Professor Kalu Uka, Dr. Dominic Akpan, Dr Oto-Abasi Akpan, Dr. Edemekung, Dr. Peter Essoh and Dr. Damson. Another private library consulted was that of Elder Ita Iniekung.</p> <p><strong>(b)       Public Libraries</strong>: Similarly the researcher made use of such public libraries as those situated at the universities of Uyo, Calabar, and Ibadan. The Akwa Ibom State library located in the heart of Uyo was equally very useful. In these public libraries relevant textbooks were consulted.</p> <p><strong>(c)        Electronic Database</strong>: The internet was very helpful in this regard; resource materials which bore relevance to the study were electronically retrieved from the world wide websites (www). Equally use was the 2009 Microsoft Encarta DVD.</p>\n\nWOMEN AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN IBIBIO LAND (1885-1970)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WOMEN AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN IBIBIO LAND (1885-1970)", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Inter-group relations is indeed very common among the various groups in Nigeria. One way or the other, people of different ethnic background were at one time or the other engaged in some sort of relations. At one time such relation was peaceful, at other times, the people engaged in violent confrontation. But whatsoever shape the relation assume, it is important to uphold the fact that inter-group relations existed and still exist between and among the different ethnic groups in Nigeria. The relations existed before colonialism, it continued during and even after Colonial Rule. Among the different dimension of inter-group relations in Nigeria include but not limited to the following; marriage, trade, war, politics, and exchange of cultural troupes etc.</p> <p>Although, inter-group relations has an undertone of an affair between immediate neighbors, it is not limited to immediate neighbor only. However, the focus of this topic is on two immediate neighbours, namely: Annang and Igbo ethnic groups. Considering the division of Nigeria into six geo-political zones, the Igbo people occupies the five south eastern states, while the Annang people are a component of Akwa Ibom State which is in south-south region of Nigeria.</p> <p>Thus, among the five Igbo States – Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo, it is Abia State that are immediate neighbours to the Annang people. In Abia State, the communities that are immediate neighbours to the Annang are Ikwuano, Onicha, Ngwa, Abala, Ndoki etc. It is important, perhaps pertinent to use these Igbo groups that are immediate neighbours to Annang people since Igbo is a large ethnic group with many dialect and a variety of culture. Again, inter-group relation between Annang and Igbo could be seen clearer with these Igbo communities than with the entire Igbo ethnic group.1 However, there exist some challenges in the discussion of this topic and these challenges include the following.</p> <p>Firstly, some scholars make no difference between some part of Annang and Igbo. This could be based on the level of migration between the two groups. Secondly, the people of Annang are seen as member of the Ibibio group rather than as a different group altogether. 2 In discussing Annang and Igbo relations, using this mindset, one might think that the entire Ibibio is involved, thus giving the research work a different outlook.</p> <p>Thirdly, Eurocentric scholars with their attitude of describing Africa as war like people have often painted the Annang-Igbo relation as a war-like affair.3 Hence, the tendency of people being misled to think that these two neighbours does not live peaceful at all is high.</p> <p>Last but not the least, the traditional political system of Igbo and (Ibibio) Annang seems very similar especially as both of them are describe as decentralized societies4.

In other words, it is an evidence of scholarship should the researcher utilize a wide range of sources.</p> <p>In the course of this research work, both private and public libraries were consulted. Also, historical methodology was adopted in this research work where the researcher utilized available sources of information. These include primary sources (oral tradition), and secondary sources (unpublished written sources and published written sources). In addition, available information from newspapers, magazines, and the internent were equally utilized in the course of this research work.</p> <p>The reason behind the adoption of oral sources was to clarify the areas unexplained by written sources which were unclear and hard to understand. In addition, some of the socio-cultural practices of pre-colonial era which played tremendous roles in enhancing the relationship between Annang ethnic group and that of the Igbo ethnic  group are still in use. With the above process, the researcher achieved a critical assessment of sources bearing in mind the limitations of sources. Data gathered from written sources such as books, newspaper, magazines, unpublished projects, as well as the internet were thoroughly verified prior to usage.</p> <p><strong>1.4     LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>A number of constraints were experienced in the course of this research work. The inadequacy of the opinions and views of some indigenes from both ethnic groups under discourse who were interview based on the scope of his study of this research work is the researcher’s regrettable limitation.

Nevertheless, these leave room for further research on the subject matter and will strongly welcome and appreciate criticism arising therefore.</p> <p><strong>1.5     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>As a discipline in academic institutions, the study of history has always involved national, continental and world topics. Apparently, there seems to be a neglect of local histories. As a result, many young historians are deficient in information on immediate local histories. However, this project is considered necessary in view of the fact that certain form of inter-group relations existed between the Annang group Igbo group which undoubtedly have some element of conflict.</p> <p>Thus, His research work would attempt to divulge the extent of inter-group relations that existed between the Annang ethnic group and that of the Igbo ethnic group within 1959 through 1970.</p> <p>On this note, therefore, the researcher intends to reveal to the general public the various factors of relations between both aforementioned ethnic groups, as well as the existence of certain conflictual events between both groups. This is necessary because, there cannot be a robust inter-group relations without clashes of interest which might eventually lead to conflict at a certain point. And also, how some of these conflicts still serve as a continuation of inter-course between both aforementioned groups.</p> <p><strong>1.6     REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURES</strong></p> <p>Reviewing the works of other scholars in an attempt to undertake a related task has been a common routine among researchers. Thus, without the views of intellectual predecessors and mentors no product is considered academic or intellectual6.</p> <p>In relation to the context of this study, A. E. Afigbo was of the view that indeed some of the Ibibio Villages – such as Mmonta, Ikot Esop, Ikot Ngwa, Eremakai, Ikot Nja, Nto Etuk, Udom, Ikoti Inyan and Nto Uruan – lived on territory said to belong to the Ndoki (Igbo) village of Azumini to whom they paid annual tributes (Oji ala) each village paying a tortoise, a goat, a case of gin, unspecified number of pots of palm wine and 400 manillas. The last two villages mentioned above divided the tribute they paid between Azumini and Akanu as part of the land they occupied belonged to Akanu7.</p> <p>Also, while commenting on the socio-cultural aspect of inter-group relations between the Ndoki (Igbo) and Annang group, A. E. Afigbo posit that, since they lived so closed, the two ethnic groups intermarried. The Ndoki in particular were said to have been fond of marrying from amongst the Ibibio whose women they claimed made excellent wives8.</p> <ol><li>C. Anene observed that the political boundaries created by the Europeans are artificial9. He further maintained that “even though these artificial boundaries separated ethnics, social-cultural factors ors continue to bring them together in form of inter-marriage10. While commenting on the economic and commercial relations in the Niger-Delta, Obaro Ikime made mentioned of an existing robust inter-group relations among the various groups within the Niger-Delta. Although, such relations are not without conflict11.</li> </ol> <p>It has been revealed by A.B Aderibigbe that the Yoruba, Igbo and Benin had influence on one another12. He further contended that “the impact of the Yoruba and Benin is beyond dispute”13. However, the answer to the question as to whether there were areas of cultural conflicts between these people was omitted in this study.</p> <p>Kenneth Grundy, on one hand, observed that Africans celebrate success with their kits and kins14. However, on the other hand, it could be noted from his study that he was ignorant of what Africans call abomination within their cultural context.</p> <p>It has been divulged by C. C. Ifemesie that a wider-layer of similarity in symbols and rituals exist among the west African peoples15. He further contended that diversities result from adaptation to peculiar environment16. Therefore, it should be noted that peculiarity of cultures indicates aspects of social-cultural relations.</p> <p>Commenting on the preservation of cultural items by the Igbo, and the Igala, which are identical to both groups, Ade Obafemi in his study stressed the view that there exist an institution, Attama, among the Igbo villages of Nsukka region and their Igala neighbours17. But the study failed to realized the possibility in the existence of socio-cultural variances between these two groups-owing to the fact that they are of different ethnicity.</p> <p>In his study, Ikwuoma, C. Anezi uncovers that Orhe/Umuna relations involved inter-marriage18. It should be noted that inter-marriage exist as an integral tool for groups integration. On another note, Gerald C. Nwobu was of the view that the people of Amandugba and their neighbours had other forms of peaceful get-together despite their involvement in inter-village wars which broke out among the people19.</p> <ol><li>N. Tamuno, pointed out in his study that apart from political and cultural contacts, there were also important commercial links existing among the people of the Niger-Benue confluence20. Also, Theresa Acholonu has revealed in her work that there exist inter-marriage between Nkwerre and their neighbours. This practice is attributed to the early contact between these people. Other consequences of such contact include wars21.</li> <li>J. Iwu, in his study, stressed the view that dances contribute immensely in enhancing the socio-cultural relations among various groups of people in Oru division. However, it should be noted that cultural conflicts constitute on aspect of inter-group relations22.</li> </ol> <p>A contribution by E. J. Alogoa proposes  that there exist close historical relations and cultural contacts between the Efik, Ibibio and other peoples of Cross Rivers23. Commenting on the relationship between Cross River people and other communities, John Okoro, revealed as a form of interrelations the existence of inter-marriage between Ihechiwa and the people of Cross River24. It should be noted that adherence to established customs forms a major basis for contracting inter-marriages. Such inter-marriages are discarded with the development of conflicts.</p> <p>Commenting on the political setting of Nigeria, Ikenga, R. A. Ozigbo in his study was of the view that the well known two hundred and forty (240) ethnic groups which have been in existence long before Nigeria came into being did not co-exist in total isolation25. According to him, these ethnic nationalities “… had thrown up mutually beneficial commercial and social relationships with their respective neighbours”26.</p> <p>While studying the people of south eastern Nigeria, C, C. Ifemesia   revealed that these exists a connection between the people OF Nembe, and that these  groups of people “have… always been in the very closet terms of friendship with one another and have never made war on each other27. However, it should be noted that war is an aspect of inter-group relations.</p> <p>Still on his study of the people of the fact that there has been in existence long before the nineteenth century  a close relationship between the people of Okirika and those of Bonny28. In addition, he also maintained that the people of Okirika likewise Bonny has equally maintained inter marriage contact with their Igbo neighbours29.</p> <p>While studying the early states of Nigeria prior to the nineteenth century, G. I. C. Eluwa et al made known of the fact that there existed an institution of divine kinship between the Zaghawa and their Tebu neighbours. Furthermore, they equally posited that there also existed a good business link between these two groups.30 However, the study neglected the fact that there could have possibly existed cultural conflicts between these two group courtesy of ethnic differences.</p> <p>Finally, Basil O. Njoku noted that there existed an economic relations between the Igbo, and their Ijaw/Ibibio neighbours. In his words, “economic transactions existed between the Igbo and Ijaw/Ibibio on the aspect of river rain products and other agricultural products”.</p>\n\nTHE PHENOMENUM OF INTER-GROUP RELATIONS BETWEEN THE ANNANG AND IGBO ETHNIC GROUPS FROM 1959 THROUGH 1970<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PHENOMENUM OF INTER-GROUP RELATIONS BETWEEN THE ANNANG AND IGBO ETHNIC GROUPS FROM 1959 THROUGH 1970", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE                                           </strong></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>The socio- economic life of Uromi women obviously differed in some respect to other ethnic groups in Nigeria. A woman’s position varies according to the (1) kinship structure of the group and (2) role of women within the economic structure of the society, common factors among women of different ethnic groups, however included the domestically orientated jobs and the range or economic activities that the society reserved for women.</p> <p>Economically speaking the people of Uromi maintains an agrarian economy where everybody effectively engaged in Agricultural practices, although most of them are simple farmers. The main crops are food crops, such as yams, corn, cocoyam’s, cassava, rice, plantain and fruits. The larger part of Esan – land is practically a forest region with the agricultural practice as main stay of the economy, which necessitated the emergence of other agro-allied industries. Moreover, the fertility of the soil is very high.</p> <p>Women held a basically complementary rather than subordinate position to men in indigenous colonial society in Uromi, which based power on seniority rather than gender.</p> <p>However, despite the lack of emphasis placed on gender by Nigeria indigenous societies, the lifestyle of the legislation concerning women, therefore attempted to control them, their sexuality and fertility further dxining their subordination. The beginning of colonial rule brought to Africa the European notion that women belonged in the home, nurturing their family. At the same time the societies expected women to work-work which the society considered complementary to that done by men.</p> <p>The state and the beginning of colonial rule began to change the roles of women by means of legislation restricting women and focusing of colonial economy on men.</p> <p><strong>Aims and Objectives</strong></p> <p>The main objectives of this study is to examine colonial rule and the socio-economic life of women in Uromi other specific objectives include:</p> <ul><li>to critically examine the historical background of Esan as well as the political, social and economic institutions.</li> <li>To investigate colonial rule and social economic life of Uromi women.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Scope of Work</strong></p> <p>The scope of this work is focus on a major group in Edo state are of Nigeria.

As a result of this, there are gender imbalance that tends to take place among both sexes. There are various gender inequalities that preoccupies the system which ranges from violence to abuses, discriminations as well as denial to political offices. Even though the attainment of gender equality is not only seen as an end in itself, it is equally an end in ingredients to and a product for the achievement of sustainable development of countries.<br/>The method of the research work is based on the secondary source of analysis which is done through the use of journals, internet materials and other archival sources of information which is going to be relevant. Though Nigeria as a country with the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation and Nigeria has been a signatory to various international treaties and policies as well.<br/>Various discoveries has revealed that gender inequality is a great challenge to Nigeria even as a developing country, such as discriminations that women are faced with including abuses. Although, the UN been an International Organization having established various policies such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) etc. Despite all these policies that have been established for the purpose of nullifying the distinction, exclusion made on the basis of sex, UN itself still encounters various problems, such is the fact that women work more than women but are still been paid low. With this policies, UN still have its challenges such that lack of women to improper education, cultural and social beliefs of the women, poor recognition of women issues etc are still some of the challenges the United Nations is facing.<br/>In conclusion, if all the policies that the United Nation has established coupled with the treaties that Nigeria has signed are put into effect, it will thus increase the knowledge of women as well as curb barriers that are been placed against women, such as vying for political positions, for instance, in Brazil and Germany; they have females as their Presidents known as Chancellor, Nigeria also can get to that position.</p>\n\nUNITED NATIONS AND THE CHALLENGES OF PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " UNITED NATIONS AND THE CHALLENGES OF PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY IN NIGERIA", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Conflict is an inescapable phenomenon of human life both at the interpersonal or international level.1 The prevalence of conflict, its management and prevention are therefore critical areas of international relations.  Conflict comes in varied forms.  They could be interstate, arising from perennial disagreements between States;

the Angolan Crisis in 1975 after the exit of the Portuguese Administrators, which signaled an end to Portuguese imperialism in Angola.  The forces of liberation cut across three ethnic based nationalistic and belligerent movements enmeshed in a deep-seated fratricidal struggle for political authority.  They are, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), and the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  There was also the fourth – FLEC – Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave.  This was a Separatist Movement for economic hegemony.</li> </ol> <p>Conflict by its very nature is inevitable.  Although not all conflicts result in armed force, this paper discusses armed or violent conflict which has for long dominated relations between the Arabs and Israelis.</p> <p>David Francis of the Department of Basic Studies of the University of Bradford in his work, <em>“Peace and Conflict Studies: An African Overview of Basic Concept”</em> defines conflict “as an intrinsic and inevitable part of human existence.  However, violent conflict is inevitable and as such, is an anomaly.  Conflict is defined as the pursuit of incompatible interests and goals by different individuals and groups.  Armed conflict is the resort to the use of force and armed violence in the pursuit of incompatible and particular interest and goal”.</p> <p>The International Criminal Tribunal in Yugoslavia states that “armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State”.</p> <p><strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Understanding the theoretical perspectives of international relations provides an analytical framework with which we mirror events in the international political system.  To serve the purpose of this research, therefore, our methodological approach shall first and foremost, entail a comprehensive examination of the contending theoretical groundwork that are seminal to international relations.  These are the theories of liberalism, realism and Marxism.</p> <p>Theories of liberalism emphasize man as a rational being able to weigh the Strengths and Weaknesses of available options and their outcomes3.  The unique preference of liberal theorists for democratic liberalism which is the very essence of America’s democracy, and Laissez faire which connotes economic liberalism equips individuals with the freedom to discover their potentials in order to improve on their well-being.  This is the conceptual basis for capitalism.  Neo-liberal institutionalism - a modern variant of liberalism posits that in an anarchic international environment, there is the tendency for States to cooperate with each other because it is in their best interest to do so.  The game theory highlighting the Prisoners’ dilemma in evaluating the possible options open to them and their probable outcomes explains the imperatives for international cooperation4.</p> <p> The realist theoretical view point which sees realism as one of the dominant Schools of thought in international relations posits that States behave in a particular manner out of considerations for national interest.  Realism emerged as a profound reaction to the idealism that heralded the formation of the League of Nations, espousing a more normatively driven approach; the structural outlines of which were transmitted to the United Nations.  The father of realism – Thucydides reputed to be an exemplar of the realist tradition, in his work, “<em>The Peloponnesian War”</em>, examined the display of power by strong states over the weak. </p> <p> Thurcydides’ analysis of the Melian Dialogue involved Athens and Sparta – both Greek City States that exercised hegemonic authority at about the 5th century B.C.  Each of these States feared the other.  This struggle for hegemony by Athens and Sparta became worrisome for the smaller State of Melos that was desirous of maintaining her neutrality.  Athens desired to bring Melos under subjugation, opting to attack Melos if she declined to submit to Athens’ authority.  Melos indeed called the bluff of Athens.  Consequently Melos was un-provokingly attacked and defeated by Athens.  Against this background, Thucydides concluded that justice is as defined by the victor which is a common feature of international relations.</p> <p>Morgenthau in his work, “Politics among Nations” also elaborated on the realist perspectives of international relations.  For Morgenthau, international politics is a struggle for power whether at the individual, state, or international level.</p> <p>The exercise of power involves an attempt by one party to get an individual or state to act in a manner contrary to pre-conceived wishes or interests.</p> <p>Karl Marx’s (1818 – 1883) radical concept – Marxism is a historical analysis which centred on class struggle.  He stratified society in two basic social groups, that is the ruling class and a subject class.  He theorized that the ruling class owns and controls the means of production and therefore derived its power through this process, which it perpetually exercises over the subject class.5  Marx alluded to the evolution of Western Society through four stages.  These are the phase of:</p> <ul><li>primitive communism,</li> <li>ancient society,</li> <li>feudal society, and</li> <li>capitalist society.</li> </ul> <p>            Pre-historic society epitomizes primitive communism which basically was a classless society.  From here society evolved into the master and slaves in ancient society, lords and serfs in feudal society, and capitalist society which involves the bourgeoisie and the wage earners – the labourers6.</p> <p>            In the Communist Manifesto jointly co-authored with his bosom friend and confidant – Friedrich Engels in 1848, Marx stated that his taxonomy of society is not a functional class in terms of income, but an economic class in terms of its economic interests.7  He maintained that such economic classes are not fixed in society but that, they are the result of the production relations that society has adopted.  He was of the view that capitalism as an economic system is exploitative and that an enduring capitalist formation will perpetually keep the working class subjugated to the whims and caprices of the bourgeoisie. His theoretical advocacy was to have a revolutionary reconstruction of society through the incentivization of the proletariat to seize the ownership and means of production from the State in order to enhance their well-being by replacing capitalism with socialism.8  In the Marxist normative and activist thinking, this would help to ameliorate inequalities and reduce dependency relationship that exists in class rule.  In the course of this work we shall highlight the Leninist variant of Marxism, and how the various theories enumerated above played out in the Middle-East crisis.</p> <p>            Secondly, our methodology shall also examine the events of Post World War II which heralded the emergence of two Super-powers – the United States of America and the Soviet Union as “primary actors in the international system”9.  The Cold-War imperatives occasioned by Soviet Marxist political expansionism (Sovietization) orchestrated to bring countries of Eastern Europe – Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and parts of Eastern Germany into Soviet Orbit (as they were farcically referred to as “Peoples Democracies”) and  also the Subterranean designs to extend same to parts of Western Europe, accounted for United States inexorable commitment to the Truman Doctrine of 1947 which came up with the policy framework of <strong>containment</strong> to check Soviet Communist aggression in any part of the world.10</p> <p>            In President Truman’s declaration, he asserted “I believe it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.  I believe that we must assist free peoples to work their own destinies in their own way”.  This policy thrust based on United States geostrategic interest became the fundamental doctrine of American foreign policy during the bi-polar years which played out in a series of proxy confrontations as a Balance of Power mechanism between the superpowers in the Middle-East.  The United States traditional support for Israel and Soviet’s backing for moderate Arab States such as Egypt, Syria and Iraq became visible in the numerous wars fought in that region.11  This will be expatiated upon in the course of this work.</p> <p>            Thirdly, the divisiveness within the Arab community has also exacerbated hostilities in the Middle-East.  Then, finally, Arab response or revisionist movements against the State of Israel and her imperial collaborators, as well as the preponderance of bilateral or multilateral diplomacy at resolving the conflict shall form the concluding portion of this work.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Conflict is an inescapable phenomenon of human life both at the interpersonal or international level.1 The prevalence of conflict, its management and prevention are therefore critical areas of international relations.  Conflict comes in varied forms.  They could be interstate, arising from perennial disagreements between States; intra-state civil conflicts which may come in varying degrees such as inter-ethnic conflicts; religious conflicts induced by ecclesiastical rivalries; conflict due to ideological incompatibilities amongst others.  Some notable crises in human history includes those between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland, the Croats and Serbs in former Yugoslavia, the African National Congress and the Apartheid regime in South Africa, Rwandan crisis between the Hutus and Tutsis; the Biafran Separatist Movement in Nigeria, Israeli – Palestinian Conflict which is the focus of this research, to mention a few.              The allusion of the English Philosopher – Thomas Hobbes (1588 – 1679) in his work “Leviathan” to an anarchic state of nature where the dominant individual interest is self-preservation, is an apt description of the international system.2             Extrapolating to the international domain, Hobbessian theorizing is accentuated by the very absence of a hierarchical structure of government in the international arena to check the eccentricity of States whose actions in the guise of national interest replicates a state of nature.  This is in contrast with what obtains in the domestic arena where Municipal law is invoked in case of an infraction.     Hobbessian prescriptions that, “power be centrally and absolutely controlled, that is, a “unitary state” is however inconceivable in the international system.             Scholars of international relations are of the opinion that the Concept of State Sovereignty which is an outcrop of the idealism orchestrated by the Westphalian Settlement, promotes the culture of anarchism in the international system.  This is against the backdrop of the “free-wheeling irresponsibility” of Sovereign States.  Many writers are of the view that Sovereignty in contemporary international relations is an anachronism, as it is akin to absolutism.             However, the broadening focus of international law which re-conceptualizes the notion of sovereignty, now exerts a restraining influence on Sovereign States by making them answerable in relation to acts bordering on crimes against humanity and international humanitarian law.  This has advanced the frontiers of international relations.             Perhaps, before an examination is made into the Arab – Israeli Conflict, it is pertinent to peruse some of the probable causes of conflict and at the same time provide an analytical assessment of the dispute.  Conflicts are manifestations of an underlying and sustained disagreement between groups that have not shown enough commitment to lasting peace.             Fundamentally, the perenniality of an un-resolved societal gap or problem could be an incentive for conflict.  The roots of the Israeli – Palestinian Conflict which has assumed a broader dimension, that is, the Arab – Israeli Conflict, could be traced primarily to the rivalry between the Jewish Israelis and the Muslim Palestinians over primordial claims to the same territory.  It could be encapsulated as “One Land, Two Peoples”.              Some probable causes of conflict among other things are: Incompatibilities of objectives and actions among interacting groups or policy in the case of states, could be an inducement for conflicts. Conflicts could arise as a result of a demand for a piece of territory for example, the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait and Saddam Hussein’s intention to subvert the Sovereign prerogatives of the Kuwaiti government which attracted international condemnation and allied response led by the United States to defeat Iraq’s aggression. Economic hegemony of a particular group over the resources of another could ignite conflicts.  For example, the Northern control of the resources of the Niger Delta in Nigeria which led to increased militarization of the region before the Amnesty Programme introduced by the Federal Authorities, which has now doused tensions. Religious and ideological diversities or incompatibilities which may translate into ecclesiastical claims of superiority of one religion over another, often times have given rise to national rivalries between groups. Domestic rebellion which attracts international sympathy, for example the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria in recent times, could be a source of international conflict. Liberation struggles, such as those between the African National Congress (ANC) and the White Supremacist regime of Apartheid South Africa; the Angolan Crisis in 1975 after the exit of the Portuguese Administrators, which signaled an end to Portuguese imperialism in Angola.  The forces of liberation cut across three ethnic based nationalistic and belligerent movements enmeshed in a deep-seated fratricidal struggle for political authority.  They are, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), and the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  There was also the fourth – FLEC – Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave.  This was a Separatist Movement for economic hegemony. Conflict by its very nature is inevitable.  Although not all conflicts result in armed force, this paper discusses armed or violent conflict which has for long dominated relations between the Arabs and Israelis. David Francis of the Department of Basic Studies of the University of Bradford in his work, “Peace and Conflict Studies: An African Overview of Basic Concept” defines conflict “as an intrinsic and inevitable part of human existence.  However, violent conflict is inevitable and as such, is an anomaly.  Conflict is defined as the pursuit of incompatible interests and goals by different individuals and groups.  Armed conflict is the resort to the use of force and armed violence in the pursuit of incompatible and particular interest and goal”. The International Criminal Tribunal in Yugoslavia states that “armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State”. METHODOLOGY Understanding the theoretical perspectives of international relations provides an analytical framework with which we mirror events in the international political system.  To serve the purpose of this research, therefore, our methodological approach shall first and foremost, entail a comprehensive examination of the contending theoretical groundwork that are seminal to international relations.  These are the theories of liberalism, realism and Marxism. Theories of liberalism emphasize man as a rational being able to weigh the Strengths and Weaknesses of available options and their outcomes3.  The unique preference of liberal theorists for democratic liberalism which is the very essence of America’s democracy, and Laissez faire which connotes economic liberalism equips individuals with the freedom to discover their potentials in order to improve on their well-being.  This is the conceptual basis for capitalism.  Neo-liberal institutionalism - a modern variant of liberalism posits that in an anarchic international environment, there is the tendency for States to cooperate with each other because it is in their best interest to do so.  The game theory highlighting the Prisoners’ dilemma in evaluating the possible options open to them and their probable outcomes explains the imperatives for international cooperation4.  The realist theoretical view point which sees realism as one of the dominant Schools of thought in international relations posits that States behave in a particular manner out of considerations for national interest.  Realism emerged as a profound reaction to the idealism that heralded the formation of the League of Nations, espousing a more normatively driven approach; the structural outlines of which were transmitted to the United Nations.  The father of realism – Thucydides reputed to be an exemplar of the realist tradition, in his work, “The Peloponnesian War”, examined the display of power by strong states over the weak.   Thurcydides’ analysis of the Melian Dialogue involved Athens and Sparta – both Greek City States that exercised hegemonic authority at about the 5th century B.C.  Each of these States feared the other.  This struggle for hegemony by Athens and Sparta became worrisome for the smaller State of Melos that was desirous of maintaining her neutrality.  Athens desired to bring Melos under subjugation, opting to attack Melos if she declined to submit to Athens’ authority.  Melos indeed called the bluff of Athens.  Consequently Melos was un-provokingly attacked and defeated by Athens.  Against this background, Thucydides concluded that justice is as defined by the victor which is a common feature of international relations. Morgenthau in his work, “Politics among Nations” also elaborated on the realist perspectives of international relations.  For Morgenthau, international politics is a struggle for power whether at the individual, state, or international level. The exercise of power involves an attempt by one party to get an individual or state to act in a manner contrary to pre-conceived wishes or interests. Karl Marx’s (1818 – 1883) radical concept – Marxism is a historical analysis which centred on class struggle.  He stratified society in two basic social groups, that is the ruling class and a subject class.  He theorized that the ruling class owns and controls the means of production and therefore derived its power through this process, which it perpetually exercises over the subject class.5  Marx alluded to the evolution of Western Society through four stages.  These are the phase of: primitive communism, ancient society, feudal society, and capitalist society.             Pre-historic society epitomizes primitive communism which basically was a classless society.  From here society evolved into the master and slaves in ancient society, lords and serfs in feudal society, and capitalist society which involves the bourgeoisie and the wage earners – the labourers6.             In the Communist Manifesto jointly co-authored with his bosom friend and confidant – Friedrich Engels in 1848, Marx stated that his taxonomy of society is not a functional class in terms of income, but an economic class in terms of its economic interests.7  He maintained that such economic classes are not fixed in society but that, they are the result of the production relations that society has adopted.  He was of the view that capitalism as an economic system is exploitative and that an enduring capitalist formation will perpetually keep the working class subjugated to the whims and caprices of the bourgeoisie. His theoretical advocacy was to have a revolutionary reconstruction of society through the incentivization of the proletariat to seize the ownership and means of production from the State in order to enhance their well-being by replacing capitalism with socialism.8  In the Marxist normative and activist thinking, this would help to ameliorate inequalities and reduce dependency relationship that exists in class rule.  In the course of this work we shall highlight the Leninist variant of Marxism, and how the various theories enumerated above played out in the Middle-East crisis.             Secondly, our methodology shall also examine the events of Post World War II which heralded the emergence of two Super-powers – the United States of America and the Soviet Union as “primary actors in the international system”9.  The Cold-War imperatives occasioned by Soviet Marxist political expansionism (Sovietization) orchestrated to bring countries of Eastern Europe – Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and parts of Eastern Germany into Soviet Orbit (as they were farcically referred to as “Peoples Democracies”) and  also the Subterranean designs to extend same to parts of Western Europe, accounted for United States inexorable commitment to the Truman Doctrine of 1947 which came up with the policy framework of containment to check Soviet Communist aggression in any part of the world.10             In President Truman’s declaration, he asserted “I believe it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.  I believe that we must assist free peoples to work their own destinies in their own way”.  This policy thrust based on United States geostrategic interest became the fundamental doctrine of American foreign policy during the bi-polar years which played out in a series of proxy confrontations as a Balance of Power mechanism between the superpowers in the Middle-East.  The United States traditional support for Israel and Soviet’s backing for moderate Arab States such as Egypt, Syria and Iraq became visible in the numerous wars fought in that region.11  This will be expatiated upon in the course of this work.             Thirdly, the divisiveness within the Arab community has also exacerbated hostilities in the Middle-East.  Then, finally, Arab response or revisionist movements against the State of Israel and her imperial collaborators, as well as the preponderance of bilateral or multilateral diplomacy at resolving the conflict shall form the concluding portion of this work.  </p>\n\nTHE ARAB-ISREALI CONFLICT AND UNITED STATES GEO-STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE-EAST<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ARAB-ISREALI CONFLICT AND UNITED STATES GEO-STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE-EAST", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Kofi Annan was born in the Kafandors Section of Kumasi, in Central Ghana, Africa, in what was then the British colony of the Gold Coast, on April 8, 1938.  He is a twin, which has a respected state in Ghanaian culture.  His full name is Kofi Atta Annan, while his twin sister Efua Atta, who died in 1991, shares the middle name Atta, which in Fante and Akan means \"twin\".  Annan and his sister were born into one of the country's aristocratic families, both their grandfather and their uncle were tribal chiefs.1 and became accustomed to both traditional and modern ways of life.  He has described himself as being \"atribal in a tribal world\".<br/>In Akan tradition, some children are named according to the day of the week on when they were born; and in relation to how many children precede them.  Kofi in Akan is the name that corresponds with Friday.2<br/>In 1965, Kofi Annan married Titi Alakija, a Nigerian woman from a well to do family.  Several years later, they had a daughter, Ana and later a son Kojo.  The couple separated in the late seventies that is when Kojo was six years old and got a divorce two years later.  In 1984, Annan remarried to Nane Legergran a Swedish lawyer at the United Nations (UN).3<br/>Between 1954 and 1957, Annan attended the Elite Mfantsipim School, a Methodist Boarding School in Cape Coast, founded in the 1870s.  Annan has said that the school taught him \"that suffering anywhere concerns people every where.4  In 1957, the year Annan graduated from Mfantsipim, Ghana gained independence from Britain.<br/>At the age of twenty, he won a Ford Foundation Scholarship for undergraduate studies at Macalester College, St. Paul.  In 1958, Annan began studying economics at the Kumasi College of Science and Technology, now the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology of Ghana.  He received a Ford Foundation grant, enabling him to complete his undergraduate studies at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, United States.  In 1961, Annam then did a DEA degree in International Relations at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.  After some years of work experience, Annan became the Alfred P. Sloan Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  He studied at the MIT Sloan School of Management.5 Even then, he was showing signs of becoming a diplomat, or someone skilled in International Relations.  At the end of his fellowship program, he was awarded a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Management.<br/><strong>Early Career</strong><br/>In 1962, Kofi Annan started working as a Budget Officer for the World Health Organization, an agency of the United Nations (UN).   In 1972, he moved to Cairo, Egypt, as Chief Civilian Personnel Officer in the UN emergency force.  Annan briefly changed career in 1974 when he left the United Nations to serve as Managing Director of the Ghana Tourist Development Company where he worked as the Director of Tourism in Ghana.  Annan returned to International Diplomacy at the United Nations in 1976.  For the next seven years, he was associated with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva.  He returned to the UN Headquarters in New York City in 1983 as Director of the Budget in the Financial Services Office.  In the late 1980s, Annan returned to work for the UN, where he was appointed as an Assistant Secretary-General in three consecutive positions.  Human Resources, Management and Security Coordinator (1987 - 1990), he became Assistant Security-General for another department at the United Nations, the office of Program Planning, Budget and Finance, and Controller (1990 - 1992) and Peace Keeping Operations (March 1993 - December 1996).<br/>In fulfilling his duties to the United Nations, Annan has spent most of his adult life in the United States, specifically at the UN headquarters in New York City.  Annan has by this time filled a number of roles at the United Nations, ranging from peace keeping to managerial and 1990s were no different.  In 1990, he negotiated the release of hostages in Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait.  Five years later, he oversaw the transition of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to the Multi-national Implementation Force (IFOR) a UN peace Keeping organization.  In this transfer of responsibility, operations in the former Yugoslavia were turned over to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).<br/>The Rwandan Genocide took place in 1994 while Annan directed UN peacekeeping operations.  In 2003, Canadian ex-General Romeo Dallaire, who was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda, claimed that Annan was overly passive in his response to the imminent genocide.  In his book, shake hands with the devil:  The failure of Humanity in Rwanda (2003).  General Dallaire asserted that Annan held back UN troops from intervening to settle the conflict, and from providing more logistical and material support.  Dallaire claimed that Annan failed to provide responses to his repeated faxes asking for access to a weapons depository, such weapons could have helped Dallaire defend the endangered Tutsis.<br/>In 2004, ten years after the genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed, Annan said \"I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and really support\".6 Annan served as Under-Secretary-General from March 1994 to October 1995.  He was appointed a Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the former Yugoslavia, serving for five months before returning to his duties as Under-Secretary-General in April 1996.  In recognition of his abilities, Annan was appointed Secretary-General, the top post of the United Nations by the UN General Assembly in December 1996.  He began serving his four-year term of office on January 1, 1997.  Joining him was his second wife, former lawyer+- Nane Lagergren of Sweden.  She is the niece of the diplomat Raoul Wallenberg (1912 - 1947), who saved thousands of European Jews from the German Nazis during World War II (1937 - 45), when American-led forces fought against Germany, Italy and Japan.  Annan and Lagergren were married in 1985.  The couple had one child.</p>\n\nTHE UNITED NATIONS UNDER KOFI ANNAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE UNITED NATIONS UNDER KOFI ANNAN", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>“Without information there is no accountability, Information is power and the more people who posses it, the more power is distributed”1 Journalism is more about dissemination of information which the press in Nigeria does daily, weekly and monthly through newspapers and magazines. There is an aspect of journalism that deals with investigation (investigative journalism). This goes beyond just news, it brings out surprising revelations about our society. Journalists having sensed irregularity or inappropriate acts in our politics investigate the issue and bring out the facts. In spite of the consequences of this action on individual journalist and the output, the practice continues. It is against this background that the researcher intends to study the press war against political indiscipline in Nigeria between 1999 and 2007 using the punch newspapers as a case study.</p> <p>1.1     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The objective of this research is to examine the press war against political Indiscipline in Nigeria with particular reference to the punch newspaper between 1999 which is the return of democracy to 2007 the last election held in Nigeria.</p> <p>To examine the processes of investigative journalism, which is hidden to non-professionals, but cherished within the profession for its worth.</p> <ul><li>SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>The researcher intends to investigate the issue of press war against political Indiscipline in Nigeria. A case study of the Punch newspaper between 1999 and 2007 (that is the return of democracy to the last election). It is therefore important to note that this research focuses only on the punch war against political Indiscipline in Nigeria. Though references would be made to some of the roles of other newspapers against political Indiscipline in Nigeria between 1999 and 2007.</p> <p>1.3     RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>A synthesis of primary and secondary sources was adopted which include: series of textbooks, research project works, magazines, newspapers as well as oral interview Materials were consulted on the internet relating to the press war against political indiscipline in Nigeria. Oral interview was conducted with journalists from the punch newspaper Lagos and member of the management. Politicians were also interviewed.</p> <p>1.4     LITERATURE  REVIEW</p> <p>This project topic “The Press War Against Political Indiscipline in Nigeria” is a sensitive and as well a very important issue. Therefore, various literatures and paper presentations has been combined. Although this literatures and presentations have not particularly pointed out the press war against political indiscipline in Nigeria but they have related points that have proved useful to this work.</p> <p>One of the important books on the Press in Nigeria is <em>Press and Politics in Nigeria 1880- 1937</em> by professor Fred Omu, which carefully outlined the role of the press during the early and later stages of colonialism as an opposition organ to the imperialist government. The educated Africans were so concerned with the education of the Natives to be politically aware of their environment, not just any form of education but a knowledge that will make them a base for strong public opinion that the colonial government would find it difficult to ignore, the press formed itself as a strong opposition against the government with the hope of raising the political awareness of the people against the government of the day. Nonetheless; Omu X-rayed the press in Nigeria as leader pace setter in the sense that it was the first organ to begin the call for the dismantling of colonialism, he saw the press as the father of all Nigerian nationalists9  because all the early nationalists were at one time or the other newspaper men.</p> <p>Throughout the breath and length of the book, Omu identified and discussed two types of the press, the missionary and the African press, the African press he portrayed as being very antagonistic towards the Europeans and their activities in Africa while the missionary press engaged in missionary propaganda. But it was the former that inspired most Nigerians to enter the newspaper business hence the growth of the press. Omu identified and discussed on the nature of the different newspapers that has appeared on the Nigerian news stand and also the pattern of the newspaper trade.2</p> <p>Another important work to this study is <em>The Nigerian newspaper press; 1859-1937: A study in</em> <em>origin, Growth and Influence</em>(an unpublished Ph. D thesis 1965) by professor Fred I. Omu. This work outlined the origin of the press in Nigeria which was dated to 1859 with the first newspaper, <em>IWE IROYIN</em> a Yoruba vernacular newspaper published by Rev. Henry Townsend in Abeokuta which was meant to serve the Yoruba community. To Omu this was very remarkable because it opened a new chapter in the history of what is today called Nigeria, Omu traced the development of the indigenous newspaper in Nigeria which grew from a very small venture controlled by organizations to a very large scale concern now controlled mostly by individuals; and this change the structure  of the industry. He also mentioned the low technical quality of the manpower, fund and facilities. He also treated the nature of the facilities at the disposal of this early press.</p> <p>Inspite of these problems, he portrayed the Nigerian press then as very power force which checked the colonial government and hence they enacted some press Laws. The press to him then “fearlessly ventilated public grievances and sought to improve the local environment”. Omu in this scholarly work examined the different newspapers that have made their appearances on the news stand and gave general reason why some of them did not n last for long, some stayed for a short time while some lasted for a long time like The Punch Newspapers. The author examined the pattern and techniques of the business, he gave reasons why the circulation was handicapped and the factor that determined the magnitude of the profits and sources of income for the industry which came mainly from government subscription, advertisement, tribal supports and the popularity of the personnel’s at the head  of the affairs. Also limited finance hindered its acquisition of new machines for operation and finally he identified and classified different types of newspaper likely weekly papers, provincial paper, Lagos papers, Southern paper, Daily papers, and monthly papers, quarterly and missionary publication. Also the origins of the different press laws were traced and why such law came into being. While my work is to concentrate on the Daily Times newspaper, Omu’s work treated the newspaper industry as a whole, with more emphasis on the political influence of newspapers at the time they existed.3</p> <p>One of the relevant works is that of Jerry Goldman in his book titled “The challenge of democratic government in America” he focuses on the role of mass media in promoting communication from a government to its citizens and from citizens to their government. He pointed out that in democratic government, information must flow freely in both directions: a democratic government can be responsive to public opinion only if its citizens can make their opinions known.</p> <p>He also said that a story’s political significance, educational value or broad social importance does not determine whether it is covered by the media, as a lay man will think, rather the primary criteria of a story’s newsworthiness is usually its audiences appeal as judged by its high impact on readers, its sensationalist aspect, its close to home character and its timeliness. A major news media seek to cover political events through first hand reports from journalists on the scene. Because so many significant political events occur in the nation’s capitals virtually all citizens must rely on the mass media for their political news4</p> <p>Ayo Olutokun and Dele Seteolu in <em>The media and democratic rule in Nigeria</em> said the media is not immune to corruption, ethnicity or factionalism, all of which afflict the Nigeria socio-polity. This has necessarily detracted from their moral profile and consequently weakened their role in democracy.</p> <p>Self cleansing, internal regulation mechanisms such as the pres council as well as keen commercial competition, help to restrain, in a measure some of these abuses.</p> <p>Ayo olutokun and Dele Seteolu in this work dwell much on the bad side of the press. They pointed out the areas of weakness of the press in Nigeria. They also made it known that these weaknesses are reducing the impact of the press in the democratic rule in Nigeria. They called on the authorities concern to do something about it. though no specific method or way out was prescribed or given to help the press out of the weaknesses discribed5</p> <p>Governor Chimaraoke Nnamani of Enugu State in <em>The press and the Nigeria project</em> addressed the evolution of the press (media) in Nigeria and the developmental stages of the media. He also pointed out some of the problems facing the media. He said “someday, I hope the media, in the self study will seek to understand what now looks like a hunger for heroes and subsequent lowering of the standards in the new emerging culture of scaling it down to create celebrities anyhow.</p> <p>In the first place, the failure to project the right social frame for Nigerians to consider their society and for the citizenry to relate their expectation frames work. Exposed the press as having failed to take up the challenge of positioning their beloved country for progressive not necessarily a leaping, changing and blotting, race to sustainable growth and development6</p> <p>Professor Sam Oyoubaire in <em>The media and the democratic process in Nigeria (1)</em> said “the point is that the media has a constitutional mandate in the advancement of the political and democratic process. It is equally true that the nature and character of the democratic process greatly impacts upon the performance of the media. It is in this sense that the nature and character of the military regime can affect tremendously the performance of the media just as the nature and character of a democratic regime can do the same. Therefore until it is fully researched and analyzed. It is not enough to proclaim that democracy necessarily provided a much healthy environments for the media or that a military regime necessarily undermines or stifles the fundamental performance of the media.</p> <p>He succeeded in comparing the impact of both military and civilians’ government on the media generally. He also examines how much the media is faring under each of the regimes (military and civilian regimes). He did not treat the press war against political indiscipline in Nigeria.7</p> <p>Richard Joslyn in his <em>Mass media and elections</em> described the activities of journalists in covering, collating arranging and presenting information (reports) in a way that make it interesting and pleasant to the audience. He said “News coverage is typically tact-based and non opinionated but also interpretive thematic and dramatic. Journalists select the each and symbols to be transmitted to their audiences; organize and amputee them in a way that produces coherent, interesting and dramatic stories they present a simplified, engaging and understandable account of complex and ambiguous phenomena. In the process they render political judgments that might not be shared by all” He treated various activities of journalist which a lay man might not understand hence its professionalism. The activities of journalist and their work during election was the major point treated in his work8.</p>\n\nTHE PRESS WAR AGAINST POLITICAL INDISCIPLINE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PRESS WAR AGAINST POLITICAL INDISCIPLINE IN NIGERIA", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The phrase “Nigeria as the giant of Africa” has been known by many nations because of the leading roles she plays in policy-makings and their implementations.  Also, these leading roles are prevalent in her military prowess, landscape, natural and human resources and natural endowment.  The larger world as well as other African nations has in contemporary time looked up to Nigeria as the “Savior” of African race given the enormity of the resources that mother nature had endowed her with in comparison to other African states.1<br/>Sequel to the above, Nigeria has also played leading and significant roles towards the establishment of various agencies such as Organization of Africa Unity (OAU), Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and African Union (AU) among others.  This same philosophy informed her strategic roles aimed at establishing and realizing the objectives of the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD). 2   To this end, the thrust of this research revolves around the enormous issues, challenges and prospects of this African project called NEPAD.</p> <p>The phrase “Nigeria, the Giant of Africa” has been so used by Nigerians especially our leaders that people of critical mind sometimes wonder what has been the basis for this judgment. In other words, analysts and scholars from time to time have attempted to look at Nigeria’s claim to leadership in Africa from various perspectives. The most popular and noticeable reasons always for these include Nigeria’s population, military strength, land mass, natural and mineral resources, etc. 3</p> <p>In addition, the larger World has in contemporary time looked up to Nigeria to play a leading role in African Affairs, given the enormity of the resources that nature has endowed on her as compared to other African states. Whether Nigeria has been able to justify this confidence is yet another thing</p> <p>What this research seeks to do essentially therefore is an appraisal of what contributions Nigeria has made in realizing the aims and objectives articulated in the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD).</p> <p>1.2   AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</p> <p>As is traditional with programmes of this nature, statements articulating aims and objectives, both long-term and short are always in abundant supply. Whether these aims and objectives are later realized however depends on availability of resources and the kind of determination of the promoters of such programmes.</p> <p>The aims and objectives drawn up by African leaders who are the main promoters of the programmes are all embracing, covering almost all areas of problems, needs and general aspirations of the African continent.</p> <p>However, the long term objective of NEPAD as contained in public enlightenment series published by the Justice Development and Peace Commission of the Catholic Diocese of Ijebu Ode are:-</p> <ol><li>to eradicate poverty in Africa and to place African countries both individually and collectively on a path of sustainable growth and development, and thus halt the marginalization of Africa in the globalization process and</li> <li>to promote the role of women in all activities.</li> </ol> <p>Specific goals of the programme, which are many, include the followings:</p> <ol><li>to achieve and sustain an average percent (7%) per annum for the next 15 years.</li> <li>to ensure that the continent achieves the agreed International Development Goals (I.D.G) as thus:-</li> <li>Reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015.</li> <li>Enrolment of all children of school age in primary school by 2015.</li> <li>Making progress towards gender equality and empowerment of women.</li> <li>Reducing infant mortality ratio by two third (2/3) by 2015.</li> <li>Reducing maternal mortality ratio by two third (2/3) in 2015.</li> <li>Providing access for all who need reproductive health services by 2015.</li> <li>To implement national strategies for sustainable development by 2015 so as to reverse the loss of environmental degradation 1 pollution. 4</li> </ol> <p>1.3 Significance of the Study</p> <p>This work is very significant because it sought to throw light essentially on an African problem that has been begging for an African solution because charity they say must begin at home. If Africa must achieve development then laudable goals and objectives the likes of NEPAD must be pursued and articulated by none other than Africans themselves. The idea therefore conceived by the founders of NEPAD becomes very essential if Africa is to move forward so all efforts at actualizing this is very significant in like manner whatever findings from this research may help in its own contribution towards achieving this development.</p> <p>1.4 Scope of the Study   </p> <p>The scope of the research shall cover the period when Nigeria and other African leaders like South African Thabo Mbeki, Nigeria’s Obasanjo Bouteflika of Algeria met to formulate what then was known as The Millennium African Plan (MAP) in 2000. The birth of NEPAD was 23rd October, 2001 in Nigeria capital city of Abuja. The scope therefore shall be between the years 2001-2010 5</p> <p>1.5 Research Methodology</p> <p>Firstly, historical – critical method will be employed to the study that is, investigating the events, developments and experiences of the past, both in Nigeria and Africa’s Economic Development. This method is handy because it will provide data for background information and contextualization. Data will be obtained from primary and secondary sources. From the primary sources, this research will use aggregate data, official documents, texts, journals, bulletins, magazines, and other periodicals. The internet and other broadcast media will also be utilized. From the secondary source, personal interviews will be conducted</p> <p>1.6 Literature Review</p> <p>This not the first time African leaders have come together to fashion out plans for the development of the continent and all this have been done under the auspices of various names and programmes which scholars like Eyinla 6 have opined that there is a need to avoid duplication, this was what saw the birth of NEPAD on the 23rd October 2001. In his view the harmonized versions of the likes of the Millennium African Plan and New African Initiatives (NAI) was what eventually brought about the NEPAD. Akinsanya 7 on his part had this to say “perhaps, it may not be out of place to remind ourselves that other development initiatives both at the national and continental level such as Nigeria’s vision 2010 and Africa’s Lagos Plan of Action (LPA) have existed as preludes to our current plan (NEPAD).”</p> <p>One of the distinguishing features of NEPAD however is the emphasis on African ownership, integrated development and partnership with developed countries in the South.  NEPAD is basically on African led strategy for sustainable development and poverty reduction in Africa.  It recognizes Africa’s responsibility to create conditions for development by ending conflict, improving economic and political governance and strengthening regional integration. Olaniyan 8</p> <p>Understandably, most institutions like the IMF, World Bank, European Union to mention a few have placed a lot of emphasis on good governance, financial discipline, respect for human rights and provision for conducive atmosphere for living and learning, NEPAD basically is also based on this line of reasoning.</p> <p>Olaniyan 9 as a matter of fact went further to opine that NEPAD is premised on the principles of good governance as a basic requirement for peace, security and sustainable political and socio economic development.  The underlying truth here is that there can never be any kind of meaningful development in the absence of peace or in the midst of anarchy and war.</p> <p>This situation is best understood in Eyinla 10 when he cited the Economist more than anything; African people need to regain their self confidence.  Only then can Africa engage as an equal with the rest of the world devising its own economic programmes and development policies.  Its people also need the confidence to trust each other.  Only then can they make deals to end wars and build political institutions that they actually believe in.</p> <p>One fundamental flaw in African development has been that of leadership.  This part of the NEPAD agenda believes that:</p> <p><em>The resources including capital, technology and human skills that are required to launch a global war on poverty and underdevelopment exist in abundance are within our grasp.  What is required to mobile these resources is and to use them properly is bold, and imaginative leadership.11 </em></p> <p>The cheering news or silver lining for African continent is the view of the European Union when the NAI/NEPAD was presented to her was that it was a welcomed and long overdue initiative based purely on the objective of democracy, transform good governance and human rights.</p> <p>Every cloud has a silver lining and therefore to the pessimistic of NEPAD it is another play in beggar/donor relations.  Eyinla aptly captured it thus when he asserted that it appears  NEPAD is attempting to make Africa’s begging bowl more attractive by adopting various fashionably and political correct spin to a fatigued donor community.12</p> <p>Although Africa leaders themselves seem to think otherwise because they believe that:<br/><em>In this regard, we are not asking for favors, but for fairness and justice, a better life for Africans and secure future for humanity.  This programme is premised on African ownership, African control of the projects and programmes, with African leaders accepting openly and unequivocally that they will play their part in ending poverty and bringing about sustainable development </em>(Africa Forum 2003).13</p> <p>The contribution of Olokun, an economist cannot be overlooked although the work focused in the quest of the Journey so far of the Organization of African Unity to African Union, his contribution through a material.”The role of Nigeria in the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) the material gives us an opportunity for this research because he carefully x-rayed some of the core aims and objectives of the NEPAD agenda thus;</p> <p>(1)Revisit AU/NEPAD perspective for effective knowledge.</p> <p>(2)Take another look at the status of the integration in Africa in terms of progress so far.</p> <p>(3)Present some key challenges faced and explore possible solutions.</p> <p>(4) Impact of relationship between the Europe and Africa Regional Organization on rural livelihood on the continent.</p> <p>(5) A call to Europe to write towards effective partnership with African especially its regional bodies.14</p> <p>Another review to be considered here is the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) in its two reports on assessing Regional Integration <em>in Africa</em> (ARIA 1&amp;2) issued in 2004 and 2006 15 respectively, provide a deep analysis as well as a detailed picture of what constitutes the current situation of regional integration in Africa.</p> <p>Kusa is a political scientist who, in her book “Nigeria and the Challenges of the Africa Peer Review Mechanism(APRM) 16also talks about the importance of (NEPAD) in the growing of the African Union(AU) and the mechanism for review which provide the means of monitoring progress toward good economic, cooperate and political government in Africa including challenges.</p>\n\nA HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF (NEPAD) THE NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT 2001-2010<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF (NEPAD) THE NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT 2001-2010", "id": 38}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background to the Study</p> <p>The History of the Local Government in Nigeria can be conveniently traced to the native administrative system introduced by the colonial government during the colonial era.</p> <p>After the amalgamation in 1914, Lugard proceeded to extend the system of indirect rule to southern Nigeria.</p> <p>In Western Nigeria, Lugard saw the Yoruba states headed by the Oba who traditionally owed some allegiance to the Alafin of Oyo as set-up similar to the Northern emirates under the Sultan of Sokoto. So, using the Obas as Emirs, he imposed his system of indirect rule in the west. But it did not prove successful as in the North. This most of the already independent Obas of Yoruba land were not prepared to countenance. The situation was even worsened when the British made Ibadan subordinate to Oyo. The study shall examine the pre-1991 Local Government system in Ibadan and the performance of Local Government in terms of development under both the Military and Civilian Administration.</p> <p>The focus shall be on Ibadan North East Local Government administration.</p> <p>In 1975, there was nothing like Ibadan North East Local Government, because it was not in existence during that period (1975) it was the local government that existed in Nigeria when Nigeria became a country.</p> <p>Oral tradition has it that when Nigeria became a country from 1861 to 1914, the Local Government in Ibadan Land was called Ibadan District Council (I.D.C).</p> <p>From 1914 to 1960 when Nigeria got independence Ibadan District Council was changed to Ibadan Native Authority. Then from 1960 to February 1976 when 19 states were created in Nigeria, it was called Ibadan City Council (I.C.C) and from February 1976 to 1991, Ibadan City Council was changed to Ibadan Municipal Government and from Tuesday August 27th1991, Ibadan Municipal Government was former had been recognized as a leading Yoruba state in the 1890s.</p> <p>Secondly, the British thought that the Yoruba Oba possessed autocratic powers as the Fulani Emir. But the Oba’s powers were limited for he could not act without the consent of his council of traditional title-holders. So, the British could not control his people by controlling him.</p> <p>Above all, the idea of taxation, without which Indirect Rule could not function, was strongly disliked and was only slowly and reluctantly accepted.</p> <p>Going down the memory lane, it was recorded that the native Authority system continued until 1976 reforms which attempted to find solution to the problems of Local Government in Nigeria split into 5 Local Government. Namely:</p> <p>Ibadan South East Local Government with its headquarters in Iwo Road</p> <p>Ibadan North Local Government with its headquarters at Bodija</p> <p>Ibadan North West Local Government with its headquarters at Onireke and finally, Ibadan South West Local Government with its headquarters at Oluyole Estate Ring Road, Ibadan.</p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that out of these above Local Governments, our concern here is Ibadan North East Local Government.</p> <p>Ibadan North East Local Government was created on 27thAugust 1991, by the administration of former Head of State General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida. It was carved out of the defunct Ibadan Municipal Government and derived its name from the metropolitan nature of the area. It covered then (12km radius with the Mapo as the centre).</p> <p>The local Government has its administrative headquarter located along the Iwo Road axis of Ibadan a major entry point through, Ife/Ibadan express way end of the Oyo State Capital.</p> <p>The inhabitants of the local Government are predominantly Yoruba, although it is highly heterogeneous, accommodating people from various other tribes who either engage in commercial activities or work in the public service,</p> <ul><li>Aims and Objective of the Study.</li> </ul> <p>Following are the objectives of the study</p> <ol><li>To examine the pre-1991 Local Government System in Ibadan: Ibadan District Council, Ibadan Native Authority, Ibadan City Council, Ibadan Municipal Government</li> <li>To provide General information of the Military Regime of Ibadan North East Local Government.</li> <li>To describe the Civilian Regime of Ibadan North East Local Government.</li> </ol> <ul><li>Scope And Limitation of the Study</li> </ul> <p>The study will cover the pre-1991 local government system in Ibadan: Ibadan District Council, Ibadan Native authority, Ibadan City council as well as Ibadan Municipal Government.</p> <p>On the course of writing this thesis there were many limitation factors that research was encountered. Apart from financial and time constraint of the researcher, several difficulties were encountered on the course of interviewing the interviewer off the study.</p> <p>There were several problems encountered during the process of data collection process. The researcher found it very difficult to collect adequate information or data about all the previous administrators of Ibadan North East Local Government apart from the incumbent chairman Hon. Gbenga Ayinde Adewusi. Some informant did not divulge all the needed materials or information’s about the subject matters because they counted such information sacred and confidential, making it difficult to get some certain facts.</p> <p>Furthermore, the archival materials concerning Ibadan North East Local Government were not available except ones on the Nigeria Local Government. Some of the materials were not completed owing to age and leading to constraining information gathering secondary information, gathering to be. This is because the closet library, the schools library did not have in stock adequate relevant materials. This has caused me to have to travel to Ibadan to make use of the main library of the University of Ibadan and that of Ibadan school of History.</p> <p>Despite the above mentioned difficulties with much efforts and determination, I was able to gather enough information to write this project.</p> <ul><li>Research Methodology</li> </ul> <p>A work of this magnitude required the use of historical methodology in data collection. And this was judiciously used to execute this research work. For most researchers was able to consult the University of Ibadan library for text books and literature such as journals, old newspapers in the University library to have a pre-requisite understanding of the history of the local government</p> <p>Consequently, in the course of writing this project, I embarked on the use oral sources and other published materials to explore my- research work which was one of the sources of getting historical fact of the people therefore, both primary and secondary sources were used in writing this project in the course of writing this project, I embarked on interviewing fourteen people.</p> <ul><li>Literature Review</li> </ul> <p>In writing this project, secondary materials have not been so adequate, particular those that directly deal with the topic understudy. This is not withstanding in the books and other materials I had gathered, I have found a whole lot of help in them. Importantly, the hand books on Ibadan North East Local Government Incorporating highlights on the indelible foot prints of Hon. Olugbenga Ayinde Adewusi is particularly written to include a lot of the administration of Hon. Gbenga Ayinde Adewusi popularly known or called ”Arole”. To a great extent, it provides a lot to this work, the background history of the Ibadan North East Local Government. Apart from that, the Local Government administration in Nigeria Incorporating contemporary issues in Governance and National Directory of Nigeria Local Government Councils edited by Tayo Orekoya and Tony Agbugba also contributed immensely to the opening aspect of this essay.</p> <p>The book which is reviewing the economic and political aspects of the Local Government right from the start of the colonial rule gives fact and figure of the relationship was like between the British and Africans in Nigeria in that period.</p> <p>Furthermore, other books contributed to work apart from the afore mentioned for example, a study of British Indirect rule in Oyo province 1894-1934 are book works on imperialism in Yoruba land  in colonial period.</p> <p>Apart from the materials mentioned above monumental impact. A compendium of Enduring Legacies of a Distinctive Democrat on Ibadan North East Local Government and Ibadan North East Local Government: “Heartily felicitate with Nigeria on the occasion of the celebration At 50 in regard of His Excellence Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan” are all books and thesis used in writing this work. All of them recorded past administrators and chairmen at a glance of Ibadan North East Local Government and the achievements of those past administrative chairmen including Hon. Olugbenga Ayinde Adewusi and how much these administrators have contributed positively to the standard of living of the Local Government.</p> <p>The book traces the Local Government Administration and also give us the relevant information of Ibadan North East Local Government. The book also gives us the detail that the present Local Government system in Nigeria is dated back to 1952 when the system was patterned along the British model which is based on the principle of indirect rule. It also recorded that the native authority system continued until 1976 reforms which attempted to find solution to the problems of local Government in Nigeria. In addition: the pamphlet and handbook compiled by information division Ibadan North East Local Government Agodi Ibadan titled The Ibadan North East Local Government also contributed a lot in writing this project. The book traces the origin of Ibadan North East Local Government and the past administrators and chairmen at glance both military and civilian regime. It also gives us the details about the British statistics of the five new Local Government created from the Ibadan Municipal Government. It also traces the Geography/Economy/the Education, Medical and Health matters of the Ibadan North East Local Government. It shows us the Wards Delineation and the Map of Ibadan North East local government.</p>\n\nIBADAN NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM 1991-2010<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IBADAN NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM 1991-2010", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Bronze casting is an aspect of visual arts which has played a significance role in Benin culture.

Essentially, this study will be based on the origin of bronze casting in Benin and its contribution to the economy. Benin, which was one of the most powerful Kingdom in West Africa before the coming of the European is gifted with rich cultural and traditional art works. It flourished as a city state from the 13th century until the British punitive expenditure of 1897 which saw the looting of Benin art works in it’s multitude to Europe and other parts of the world. Bronze casting in Benin staffed to take its full shape in 1280 A.D during the reign of Oba Oguola. Benin is said to have derived it’s arts of bronze casting from Ife in the 14th Century. This statement leads us to Igueghae story; as the bronze caster who went to learn this art of casting in Ife. However, the lost wax (cire perdue) method of bronze casting had been known earlier in Benin and the works from Benin were more stylized than that of Ife.</p> <p>Bronze was already a universal value and enjoyed great respectability among all groups, all people, in all cultures in Benin kingdom before bronze casting actually became one of the professionalized royal crafts in Benin Kingdom. Bronze was always a royal ornament for power, splendour, for adornment and was so valued that even the image of the Oba, both past and present could proudly be represented in it. In Benin nation, Bronze was generally regarded as precious and because it was precious, it was considered incorruptible. It could neither rust nor rot.</p> <p>In Benin-city, the bronze sculptors were mainly for the sovereign (the palace). The palace was the Chief patron of the group, reciprocally, the palace paid in kind to the group members that were involved in bronze casting and paid also for services including technical expertise. The craftsmen also received protection as a monopoly of the craft. The plague represented scenes from the life of the Benin Peasant, warriors, musicians and also important events that took place in the palace. In pre-colonial time, was implements, household utensils were made of brass. Those bronze casters just like other guild system in Benin had a specific area where they are settled and they had their own guild name in which they are known. They are organized on a family basis and a non-family member cannot be a member of the guild. This guild quarter of bronze casters is still in existence in Igun Street present day in Benin. It is referred to as the “Home of Bronze”.</p> <p>1.2    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study on “the contribution of Indigenous techno1og to Benin economy, a case study of Bronze Casting will focus on the Benin Bronze Casting. In other words, this study is an attempt to give a comprehensive understanding of the artistic excellence of the Benin bronze casting and its stylistic differences from other craft-tradition of Africa.</p> <p>The researcher’s purpose is to show ho much we really know about ancient Benin and thereby take stock of our present knowledge providing a firmer basis for future research on bronze casting to Nigeria and even the world culture development.</p> <p>Bearing in mind that the art of bronze casting was and is still a family affair, it is of advantage to study the traditional local technique and find the possible ways of improving this craft. It is through a research of this nature that this objective can be achieved.</p> <p>This project is also aimed at how the craft of bronze casting in the olden- days have been utilized on various aspect of craft production by the people of Benin and their own unique style and how bronze was used to document events in the preliterate Benin economy.</p> <p>1.3    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The scope of this study will cover the origin of Bronze casting in Benin, so also this study will be based on the influence of bronze casting on the society, the traditional arts and culture, the economy and its relation with other communities.</p> <p>This research work is divided into four chapters, the introductory part of the essay under which we have purpose, scope, and significance of the study, methodology, limitation and literature review. Also, we have in chapter two, the geographical and historical background of Benin. The third chapter explains the origin of bronze casting in Benin, the guild system and essentially the technique of bronze casting (how bronze is being cast). The fourth analyses the contribution of bronze casting on the society in the area of social, economic and political impact, while the last chapter is the conclusion and recommendation of the work.</p> <p>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work will create the opportunity of understanding the origin of bronze casting in Benin, how the bronze in Benin is being cast, how the different guilds in Benin were organized and essentially gives us insight as to how bronze casting has contributed to the economy of Benin and to the society at large both in the pre-historic times and in our contemporary time.</p> <p>1.5    METHODOLOGY AND PROBLEMS</p> <p>Different research methods will he adopted in collecting the data for the work, but a great deal of this work will rely on oral information which will be conducted in Igun Street (Benin City).</p> <p>Written sources were also consulted both the primary and secondary sources used included published books, published articles which are related to this topic or discussion.</p> <p>The library and archival also served as an effective indicator of other sources and that is complied with photographic analysis which made the work more relevant.</p> <p>The process of data collection began Edo State archival, where few related materials on the subject matter was found. This necessitated the researcher to go to other libraries for more materials. As a result of this, the researcher visited Edo State library for more materials.</p> <p>Also, Oral Interviews with prominent casters and the people of Edo</p> <p>State was conducted. They include Mr. Ehimona, Senior lecturer and deputy dean in the department of Fine Arts in the University of Benin. Mr. Sunday Ihama a bronze caster who had worked for over 10 years as a caster in Igun Street, Mr. Moses lgbmosun was also interviewed. All of these people supplied the researcher with facts and clues on the subject matter of this research work.</p> <p>The researcher equally explored the Edo State national museum for some data collection.</p> <p>1.6    LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>Many research works were consulted. This included articles, journals and magazines. For most among the works used for this dissertation was Aghama Omoruyi (1986) “Benin Series, a new dimension in Benin Studies” gave a brief history on Benin and their arts .and crafts. He emphasized the importance of Bronze casting in Benin, its origin and influences.</p> <p>Another important text is the work of John O. Igbinokpogie “The Benin Kingdom historical and environmental perspectives which he reveals the Benin people and their environment. Through this work, one is able to view the Benin people, their environment and culture.</p> <p>In his contribution, Philip Aigbana Igbafe “Benin under Administration”, he explained vividly the indigenous background of Benin, he also shed light on how the guild system is organized and the origin of Bronze casting in Benin. According to him, members of guild are divided into three age grade for effective administration.</p> <p>Also, R. E. Bradbury also (1973) “Benin Studies” deals extensively with the Benin Bronze casting, the Ikegbo and the Benin Cult of the hand, he wrote that the Benin plagues and other bronzes were intended to convey some information about specific events or particular persons. He also stated that bronzes contain much potentially valuable information about Benin Society, culture and history.</p> <p>According to Jacob Eghareveba (1968) in his book, “A. short history of Benin”. He helps to shed light on the foundation of Benin Empire, the reign of various kings in Benin. This helped in the historical background of Benin as a reference to this work.</p> <p>In his work, Prince Eva Basirai Eweka “The Benin Monarchy, Origin and Development”, he gave a vivid account on the Benin People and their culture. This helped to know the role of the Oba in the Benin Political system.</p> <p>Also Nkata and E. N. Arinze, (1989) “The lost treasures of Ancient Benin”. Also he gave an account on the punitive expenditure f 1897 which saw the looting of Benin Arts in its multitude to Europe and other parts of the world. This helped in the introductory part of this work.</p> <p>Aghama Omoruyi “Benin Anthropology” also gave a comprehensive analysis more on the historical background of Bronze casting. The book helped in understanding the origin of Bronze casting in Benin and how the guild system was organized.</p> <p>Furthermore, A.F.C Ryder (1969) “Benin and the Europeans” stated how the Portuguese traded with the Binis and imported Brass as an object of exchange, according to him, the increase use of Brass may have influenced the production of Bronze casting in Benin at a time when the mental would have become available in quantity sufficient to permit experimentation and continuous production.</p>\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNOLOGY TO BENIN ECONOMY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CONTRIBUTION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNOLOGY TO BENIN ECONOMY", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This project work was carried out to determine the role of management in motivating workers in banking sector, using first Bank Nig. Plc, Okpara Avenue, Enugu State as a case study. The purpose of this study is to find out how workers in the banking sector derive motivation, taking into consideration the impact of management influence and the effect of this on productivity. Also research questions and hypothesis were stated to be used in generalization towards the end of this with the appropriates tools. The research design used in this study is descriptive survey method, were simple random sampling was used to obtain information as to the population of the firm, getting a sample size of 44 persons. The data collection was based on primary data like questionnaire, personal interviews and data like bank‟s annual reports were also used. Statistical tools like chi-square, simple percentage were used to analyze the data.The research findings showed that worker‟s productivity does not necessarily depend on motivation since every employee have a target to meet and also has obligations to carryout. It was also established that motivation has relationship with personnel officers‟ productivity but the basic fact underlying the issue is that what appear to create motivation on one personnel in a particular bank might not act similarly in other bank, most especially in commercial banks. This can be deduced in the sense that motivation does not work in all situations as panaceas to increase productivity in all corporate organizations. Every indication shows that environment and fringe benefits play significant role in personnel manager‟s job satisfaction. Based on the findings above, the researcher made this recommendation on how motivation in the banking sector can be enhanced to have an impact in productivity. The management should be able to identify what can actually make the workers in their own banks have adequate motivation and whether such motivation packages are capable of boosting high productivity. Lastly, the management should also endeavor to include some packages like compensation that will ensure adequate job security and if possible work towards developing a policy for pensionable service.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0                            INTRODUCTION </p> <p>  One of the most significant developments in the field of the organization in recent times is the increasing importance given to human resources. More and more attention is being paid into motivational aspects of human personality, particularly the need of self-esteem group belonging and self actualization. This new awakening of humanism and humanization all over the world has infact enlarged the scope of applying principle of personnel management in organizations. The development of people, their competencies and the process developing the total organization are the main concerns of personnel managers.</p> <p>Extension of organizations in banking sectors face the major problems of professional incompetence and lack of motivation among their employees. Further more, many banking sectors in Nigeria do not have a well defined system of personnel management. Proper planning and management of workers within extensions of organization is essential to increase the capabilities, motivation and over all effectiveness of personnel. Keeping this in view, this research discusses the various dimensions of workers as applicable to extension organizations.</p> <p>One of the major role of a personnel manager is to recruit, select and place workers at their area of specialty; in other to boost these personnel functions and enable them work effectively, they must be adequately compensated. Comensation being a source of motivation increases the performance of personnel in workplace. Management must first consider what they can reasonably afford to pay their personnel workers and the ramification of their decision; will they affect workers‟ turnover and productivity. In addition, management play vital role in motivating workers and they solely believe that pay can influence their work ethic and behavior towards their job. Moreover, social, economic, legal and political factor also exert influence on the rate at which personnel managers operate.</p> <p>It is hereby articulated that the increase of management creating incentives as a source of motivation tends to boost and increase the rate of response of employees in an organization thereby increasing productivity.</p> <p>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </p> <p>The task facing management in various banking sector in recent times is that of determining what should constitute adequate motivation        for   the workers. To   achieve    these      objectives,the environment for the performance of the individuals working in group towards accomplishing common objective must be maintained.   Personnel managers as well as employees are the single most important source in any firm. They are the keys to higher productivity and efficiency. Most managers have discovered that productive work cannot be achieved through command, order or executive fiat. The primary aim of personnel managers is to recruit, select and place were they rightly suit, in order words, improved personnel managers productivity and efficiency depends on individuals motivation that gives them job satisfaction. The themes of motivation suggests that personnels who have a clear sense of their own contribution to their firm and who receive effective feedback from their manager are more likely to experience job satisfaction than those who do not. Achieving goals and being recognized for doing so is intrinsically motivational. The satisfaction a personnel derived from their work varies, some derive satisfaction from their environment, good salary they receive other benefits and oversees training courses made available to them by the management.</p> <p>Those in banking sector derive their own satisfaction from the nature of their job, car loan, rewards, interaction, training exercise and other benefits they receive from the organization. Motivation has a lot to do on workers emotion, when an individual is not motivated he cannot put in his best. Motivation they say activates human energy. It is a force which leads people to satisfy their important needs. All human behaviour is directed towards a goal. Individual values and goals differ from organizational goals and values. These values help personnel make judgment and decisions on matters affecting them. Personnel in organization have a number of responsibilities. They are responsible to the organization for doing what they are paid to do which is hiring new workers and administering basic resources like pay and benefits and also responsible for meeting their own needs and protecting their own values.</p> <p>According to Eli Ginzberg (1982) in his human Economy, workers want to earn enough from their work to meet the needs of their families and to enjoy a rising standard of living. Secondly, they want reasonable assurance that if their performance is satisfactory they can look forward to holding their jobs and to the special benefit which will accrue to them by virtue of their long term with the organizations. They want their job to provide the satisfaction that comes from the meaningful activities of the management. Finally, workers expect that those who supervise and direct them will not infringe on their rights as human beings and as citizens.</p> <p>Furthermore, Koontz et al (1982) define motivation in a general term applying to the entire class of desired needs, wishes and similar force. We can look at motivation as involving a chain reaction on wants or goals sought which gives rise to tension, then causing action towards achieving goals, and finally satisfying wants. We can easily note that many physiological needs are stimulated by environmental factor. The smell of food may make one hungry, a high thermometer reading may make us suddenly feeling hot or the sight of a cold drink may cause an overwhelming thirst, who for example, has not had certain physiological needs accentuated by an attractive</p> <p>advertisement.</p> <p>Udoh E.U. (1999) says that management has a major influence on our perception and needs. The promotion of a colleague may kindle one‟s desire for a higher position. A challenging problem may want our desire to accomplish something by solving it. Personnel manager like other categories of workers every where are basically the same. They want more money, training exercise, more motivation accordingly. Even in the banking sector, benefits that management can use in motivating personnel managers include, medical facilities, pension, gratuity plans, vacation leave with pay, and sick benefit with pay, housing subsidy, and transport allowance. If these are the needs and wants of personnel managers everywhere in the banking sector, what type of benefit do managers in the sector provide to satisfy the yearning of their manpower. From the situation of things in the country, we can see that these fringe benefits are being denied to personnel mangers in most banks in Nigeria. We don‟t need anyone to convince us that productivity of personnel managers in such banks is one of the lowest in the sector.</p> <p>However, the basic focus of this study centers on the role of management in motivating personnel managers in the banking sector. Also the study has to look into things that makes recruiting officers in the banking sector feel satisfied in their work as well as the things management in the banking sector have to do to make sure that their personnel derive satisfaction from their work to boost their productivity, using First Bank, Plc, Okpara Avenue, Enugu State as a case study.</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Motivation of personnel managers in every bank poses some serious problems to both management and employees themselves and the two have been on entangled midway but research and analysis of the motivation of personnel appears to emphasize the importance of making job challenging and meaningful.</p> <p>Employees attitude to work depends on the degree of motivation they derive from the job. Satisfaction an individual derives from job varies with age, sex, occupational level, social group and individual increase in productivity depends on workers input and workers cannot put in much when they are dissatisfied with their work.</p> <p>In other words, the efforts of managers in motivating personnel manager or human resource managers in most of the banking institutions does not seem to yield expected result, but managers in these banks often consider their immediate corporate financial position to the detriment of effective motivation of the personnel workers and the role played by personnels, forces managers always to take consolation on aggregate return rather than individual rate of returns thereby, getting the wrong evaluation and faulty picture of the impact of the role of personnel managers in motivation. This degree of laxity and limitation constitute the problem of this study which necessitates this research.</p> <p>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The objectives of this study are:</p> <ol><li>To determine how managers contributes to the motivation of personnel managers and their satisfaction in the banking sector.</li> </ol> <ol><li>To determine the effectiveness of personnel workers in the banking sector</li> <li>To look into some motivation mix, that is, the set of controllable variables that managers in the banks can use to influence their personnel workers and recommend appropriate motivation mix that will make the staff experience job satisfaction that will enhance performance and quality of service rendered to customers.</li> <li>To determine the effectiveness and impact of motivation on employee‟s productivity in the bank.</li> </ol> <p>1.4 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work will be relevant to the managers and</p> <p>personnel managers of First Bank Nig. Plc. It will also be beneficial to other public sector organization in Nigeria; it will also be of importance to the government, potential and future researchers on the issue of management‟s means to motivate personnel workers or related studies on motivation.</p> <p>This empirical study is also important to the researcher, since it is a partial requirement for the award of Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in industrial Relations and Personnel Management. It is hoped that the result of this study would be used by all corporate financial and recruiting organizations involved in banking and personnel services, by way of providing the necessary information and machinery that will be useful for appropriate decision making and recruitment process in the area of study. It would also guide management of related organizations on policy formulation and even on implementation processes.</p> <p>This study will also identify how the academic environment would stand to benefit in the direction of having a guide for research work, lectures, seminars and even class work for the study. The professionals would have enough ground for professional advice for client and other related publics. Government will use the result of their study as guiding information for policy formulation and other decisionmaking.</p> <p>Finally, the general public and even the personnel managers would benefit from this work by actually knowing what motivation as well as the impact on performance is all about.</p> <p>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </p> <ol><li>Are their any room for personnel management in your bank?</li> <li>Are workers in your bank motivated on their work?</li> <li>Does your bank management have concern on workers‟ job satisfaction?</li> </ol> <ol><li>What are the things management use to motivate personnel managers in your bank?</li> <li>Are there problems arising in your bank concerning workers‟ motivation?</li> <li>Did you think that motivation have an impact on worker‟s productivity in your bank?</li> </ol> <ol><li>Does the management respond to the workers problems positively?</li> </ol> <ol><li>In what ways do you think that motivation packages for workers in your bank could be improved?</li> </ol> <p>1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS </p> <p>The researcher formulated the following hypothesis based on the objectives and problem identified for the purpose of this research work, stating them in both Null and Alternate forms.</p> <ol><li>Ho: Motivation does not have significant impact on workers productivity                                           </li> </ol> <p>Hi: Motivation has significant impact on workers productivity</p> <ol><li>Ho: Employee productivity does not depend on motivation</li> </ol> <p>Hi: Employee productivity depends on motivation</p> <ol><li>Ho: The role of management in motivating worker in the banking sector is not significant.</li> </ol> <p>Hi: The role of management in motivating workers in the banking sector is significant.</p> <ol><li>Ho: Provision for advancement would not improve workers productivity</li> </ol> <p>Hi: Provision for advancement would improve workers productivity.</p> <ul><li>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>This research work focuses particularly on the role of management in motivating workers in the banking sector. For this reason therefore, the research has consulted with several views on the issues of motivation and workers to include text books on management, Human Resource Management; industrial relations, Newspaper, edits, journals banks etc. The work could be voluminous if all the arguments of different authors are presented, but they have been carefully selected so that only issues particularly concentrating on management‟s motivation of workers in banking sector are considered.</p> <ul><li>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>In the process of conducting this research work on the role of management in motivating workers in the Banking sector, a lot of factors militated against the study. First was the attitude of the respondents to the researcher, some of the respondents took the researcher to be an agent from external bodies and deliberately refused to answer the questions. This is mostly the case with the senior staff/managers.</p> <p>Closely associated with this problem is the fact that some of the respondents did not return the questionnaire to the researcher. This is a big limitation to this study since it further reduced the sample of workers in the company used for the study.</p> <p>Another problem that was encountered was due to shortage of time and financial constraints. The research was faced with financial problem due to transportation involved, printing questions, consulting newspapers etc. also the scarcity of current materials or books imposed serious limitations on the study.</p> <p>The effect of the national strike which also affected the banks was also a constraint. Finally, the problem of retrieving questionnaire from the</p> <p>respondents, some of whom did not care to complete the</p> <p>questionnaire and so it became necessary to retrieve and redistribute them.</p> <p>The research would have even cost more if it were to cover all banking sector in the country, thus, the research areas is limited to first Bank Nig.

It is the most widely mentioned theories of motivation and that best suit this research work. Maslow saw human needs from the lowest to the highest needs ie in hierarchy and he concluded that when one set of needs are satisfied, this kind of need ceases to be a motivator. Maslow said; “If we are interested in what actually motivates us and not what has or will, or might motivate us, then a satisfied need is not a motivator”. According to Maslow, these needs are classified into five and all of them go towards giving an individual (personnel manager) motivation and job satisfaction. These needs are:</p> <ol><li>Physiological need:</li> </ol> <p>Undoubtedly, these basic needs are the most proponents of all needs. What this means specifically is that, human beings who has not achieved anything in life in an extreme fashion, it is most likely that the major motivation would be the physiological needs rather than any other. A person who is lacking food, safety and esteem would probably hunger for food more strongly than anything else. At every stage in the organization, management is to recognize that every kobo means much to the employee. He would trade some comfort for money.</p> <ol><li>Safety need:</li> </ol> <p>Once the first need are largely satisfied, safety needs emerges. An individual becomes concerned with the need for safety and security, protection from physical harm, disaster, illness and security of income, life style and loss of employment. An employee likes to know that his employment is permanent. The loss of his job could induce him to seek ways of satisfying his physiological needs. In other to motivate such employee and encourage productivity, management would try as much as possible to provide security for workers.</p> <ol><li>Social need:</li> </ol> <p>The need is often referred to as acceptance need. The individual has satisfied his two basic needs and wants acceptance, to love and to be loved. The value of friendship, affection and the sense of belonging are much needed and are seldom satisfied by money. Management on their part could motivate personnel manager by paying them adequate salary and rewarding them for the services rendered.</p> <ol><li>Esteem needs:</li> </ol> <p>At this stage the individual has need for recognition, accomplishment, and achievement for the need for self respect. He loves to take responsibilities and prove himself. The esteem need is the ego need. A personnel manager would feel motivated when management gives room for his contribution to be recognized and appreciated. The feeling of independence, professionalism and confidence is highest at this stage. It is important for management to recognize.</p> <ol><li>Self Actualization:</li> </ol> <p>This need is often called fulfillment need. This is the need for an employee to reach his highest potential at work place in conquering his environment. A personnel manager is motivated by a desire to selfactualize, to achieve whatever he defines as his maximum potential, to do his work to the best of his ability. As he succinctly put it, “what a man can be, he must be”.</p> <p>Maslow believe that an average citizen satisfies perhaps 85% of his physiological needs 70% of his esteem needs and 10% of his self actualization needs. According to him, human motive at work are governed by these needs and their satisfaction will lead to motivation and high productivity. It must be recognized that there is a great deal of over lap in the concept of hierarchy of needs and a great deal of inter-dependence among the various levels there is no clear cut distinction between one level and the other, when all the individual needs tends to be partially satisfied, the safety need disappears as social needs and esteem needs emerged, they only become less active.</p> <p>Certainly, there is evidence that Maslow‟s theory is able to account for findings on occupational level and motivation. Those in lower level of occupation are likely to be motivated by lower order needs as pay and security. Where as those in high levels of occupation that have those basic needs fulfilled are more interested in fulfilling higher order needs. Again this depends in the time and circumstances since a person on esteem need can fall back to physiological needs during severe economic depression.</p> <p>Maslow did not infact intend that needs hierarchy should be directly applied to job satisfaction but despite this lack of interest on his part, a number of theorists like McGregor (1960) “The „X‟ and the „Y‟ Theory” has popularized Maslows theory in management literature. The needs Hierarchy has a tremendous impact on the modern management and job satisfaction studies by Beer (1960) and Clack (1960) seem to support Maslow theory.</p> <p>1.11 HISTORY OF THE AREA OF STUDY </p> <p>First Bank was founded precisely in March 31st 1894. at inception, the bank was incorporated as a limited liability company under the name Bank of British West Africa (BBWA), with the head office originally in Liverpool.</p> <p>First Bank of Nigeria Plc is the premier bank in West Africa and the leading financial service provider in Nigeria. The Bank has involved itself in national development especially its contribution to the economic growth and development of Nigeria over the last 116 years and has been driven by commitment to the provision of excellent banking services.</p> <p>In response to a rapidly changing economic and business environment, First Bank has at various times restructed her operations.

Lack of qualified and company-oriented individuals undermine employees participation in decision making. Availability of skilled individuals in organizational decision making promotes productivity.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Employee participation is creating an environment in which people have an impact on decision and actions that affect their jobs.</p> <p>Employee participation is not the goal nor is it a tool, as practiced in Nigerian Public sectors. Rather, employee participation is a management and leadership philosophy about how people are most enabled to contribute to continuous improvement and the on going success of the public sectors.</p> <p>Anyanwuocha (2003) explained that public sector are government or state owned business organizations, which are usually set up by act of legislation, with the main aim of maximizing public welfare.</p> <p>Moving decision making power downward in public sector is at the core of what employee participation is all about. Teams are a potentially powerful way to move power downward. The employee participation have also been implemented in the Nigerian public sectors in order to motivate the employees by involving them with the management for taking serious decisions about the public sector.  Research on employee participation begun to provide information on the number and types of programmes that exist, their structure and their effects on a variety of social-psychological, production and economic issues in the public sector.</p> <p>To date, little is known about the financial condition of the Nigerian public sectors with employee participation in decision making. Although the popular literature suggest that employee participation in decision making has been implemented in the Nigerian public sector in distress and has been effective in restoring financial health.</p> <p>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </p> <p>It should be recent that a decision is a choice whereby a person forms a conclusion about a situation. Gostell L. Wand Zalkind S.S. (1963) defined the term decision making as a choice process, choosing one from among several possibilities. This depicts a course of behaviour about what must be done or vice versa. Decision however translated into concrete action. Planning engenders decision guided by company policy and objectives, policies, procedures and programmes.</p> <p>The aim of decision making is to channel human behaviour towards a future goal. Decision-making is however one of the most important activities of management. It has been the pre-occupation of all management of multifarious organization to multi-national corporations.</p> <p>Managers often consider decision making to be the heart of their job in that they must always choose what is done, who will do it, when, where and most of the time how it will be done.</p> <p>Traditionally, managers influence the ordinary employers and specifically their immediate subordinate in the organization. This has resulted in managers‟ unnatural decision even in areas affecting their subordinates. In Germany around 1951 a law was enacted which provides for code termination and requires labour membership in the supervisory board and executive committee of certain large corporation enabling subordinates to participate in decision making process resulted to relatively and peaceful labour management relations.</p> <p>The basic concept involves any power-sharing arrangement in which workplace influence is shared among individuals who are otherwise hierarchical unequals. Such power-sharing arrangements may entail various employee involvement schemes resulting in codetermination of working conditions, problem solving and decision making.</p> <p>It is in this context the researcher wishes to assess the “impact of employee participation in decision making in Nigerian public sector” using Power Holdings Company of Nigeria (PHCN) Enugu as a case study.</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS   </p> <p>There has been a lot of controversy as to whether an employee should participate in management decision making or not. Some writers argued that employees should contribute in making decision more especially where it affects them or their jobs. It is expected that such participation will serve as training and testing ground for future members of upper management.</p> <p>In Nigeria, experts that refuted the above assertion see the arrangement as a symptom of mal-organization. They maintained that qualified, reasonable, honest and company oriented individuals are not available at these lower organizational levels. But the big question is, are skilled individuals really available? All these underlay the need for an investigative study.</p> <p>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The general purpose of this empirical study is to assess the employee‟s participation in managerial decision making in public sector organization in Nigeria with reference to Power Holding Company of Nigeria Enugu. The specific objectives are;</p> <ul><li>To asses the impact of employee participation in management decision making.</li> <li>To determine the impact of employee participation and nonparticipation in management decision on productivity of the Nigerian Public Sector.</li> <li>To make recommendations based on the research findings.</li> </ul> <ul><li>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>It is expected that the study will inform the management of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) Enugu that to increase productivity and to ensure harmony between management and the workers, there is need for employees participation in decision making in the organization as it is a good motivation factor. It will also help develop and maintain a quality work life, which will provide an opportunity for employees job satisfaction and selfactualization. It will also aid management of Power Holding Company of Nigeria to introduce modern schemes for good relationship with their workers, to enable them meet the challenges of change in the future.</p> <p>Finally, this work is also beneficial to the Nigerian Public Sector in general and also important to government, academic potential and future researchers on the issue of employees participation in decision making.</p> <ul><li>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>The study is limited as it looks at the impact of employees participation in decision making in Nigerian Public Sectors, A case study of Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) Enugu. Power Holding Company of Nigeria is typical of public sector, but it has the responsibility of providing the citizenry with power (electricity). And it holds a large population of employees.</p> <ul><li>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>In the process of carrying out this project work, the researcher was confronted with many challenges and limitations which are as follows:</p> <p>Time: There was time constraint for the research project and within the time specified, the normal lecturer were also in progress, therefore, the researcher was faced with a lot of stress to combine the research work with her personal affairs and running from one lecture to another. The effect of this work was that the period the researcher was supposed to spend on findings and data collection was limited and as a result more quality work was hindered.    Finance: The researcher was also faced with financial problems. Researcher work is very tedious because it requires running from one place to another in search of information, books, Journals, paper and reports must be consulted but are not always available within, there was the need to travel to gather some of the materials which involved money. Also the researcher printed questionnaires which was distributed to the staff of Power Holding Company of Nigeria (Enugu) which also involved money.</p> <p>Quality of Information: The analysis of the data in chapter four is based on the information provided by the staff of Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) Enugu. After administering</p> <p>questionnaires, it was expected that the information needed will be provided by both the senior and junior staff of the company. The junior staff were reluctant to provide some of the important information needed. This was on the ground that such information are very secret, and it is called industrial espionage. This challenge also affected the quality of information provided for the research findings.</p> <p>1.7 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>In a view accomplishing this research work effectively, the researcher poses the following:</p> <ul><li>Does management make decision without pre decision and consultation with employees?</li> <li>Does management change decision when rejected by employees?</li> <li>To what extent do employees participate in decision making?</li> <li>How often do employees meet to discuss with managers?</li> </ul> <p>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>The researcher formulates the following based on the</p> <p>objectives and problems of this research work.</p><p> Hi: Employees participation serves as a training and testing ground for future members of upper management. Ho: Employees participation does not serve as a training and testing ground for future members of upper management. Hi: Lack of qualified and company oriented individuals undermine employees participation in decision making at lower </p> <p>organizational levels.</p><p>  Ho: Lack of qualified and company oriented individuals does not undermine employees participation in decision making at lower organizational levels. Hi: Availability of skilled individuals in public sectors decision </p> <p>making promotes productivity.</p> <p>Ho: Availability of skilled individuals in public sectors decision making does not promote productivity.</p> <p>DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <ul><li>DECISION MAKING: The selection from among alternative a course of action.</li> </ul> <ul><li>MANAGEMENT: Management can be defined as an art of</li> </ul> <p>science of achieving the objective of a business in the most efficient way. It is made up of top and middle level management. Top management include: share holders, Board of Director, Managing Directors or the Chief Executive/General Manager above department level. middle level managers include: level of department manager, deputy and assistant managers.</p> <ul><li>PRODUCTIVITY: A measure of how well resources are brought together in organization and utilized for accomplishing a set of result.</li> </ul> <ul><li>PUBLIC SECTOR: This is an organization that is owned and managed by Government.</li> <li>EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATION: This is creating an environment in which people have an impact on decisions and actions that affect their jobs in the organization.</li> </ul> <p>1.10 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</p> <p> The Neoclassical theorists recognized the importance of individual or group behaviour and emphasized human relations. Based on the Hawthorne experiments, the neoclassical approach emphasized social or human relationships among the operations, researchers and supervisors (Roethlisberger and Dickson, 1943) it was argued that these considerations were more consequential in determining productivity than mere changes in working conditions. Productivity increase were achieved as a result of high morale, which was influenced by the amount of individual personal and intimate attention workers received through participation in managerial decision making.</p> <p>The classical approach stressed the formal organization. It was mechanic and ignored major aspects of human nature. In contrast, the neoclassical approach introduced an informal organizational structure and emphasized the following principles.</p> <ul><li>Individual: An individual is not a mechanical tool but a distinct social being with aspirations beyond mere fulfillment of a few economic and security works. Individuals differ from each other in pursuing these desires. Thus, an individual should be recognized as interacting with social and economic factors.</li> <li>The work Group: The neoclassical approach highlighted the social facets of work groups or informal organizations that operate within a formal organization. The concept of „group‟ and it‟s synergistic benefits were considered important.</li> <li>Participative Management: Participative management or decision making permits workers/employees to participate in decision making process. This was a new form of management to ensure increase in productivity.</li> </ul> <p>The system approach views organizations as a system composed or interconnected and thus mutually dependent – subsystem. These sub-system can be perceived as composed of some components, function and process Albrecht (1983). Thus, the organization consists of the following basic elements. Bakke, (1969).</p> <ol><li>i) Components: There are 5 basic interdependent parts of the organizing system namely:</li> </ol> <ol><li>Individual</li> <li>The formal and informal organization</li> <li>Patterns of behaviour emerging from role demands of the organizations.</li> </ol> <ol><li>Role comprehension of the individual</li> <li>The physical environment in which individuals work.</li> </ol> <ol><li>ii) Linking Processes: The different components of an organization are required to operate in an organized and correlated manner. The interaction between them is contingent upon the linking processes which consist of communication, balance and decision making.</li> <li>Communication: Is a means for eliciting action, enacting control and effecting coordination to link decision centre in the system in a composite form.</li> <li>Balance: Is the equilibrium between different parts of the system so that they keep a harmoniously structured</li> </ol> <p>relationship with one another.</p> <ol><li>Decision Analysis is also considered a linking process in the system approach. Decision may be to produce or participate in the system. Decision to produce depends upon the attitude of individuals and the demands of the organization.</li> </ol> <p>Decision to participate refers to the individuals decision to engross themselves in the organization process, that depends on what they get what they are expected to do in participative decision making.</p> <p>Conclusively, these theories are of the opinion that workers/ employees should be seen as human beings with social and economic needs and as such be allowed to participate in managerial decision making as it affects them.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATION IN DECISION MAKING IN NIGERIAN PUBLIC SECTORS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATION IN DECISION MAKING IN NIGERIAN PUBLIC SECTORS", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study is aimed at determining the impact of motivation on employee‟s job performance in an organization.

Their impact on the individual depends also on his perception of what he considers to be of value to him and invariably influences his action or non-action.</p> <p>Motivation can be described as a set of incentives monetary of otherwise, reward and punishment systems which determine or influence staff performance and altitude to work. It is a production of human resource management and its impact goes on a long way in determining the quality and quantity of production and the level of industrial and labour harmony or disharmony in the organization.</p> <p>Motivation can also be defined as the forces acting on or within a person that cause the arousal, direction, and persistence of goaldirected, voluntary effort.</p> <p>Work Motivation has been defined as “conditions which influences the arousal, direction, and maintenance of our behaviors‟ relevant in work setting”.  Gbadamosi and Adebakin (1997, PP33) other scholars have variously defined motivation as “the act of stimulating some or oneself to get a desired course of action, to push the right button, to get a desired reaction.</p> <p>Julius Michael (1975,pp 265). “motivation is the process of creating organizational conditions which will impel employees to strive to attain company goals-Hodgetts,Richard (1977, pp 385) motivation is the influence or drive that causes us to behave in a specific manner and has been described as consisting of energy, direction and sustainability.</p> <p>Motivation is a driving force by which human achieve their goals.</p> <p>Motivation is said to be intrinsic or extrinsic:</p> <p>Intrinsic motivation refers to motivations that is driven by an interest or enjoyment in that task itself, and exist within the individual rather than relying on any external pressure.</p> <p>Extrinsic motivation comes from outside of the individual, common extrinsic motivation are reward like money and grades coercion and threat of punishment, competing is in general extrinsic because it encourage the performer to win and beat others, not to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity.</p> <p>The main purpose of motivation is to attain organization goals according to Koontz et al (1983: 14) “management requires the creation and maintenance of environment in which individuals work together in group toward the accomplishment of the objective” management has been faced with broad predicament since poor approaches were employed toward the attachment of organizational objectives.</p> <p>These approaches are not without their strengths and weakness. In other worlds, firma are now faced with many complexes managerial predicament because of the phenomenon maintained above.</p> <p>Since the foremost aim of management of organization is the attainment of its objective.</p> <p>Little or no attention is paid to welfare of workers. As an outcome, the firm goals are defeated, since the workers are not motivated and cared for.</p> <p>The motivations range from inadequate to lack of motivation. Often management becomes dogmatic in their method of motivation as a result their expectation are defeated. It is pertinent for management to know what can motivate a single individual at a particular time and place would not motivate another person.</p> <p>The expectation to drive from anything one is doing is a motivation force that forces the individual to work. According to Ajuogu (1996, pp 47) “motivation is an internal psychological process”. It is the motive power that makes people behaves the way they do.</p> <p>1.2 BRIEF HISTORY OF ACCESS BANK</p> <p>Access Bank Plc is a remarkable story of the transformation of a small obscure Nigeria Bank into an African Financial institution of note; with emerging foot prints on the international banking landscape. Access Bank today is one of the top 10 largest banks in Nigeria in terms of asset base. A phenomenal accomplishment considering its antecedents.</p> <p>The Beginning (1988-2002)</p> <p>December 19, 1988: Access Bank Issued a banking license.</p> <p>February 8, 1989: Access Bank commenced operations at its</p> <p>Burma Road, Apapa Head Office.</p> <p>March 24, 1998: Access Bank became a public limited liability company.</p> <p>February 5, 2001: Access Bank obtained a universal Banking license from the central Bank of Nigeria.</p> <p>The Rebirth</p> <p>The board of director appointed Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede as MD/CEO and Herbert Wigwe as Deputy Managing Director. The mandate was clear: “Reposition the bank to one of Nigeria‟s leading financial institutions within a five year period (March 2002-March 2007) this task was perceived by many as audacious, given the realities of the Bank at the time. Also appointed to the Board was M. Gbenga Oyebode who brought commendable board experience gathered from some of Nigeria‟s leading companies, such as MTN Nigeria, Okomu oil Palm Plc. The new management then articulated a transformation Agenda for Access Bank Plc.</p> <p>This agenda represented a complete departure from all that characterized the bank in the past and became the road map for the transformation of the bank into a world class financial institution. The focus was to:</p> <ul><li>Assemble a credible and high caliber management team</li> <li>Introduce a culture of excellence founded on professionalism and integrity.</li> <li>Ensure human capital development</li> <li>Enlarge shareholder base</li> <li>Introduce strong procedures and processes to drive day-today activities of the bank</li> <li>Instill a passion for customers in all members of staff</li> <li>Establish a low cost liability generation strategy</li> <li>Expand branch network to cover all clearing zones within Nigeria</li> </ul> <ul><li>Create a world class Brand image.</li> </ul> <p>The impact of the transformation agenda was reflected in the first year. The bank grew its balance sheet by 100% and posted an impressive N1billion in profit before tax. The profit before tax figure was more than the cumulative profit made by the bank in the last 12years. This also marked the beginning of what would be a 6 years record triple digit growth trend. Similarly, earning per share had rebounded to 21kobo from a negative 2kobo position, leading to a declaration of a 5kobo dividend to shareholders for the first time in 3 years February 1, 2012 Access Bank acquired intercontinental bank as part of their expansion program is to increase their capital base, to increase their branches and to serve their customer better.</p> <p>1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</p> <p>So many problems have be found or discovered to be a hindrance to the entire business sectors. In the since that most enterprise has not achieved significant supply of corporative workforce and optimum productivity.</p> <p>It has been noted that employee‟s often complain about their wages and salary administration, poor working condition, welfare, effective supervision, provision of adequate machinery and materials at work place, provision of proper appliance and their maintenances etc. the above complaints are indications that things are not going smoothly with the employee‟s. on the other hand, management always ask why the employee‟s are not longer productive or low level of productivity in the organization.</p> <p>We pay them good salaries provide good working condition and environment and give excellent fringe benefits. The solution to the above management questions often point to the managers that employee‟s are either not properly motivated or not satisfied with their job. Except opportunities are provided at work place to satisfy the workers needs they will continue to have decreased production and performance will always remain law. It was such alarming question that led some human relation experts into finding out what gives on individual‟s job performance. These relationships between motivation and job performance have made many researchers work intensively on this area to find out dependable solutions to the problems.</p> <p>1.4 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The study will among other things try:</p> <ul><li>To find out what motivated employee mostly in an organization.</li> <li>To find out what constitutes motivations and job performance to employee</li> <li>To diagnose some of the incentive given by Access bank Plc which have strengthened the relationship between motivations on employee‟s job performance.</li> <li>To abstain what constitutes and efficient leadership style which will leads to increase in employee‟s job performance.</li> </ul> <p>To find out if employees are trained as at when due in other to increase their job performance etc.</p> <p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The study could be useful to Access Bank Plc, Enugu Metropolis, in improving their level of productivity and employee‟s performance in future.</p> <p>It will also aid management in making decision on how employees could be motivated, not only with money but other incentives.</p> <ul><li>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>The study will be carried out on Access Bank Plc, Enugu Metropolis, the data collected and other vital information are Limited to Access Bank Plc. This study strictly treats the impact of motivation on employee‟s job performance.</p> <p>Also the study does not show any concern or analyzing on any bank around it environment. The study should have covered all the banks in Enugu State but due to time and financial constraint, it was limited to Access Bank Plc, Enugu Metropolis.</p> <ul><li>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>This research work is specifically on the impact of motivation on employee job performance in Access Bank Plc.</p> <p>In the limitation on research work of this magnitude or nature can be carried out without limitation.

A strike usually takes place in respond to employee grievances. Strike became important during the Industrial Revolution, when mass labour became important in factories and mines. In most countries, they were quietly made illegal, as factory owners had far more political power than workers. Most western countries partially legalize striking in the late 19th or early 20th centuries.</p> <p>Strikes are sometimes used to put pressure on government to change polices. Occasionally, strike destabilizes the rule of a particular political party or ruler. In such cases, strikes are often part of a broader social movement taking the form of a campaign of civil resistance. A notable example is the stoppage of work by the indigenous railways workers in (1932) led by Pa Michael Imodu during the colonial era and the first general strike of (1945) in Nigeria.</p> <p>Since 1970 to present time, workers demand for improved condition of work and wages have increased the number of strike actions as management most times would not accurately satisfy the needs and requests of employees even in the face of economic recession.</p> <p>In this study, however, we are going to examine the causes of strike, i.e. consequences and impact in the achievement of trade union objectives.</p> <p>Strikes are the most significant aspect of industrial conflict. Strike is defined as the temporary stoppage of work in the pursuance of grievance or demand. In practice however, it has been difficult to separate strike from other forms of expression of industrial dispute as employer lock out workers and workers themselves embark on strike action.</p> <p>It is more useful to view both phenomena as part and parcel of the conflict situation, not as opposite. Rarely does a strike occur over a single issue for an obvious cause may be linked with several other issues that not immediately apparent to the observation that have caused dissatisfaction because solutions to them have been long in coming. The actual occurrence of strike depends on several factors including prevailing circumstances. This also goes to show that few strikes occur spontaneously especially as there is no way of guaranteeing that strike actions instead of the other forms of industrial action would be decided upon by workers involved.</p> <p>Each time strike occurs substantial man-hour is lost, a good example  is the first general strike of (1945), the (1993)   ASU strike where universities in the country was closed for couple of months  thereby causing set back in the tertiary institution.    The Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, and Trade Union Congress, TUC, the two major umbrella bodies of workers union in Nigeria mobilized workers for an indefinite  strike action which commenced on Monday, 9th January, 2012 to drive home the protest against the fuel subsidy removal of January 1st 2012. The government of Nigeria removed fuel subsidy by increasing the price of petrol per litre from N65 to N141 on January 1st 2012.</p> <p>This nationwide strike affected the country‟s economy negatively where the volume of trading on the floor of the Nigeria Stock Exchange,( NSE) fell by 82 percent, local flights were grounded, and lifting of crude oil was hampered. The strike had a lot of effect on the major sector of the economy as activities of the (NSE) that are trading slumped by 80%, while banks complied with the strike order and closed shop, the NSE opened for business as usual. But at close of trading, only 46.06 million shares were traded in 20 deals.</p> <p>This is a significant reduction when compared with an average 262 million shares worth about N1.05 billion traded in 2,509 deals the previous week. The Nigeria Labour</p> <p>Congress,(NLC) has led a number of  general strikes in the past to mention a few. In 2004, the Nigeria Labour Congress gave the Federal government an ultimatum to reverse the decision to introduce the controversial fuel tax or force a nation wide protest strike. The strike threat was made despite the fact that the Federal High Court judgment in an earlier dispute had declared the organization lacking legal power to call a general strike over government policies.</p> <p>It is in this context that the research wishes to access the impact of strike action on the achievement of trade union objectives in both private and public sectors in Nigeria and how management policies/decisions are influenced by workers through the representatives (trade union) to the effect of harmonizing management polices with trade union objectives enhancing efficiency as well as maintain good industrial relation peace and harmony in the work place using…</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The unstable industrial relation climate in Nigeria just within the decades has resulted in all time record of lost working hours, unprecedented work stoppage as a result of strike action.</p> <p>By October 1981,both federal and state government were broke, by December, seven out of the nineteen state governments  could hardly pay the salaries of their employees; by June 1982,Bendel,Rivers,Cross Rivers, Benue and Imo States were owing teachers two to four months arrears. It was only when junior workers threatened strike action in Cross River State and teachers actually abandoned classes in Bendel State after not receiving January salaries as at April 1982 that both government cleared part of the outstanding amount .</p> <p>In the first six months of the year 1982, Nigeria lost a total of 4,598 man- hours because of strike action by workers. The recent strike action embarked by Nigeria Labour Congress in January, 2012 has cost the country millions of naira as all the sectors of the economy which engage in productivity activities in order to boost the gross domestic product of the economy were closed down for couples of days.</p> <p>1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to probe into the effectiveness of strike action as a means of achieving union objectives from the management. This study is based on a case study of EMENITE LIMITED ENUGU</p> <p>Precisely, the study is focused on following issues, tools for achieving union demands from management using strike as the major tools in achieving union objectives.</p> <p>The recommendation which will be based mainly on the findings of the research will be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of strike action as means of achieving union objectives. If on the other hand, the study suggest a better way of achieving union aims than strike, then of course the mentored will be recommended.</p> <p>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The research work focuses particularly on the impact of strike on the achievement of trade union in an organization. The research is conducted to cover and improve the management of organization focusing on the company EMINITE LIMITED, ENUGU. For this reason therefore, the researcher has consulted several reviews, on issues of strike and trade union to include text books industrial relation, management, social sciences, dissertations from academicians on related issues, Newspaper edits journal etc. the work would be very large if all the argument of the different authors are presented, but they have been carefully selected so that only issues particularly concentrating on the impact of strikes on the achievement of trade objectives are considered.</p> <p>1.5 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>A work of this nature is not easy to accomplish for its wide scope and for the expense it would involve such as financial problems, time constraint, material cost, apathy on the part of respondent and bureaucratic procedure involved in releasing data in the organization of my case study. The research would have been more expensive and capital intensive if it were to cover all the public sectors corporation in the country, thus the research area is limited to……</p> <p>1.6 RESEACH QUESTIONS</p> <ol><li>Does the existence of trade union lead to increase strike action?</li> <li>Does collective bargaining lead to human resource practices which help in the achievement of union objective?</li> <li>Do trade unions influence the making and implementation of management polices?</li> <li>Has the trade union activities affected the organization objective negatively?</li> <li>Is the union management effective?</li> <li>Does union undertake peaceful dialogue as a means of setting trade dispute between management and the employee?</li> <li>How good is the union management relation of the organization?</li> <li>Does the management respond to the union positively?</li> </ol> <p>1.7 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>The researcher formulates the following hypothesis based on the objectives and problems identified for the purpose of this research work, stating them in both Null and alternate forms.</p> <ol><li>Ho: Organizational objectives are low where there is a strong and viable trade union.</li> </ol> <p>H1: Organizational objectives are high where there is a strong and viable trade union.</p> <ol><li>Ho: Trade union and management do not co-operate to raise organizational objectives</li> </ol> <p>H1: Trade union and management co-operate to raise organizational objectives</p> <ol><li>Ho: There is no significant relationship between the activities of trade union and organizational objectives.</li> </ol> <p>H1:  There is a significant relationship between the activities of trade union and organizational objectives.</p> <ol><li>Ho: Unstable union- management relationship has no significant effect on the organizational objective</li> </ol> <p>H1: Unstable union- management relationship has significant effect on the organizational objective</p> <ol><li>Ho: Trade union activities do not influence the making and implementation of management policies in the organization.</li> <li>H1: Trade union activities influence the making and implementation of management policies in the organization. <ul><li>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul></li> </ol> <p>This research work will be relevant to management and employee</p> <p>It will be beneficial to other public sectors in Nigeria; it will also be of importance to government, academicians, potential and future researchers on the issue of the impact of strike action on the achievement of trade union objectives in an organization. This empirical study is also important for the reward of Bachelor of Science (B.SC) in industrial relation and personnel management.</p> <p>The study will also identify how management and union can co-operate to enhance the achievement of trade union objectives in an organization. It will provide a basis for trade union re-orientation objectives are achieved for better and harmonious industrial relationship. It will also provide a frame work for management and union to relate for increase productivity and good condition of service.</p> <ul><li>DEFINITION OF TERMS</li> </ul> <p>STRIKE: Strike is defined as a temporary stoppage of work in the pursuance of a grievance or demand.</p> <p>TRADE UNION: Is a combination of workers who are wages or salary earners form for the purpose of regulating work terms and condition for maintenance and improving the employment condition of their members.</p> <p>WORKING CONDITION: A comfortable environment (condition of floor and workroom, dressing rooms and cafeteria, temperature and humidity, cleanliness, comfort and safety (of floors, tools and so fort) and efficiency (steady product flow, adequate wage and salary, performance approval, incentive, motivation and welfare services.</p> <p>GRIEVANCE: situation of dissatisfaction on the part of the worker of the organization.</p> <p>EMPLOYEE: Refers to worker(s), person(s) responsible for carrying out day to day activities of the organization toward achieving the target goals.</p> <p>EMPLOYER: Refers to the management board, one who engages human and material resources for the production of goods and services.</p> <p>MANAGEMENT: Refers in this study to be the body employer and its representatives, foremen and supervisors inclusive.</p> <p>DISPUTE: Is any argument or disagreement between employer and workers, or between workers and workers which is concerned with the employment and non employment conditions of work of any person.</p> <p>WORK: This implies any kind of purposive action i.e. whether paid or unpaid, full time or part time, formal or informal with reference to an organization; it used to imply the operation involved in a particular job or work.</p> <p>ORGANIZATION: A group of people brought together for the purpose of achieving certain objectives, while these members may change the role of organization which is its basic unit is maintained.</p> <p>LABOUR RELATION/INDUSTRIAL RELATION</p> <p>It refers to the totality of interaction between an organization‟s management and the organized labour/trade union. Its purpose is to serve the interest of both the state and the working classes. It is often called collective bargaining.

The importance of it can not be over emphasized. According to Obassi (1999:9), it is a device or scheme for adopting or applying the assumption, a theoretical framework is a way of describing, analyzing, interpreting and predicting phenomenon, it has the potentiality to provide the significance rational of a study. Therefore, it provides the theoretical framework of this study is based on interactionistic perspective organization. A more recent view of conflict is a positive force and necessary for effective performance. This approach encourages a minimum level of conflict within the group in order to encourage self criticism, change and innovation and to help prevent apathy or to quest a tolerance for harmony and the status quo.  the overall background of the research.</p> <p>Conflict perse is not necessarily good or bad but an inevitable feature of organizational life and should be judged in terms of its effect on performance. Even if organization has taken great care to try and avoid conflict, it will still occur. Conflict must continue to emerge despite attempts to suppress it.</p> <p>For long, the strike as been recognized as a legitimate weapon of workmen for ventilating their grievance or seeking enforcement of right. But it is not a fundamental right because otherwise, it could not have been controlled by statutes like the Industrial dispute Act. The Indian constitution does not consider the right to strike as a fundamental right.</p> <p>The general right to resort to strike has been recognized by defining the circumstances under which a strike is to be regarded as illegal. The right to strike, however, is not unjustified; it is a relative right which can be exercised with due regard to the right workers. A strike therefore, should be used as a weapon only as the last resort when all avenues have proved futile and so long as it is used in a restrained peaceful manner for good and justifiable reasons.</p> <p>Mahatma Gandhi recognized the workers right to strike but he warned that such a strike should be conducted when all other methods have failed. The national commission on labour is of the opinion that “The right to strike and the right to lockout with reasonable restraint have been recognized in all democratic societies, though the degree of freedom grated for the exercise has varied in different countries. According to the social, economic and political system prevailing there”     BACKGROUND/ HISTORY OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Emenite Ltd is an abestor roofing ceiling sheet producing company incorporated in (1961) with registration number Rc 2712.

Strike generally could be defined as the refusal to work by employees of an establishment to protest from certain inadequacies in their conditions of service. Strike is a work stoppage caused by mass refusal of employee to work. To solve this research problem, the workers should be given their pride of place and be put in the “hall of fames” because the workers are the light house of the world who should be given their salaries promptly, given them incentives, make sure they are satisfied job-wise so as to be more dedicated thereby producing good giants who will uplift the tone of the  nation within and outside the nation. The society itself could solve this contemporary problem of strikes, the financial gain is not coming in thousand; frustration is being meted to the workers from  the citizenry. The design of the study used for this study was survey design. The population  put together is 12,000 and the sample size is 746.</p> <p>The instrument used for data collection is the questionnaire  and interview. The  instrument for data analysis is Chi-square method of testing of hypothesis and simple percentages of analyzing the tables.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>  INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 INTRODUCTION </p> <p>Strike generally could be defined as the refusal to work by employees of an establishment to protest for certain inadequacies in their conditions of service.</p> <p>Strike is a work stoppage caused by the mass refusal of employees to work.

Most Western countries partially legalized striking in the 19th or ea 20th centuries.</p> <p>Strikes are sometimes used to put pressure on government to change policies. It will also be noted that strike is not peculiar to universities alone but to other organizations or pressure groups such as:</p> <ol><li>Nigeria labour Congress (NLC)</li> <li>Nigeria Bar Association (NBA)</li> <li>Nigeria Union of Journalist (NUJ)</li> <li>Nigeria Medical Association (NMA)</li> </ol> <p>Higher Institutions that are liable to embank on strike actions include:-</p> <ol><li>The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUNU)</li> <li>The National Association of Nigeria Students (NANS)</li> <li>The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP)</li> <li>The Academic Staff Union of College of Education etc</li> </ol> <p>When strike occurs in an organization, workers suffer most and in this way, the Nigeria working system has been thoroughly destroyed.</p> <p>There is no way to remedy this situation apart from the individual employees concerned to stand up and demand for their right.</p> <p>Although, strike may create temporary difficulties for workers in the sense that it will stop their work and without their work, they won`t earn a living. this situation of our country Nigeria will not be fully developed because they will be back of or less production because of the strike action management has not put its priorities right. it is in protest of these misplaced priorities and inadequacies that these management and Nigeria union of worker. ie the Nigeria labour congress (NLC).</p> <p>In most cases, the employers and the employees would have explored all avenues for dialogue and strike becomes the last option for the settlement of disputes.</p> <p>Before the introduction of strike among Nigeria worker in the years 1963 by PA Imodu, the authorities have always worked in peace and harmony with their privilege to work as an employee in any organization because they always had great expectations both the senior and the junior staff worked happily together as members of the same community and guided by a sense of mission to promote and preserve their working performance.</p> <p>Today, the issue of strike in our country has been so rampant that the government will have to do something urgently so as not to Jeopardize the interest of the employees on how to improve their performance and productivity in their place of work. But before the emergence of union, there had been spontaneous strike and protests against poor conditions of work in several African countries.</p> <p>In the strike that took place in sierra-leane in 1874. In Senegal, rail road workers had frequently engaged in sporadic strikes against the dehumanizing conditions of work.</p> <p>In practice, however, it has been difficult to separate strike from other forms of expression of industrial dispute as employers lock out workers and workers them-selves embank on strike action. it is or useful to view both phenomena as part and parcel of the conflict situation, not as opposite. rarely does a strike occur over a single issue for an obvious cause may be linked with several others issues that are not immediately apparent to the observation that have caused dis-satisfaction because solutions to them have been long in coming. The actual occurrence of a strike depends on several factors including prevailing circumstance. This also goes to show that few strikes occur spontaneously especially as there is no way of guaranteeing that a strike action instead of other forms of strike action would be decided upon by worker involved.</p> <p>1.2 BRIFY HISTORY OF CASE STUDY </p> <p>The University of Nigeria, commonly referred to UNN, is a Federal University located in Nuskka, Enugu State, Nigeria. Founded in 1955 and formally opened on 7th October 1960, the University of Nigeria has four campuses-Nuskka, Enugu and Ituku-OzallaLocated in Enugu State and one in Aba, Abia State Nigeria.</p> <p>The University of Nigeria was the first full fledges indigenous and first autonomous educational system. it is the first land-grant university in African and one of the five elite universities in the country. The university has 15 faculties and 102 academic departments. The university offers 211 undergraduate programmers and 82 postgraduate programmers.</p> <p>The University celebrated its 50th anniversary in October 2010.</p> <p>A law to establish a university in the Eastern Region of Nigeria was passed on may 18, 1955 while that date marks the formal beginning of the history of the university of Nigeria, the enactment of this legislation by several Nigeria leaders, and inspired particularly by then premier of the Eastern Region, Dr. Nnamdi</p> <p>Azikwe. One of the first steps taken by Eastern Nigeria Government towards the implementation of its commitment was an invitation to both the United States of American and the United Kingdom to send advisers to help in the planning of physical structures and educational aspects of the proposed university.</p> <p>Under the joint auspices of the inter overseas and the international Education Administration (now the United States</p> <p>Agency for international the Development). J.W. Cook, Vice Chancellor of the University of Exacter, Dr. John A Hannah,</p> <p>President of Michigan state university and Dr. Glen L. Taggart, Dean of International programmers at the same university came to Nigeria in 1958. The team surveyed the site at Nsukka, and extensively investigated a great variety of factors pertinent to the establishment of a new university.</p> <p>The result of their efforts were contained in a while paper issued by the Eastern Nigeria Government on 30 November 1958.</p> <p>They had recommended “that the development of the University of</p> <p>Nigeria based upon the concept of service to problems and needs of Nigeria is a desirable project and one that should receive support from any source which could help to make it a sound Endeavour”.</p> <p>They further recommended that a provisional council be</p> <p>established to “draw upon the technical and consultative</p> <p>Resource available throughout the world to help in planning the institution” the provisional council authorized by the Eastern Nigeria legislature, was appointed by the Governor in council in April 1959, and given necessary financial and administrative powers to build a sound university. it reflected the spirit of international co-operation which has given birth to the institution. it consisted of Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe. Dr. T. Olawale Elias and Dr. Okechukw Ikejiani from the federation of Nigeria, J.S. Fulton from the United Kingdom, Dr. Marguertu Cartwright and Dr. Eldon Lee Jonson from the United State of American.</p> <p>The university was formally opened on 7th October 1960, as the Celebrations in the Eastern Region. her Royal Highness</p> <p>Princess Alexandra of Kent, represent HER Majesty Queen Elizabeth 11 at the Nigeria independence celebrations performed the opening ceremonies and laid the foundation stone of one of the university`s early buildings.</p> <p>Classes began on 17 October 1960 with an enrollment off 220 students and 13 members of the academic staff other opening convocation addresses were delivered by the chairman of the provisional council, Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe, the first president of the federation of Nigeria and by Dr. John A. Hannah, president of Michigan State University, U.S.A.</p> <p>The university was fully autonomous, with the power to grant its own degree technology speaking, therefore, it become the first fully-fledge university in Nigeria since Ibadan was still at that time a university. It also became the first university established by a Nigeria Regional Government.</p> <p>1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The Influence of strike action on employee`s performance and productivity poses serious problems both on management and lecturer and those problems sought to be solved by the end of this research study and they include, the causes of strike action, how workers performance and productivity could be increased, ways in which strike actions could be eradicated and dose strike action demoralize workers or motivate them.</p> <p>1.4 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY.  </p> <p>The issue of strike by organization has been so rampant that the government will have to do something urgently about this situation, so as not Jeopardize the existence of the organization.</p> <p>Therefore, the objective of this study includes:-</p> <ol><li>To find out whether strike influence the employee performance in an organization.</li> <li>To find out whether delay in payment employees salaries is the major cause of strike in an organization.</li> <li>To find out how government reach towards the cause of strike in an organization.</li> <li>To find out how the organization, employers and employees respond either positively or negatively to strikes.</li> <li>To prefer practical solution to the problems.</li> </ol> <p>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>This empirical study will be important to be researcher since it is a partial requirement for the award of Bachelor of Science in Industrial Relations and personnel Management. Also this research work will be the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. it will also be beneficial to other universities within Nigeria and potential and future researchers on the issue of strike action in employee`s productivity and performance.</p> <p>The study will identify how to make management have a re-think or reconsider their plea. How strike action is carried out so as to increase the welfare or pay of workers and how employed embark on strike so as to gain grounds in the organization.</p> <p>1.6.

Strike usually takes place in response to employee‟s grievance. We have different theories in strike and they are unitary perspectives, classical perspective, integrationist perspective and pluralistic perspective all those are involutes in the strike theories but the pluralistic perspective it say “if one however accepts the views of social writer and the idea of a pluralistic approach to work organization, then conflict among competing subgroups will be seen as an inherent feature of structure of the organization. The pluralistic manager is more likely to accept that conflict in organization requires careful handling and attempts to reconcile rival interest</p> <p>1.10 DEFINITION OF TERMS </p> <p>STRIKE: An organized refusal to work by employees of a company.</p> <p>INFLUENCE: The power to produce effects, especially Indirectly or through an intermediary, the condition of being affected power to change a person`s way of life.</p> <p>JOB SATISFACTION: Remuneration is a reward. It is better payment and fringe benefits. The chief characteristics of workers were that economic self interest. Michael white (1980) discovered that remuneration (money) is a good and an incentive. Remuneration is a source of satisfaction, is a standard companion. so remuneration is a source of material goods stimulus to greater production.</p>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF STRIKE ACTION ON EMPLOYEES PERFORMANCE AND PRODUCTIVITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF STRIKE ACTION ON EMPLOYEES PERFORMANCE AND PRODUCTIVITY", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PREFACE</strong></p> <p>This work is an attempt to trace the History of Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra state.

The doctrine of separation of power and check and balances, as propounded by Montesquieu, cardinal principle of democracy, which ensures the distinctiveness and independence of the three arms of government at various levels. The issues of the violation of human rights has assumed center stage of the various regional grouping and have vigorously been mandated by international agreements and treaties, to always obey the fundamental principles of human rights. It’s equally good to state that the fundamental principle of human rights and its violation are majorly characterized during the military era and dictatorship regimes, because the military regime is an aberration and not a form of governments, the military then protect the unconstitutional and inhuman acts, and in the bid to do this, the fundamental human rights of the citizens are trampled upon. Over the years various measures have been adopted by international institutions and organizations to reduce the trends of the violation on the fundamental human rights at various countries, most cases sanctions have been imposed which on its own, is another way of violating the rights of ordinary man. even though we say that the violation of the human rights is an attributes to military regime, it is equally important to note that democracy till date are found to be violating human rights especially during the democratic dispensation of 1999 to present.</p>\n\nHISTORY OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN NIGERIA, 1970-1999<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HISTORY OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN NIGERIA, 1970-1999", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Nigeria external relations with the outside world started a long time before she gained her autonomy as an independent State.

The country, in the past decades has been ‘decorated’ with top ten position among the league of corrupt nations by Transparency International and other international watchdog organizations. With anti-graft in his campaign manifesto, it was an ‘easy’ task for Muhammadu Buhari to succeed the government of Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan which was famous for corruption ‘manifestations’ and impunity in the 2015 presidential elections .This work appraises Nigeria’s strategy in the fight against corruption under President Muhammadu Buhari’s first eight months in office. The work argues that Buhari’s anti-graft strategy in its first eight months is misguided and misconceived. A theoretical framework is adopted for clear focus and distinction between the blurred edges of corruption and its manifestation.

The people are of Benue-Congo speaking group found around the defunct Lafia Native Authority in the present day Nasarawa State with their settlements at Keana, Doma, Obi, Assakio and Agwatashi among others. The population of the people according to the National Population Census of 2006 estimated figure was that the Alago population is above seven hundred thousand (700,000) people.</p> <p>            Today, Alago people are found predominantly in the following Local Government Areas of what is now Nasarawa State Doma, Keana, Obi, Lafia-East, Azara, Giza and Nasarawa. They can be found in the settlement areas of Doma, Keana, Obi, Ribi (Ibi), Agaza, Alagye, Aloshi (Ole’shi), Agwatashi (Olosoho), Assakio (Owusakyo), Kadaerkop, Owena, ankani, Ajkpanaja, Okpata, Ediya among other small settlements including Amaku (Olonya) in Nasarawa Local Government Area.</p> <p>            By all standards the Alago group is one of the largest if not the leading group of the whole of present day Nasarawa State with their population of about 712712. This is the status the people enjoyed even before the split of the former Plateau State which gave birth to the new Nasarawa State on the 1st October, 1996. Indeed, there can be no denying the fact that the choice of this subject for study for both remotely and directly an attempt to satisfy an interest that is not only personal but also collective and ethnic in nature.  </p> <p>            From another perspective Benedelto Crole opined that all history is contemporary since no matter how remote in time the events being reconstructed appear to be the history in reality refers to present needs and situations where those events vibrate. Certainly 3, these needs are represented by the desire to have a more beneficial exposition of the past of the people whose generations after generations have continually been bombarded with conflicting records and reports on the actions of their progenitor. This is because Alago people in the post colonial period (1960-2001), keep migrating from one place to another in search of socio-economic opportunities and facilities rather than religious reasons.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>In spite of the increasing wide range of knowledge, works and attentions by scholars on the Alago, their traditions still remain speculative, uncoordinated as well as superficial in nature. However, the objectives of this research work becomes imperative and it includes among other things:</p> <p>To understand the nature, origin and character of the movement and settlement patterns of the Alago people of Nasarawa State, and examine the causes of their migration to their present settlement.</p> <p>To examine the socio-political and economic contribution of the ethnic group to the making of Nasarawa State.</p> <p>To put in proper perspective the exact position and place the various Alago people (settlements) in history, within Nasarawa society, as well as to understand the socio-economic relations of the people with their neigbours as a roadmap for national development.</p> <p>Moreover, the work is aimed at providing reference material in the history of the people, giving the discordant nature of their growth and development. This is so because the present generation of Alago scholars as well as elites need an up-to-date and a thorough (comprehensive) analysis of the history of their past.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.3    Statement of the Problem/Justification of the Study</strong></p> <p>History is repleted with movement of people and this movement can either be individually or in mass. Migration being part of human behaviour (Alago inclusive) often occasion by some natural or manmade forces. The need to move from one location to the other became imperative because of craving need to interest, search for food (farmland and trading) and a conducive environment in which to live.</p> <p>The post colonial migration among the Alago people from 1960 has impringed or contributed to the development of the people under study. Few earlier settlements were forced to move or relocate to new settlements of  the same Alago people in Nasarawa State and these resulted to the development and or development of the people but in this case, development is mush counted, hence educational, social, economic and political developments were achieved among the Alago people in Nasarawa State from 1960-2001. </p> <p><strong>1.4      Scope and Limitation     </strong></p> <p>This study however is confined to an examination of the Alago post colonial migration and settlements from when the colonialists terminate their rule in Nigeria by 1960. This is to say that the study is only on Alago people and as well as some of their settlements in Nasarawa State.</p> <p>The limitation was however faced with some circumstances beyond the ability of the researcher. Thus, the scope in area of settlements could not be adequately satisfied. Hence the researcher decided to limit his search due to lack of relevant data to some selected Alago settlemts such as Ibi, Alagye, Keana, Doma, Obi, Assakio and Agwatashi since they all have identical traditions, customs and reasons for the post colonial migration.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, one among the limitations was the issue of terrain of the settlements that were to be visited. The roads were bad and were not motorable and this brought delayance for the researcher to carry out his research work at the appropriate period of. There was also non-availability of many written sources on Alago ethnic group as a result of making the reference materials very little. Non-access to archival materials was also experienced by the researcher during the course of study of the people under consideration.</p> <p><strong>1.5       Research Methodology  </strong></p> <p>In search for knowledge of the past, the historian relies on various sources. Historians, most especially those of the advanced societies used written documents such as records of government activities that were left behind by actual participants or observers of early events. These were tenable only in areas where the art of writing and documentation were available and in use. However, for most of African societies, the search for knowledge of the past was based mainly on oral accounts referred to as oral traditions.</p> <p>For the purpose of this research, giving that oral tradition arising from preserved memories has remained one of the major sources in African historiography. One is often irked by the seeming continuous disappearance of past records of most societies. It is on this note that a Ugandan professor of history, Kiwanuka has often been quoted as saying:</p> <p><em>                            ……. The minds of our fore-fathers are libraries</em></p> <p><em>                            Waiting to be tapped and the death of an old man</em></p> <p><em>                            In Africa is the death of a whole library…</em></p> <p>Certainly, there can be nothing more correct in the relevance on, and significance of oral tradition as a historical source in African historiography. Hence the memories of our fore-fathers over time shall be relied upon mostly. However, in historical documentation, irrespective of the form and nature of these sources as may be available to the historian, they in themselves do not constitute history. Hence the historian has to engaged in a careful selection process to bring out the historical facts from the lost of materials available to him. (E.H. Carr).</p> <p>For the purpose of this work therefore, a number of these sources have particularly been used for the attainment of the desired goal. Earlier works by scholars in the form of project or thesis have been consulted and made use of. Indeed, I embarked on the collection and harnessing of source materials through personal interviews, readings and comparative analysis of the available materials.</p> <p>It must however be stressed that in the course of doing this, the paucity of in-depth and reconcilable materials on the issue under consideration without doubt posed serious problems. This is why more often than not, most African method of reconstructing the past through the use of oral traditions formed the dominant and central source which that was depended heavily for this study. Here too, the problem of distortions has created drawbacks in the attempt to achieve a near perfect reconstruction of the past of the Alago people in Nasarawa State.</p> <p>In handling these problems therefore, a careful, comparative analysis was carried out on the scores of materials available and selection was based on a more concrete evidence of the past of the people as contained in their traditions. Nevertheless, for the source, materials upon materials were gathered, collated and served or analyzed in line with the thinking of H.P.L Fisher who said:</p> <p><em>To write or even to read it is to be</em></p> <p><em>Endlessly engaged in a process of selection.</em></p> <p><em>Many facts are called but few are chosen, on</em></p> <p><em>Implicit and rational criteria of factual significance6.</em></p> <p>           The study dependent on two broad source types: primary and secondary sources. For primary sources, oral accounts of eye-witnesses and participants as passed from generations to generations have been collected and collated to provide significant base. This was done through personal interviews and direct visits. In the case of the secondary source, the numerous works of earlier researchers and historians were also consulted to provide some historical insight into the past of the people in question. By and large, the writings of scholars have served as reference points and guides on the general approach to the study, in essence, maximum use of available materials has been applied to supplement and also complement the primary sources.</p> <p>           It must be asserted that, in carrying out a research work of this nature, a broad methodological approach must be used. By so doing oral interview and personal visits or contacts were carried out. These were resulted to the problems of Bias narration or hidden of information by the local people, problem of language interpretation either by the interpreters or the researcher himself. </p> <p><strong>1.6       Theoretical/Conceptual Framework</strong></p> <p>Migration is a change of residence from one particular place to another whether on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. Migration is an intrinsic aspect of human behavoiur. Throughout human evolution, the urge to move has been part of the characteristics of man’s existence. The need to move from one location to the other became imperative because of craving need to interact, search for food and a conducive environment in which to live. Migration simply put is the act of moving from one locality region and or country to another.7</p> <p>Richard Schafer sees migration as a relatively permanent movement of people with the purpose of changing their place of residence. He described movement over a sizable distance, rather than from one side of a city to another. 8</p> <p>           Migration has been an age old human phenomenon. Right from the ancient world. History is replete with movement of people either individually or mass often occasioned by some natural or man-made forces. As a complex social phenomenon, migration has assumed several dimensions. The factors which tends to ginger human population movement varies, while some were motivated by the prevailing economic opportunities of the time, others were gingered by some other factors like religious bigotry, war, political dominance and some other social forces, thus causing a forceful human migration from one area to the other.</p> <p>           Migration generally speaking, means the movement of people, more specifically, it means movement of people or a population across a specific boundary for the purpose of residing. The United Nations multi-lingual demographic dictionary defines migration as “a form of spatial mobility between one geographic unit and another involving a permanent change of residence.” 14 This definition excludes wandering of nomads, seasonal migration and the movement of persons with more than one residence. In other words, the movement of nomads is not migration; movement of persons with more than one residence is also no migration. </p> <p>           There are two types of migrations, internal migration and external migration, internal migration is defined as the movement of persons within the political boundaries of the nation being considered as a country. Any movement between different towns or cities within Nigeria is internal migration. Therefore, movements between Doma and Obi, Keana and Agwatashi, Assakio and Obi as well as Lafia are all internal migrations. External migration (though not part of the study) is the movement of persons across ethnic, national and state boundaries of one country to another. Every migration process involves two places, that is the origin and the place of destination. There are four varieties of internal migration (i) Rural-rural (ii) Urban-Rural (iii) Urban and (iv) Rural-Urban migration. Urban-rural is movement from urban to rural areas. Urban-urban involves movement from one urban area to another while rural-urban migration is movement from rural to urban area 9. </p> <p>           Sociological approach to the study of human migrations sees the term migration as a concept embedded in the plurality of people such that the action of one group determines the action of the other. Marx Weber drew a criterion specifying that there should be at least a minimum of mutual orientation of the action of each to that of the other. He viewed conflict, hostility, sexual attraction, friendship, loyalty or economic opportunities, which propelled a free escape factor principle of human migration.</p> <p>           The promotion of schools in the rural areas have also stimulated migration of rural youths who have received primary/secondary education. Some migrate to improve their skills while others become dissatisfied with the prospect of like particularly in terms of social amenities in the rural areas. They now move to acquire higher education and to also avoid themselves of the facilities in their new area of destinations.</p> <p>           Though, scholars have attempted to propound theories that explain migration which according to them account for migration, particularly internal migration. Notable among scholars are: Ravenstein (Law of migration), Lee (theory of migration), Sjaastad (Human investment Theory), and Todaro (Model of Rural-Urban migration). According to Ravenstein, (1880s), migration move from areas of low opportunity to areas of high opportunity. The choice of destination is regulated by distance with migrants from the rural areas often moving towards nearly town before moving towards larger cities 11. Lee identified the forces that influence a potential migrant to either migrate or not. He divides these forces into pluses and minuses. The positive or plus forces pull individual towards them, and the negative or minus forces tend to drive individual away 12.  </p> <p>Apart from the plus and minus forces, there are also zero forces to which the individual is indifferent. In other words, the zero forces neither pull the migrant nor drive him away13. These forces are associated with the area of origin and the area of destination. They are governed by personal factors which may either facilitate or retard migration.</p> <p>           Tadaro’s Model of Rural-urban migration suggests that the potential migrant’s decision to migrate involves a perception of the expected stream of income that will accrue to him/her. This expected stream of income is a function of both the prevailing wage structure in the urban area and a subjective probability of obtaining employment in the urban area. This according to Todaro four main features was postulated:</p> <p>          i.            Migration is stimulated primarily by rational economic considerations of relative costs and benefits which are mostly financial but are also psychological.</p> <p>        ii.            The decision to migrate depends on the expected differentials between urban and rural areas and not the actual differentials. The decision to migrate also depends on the probability of successfully obtaining employment in the urban areas.</p> <p>      iii.            The probability of obtaining an urban job is inversely related to the urban unemployment rate. This is to say the higher the chances obtaining an urban job, the lower the urban unemployment rate.</p> <p>      iv.            Migration rates in excess of urban job opportunities growth rates are not only possible but also rational and probable in the face of continued positive urban-rural expected income differentials. High rate of urban unemployment are therefore inevitable outcomes of the serious imbalances of economic opportunities between urban and rural areas 14. This means that the rate of migration usually exceeds the rate at which urban job opportunities grow, this is because of the expected differences in wages between urban and rural areas, and the expected difference is usually in favour of the urban areas.</p> <p>These are some of the theories that explain migration particularly rural-urban migration. </p> <p>These are theories upon which researchers have based their explanations of migration. They also laid the foundation for migration studies. For the purpose of this study therefore, there is the need to identify and defined some key concepts and words in the work for example:</p> <p>1.      Alago: An ethnic nationality (group) which has settled for centuries around what used to be Lafia Native Authority, Nasarawa State, Nigeria.</p> <p>2.      Origin: Starting point of a place or movement at which something begins to exist and or the country, race, or social situation that someone comes from.</p> <p>3.      Migration: The act of moving from one locality, region and or country to another. Or a relatively permanent movement of people either individually or massively with the purpose of changing their place of residence.</p> <p>4.      Settlement: A place where people have come to make their homes or a place where people have come to live permanently.</p> <p>5.      Native Authority (N.A): A particular area or a country with the power to make decisions and make people do something or obey laws, or an organization or institution that control a public service 15.</p> <p><strong>1.7       Literature Review</strong></p> <p>    Generally, since Nigeria became an object of interest to the Western world, a wide range of scholarly works have been done on some aspects of the economic, social and political history of the people. As attention became more and more focused on the history of different parts of Nigeria, a mixture of literary works have been rolled out by different scholars both from within and outside the shores of the land. However, the case of the Alago people cannot be said to have enjoyed the same interest and attention of scholars. While quite a few studies have been done, the treatment of the entire Alago is still very peripheral and superficial. Most of the early works on Nigerian history, concentrated mainly on the large kingdoms and empires that existed prominently before the advent of colonialism. Consequently, Alago were treated as mere appendices of these kingdoms. This explains their limited scope of coverage in virtually all existing literature.</p> <p>The available published and unpublished works by Alago student and other scholars display a considerable degree of ignorance on the exact origin, migration routes and settlements patterns of the people. This is so because the expository attempts by early anthropologists of colonial extraction and local writers all appear replete with common errors. This is evidently manifest in their frequent treatment of the Alago as an adjunctment of the Jukun Empire.</p> <p>It is interesting that almost all of the published literature on the Alago people uncritically accept the account of colonial investigation attributing their ancestry from the east. For instance, writing on political and administrative system in Plateau State, Sen. Luka Gwom alludes to the tradition that Alago people legendarily migrated from the east together with the Jukun, the Igala, the Goemai and others to form the famous Kwararafa empire. 16   where precisely is meant by “cast” is not clear. This is very evident in his work, Plateau State political and Administrative Systems: A Historical Analysis, in which he maintained that, “The disintegration of the Kwararafa Empire saw the movement of the Alago people to Wukari and thereafter to Idah through Ogoja. Relying largely on early colonial sources, Gwom agrees that it is from Idah that Alago people formed a recognizable part of the Igala kingdom until their migration northwards in search of new settlements17.</p> <p>Ade Adefuye writing on “The Alago kingdoms: a Political History”, states that Alago traditions point to somewhere in the east as their ancestral home, which they were said to have been compelled to leave following their insistence on keeping to their traditional religious practices as against the new religion then, Islam. 18 Certainly, oral accounts of the people also subscribe to this historical view on the origin of the people in focus. There is however very thin or no evidence at all to support such a spurious claim.</p> <p>C.K. Meek and Charles Temple are among some of the foreign writers who also traced the origin of Alago to the Jukun Empire north of the Middle Benue plain. While in his, A Sudanese Kingdom, meek sees the Alago as sharing the same culture and tradition with the Jukun, Temple in his Notes on Tribes, Provinces, Emirates and State of Northern Nigeria,   believes that though the Alago origin in uncertain, the cultural similarity of the Alago and Jukun arose only as a result of inter marriages between the two groups. To him, the Alago are probably more of Igala breed that left Atagara near Idah in the first half of the 13th century (1232AD).19  </p> <p>Ade Obayemi is averse to the argument that the Alago migrated from Idah as a result of Chieftaincy disagreements. In his work, “States and people of the Niger-Benue confluence” in the Groundwork of Nigeria History, Obayemi dismissed any trace of imagined relation between the Alago and Igala (Idah) royal class or any evidence of a new language learnt there from. Rather, as an archeologist using linguistic and other cultural studies, Obayemi stressed that the Idoma, Yoruba, Igala, Tiv, Nupe and Jukun as well as Goemai all fall under the Kwa language family who moved into the Niger-Benue confluence to do constant warfares. 21 As an archeologist, Obayemi could be excused for erroneously making reference to Keana as large Kingdom (but not the older kingdom of Doma) as being more directly related to the Jukun. </p> <p>Another scholar, T.N. Tamuno writing on, “people of the Niger-Benue confluence,” specifically discussed the Jukun, Tiv, Idoma, Igala and Nupes as the people that clustered along the Niger and benue rivers. Here as in many other works, the Alago groups are conspicuously missing. In the work published in A thousand years of west African history, edited by Ade Ajayi and Espie Ian, Tamuno, however, concedes to earlier submission to the Jukun, whose traditions of origin suggest that they migrated to their present habitats from the ‘East’-probably Yemen, East of Mecca, interestingly, however, after linking the Idoma strongly with the Jukun tradition, Tamuno placed Doma and Keana (both Alago kingdoms) as two of the three most important clans of the Idoma. To him, the Idoma speaking peoples originally occupied an area extended from Idah in the South-west to Wukari in the east: but who have been forced to shrink to a smaller area owing to pressure from several neighbours. He tries to locate the missing link in this historical relationship to the fact as he puts it, that though the Idoma were united linguistically, they were not united into a single political state. 24 This argument sound only plausible to the extent that the Idomas and Alagos are to a large extent, linguistically closely related. The seeming contradiction here therefore is, if the Alago were not part of the original clusters like he suggested, then the ethnic affinity and strong cultural link between the Alago and the Idoma on one hand, and between the Jukun and the two on the other still requires further study or investigation.</p> <p>Is should be noted that contemporary migration and settlements of Alago people  in Nasarawa State since 1960, according to the people oral tradition suggest that it was based purely on socio-economic factors which forced the people to migrate even up  to the time of our discourse. Farming being the major activities of people makes them to move in search of fertile land to farm, as well, people engaged in trading and also in search of knowledge and other social amenities like schools, hospitals, etc.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.8       Conclusion</strong></p> <p>This chapter attempts to define the term migration which is a permanent movement of persons either in mass or on individual basis. Though, there is no acceptable definition of migration but scholars have tried to define migration as a relatively permanent movement of people with the purpose changing their place of residence. Many reasons were stated which always compelled man to migrate; for instance, people are motivated by the prevailing economic opportunities of the time as well as religious bigotry and social and political dominance. But for the case of Alago, their tendency to migrate during the period under the study can be understood within the context of conflict, hostility, friendship, loyalty and economic opportunities. There are two types of migrations and four process involved in migration respectively that is internal and international migration as well as Rural-rural, urban-rural, urban and rural-urban migration.</p> <p>The study is however confined to an examination and analysis of the significance of migration and settlement of Alago people Nasarawa State, with emphasis on Doma, Keana, Obi, Agwatashi, Assakio, Lafia and other smaller settlements of Odobu, Aloshi, Ibi, Agaza, Alagye and many others.</p> <p>The work has been divided into five chapters. The work starts from chapter one with a consideration of the general introduction. It follows with the aims and objectives of the study, the scope and limitation of the study is also examined and an attempt at the definition of concept and methodology was also made. To note also is the review of related literature. The second chapter will give attention to the environment of Nasarawa, major ethnic groups, socio-political organizations and the economic activities of the people of Nasarawa State. this is closely followed by a chronological study of the origin of migrations and settlement of Alago people in Nasarawa State, with emphasis on Doma, Keana, Obi and other places. The fourth chapter titled “Focuses on the social relations that exist between Alago and their immediate neighbours in Nasarawa State:, such as Jukun, Idoma, Tiv, Agatu, Kanuri, Eggon and others. The work is concluded by a summary and contribution to knowledge for the benefit of history and succeeding generations of Alago people and other Nigerians generally.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>ENDNOTES:</strong></p> <p>         1.

Leading that effort within the United Nations system is the World Health Organisation (WHO); an international agency concerned with world wide health and welfare. It is one of the agencies of the United Nations whose purpose is to aid in the attainment of the highest possible level of health by all people. Programs include; education for current health issues, proper food supply and nutrition, safe water and sanitation, maternal and child health immunization against major infectious diseases and prevention and control of disease. WHO is coordinating global strategies to control and prevent Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. Its function include furnishing technical assistance, stimulating and advancing epidemiologic investigation of diseases, recommending health regulation promoting cooperation among scientific and professional health groups and providing information and counsel to health matters. Its headquarters is in Geneva, Switzerland. 2<br/><br/>At the outset, it was decided that WHO’s top priorities would be malaria, women’s and children’s health, tuberculosis, venereal disease, nutrition and environmental sanitation. Many of those remain on WHO’s agenda today, in addition to such relatively new disease as HIV/AIDS. 3<br/><br/>In 1948, WHO took over the responsibility for the international classification of disease, which has become the international standard for clinical and epidemiological purposes. Between 1952 and 1964, WHO’s efforts had reduced the global prevalent of Yaws – a crippling and disfiguring disease that afflicted some 50 million people in 1950 – by more than 95 percent. Between 1967 and 1979, WHO’s effort led to the eradication of small pox the only time a major infections disease has been completely eradicated. Since its global polio eradication initiative was launched in 1988, through 2008, the number of cases was reduced by more than 99 percent – from 350,000 per year to less than 2,000. 4<br/><br/>WHO staff are at work on the ground in 147 countries worldwide. They advise ministries of health on technical issues and provide assistance on prevention, treatment and care services throughout the health sector. Six regional office coordinate and support these efforts, while giving special attention to adapting global HIV/AIDS policies to fit the specific needs of their region – for example in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic is largely spread by heterosexual sex, as compare with eastern Europe, where injecting drug use is the primary mode of transmission. 5 <br/><br/>In short WHO intervention cover all areas of the global health – care spectrum, including crisis interventional and the response to humanitarian emergencies; establishing international health regulations, which countries must follow to identify diseases outbreaks and stop them from spreading; preventing chronic disease and working to achieve the health – related millennium development goals (MDGs). In the lead up to the millennium development goals summit, the secretary – General launched a global effort convening 40 keys leaders to define a collective strategy of accelerating progress on women’s and children’s health. <br/><br/>But it would be misleading to suggest that the entire work of the UN system in support of global health rests with the WHO. On the contrary, many members of the UN family are engaged in the critical task. Many health related matters addressed directly by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social council, as well as through the efforts of the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS); the work of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in support of reproductive, adolescent and material health, and the health related activities of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).<br/><br/>In addition such members of the UN, system as the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nation (FAO), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations Environment Programmes (UNEP), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the World Bank, among others, all play a key role in promoting global health. <br/><br/>Health – related decades now being observed internationally, as declared by the General assembly include the decade to roll back Malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa (2001 – 2010) and the international Decade for action, “water for life” (from 22 march, 2005).<br/><br/>Annual International observance relating to health, as proclaimed by the General Assembly, include World Water Day (22 March), World Autism awareness Day (2 April), World Health Day (7 April), World No-Tobacco Day (31 May), the international Day against Drug Abuse and illicit Trafficking (26 June), World Mental Day (10 October), World diabetes day (14 November) and World Aids Day (1 December).6 <br/><br/>The World Health Organisation (WHO) is a special agency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international public health. 7 It was launched to systematically improve health condition throughout the world. Some of the activities of WHO have been dramatic and have relieved well – deserved acclaim. For example, the prompt action in dealing with the cholera epidemic in Egypt and the typhus outbreak in Afghanistan in 1949; others have been less spectacular though equally important. 8<br/><br/>As a specialized agency of the United Nations, WHO is the central directing and coordination authority in international health work. It also provides advisory and pubic health services to member countries (124 countries were members in 1963), and central technical services. It has given major assistance to many countries in the fight against malaria, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, venereal disease, influenza, small pox, leprosy, trachoma (an eye disease), filariasis (a disease caused by parasitic worms), bilharziasis (a disease communicated to man by water snails), and other communicable disease. In some cases, the results of the joint efforts have been most impressive. Malaria has been virtually wiped out in Europe and North America, and in many countries where it was once a prime killer, it has been reduced spectacularly. WHO in cooperation with UNICEF, has launched a long term program aimed at its total eradication. 9 <br/><br/>WHO has also given assistance to many countries in Public health administration, maternal and child health, nursing, social and occupational health, public health education and training, mental health, nutrition, sanitation, dental health, the development of community water supplies, the rehabilitation of physically handicapped children and Adults and medical research. It administers health and sanitary regulations, maintains a medical library and an international center for the compilation and analysis of medical and health statistics from all countries, established international standards of purity in medicines in current use, and issues a number of publications. 10 <br/><br/>In its charter, the UN is charged with promoting “solution of international economic, social, health and related problems”. Thus, the UN is vitally concerned with furtherance of human welfare social justice, and the aspirations of men for a better lot in life. The world Health Organisation (WHO) has given enormous sums to develop health services in various countries and to fight disease. By 1966, WHO had helped over twelve hundred projects in 152 different countries. 11 <br/><br/>In order of the United Nations to achieve its objective of world peace and security, it has to attend to situations that could trigger crisis. In fighting of the maintenance of peace, the UN’s job is to create the conditions of social stability and human satisfaction essential to a lasting peace. According to the United Nations Educational, scientific and cultural organisation (UNESCO), “since wars begin in the mind of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed”. <br/><br/>Health is a state of complete physical and social well being, and not merely the absence of diseases or infirmity. The enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of health is one of the fundamental right of every human being without destruction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition. The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependence upon the fullest cooperation of individuals and states. The achievement of any state in the promotion and protection of health is of value of all. 12 <br/><br/>WHO is an entity under the authority of the UN with a mission to promote the best possible health care for all the world’s citizens. 13 In the 21st century, health is a shared responsibility, involving equitable access to essential care and collective defense against transnational threats. The organisation develops and promotes the use of evidence- based tools norms and standards to support member states to inform health policy options. It oversees the implementation of the international Health Regulations, and publishes a series of medical classification, of these, there are over reaching “reference classification” the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Health Intervention (ICHI), other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the international code of marketing of Breast milk substitute (adopted in 1981), framework convention on Tobacco control (adopted in 2003) and the Global code of practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (adopted in 2010). The WHO regularly publishes a World Health Report, its leading publication including an expert assessment of a specific global health topic. Other publications of WHO include the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, the Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (overseen by EMRO), the Human Resources for health and the Pan American journal of Public Health (Overseen by PAHO – Pan American Health Organisation/ AMPO).<br/><br/>WHO runs the alliance for health policy and systems research, targeted at improving health policy and systems. WHO aims to improve access to health research and literature in developing countries such as through the HINARI network. The organisation has published tools for monitoring the capacity of national health system and health work forces. <br/><br/>The organisation relies on the expertise and experience of many world renowned scientist and professionals to inform its work, such as the WHO study group on inter professional education and collaborative practice. <br/><br/>The WHO also promotes the development of capacities in member states to use and produce research that addresses national needs, by bolstering national health research system and promoting knowledge translation platforms such as the evidence informed policy Network (EVIPNET), WHO and its regional offices are working to develop regional polices on research for health – the first on being the Pan American Health Organisation/ Regional Office for the Americas (PAHO/AMRO) that had its policy on Research for Health approved in September 2009 by its 49th directing council document. <br/><br/>In addition, the WHO has also promoted road safety. Each year, the organisation marks World Health Day focusing on a specific Health promotion topic. <br/><br/>The WHO’s suite of health studies is working to provide the needed health and well being evidence through a variety of data collection platforms, including the World Health Survey Covering almost 400,000 respondents from 70 countries, and the study on global ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) covering over 50, 000 person over 50 years old in 23 countries. <br/><br/>WHO has also worked on global initiatives in surgery, including emergency and essential surgical care trauma care and safe surgery. The WHO surgical safety checklist is in current use worldwide in the effort to improve safety in surgical patients. Also, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies have entered into “official relations” with WHO. 14<br/><br/>The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the legislative and supreme body of WHO. Based in Geneva, it typically meets yearly in May. It appoints their Director General every five years, and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. It also reviews reports of the executive board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination. <br/><br/>The regional division of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on Article 44 of WHO’s constitution, which allowed World Health Assembly (WHA) to “establish a single regional organisation to meet the special needs of each defined area”. Each region has a regional committee, which generally meet once a year, normally in the autumn. Each regional office is headed by a regional director, who is elected by the Regional committee. Since 1999, Regional Directors serve for a once renewable five year term. <br/><br/>Each regional committee of the WHO consists of all the Health department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the region. Aside from electing the Regional Director, the regional committee is also in charge of setting the guideline for the implementation, within the region of the health and other policies adopted by the World Health assembly. The regional committee also serves as a progressive review board for the actions of WHO within the region.<br/><br/>The Regional office of WHO in Africa has its headquarters in Brazzaville, republic of Congo which includes most of Africa with the exception of Egypt, Sudan, South Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, Somalia and Morocco which fall under East Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO). <br/><br/>The WHO operates 148 country and liaison offices in all its regions. The presence of a country office is generally motivated by a need, stated by the member state. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital occasionally accompanied by satellite offices in the provinces or sub regions of the country in question. <br/><br/>The country office is headed by a WHO representative (WR), who is an internationally experienced physical or other health professional, not a national of that country who holds diplomatic rank and is due privileges and immunities similar to those of an ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary. In most countries, the WR (like representative of other UN agencies) is de facto/ or de jure treated like an Ambassador. The distinction have being that instead of being an ambassador or one sovereign country to another; the WR is a senior UN civil servant, who serves as the “Ambassador” of the WHO to the country to which he or she is accredited.15 <br/><br/>The main functions of the WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country’s government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. 16<br/><br/>According to the World Health Organisation report 1996, “the WHO is geared towards fighting disease, fostering development”.<br/><br/>The mission of the WHO Nigeria country office is to promote the attainment of the highest sustainable level of health by all people living in Nigeria through collaboration with the government and other partners in health development and the provision of technical and logistic support to country programmes. <br/><br/>Nigeria became a member of the World Health Organization in 1960 and signed the Basic Agreement in 1962. Over the last four decades therefore, WHO has worked in close collaboration with the Nigerian Government, mainly with the federal ministry of health, to establish a wide array of collaborative programmes. <br/><br/>The main WHO country office is located in the United Nations House, Abuja the Federal capital territory (FCT). In addition, a network of offices has been established in each of the 36 states of the country and the FCT, to provide appropriate and accessible technical support to states and local government areas (LGA). This has improved collaboration with stakeholders and partners as well as the visibility of WHO at those levels. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Endnotes<br/><br/>www.un.org. “world Health Organisation,” accessed May 6, 2012, 2:00pm<br/><br/>Mosby, Medial Dictionary: “World Health Organisation”, (8th Edition, 2009) p 12 – 713.<br/><br/>www.un.org.accessed May 6, 2012. <br/><br/>Ibid<br/><br/>Ibid<br/><br/>Ibid<br/><br/>www.who.int., accessed April 12, 2012, 12: 32am<br/><br/>The United Nations: Economic, Social and Organizational issues in Norwan D.

Even a search through the literature has revealed that ethnicity is relatively a new concept and it made its first appearance in the literature less than half a century ago.1 According to Osaghae, ethnicity refers to a social formation resting upon culturally specific practices and a unique set of symbols and cosmology.2 A belief in common organs and a broadly agreed common history provide an inheritance of symbols, heroes, values and hierarchies and conform social identities of both insiders and outsiders. As a social construct, ethnicity can be regarded as the employment of ethnic identity and differences to gain advantage in situation of competition, conflict and cooperation. In his own conception of what ethnicity is, Depress define ethnicity as largely a subjective process of status identification..3 Hence ethnic groups are formed to the extent that actors use ethnic identities to categorize themselves and others for the purpose of interaction. In similar view, ethnicity can be conceived as an interaction or relationship that exist among people of different ethnic groups who decides to base their relationship on their differences, such exist when two or more ethnic groups, interest relate with one another which normally brings about competition on issues like power or wealth. <br/><br/>The concise Oxford Dictionary defines ethnicity as how the aspirations and interest of ethnic groups are pursued in relation to other groups. To help it off, someone can say ethnicity is the contextual discrimination by members of one ethnic against the others in the process of competition for natural resources. Okwudiba Nnoli has defined ethnicity as a social phenomenon associated with interactions among members of difference ethnic groups. He also proceeded further to define ethnic group as: <br/><br/>Social formation distinguished by the communal character of their boundaries. The relevant communal factor may be language, culture, or both. In Africa, language has clearly been the most crucial variable. As social formations, however, ethnic groups are not necessarily homogenous entities even linguistically or culturally.4 <br/><br/>Religion means different things to different people. There is no consenting of opinion on its meaning, that is why Egwu argued that religion is a subject of inquiry including attempts at its definition and conceptualization.5 Religion is thus defined in many ways and the definitions usually vary among scholars. According to Adeniyi, religion is a body of truths, laws and rites by which man is subordinated to the transcendent being.6 This implies that religion deals with norms and rules that emanated from God and which must be followed by believers. According to Ejizu, religion is man’s intuition of the sacred and ultimate reality and his expression of that awareness in concrete life.7 Many scholars such as Goody and Horton agree that the notion of “sacred” indicates the idea of the transcendent concept of religion and they both go further to undermine the fact that the ‘sensuous religion’ is a district type of experience that is essentially characterized by a feeling of mystery and awe. Ayinla understands religion as a particular system or set of systems in which doctrines, myths, rituals, sentiments and other similar elements are interrelated.8<br/><br/>Religion according to the Oxford Dictionary is defined as one of the systems of faith that are based on the beliefs in the existence of a particular God or gods. The concept has also been defined as a particular interest or influence that is very importance in one’s life. In its own definition, the Oxford learner’s dictionary explained religion as the belief in a super human controlling power that is entitled to obedience and worship. It goes further to state that it is a particular system of faith and worship that one is entitled to.<br/><br/>The word “conflict” has multiple ranges and meaning on the vocabularies of the west on the plane of biography, it usually stands for inner stress and tension, as when a self evolves from the childhood and dependency; when choices between rival moral challenges or course of social action have to be made, or when competitive ideas intrude upon the mental process of seeking certainty and truth.9 Indeed it is hardly possible to appreciate the stream of scientific discoveries artistic inventions, or philosophical theories carried out by this culture without realizing that each represents the resolution of conflicting principles.<br/><br/>Conflict could be described as a situation or condition of disharmony in an interactional process. Banks claim that a situation of conflict is one in which the activity of one is actually or forcibly imposed at unacceptable cost, materials or psychic, upon another. For conflict to occur, Banks put forward three required factors which are intensity and salience of the issues at stake, the status and legitimacy of the parties and the clustering of interest and coincidence of cleavages within a community.10 These factors determine the extent to which conflict can stretch. Imobighe points out that conflict is not limited to any particular level of interaction.11 In other words, it could occur at any level of human interaction and it often manifests violent activities.<br/><br/>Conflict, simplistically, could mean different things but with central themes like: to fight, battle, contend, to be antagonistic, incompatible or contradictory, be in opposition, clash, sharp disagreement or opposition as of interest, ideas, etc. It may mean an emotional disturbance resulting from a clash of opposing impulses. The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary 6th Edition, defines conflict as a situation in which a group or groups of people or countries are involved in serious disagreement or argument; it is also a situation in which there is opposing ideas, opinion, feelings or wishes, a situation in which it is difficult to choose. Conflict may also be defined as the lack of harmonious existence between two or more individuals, two or more ethnic groups, nation states etc. This is the cessation of peace where it had previously existed. Key factors for the cessation of peace (which brings about conflicts) are: injustice or perceived sense of injustice, unfair distribution of benefits or perceived unfair distribution of benefits and betrayal of trust or perceived betrayal of justice. Conflict could also be seen as a disagreement through which the parties involved perceived a threat to their needs, interests or concerns. <br/><br/>The character of the Nigerian state is responsible for the country’s deepening ethno–religious contradictions. This plural nature originates a constant feeling of distrust between the component units and the fear of one ethnic or religious group dominating the other is rife. A pattern of largely discernable ethnic suspicion and intrigues that had existed prior independence in 1960 led to the military coup d’etat of 1966, the traumatic civil war between 1967, and 1970, mutual distrust afterwards, the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential elections and the incessant ethno- religious skirmishes that are presently threatening the very fabric of our nascent democracy and national existence.12 <br/><br/>Nigeria has within its various stages of development, embraced three of the exiting world religions these are Traditional religion, Christianity and Islam. In tracing the impact of each of these religions on Nigeria’s social, political and economic life, some contribution made use of periodization, denoting the level of religiosity of the nation before independence and after the attainment of self government. The existence of any group is the existence of a power above them which regulates their lives and provides them which the survival hit with which the vicissitudes of life are combated. Religion therefore came to describe the totality of man’s outward pattern of behaviour as he struggles to emulate the ways of that being who must be good and to be in the right relations with his being. This belief is found in all communities and societies of the world at varying degrees and with varying conceptual understanding and postulations. Basically therefore, each of the religions existing in Nigeria presents the outward interpretations of qualities of this being, and their perception of his infinity and benevolence. The different location and geographical classifications of peoples has occasioned the conception of the being and their expressions in objects, creed, tenets and worship. The acceptance of this position, dictates of necessity, the existence of groups of people with their religion in Nigeria before the advent of Christianity or Islam. <br/><br/>The origin and history of ethnic conflict can be traced from internal state rivalry to external. And its root cause is not very far from power competition and decision making over economic resources and their important human factor, like position. The implementation process has always involved more than one or two person. In general concept, conflict could be traced back to the first and early patriarchal of human history an ever since then, there has been an increase in various dimensions of conflict in the face of human world. Some are personal (internal) conflict, family, community, group, intellectual, state, national and international in nature. 13 <br/><br/>In confronting to this idea, Badawi in his statement titled “World Apart” stated thus, “Indeed the greatest discord today is among the descendants of Abraham. These are the people of the book, the followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam who had in fact share a common beginning in the religion of Abraham”.14 In shading more light in the above statement, Badawi’s statement goes far beyond religion, rather, he was tracing one of the earliest source of conflict which Badawi mentioned the off springs of the said Abraham. Even before Abraham there had been conflict, so it is as old as human history down to the Abrahamic period, to ancient kingdoms, Dukes and kings. <br/><br/>Ethnic and religious issues are part of the most recurring issues in Nigeria’s body politics. The issue has permeated the landscape since the colonial period and up till the present time, there seems to be no solution in sight to the accompanying conflicts of ethnic rivalry and religious intolerance.15 The dominant and minority ethnic groups treat each other with suspicion and the different religious world view clash at the slightest provocations. <br/><br/>Institutional efforts which were made to satiate these tendencies since independence in 1960 has provided inadequate. The long years of military rule increased the gap of distrust as the elites deliberately employed state power to pursue primordial sentiments thereby increasing the gap of intolerance in Nigeria. The current political cum religious battles is fuelled by certain quarters and individuals who benefits at the expense of the state and citizens. According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, innumerous actors have a stake in the promotion of ethno-religious conflicts because the associated arithmetic of numbers underpinning the conflicts translates into jobs, contracts, the creation of local governments and states as well as representation in the National Assembly. 16 <br/><br/>The introduction of the Sharia legal system has introduced another dimension into the whole farce. While the Moslems justifies its introduction as part of the dividends of democracy, the Christians see its introduction as contrary to the spirit of secularism, as provided for in section 10 of the 1979 and 1999 constitutions, with states that ‘’the government of the federation or of a state shall not adopt any religion as a state religion’’. 17 This brings to fore the fact that the real problem in Nigerian is not so much the level of ethnic differences, secularity or religiosity but fears of political domination of one ethnic or religious group by the other. <br/><br/>The years between 1952 and 1966 brought changes in the political culture of the country, transforming the three regions into three political entities. Thus, the struggle for independence was reduced to the quest for ethnic dominance. At this time, ethnic and sub – ethnic loyalties threatened that survival of both East and West, while the North was divided religiously between Christianity and Islam. It was a period of politicized ethnicity and competition for resources, which worsened the relationships between ethnic groups. There was a high degree of corruption, nepotism, and tribalism. The national interest was put aside while politicians used public money to build and maintain patronage networks. 18 Since independence, the situation in Nigeria has been fraught with ethnic politics whereby the elite from different ethnic groups schemed to attract as many federal resources to their regions as possible, neglecting issues that could have united the country. The anarchy, competition and insecurity led to the demise of the first republic. Military intervention culminated in the gruesome ethnic war from 1967 to 1970, when the mistreated Igbos of eastern Nigeria, called Biafrans, threatened to secede from the federation the Igbo’s grievances were because they were denied of their basic human needs of equality, citizenship, autonomy and freedom.19 Wherever such basic needs are denied, conflict often follows as the aggrieved groups use violent means to fight for their human right. <br/><br/>Ethnocentrism in the country and evidenced corruption of the electoral and political process led in 1966 to a number of revengeful military coups in the country. 20 The first military coup was in January when a collection of young leftist under Major Emmanuel Ifeajuma and Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu led a coup, it was partially successful. The coup brought about the death of some notable figure such as the former Prime Minister , Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Premier Ahmadu Bello of the Northern region and Premier Ladoke Akintola of the western region. Though they could not set up a central government, therefore, president Nwafor Orizu was then pressured to hand over government to the Nigerian Army under the command of General JTU Aguyi Ironsi. Later on, there was another counter coup by another successful plot, which were primarily supported by the Northern military officers and those northerners who were in favour with the NPC. This time, it was planned and carried out by the northern officers and gave Lt. Colonel Yakubu Gowon to become head of state. This series of coups led to an increase in ethnic tension and violence. The northern coup, which was mostly motivated by ethnic and religious reason, the result was a bloodbath of both military officers and civilians, especially those of Igbo extraction. The violence against the Igbo increased their desire for a demand of their own authority and protection from the military’s wrath. By May 1967, the eastern region had declared itself an independent state calling themselves “Republic of Biafra” with Lt. Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu as the leader. Inspired by the Pan – Yoruba militant groups, the Afenifere and the Oduduwa People Congress (OPC) in south – western Nigeria threatened secession and intensified violent protest across the country. <br/><br/>Ethnic conflicts in Nigeria continued through the democracy transition. Olusegun Obasanjo, a civilian, has been president for several year. 21 However, conflict continues to escalate, as various ethnic groups demand a political restructuring. The federal structure has developed deep racks and demand urgent action to mend it. But what is more worrisome is the religious dimension of ethnic competition for power and oil wealth in Nigeria. The multiple ethno–religious conflicts in the northern cities of Kano, Kaduna, Jos and Zamfara spring from the introduction of Muslim Sharia courts and the south’s demands for autonomy. The continuing conflict is an indication that Nigeria lacks effective mechanism to manage ethnic conflicts. <br/><br/><br/><br/>ENDNOTES<br/><br/>O.A. Fawole and M. L.

It is a principle of behavior or belief that influences how one behave. It can also be defined as government programmes of action, which is what government intend to do and how they intend to do or achieve it.1<br/><br/>Economic policy can be seen as a set of Economic measures conceptualized formulated, enacted and executed by government as a deliberate effort to speed up the process of Economic development in such society. It is the deliberate measures or programs taken by governments or their agents an order to accelerate the pace of development for the socio-Economic well-being of its citizenry. No country whether big or small, would leave its economy to invisible hand of market forces without any kind of moderation. It has been argued by some scholars in the economic field that in modern world, no country’s economic and social development are free from some form of deliberate efforts by government or its agent, to speed up the process of economic development. <br/><br/>Government plays a vigorous role in shaping, designing and moderating economic developments in each of their respective states or countries. While in some states, the role of the governments is pervasive, directly, and extensively interfering with the lives of the people- as typical of socialist or communist oriented countries, in others that are capitalist oriented the influence of governments is limited to policy measures with which economic and others actions take lace and this provide the stimulous to economic growth and development2. <br/><br/>One of the most important purpose or programs of a constituted government is the formulation of economic policy. The relevance of the formulation of such economic policy in the act of governance cannot be over emphasized considering the implication of a weak economy for the survival of a nation:- The strength of a nation rests on a viable economy. A nation with a viable economy enjoys political stability, high standard of living for its citizenry and a good diplomatic relation with other nations of the world. Therefore it can be safe for us to argue that the economic strength of a nation is a major determinant of the political power of that nation and its respectability in the international system or environment. In order to pursue economic statecraft effectively, states and indeed governments need to have a strong economic base. Such financial strength is usually an important element in the power equation of states in the international system. <br/><br/>The growth rate of the economy, the inflation rate, the international/foreign reserves (holding of foreign currency and gold), the balance of payment, budget surplus or deficit of the central bank of states, are crucial factors in determining the performance of states in the international environment3. <br/><br/>For instance, according to IMF and World Bank sources (1996), Japan had a moderate growth rate and low inflation. Her international reserve was substantial. She had a positive balance of payment and a small deficit. Russia by contrast, was in financial shambles, her GDP had declined and inflation had run rampant; it had scant international reserves and a substantial balance of payment deficit. Given this scenario, Japan though smaller by size is more likely to play a more dominant role in the international political economy than Russal4. Similarly, with the 1994 GDP of 6.6 trillion dollar, the U.S.A is an economic titan that could use its economic power to produce other types of relationship. The U.S has the ability, for instance to influence other countries by offering trade benefits or threatening trade sanctions. For this reason, the U.S. has continue to play a dominate and vigorous role in international economic relations and in world politics. Since every nation strives to achieve those goals; economic policy becomes an important economic tool used in promoting economic growth5.<br/><br/>The success of a government is not only determined by its political actions or position but most importantly, how such government manages the economy. The economy of a nation has profound effect on the social, political and economic life of her citizens. When and if poorly managed, the result is that the government losses credibility amongst its citizens. Formulation and implementation of economic policy becomes a sensitive issue in governance which has to be exercised with a high level of seriousness in that, it determine how successful a government is <br/><br/>Formulation of economic policy is not new in Nigeria, as virtually every regimes come with one form of policy or the other. However, this work is limited or concerned with economic policies initiated by the military governments in Nigeria between 1983-1993 when the military terminated the second republic and took over the leadership of this nation-Nigeria. <br/><br/>Post independent Nigeria have had a chequered history – this is because it has been characterized by political instability occasioned by incessant military interventions into the nations political scene. Of the over 50 years of Nigeria’s independence, the military has made six (6) successful interventions into the Nigeria government; 1966-1975, Gen. Gowon led government; 1975-1979, Gen. Murtala/Obasanjo led government; 1983-1985; Buhari/Idagbon, led military government; 1985-1993, Gen Banbagida led military government, 1993-1998, Abacha led the military government till his death and 1998-1999 Gen. Abdusalami led the military government and handed over power on May 29th 1999 to a democratically elected president and commander-in-chief of the Nigeria arm forces.<br/><br/>It will therefore be ideal to ascribe most of the economic policy(ies) formulated and implemented in Nigeria to military regimes which have had a greater share in governance since independence and these policies have had its effect on the economy. Such effect had profound impact on the social, political and economic life of Nigeria. The most pronounced of these economic polices was the one initiated in 1986 by the military government led by Gen. Banbagida. <br/><br/>The period between 1985-1993 when Banbagida ruled this nation, marked a revolutionary change in Nigeria’s history. Revolution in history may be dramatic or traumatic. It may also be violent resulting in blood letting as in the case of the French Revolution of 1789. Revolution could also occur or be made to occur through a systematic Activation of particular decisions, policies and progress by a leader6. The Banbagida administration initiated a lot of decisions, policies and programs that were unique in the life of the nation. Most important was his economic policy known as the Structural Adjustment program (SAP). <br/><br/>The Banbagida military government economic package-SAP was not entirely new in Nigeria but it was formally introduced or applied in Nigeria’s economy in 1980’s7. This was after a series of disagreement between previous government and the international monetary fund (IMF) which led to a deadlock over the issue of Nigeria receiving loan from IMF. SAP is a World Bank and IMF program conditionally for countries that are faced with serious deficit in the balance of payment7. Therefore, the ultimate reason why SAP was introduced in Nigeria economy was to correct imbalance that has been manifesting in the Nigeria economy since the early 1980’s. It was hoped that SAP would place the Nations economic development on a realistic course and correct the wrong headed import substitution program of the late 1950’s through to the beginning of the 1980’s8. <br/><br/>Nigeria economy for instance, has been characterized by a rather dismal growth performance over the past several years before 1986 when SAP was introduced. The economy also suffered from structural im-balance which was dominated by oil sector which provides the bulk of foreign exchange and government revenue. During the period of the oil boom, the country’s per capital income rose significantly, peaking at about N1,160 in the late 70’s and early 80’s9. Decline stated manifesting in the per-capital income in the middle 1980’s as a result of the fall in oil price in the international market. The situation led to a serious economic crisis which began in 1982 has the country was faced with a serious balance of payment deficit. The Shagari regime, 1979 to 1983, under which the crisis manifested itself tried to resolve it through a combination of state regulations as exemplified in the introduction or austerity measures10. And some structural adjustment measures. The regime in April 1983, applied for an I.M.F. support loan to argument the balance of payment and by the end of the year it had started making moves to secure a world Bank structural adjustment loan11. But there was disagreement over the I.M.F. request that the economy should be deregulated by granting ascendency to market forces and the substantial devaluation of the naira. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the Buhari regime which overthrew Shagari’s administration on December 31st 1983, believed that the crisis could be resolved through state regulation and implementation of a structural adjustment program. The regime then embanked on measures like retrenchment and anti-corruption crusade, counter trade and the promotion of a greater state control of the economy. At the same time, the administration stated its commitment to a structural adjustment program with a key-note address given by Gen. Buhari at a conference on strategies for the 5th National Development Plan (NDP) at the Nigeria institute for social and economic research (NISER) Ibadan on 26th November, 1984. He stated that: <br/><br/>Because of the structural adjustment required to place the economy on the part to early discovery and a self sustained growth, the present administration has decided against any extension of the life of the 4th plan12. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the disagreement between the Shagari and the Buhari regime on the one hand and the I.M.F. on the other hand, resulted as a stalement of Nigeria’s request for the balance of payment support loan. <br/><br/>The Babangida regime which overthrown the Buhari’s administration in August, 1985, made it clear that it was bent on resolving the imposes between the Nigeria’s government and the I.M.F. After the rejection of the I.M.F. loan through a public debate in 1985, the regime want ahead to introduce structural adjustment program- SAP in June 198613. The Babangida administration was throughout its life, committed to the fall scale implementation of the program. <br/><br/>Conclusively, the introduction and implementation of SAP in Nigeria, marked a revolutionary and a traumatic change with serious social economic and political problems which has left Nigeria unstable since 1986. SAP led to an unpresented increase in the inflationary rate in Nigeria following the deregulation of the foreign exchange market in March, 199214. Given the dependent nature of the county’s production structures, this situation simply helped to further deepen the economic crises. The big question for our consideration is: why was SAP introduced at all in Nigeria? is the policy alien, strange and impossible to fit into our social political and economic settings was SAP badly implemented by the military government. A total evaluation of the concept of the policy and its implementation would give answers to these question.</p>\n\nNIGERIA ECONOMIC POLICY UNDER THE MILITARY 1983-1993<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NIGERIA ECONOMIC POLICY UNDER THE MILITARY 1983-1993", "id": 54}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE <br/><br/>INTRODUCTION <br/><br/>This work is on the inter-group relations between Ukwuani and Urhobo peoples up to 1900. One aspect of Ukwuani and Urhobo history that has not received much attention from historians in recent times, is the effect of inter-group relations between them. Many have written on the various aspects beginning with the origin, culture and annual festivals of the Ukwuani’s and the Urhobo’s. Yet, the more recent events – the inter-group relations between them, which virtually have affected nearly all aspects of Ukwuani and Urhobo lands has not caught the attention of many historians despite the fact that many of these people are now living witnesses to the events. It is therefore, the aim of this study to construct the history of Ukwuani and Urhobo in relation to their experiences and analyze the events as they occurred and show how they were affected in terms of their political, social and economic activities up to 1900. <br/><br/>GEOGRAPHICAL BACKGROUND OF THE UKWUANI’S<br/><br/>Ukwuani is an ethnic group in part of Delta State in the Federal Republic of Nigeria and it is administratively divided into three local government areas, namely; Ndokwa East, Ndokwa West and Ukwuani Local Government Areas of the same state1 with the administrative headquarters located at Aboh, Utagba-Ogbe (Kwale) and Obiaruku respectively. <br/><br/>Ukwuani land is located between longitude 6061 and 6042 East, latitude 6031 and 5025 North2 and they constitute a political division in Delta State of Nigeria. With a population of about 500,000 inhabitants in 1963.3 Ukwuani land is bordered on the North by the Benin Division, on the south by the Ijaw Division, on the South-West by Urhobo and Isoko Divisions, on the East by the Niger River, on the North-East by Ika and Asaba Divisions, and on the South-East by Ahoada Division of the Rivers State.4 <br/><br/>The geographical position of Ukwuani, places the country within two belts and they include the Deltaic Swampy Forest, which covers the southern and south eastern coastal towns as well as the tropical rain forest situated in the Northern part of the territory.5 In the swampy region, numerous creeks and impassable dense forest abound which also experience flood during certain period of the year. The area also has adequate rainfall all year round and the vegetation is a mixture of evergreen forest and the savannah grassland with very fertile soil.6 <br/><br/>Ukwuani is a language spoken in parts of Delta and Rivers States in Nigeria, notably: Abbi, Aboh, Afor, Akoku, Amai, Ndoni (Rivers), Isukwe (Rivers), Onuaboh, Ashaka, Ebedei, Emu, Ejeme Aniogo, Ezionum, Eziokpor, Utagba-Ogbe (Kwale), Ndemili, Obiaruku, Obetim Uno, Obikwele, Owa Alidima, Umuaja, Ossissa, Utagba-Uno, Umutu, Onicha-Ukwuani, Obinomba, Iselegu, Umukwata, Owa Abbi, Utchi, Abgragada, Ushie, Ogume, Azagba and Umuolu.7 <br/><br/>Garri which is produced from cassava forms one of the major export communities in this region and both palm oil and kernels are extensively produced for internal use and for export. Certain cash crops like cocoa and rubber are also cultivated while the latter forms one of the main export cash crop in the territory.8 In addition, other cash crops like maize, melon, tomatoes, okro, beans and groundnut are also cultivated and produced in abundance both for subsistence and for commerce with the neighbouring towns and villages. It is no wonder that many of the people in the region are traders while a few are weavers. <br/><br/>Additionally, Kwale and Aboh are very often referred either to the inhabitants of the Ukwuani country or the territory itself. But in either case, the terms or names so employed are basically unsuitable for the word ‘Kwale’ goes back to the days of British pacification of Ukwuani land. Consequence upon this initial hostile attitude of the Ukwuani towards the British, the first political officer had to fall back on a town which was then predominantly Urhobo speaking (although some speak a bit of Ukwuani) and now part of the Urhobo Division. This provincialism which existed in the area made them pronounce Ukwuani-Ukwuale or Kwale. <br/><br/>According to an oral account given by Chief Obodiowe Edike,9 the choice of Abraka as temporary British headquarters was motivated by a number of factors; firstly, the town was friendly to the administrators. Secondly, it was situated on a level plain as against the swampy impassable path of Ukwuani. Thirdly, it was sighted on the main road leading to Warri – the provincial headquarters, and so facilitated communication and re-enforcement of troops. And fourthly, Abraka was very close to River Ethiope, the only source of pure water in the division. <br/><br/>Because of the choice of Abraka as a station, the British were much more familiar with Urhobo-speaking elements, in and around Abraka than they were with the Ukwuani people. As these Urhobo people called their Ukwuani neighbours “Ukwuale” or “kwale”, their own rendering of Ukwuani, this name gained currency. The British thus adopted the word ‘Kwale’ as a simplified word for Ukwani and called the headquarters ‘Kwale’. Thus, the new station built in Utagba-Ogbe on a Government Reserved Area became known as ‘kwale’.10 This name was used in all official correspondence until 1950 when at the instance of the people, the proper name ‘Ukwuani’ was officially adopted.11 <br/><br/>It is imperative to point out here that Ukwuani communities as has been outline in previous paragraph and these communities share common boundary with each other. In addition, the land occupies a very strategic position in Nigeria as all the major roads in the country converge in Ukwuani land, accounting for her rapid development. For instance, the New Sapele-Agbor Road popularly referred to as the “New Road” passes through Ukwuaniland. The Warri-Umutu-Ekuku-Agbor Road enrout to Onitsha also passes through Ukwuani land as well as the Agbor-Ogwashi Road to Onitsha. Source of water supply in Ukwuani land is through rivers and rainfall and most recently taps and bore-hole. It is also worthy of note that Ukwuani has never recorded any earthquake or earth tremor and there is no major mountain or rock in the different communities that make up the Ndokwa nation. <br/><br/>GEOGRAPHICAL BACKGROUND OF THE URHOBOS<br/><br/>The Urhobo, also a very prominent part of the Delta State in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, constitute the largest ethnic group in same state and are spread over nine (9) Local Government Areas which includes Ethiope East, Ethiope West, Okpe, Ughelli South, Ughelli North, Sapele, Udu, Uvwie and part of Warri South.12 The Urhobo occupy a contiguous territory bounded by latitude 50151 and 60 North and longitudes 50401 and 60251 East.13 They have about twenty two polities which includes: Agbarha-Ame (Agbassa), Agbarha-Otor, Agbarho, Agbon, Arharwarien, Avwraka, Ephon-Otor, Eghwu, Evwreni, Idjerhe, Oghara, Ogor, Okere (Urhobo), Okparabe, Okpe, Olomu, Orogun, Udu, Ughelli, Ughivwen, Ughowerun and Uvwie.14 <br/><br/>The area is bounded on the North by the River Ethiope (except at the Northwest corner where it stretches into a strip of land on the right bank of the river). On the south, it shares a boundary with the Western Ijaw Local Governments of Bomadi and Patani while on the East by the Ukwuani and Ndokwa West Local Governents as well as Isoko North and on the West by the Warri South Local Government.15 Thus, their immediate neighbours are the Binis to the North, the Ijaw to the South, Ukwuani’s and Isoko’s to the East and Itsekiri to the West. <br/><br/>Located in the evergreen forest of southern Nigeria, the Urhobos are predominantly farmers. Such products as yam, cassava, maize, plantain, banana and cocoyam constitute the core products of subsistence farming embarked upon by almost every family. It was however, for the abundance of oil palm products that early European interest in Urhobo land was generated as we see in subsequent chapters in the course of this work. Although not as popular as oil palm, rubber is a primary cash crop that survives the economy of the people. <br/><br/>Fishing is another occupation through which the Urhobo people make their living and this is not surprising as a number of rivers and creeks flows through the land. Among these are the River Ethiope which flows through Sapele and parts of Abraka clan, the Warri River which seeps through land areas in Ughievwen (Okwagbe), Agbarho, Agbon, and Abraka clans. Also, a tributary of the Forcados River, known as Okpare, runs through Obomu clan into Ekakpamre creek and Kiagbodo River.16 <br/><br/>Apart from fishing which is made possible by the presence of these rivers, the Urhobo’s who live along these rivers produce the local gin also known as ‘Ogogoro’ from raffia palms.17 Pottery and raffia mats also form a lucrative soruce of revenue for the people especially the Ughievwens in Ughelli South Local Government Area. <br/><br/>Additionally, with respect to the population, the National Census count of 1932 gave the Urhobo division a population of about 359,000. But during the census counting of 1952, the government of the then Mid-Western Region of Nigeria gave Urhobo Division a population of 323,000.18 That means the Division recorded a drop of 36,000 in population which is an absolute absurdity. <br/><br/>In all parts of Urhobo land, the average annual temperature is about 270C with no marked seasonal or monthly variations. Mainly on account of the fact that the Niger Delta lies across the part of the South-West moisture-laden winds blowing from the Atlantic Ocean. All parts of Urhobo land experience heavy rainfall, in that annual rainfall average of 2500mm or more in characteristic of most areas.19 <br/><br/>It is also important to point out here that some of the different communities that make up the Urhobo land share common boundary with each other and the land occupies a very strategic position in Nigeria as some major roads in the country passes through the Urhobo land, also accounting for her rapid development. Source of water supply is through rainfall, rivers, taps (and borehole in contemporary times) and most importantly, Urhobo land has never recorded any earthquake or earth tremor and there are no mountains or rocks in the different communities of Urhobo land. <br/><br/>TRADITIONS OF ORIGIN OF UKWUANI PEOPLE <br/><br/>Matching events with dates have been very difficult in writing about the history of Ukwuani and this problem stems from the fact that very few literature are available on the history and origin of Ukwuani. Hence, one has to rely on oral traditions from the Okpala’s, Okwa’s, Onotu’s (Inotu’s), Eze’s, Ada’s and some other experienced men in Ukwuani whose source of knowledge was also through oral tradition. <br/><br/>Again, there are so many traditions of origins of Ukwuani and this has been a subject of great controversy. The controversy arose from the fact that there are vested interest on the topic with each clan, village or family component trying to exert influence and superiority over others. <br/><br/>The word ‘Ukwuani’ stands for the people as well as their language and so its usage therefore encompasses both the people and their language. For record purposes, the word “Ndokwa” was coined from the names of two former district councils in former Aboh Division, namely: Ndosumili and Ukwuani District Councils. The word ‘Ndokwa’ therefore consists of the first three letters of Ndosumili and the second, third and fifth letters in Ukwuani.20 As was earlier stated, the Ukwuani people are found in Ndokwa East, Ndokwa West and Ukwuani Local Government Areas(s) of Delta State. However, some Ukwuani people are found in other parts of Delta State and Rivers State respectively. Although most writers and historians on the other hand, who have written on Ukwuani history did not include these ones as part of the ‘Ndokwa Nation’ or ethnic group (for they confined the ethnic definition of Ukwuani people to only those found in the above mentioned Local Government Areas) it is important to note here that the Ukwuani speaking people in these other parts of Delta and Rivers State also form part of the ‘Ndokwa Nation’ because for one thing, they speak Ukwuani language just like their counterparts in the above mentioned L.G.As. In addition, they have similar traditions of origin like them in the sense that most of them trace their origins to some of the recognized Ndokwa/Ukwuani communities in Delta State. <br/><br/>The Ukwuani people, just like every other tribe or ethnic group in Nigeria has their own traditions of origin. It is difficult to explore the whole gamut of traditions of Ukwuani people because the range is almost endless as a result of the fact that the various clans that make up the Ukwuani ethnic group do not have a single tradition of origin. Be that as it may, efforts will be made here to examine those traditions that have common relevance to this ethnic group and also are prominent among the people. <br/><br/>In consequence of the heterogeneity of Ukwuani clans, divergent views were held with regards to the historical origins of the people. However, from the varying account of the elders, three waves of migration appeared to account for the present population of the Ukwuani people. <br/><br/>The first wave comprises the independent settlers, which are represented by the clans of Umu-Akashiada, Ebedei and Akarai who claim to have migrated from Benin. As they were the first clans to arrive, they occupied the best part of the country. These clans were followed by a second wave of independent settlers whose ancestors migrated from Eastern Nigeria. The settlements consists of Abarra Clan, Utu-Oku, UMu-Barautchi, Ndoni, Onya and Adai Clans. They settled along the banks of the Niger and were the first groups of Igbo extraction to establish isolated settlements in Ukwuani lands. Towards the end of the sixteenth century, a third wave: in the form of a well-organized expedition of Edo conquerors arrived Ukwuani land. The Aboh clan and its offshoot clan of Abbi, Amai, and Umukwata represent them.21 <br/><br/>Among the first wave of migrants who were all of Edo extraction, the Umu-Akashiada claim to be the earliest clan to settle in Ukwuani Country. The clans consist of the Eziokpo, Ezionum, Umuebu, and Obiaruku clans. (Abraka, having now emerged with the Urhobos). <br/><br/>According to Chief Oshilim Nwazuosa22, the ancestors of the clan, Akashiada migrated from Benin and settled at Umuoshi quarter of Eziokpo. Tradition states that Akashiada ahd two wives and the first wife gave birth to three sons: Okpor, Ezie and Ebu, while the second wife had a son called Ovili. As members of the various families increased rapidly after the death of Akashiada, the first settlement became too congested for the migrants, as a result, the brothers decided to separate their families from one another and found new settlements. Okpo, the eldest son became the direct heir of the original settlement at Umuoshi and his descendants named the settlement Eziokpo (after Okpo). Ezie, the second son moved southward with his family and founded a site, which his descendants named Ezionum, after their ancestor. Ebu, the youngest son then migrated westward with his family and settled at first in Obi-Agbulugu, he later moved to One-Oto or Obi-ata, and finally settling at the present site, which his descendants called Umuebu (the descendants of Ebu). Ovili, the only son of the second wife moved further west and founded the village of Ovili (Abraka-Inland). <br/><br/>Between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, many other independent settlements were founded by the clans of Ebedei (at the present site of Ogume in the hinterland of Ukwuani) and Akarai (at the present site of Aboh, between the Ase Creek and the Niger River). These clans were of Benin extraction. <br/><br/>According to the oral account of Pa Enehume Nmor23, the ancestors of Ebledei was one Udei. He claimed to have migrated from Benin and settled in the present site of Aboh wehre he had two children – Okpu and Ezie-Ogoli. These two sons were the founders of Ebedei clan. They migrated from Aboh and settled at the present site of Ogume on the Southern site of Okumeshi stream. Due to lack of farmland, Okpu crossed to the northern side of Okumeshi where he discovered some fertile land as he was hunting. He planted ‘Ani Divinity’ (Earth Covenant Divinity) indicating right of ownership on this spot and invited his brother Ezie-Ogoli to join him. Both brothers settled in the present site of Umunyalum. Later, Ezie-Ogoli moved to Ogbe Ata from where his descendants moved further to the present site of Umuezie-Ogoli quarter because of a fight between Umunyalum and Umuezie-Ogoli. During this fight, Umunyalum quarter was burnt to ashes and in fear of biter reprisal, Umuezie-Ogoli had to move away because if they had remained at Ogbe Ata, they would have to pass through Umunyalum quarter while going to their farm. Prior to this disruption, other migrants had joined the two brothers and constituted themselves into various quarters of Ebedei. These included the quarters of Ogbe Uzu who migrated from Akarai, Umu-Osele who migrate from Benin, Isemelu and Ukwu-ole quarters who moved in from Ogume. <br/><br/>The clan of Ndoni, comprising the villages of Ndoni and Oniku on the other hand, claims to have migrated from Utafi in Ahoada Division of Rivers State. According to the oral testimony of Elder Ikpeoha Onyeso24, the leader of the emigrants from Utafi settled at Oniku while his followers moved to Ndoni. This is why Oniku claimed to be the ancestral village of the Ndoni clan. For example, the priest of Ani (earth covenant divinity) for the whole clan is always the Oke (the oldest man) of Oniku. This priest also fixed the date for the festival of Udieri, which is jointly celebrated by the two villages. Furthermore, when an Ndoni man loses a wife by death, he must go to Oke of Oniku to offer sacrifice to Ani’. <br/><br/>INVASIONS <br/><br/>By the middle of the fifteenth century, the young independent settlements in Ukwuani country had begun to experience series of invasions from Benin. Oba Ewuare the Great (1440) in particular was said to have attempted to subjugate Akashiada Clans and to force them into accepting the overlordship of Benin. Ewuare was reputed to be a great magician, physician, traveler, and warrior.25 He was also powerful, courageous and sagacious. He fought against and captured 201 towns and villages in Ekiti, Ikare, Afenmai and Western Igbo, taking their petty rulers captive and causing the people to pay tribute to him. <br/><br/>According to the interview with Chief Okpor Nduka26, the Oba was regularly sending his soldiers to intimidate the various clans, as such clans were expected to entertain them. Failure to provide hospitality was regarded as contempt and visited with instant annexation. In one of their routine exercise, Edo troops tried to force Akashiada clans to pay tribute but Unuebu, the most powerful and populated Akashiada clan, withstood the Edo soldiers and forced them to flee. <br/><br/>However, the sixteenth century ushered in a well organized Edo conquering party, which the Ukwuani could not resist. This was the Aboh party that resulted not only in the establishment of Aboh kingdom, but also in the foundation of many towns in Ukwuani. As they travelled southwards, their numbers dwindled because families decided to settle at various points enroute. Thus, clans like Obetim, Ossissa, Ashaka and Amai were founded in the process. <br/><br/>As the rest of the party moved northwards together with their families as nomads, they arrived the present site of Umukwata where they established their first camp. After staying together for many years, Amai moved westward and founded Amai; Eti migrated further west and founded Orogun and Amacha went southwest and founded Abbi. Ukwata, the oldest man among the leaders was left with his family to occupy the original settlement, which, his descendants named Umukwata (the descendant of Ukwata) after their father. Gradually, as they migrated further, other clans like Ogume, Akoku, Onicha, Emu, Umuolu, Utagba-Ogbe (Kwale), Utagba-Uno were founded. <br/><br/>In all of these, it is important to admit that there are vested interest on this topic – the origin of Ukwuani, as was earlier stated. This is partly because each clan, village or family component try to exact influence and superiority over others and this consequently has made the subject of great controversy. <br/><br/>TRADITIONS OF ORIGIN OF URHOBO PEOPLE <br/><br/>As with the Ukwuani people, the Urhobo people have their own traditions of origin. Although it is very difficult to explore the whole gamuet of traditions of Urhobo people for the range is almost endless owing to the fact that the various clans that make up the Urhobo ethnic group do not have a single tradition of origin. Efforts will be made here to examine those traditions that have common relevance to the Urhobo ethnic community and also are prominent among the people. <br/><br/>There are about four main traditions of origin of the Urhobo people and these traditions, collected at different times in different places and by different researchers are not necessarily mutually exclusive. They include: (i) Autochthony, (ii) Emigration form an original Edo Territory, (iii) Traditions of Origin from Ife and (iv) Traditions of Origin from the Sudan and Egypt.27 To begin, it is best to look at these traditions one after the other. <br/><br/>Autochthony <br/><br/>Traditions among the Urhobo are replete with assertions of original dwellers and owners of their territory and those autochthonous people were believed to be Urhobo, with no known history of migration from anywhere else. They were the aborigines coming from no where but living in their territories from time immemorable. This tradition is without documentary or archeological evidence, yet, it recurs among Urhobo respondents and it may not be brushed aside. <br/><br/>This aboriginal strata referred to above must have been very strongly established because the diverse ‘stranger’ intervening elements have been completely absorbed into a common and distinguishable pool of cultural and organizational forms among all the Urhobo people. <br/><br/>Emigration from an Original Edo Territory<br/><br/>Urhobo emigrants from their Edo territory consist of two categories: the masses (ordinary) people, and the ruling elite. An overwhelming number of Urhobo claim that they came from Benin, but they emphasize that they were not Bini people who turned to be Urhobo on reaching their territories. Instead, they assert that they were already Urhobo’s before they left Benin. This tradition is the one found in recorded works.28 <br/><br/>Traditions of Benin origin suggest two major migrations during the two dynasties in Bini history. In the first place, the Urhobo remember clearly the Ogiso Dynasty consisting of the 31 known rulers (Ogisos) before the alleged journey to Ife that gave rise to the Eweka dynasty. Also, such terms as ‘Igodomigodo’, the name by which the territory was known, are repeated and are well remembered in connection with cruelty, bitterness, deprivations, insecurity of life and property, and tyranny, and consequently too, in connection with a period when the Urhobo, apparently less powerful, left their Edo abode in search of peace and plentiful economic resources.29 <br/><br/>The second major migrations occurred after 1770 A.D. during the second Benin dynasty and in particular, reference is made to the reign of Egbeka at about 1370 A.D.30 when the Urhobo were said to have emigrated from Benin. <br/><br/>Traditions of Origin from Ife <br/><br/>Traditions of Ife origin are also remembered by the Urhobo, but neither those at Ife nor those in Urhobo land can recall the nature of the connection and this is understandable, bearing in mind the strains and limits of memory in keeping unwritten records. Spots pointed to by the Urhobo’s in Ile-Ife as being the places from where Urhobo people migrated appeared better regarded as centres of Urhobo concentrations within living memory and admittedly, there are a large number of Urhobo in and around Ile-Ife but these are organized more like immigrants than as autochthonous. Yet, the traditions of Ife origin are strongly held. <br/><br/>Traditions of Origin from the Sudan and Egypt<br/><br/>The traditions of origin that link the Urhobo’s with the Sudan and Egypt are, at face value, near friction. However, they are important indicators of societal links existing amongst the Edo and Yoruba speaking peoples, providing the social and cultural contexts within which to analyze historical processes. <br/><br/>At this point, it is important to mention that aside the above mentioned traditions of origin, there also exist Urhobo clans of Ibo origin.31 However, due to long interaction and cross migration, the entire group now has some general features which have constantly undergone modification to assume a generally acceptable culture in certain areas as marriage, burial rites, dressing pattern and social values which can be referred to as Urhobo culture. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The clans that constitute the entity known as Urhobo are: <br/><br/>No. Clan Headquarters Local Government Areas <br/><br/>1<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>9<br/><br/>10<br/><br/>11<br/><br/>12<br/><br/>13<br/><br/>14<br/><br/>15<br/><br/>16<br/><br/>17<br/><br/>18<br/><br/>19<br/><br/>20<br/><br/>21<br/><br/>22 Abraka <br/><br/>Agbarha <br/><br/>Agbarho <br/><br/>Agbassa <br/><br/>Agbori <br/><br/>Arhavwarien <br/><br/>Effumentor <br/><br/>Evwreni <br/><br/>Ewu <br/><br/>Idjerhe <br/><br/>Oghara <br/><br/>Ogor <br/><br/>Olumu <br/><br/>Okere-Urhobo <br/><br/>Okparabe <br/><br/>Okpe <br/><br/>Orogun <br/><br/>Udu<br/><br/>Ughelli <br/><br/>Ughievwen<br/><br/>Uvwie<br/><br/>Uwherun Otorho-Abraka <br/><br/>Agbarha-Otor <br/><br/>Orho-Agbarho <br/><br/>Agbassa <br/><br/>Isiokolo <br/><br/>Arhavwarien <br/><br/>Effuruntor <br/><br/>Evareni <br/><br/>Ewu <br/><br/>Jesse Town <br/><br/>Ogharefe <br/><br/>Otogor <br/><br/>Otorere-Olumu <br/><br/>Okere <br/><br/>Okparabe <br/><br/>Orerokpe<br/><br/>Orogun <br/><br/>Otor-Udu<br/><br/>Otovwodo<br/><br/>Otughievwen<br/><br/>Effurun<br/><br/>Uwherun Ethiope West <br/><br/>Ughelli North <br/><br/>Ughelli North<br/><br/>Warri South <br/><br/>Ethiope West <br/><br/>Ughelli South<br/><br/>Ughelli South<br/><br/>Ughelli North <br/><br/>Ughelli South <br/><br/>Ethiope East <br/><br/>Ethiope East <br/><br/>Ughelli North <br/><br/>Ughelli South <br/><br/>Warri South <br/><br/>Ughelli South <br/><br/>Okpe and Sapele<br/><br/>Ughelli North<br/><br/>Udu<br/><br/>Ughelli North<br/><br/>Ughelli South<br/><br/>Uvwie<br/><br/>Ughelli North <br/><br/>Table A: Urhobo Clans Headquarters and Local Government Areas.32 <br/></p>\n\nUKWUANI AND THE URHOBO PEOPLE UP TO 1900 – A STUDY IN INTER-GROUP RELATIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " UKWUANI AND THE URHOBO PEOPLE UP TO 1900 – A STUDY IN INTER-GROUP RELATIONS", "id": 55}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE <br/><br/>INTRODUCTION: THE GEOGRAPHY AND PEOPLE OF BENIN <br/><br/>This work is on women and economy of precolonial Benin. This chapter is an introductory study of the geography and people of Benin. Benin was one of the states known for its remarkable civilization and development in the Guinea Forest. Benin was one of the most famous kingdom in the forest region of West Africa and that includes her political system. Scholars and writers alike have shown interest in the history of Benin particularly its participation to the world civilization. It is quite fascinating to known that the Benin history of all the pre-colonial African States, in the most mentioned in contemporary European literature and arts. This chapter centers on the geography and the peoples of Benin.<br/><br/>Geographically, pre-colonial Benin kingdom was located in the forest region of what is now modern Nigeria in West Africa sub-region. This kingdom was not a single administration unit, and its boundaries cannot be precisely drawn.1 The term territory of Benin Kingdom is with the present Orodo, Ovia North-East, Ovia South-West, Uhunmwonde, Orhionmwon and Ikpoba Okha Local Govenrent Areas of Edo State. At the height of its power, the influence of Benin was recorded to have extended westward along the coast of Eko which is present day Lagos and beyond, westwards to Ekiti and beyond which marked the boundary between Benin and Oyo Empire, eastwards to the River Niger as well as the Igbo speaking areas and beyond, and southward to the Atlantic Ocean. The area of pre-colonial Benin had a continuous expansion and that was because Benin was involved with lot of warfare. Warfare and conquering of kingdoms are part of the key answers to empire building. The area does not correspond with what was left of the empire since the European conquest of the kingdom in 1897.2 <br/><br/>Evidence have proved that for upwards of three millennium, people speaking varieties of Edo languages (Benin) have occupied an area, some thirty one thousand square kilometer (31,000sqkm) and that is about twelve thousand square miles (12,000skm). It extends to the west of the River Niger in present day Southern Nigeria. From the people, the Kingdom of Benin was established. Still on the linguistics and cultural evidence was the fact that Benin was called differently by her surrounding immediate neighbours. Their Yoruba neighbours called them ‘Ado’, while the Igbo’s to the east called them ‘Idu’, among their southern neighbours, the Urhobo’s called them ‘Aka’ while the Ijaw called them ‘Ado’ and the Itsekiri call them ‘Ubini’. <br/><br/>It is quite unreasonable to suppose that the Edo’s living in the Benin area in pre-dynastic times were organized socially and politically in a manner that has remained typical of that people. <br/><br/>Cosmologically, the Binis believe in the most high God who they call ‘Osanobua’ or Osanoghodua. They were engaged in atonement of sins and lifting of curses as well as the worship of other smaller gods or deities. <br/><br/>The Binis refer to themselves as Owie-Edo which in English means “Born of Edo”. They also refer to Edo-Newbo-Ahiris meaning Edo, the city of love, drawing reference from an event that a man named Edo rescued a Bini prince the certainty and truth of which can be ascertained in the history of Benin during the rivalry period. <br/><br/>However, some writers, academia and non academia have tried to explain how the Portuguese came to identify the area as Benin. Dr. Ekhayuosa Aisien, a medical doctor and a surgeon who serves as one of the resource persons in the history of Benin and culture, has argued that the Itsekiri’s passed the name Ubini to the Portuguese and that Benin is the Portuguualization of Ubini. Professor A.F.C Ryder disagrees with Dr. Aisien’s view. His disagreement came without any explanation.4 That is to say, although he disagreed, he has not been able to give a tangible explanation. However, what is important here is that the name Benin/Ubini was given by the Europeans. Ubini was a name of territory which had several villages, speaking the same Benin/Edo language. As early as the 15th century, Benin has had contact with the Europeans. This was basically because of Benin’s wealth and fame which included his art and bronze work. The Portuguese were the first to have contact with Benin. They referred to them as ‘Beny’. The Europeans were so amazed at the level of achievement and influence, that they described Benin as the city of bronze. <br/><br/>The origin of Benin have for years had difficulties in reconstructing. This is because of lack of documentation. Since the pre-colonial Benin was mostly reconstructed by oral tradition. This occurrence, has created lots of version as regards to the origin of Benin. In discussing the origin of Benin, there are four interpretation, it can also be called the conflicting interpretation. There are: <br/><br/>The Hermitic Hypothesis <br/><br/>The tradition of migration <br/><br/>The tradition of original settlers <br/><br/>The snail shell hypothesis <br/><br/>The first account on the origin of Benin is the Hermitic Hypothesis. This theory was propounded by Charles C. Seligman in his book, “The Races of Africa”. This was published in the year 1930. He attempt to explain in his book that African initiative and contribution to human or world civilization was the handiwork of Hermites who are believed to be of the Caucasian race.6 This hypothesis through describes or offers an explanation for the conquest of Benin by some foreign invaders who imposed their idea of states formation. These invaders are claimed in historiography to have migrated in waves after waves from the North and over ran the original settlers to establish a new state and society. A study of the dynasty will help to bebunk the hamitic hypothesis as far as pre colonial Benin history was concerned. The point here is that the Ogiso dynasty was a product of autonomous Benin people and not, the Hamites as supported by the Hamitic Hypothesis. It is recorded that the dynasty has flourished centuries before the Europeans had contact with them. Still on the line of over-ruling this Hamitic Hypothesis, it should be noted that the Ogiso dynasty was not just a dynasty, but was all about state formation and civilization of the Benin. Based on these facts, the authenticity of this theory is indeed a questionable one. <br/><br/>The second account of the origin of Benin is the Tradition of Origin. It is closely related to the Hamitic Hypothesis. This theory has three explanations which can also be regarded as the three waves of migration. <br/><br/>The first wave of migration was said to be from Nupe in the Middle Belt of present day Nigeria. The migration was southwards which led to the establishment of the settlement now called Benin. This theory has been without a concrete date. <br/><br/>The second wave of migration was from Sudan through Nupe in about 7th century A.D to form the present day location of Benin. <br/><br/>The third was of migration claimed to have started from Egypt through the Sudan to the Sahara to Ile-Ife, as a place of brief sojourn before moving to present abode Benin. This third wave of migration was greatly supported by a local historian Chief J.U. Egharevba. According to him, <br/><br/>Many years ago, the Binis came all the way from Egypt to found a more secure shelter in this part of the world after a short stay in the Sudan and at Ile-Ife, which the Benin called Uhe.7 <br/><br/>The claim has caused a lot of arguments, Egharevba’s trace of the origin of Benin to Egypt cannot stand the “acid test” of historical scrutiny and analysis. For one thing Egharevba’s proposition gives credence to the Hamitic Hypothesis which has it that everything of significance that took place in Africa South of the Sahara was brought about by the Hamites (Whites). This ascribes Africa’s pre-colonial achievement to the handiwork of white skinned invaders who was supposedly of the Caucasian stock. This however, means that the Benin civilization must have come from Egypt. For another thing the people of Benin do not have any theory of tradition of migration from Egypt. In addition to these facts is that Benin had been in existence for a long time before the establishments of Ile-Ife by Ododuwa and what this point implied is that the founder of Benin whom Egharevba claims migrated from Egypt could not have sojourned in Ile-Ife an his way to Benin. Moreover, the Egyptian culture is significantly absent from the Benin culture, in terms of social and political culture. An example is the Egyptian writing culture known as the hieroglyphics writing. It is purely absent that of Benin. Although there is evidence that the people who moved into the forest region from the northern fringes of west Africa as a result of the desertification of the Sahara. With this, there is a possibility that some of these people may have found their way to Benin.8 Egharevba’s view still habours some uncertainties.<br/><br/>The third account is the theory of evolution. The Benin people in this theory claim that they are the original settlers. According to their belief, they hard occupied the territory from the beginning of the world. They regard themselves as the children of the soil. In most cases, they trace the location to an area in Benin called “Ivbiotor”. Some other areas located at Upper Sakponba and one of such is known as “Igodomigodo” very close to Ugbekun. <br/><br/>The fourth account is anchored on the Benin myth. It is known as the snail shell hypothesis. According to this theory, the Benin mythology has it that Benin was founded by the youngest son of “Osanobua” (the High God) with his elder brothers. It holds that the High God sent his sons to the world, for the journey’s sake, each was allowed to take something with him. While some chose wealth, material things and magical skills and implements, the youngest son was left with nothing to choose from. At the corner was a snail shell which a mystic voice asked him to take. On reaching the earth, they found out it was covered with water, so they could not settle. As they hovered around, a mystical bird instructed the youngest son to upturn the snail shell and when he did so, sand came out from it to form a land. For this reason, the youngest son of ‘Osanobua’ became the owner of the land in the world and became the first king of Benin.9 His elder brothers had to barter their possessions in return for a place to settle. Hence, though he was the youngest, he became the wealthiest and most powerful. It is believed that the first semi-mythical ruler of pre-colonial Benin during the first dynasty which was known as the Ogiso dynasty (meaning king from the sky) was the youngest son of Osanobua. Prince Eweka claimed in one of his lectures that Benin is the cradle of the world. Meaning “Edo orisiagbon”. It is believed that all other people started on Edo land for the Oba owns the land. This version of origin of Benin is supported by the present Omon n’oba Erediauwa in his lecture on Evolution of the Traditional Rulers in Nigeria given under the auspices of the University of Ibadan Institute of African Studies.10 <br/><br/>Although a firm conclusion on the origin of Benin can not be stated, it is believed that all the four traditions of origins has proved questionable at some point. However, I will draw my conclusion by stating that based on the beliefs, customs and traditions from the Oba to his subjects, it is quite clear that the snail shell theory holds all the answers to the way the Oba is regarded and why he is believed to have come from the sky, and also based on their belief that the Oba owns the land, (Obayanto). </p>\n\nWOMEN AND THE ECONOMY OF PRE-COLONIAL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WOMEN AND THE ECONOMY OF PRE-COLONIAL", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Nigeria is a multi ethnic and multi religious country and thus there have been occurrence of ethnic-religious and political conflicts. Study of intergroup relation, such as that of Kankia which portray peaceful co-existence amidst peoples with variations in cultural and religious backgrounds, is of high relevance in the country nowadays. This research therefore, attempted to study the Role of Igbo and Yoruba migrants in the development of Kankia town, 1950-2016. Based on the framework of push and pull factors, the work examined the cases responsible for the settlement of migrants in Kankia, among which economic factor was the most important. The study further examines the social and economic activities of Igbo and Yoruba, their dominant role in certain commercial enterprises and their contributions to the development of Kankia town. Also, the study discovered that, relations between the migrants and their hosts have, for long, been cordial. For the Yoruba migrants, for instance, because of Islam as a factor, there have been instances of inter-marriages with their Hausa host communities. The study then recommends that, peoples of the country generally and policy makers in particular need to learn from Kankia so as to promote peaceful co-existence among Nigerian communities for the betterment of all. This study was carried out, using primary and secondary sources.</div> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></div> <div>Migrant communities, throughout the world, have been playing significant roles in the development of societies. For instance, the activities of migrants in different part of Africa contributed in re-shaping many societies and are viewed as major aspects of the history of Africa. Therefore human migration has been transforming the aspect of racial and linguistic composition of human population.1 Generally, scholars are of the view that migration is influenced by two important factors: the push and the pull factors.2 the push factors include famine, war and flooding. The pull factors on the other hand, attract migrants to settle in an area, such as better socio-political and economic atmosphere.According to Abdulkadir the occurrence of famine and food shortage in some parts of Nigeria in 1932, for instance, served as push factors to the migration of people to different parts of Nigeria and beyond.3</div> <div>This research is concerned with the migration and settlement of Yoruba and Igbo communities in Kankia town, 1950 – 2016. The Yoruba and Igbo came to Kankia town, in the second half of the 20th century, Igbo and Yoruba migrants were the predominant traders in Kankia  town  in fact their settlement facilitated trade and other economic activities in Kankia.

This research is therefore an attempt to re-construct the history of Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) from 1964-2006. The NDA was established in 1964 and charged with the role of training military officers for the Defence need of independent Nigeria. From its establishment in 1964, the graduates of the NDA were awarded National Certificates of Education (NCE) apart from being commissioned into the officer cadre of the Nigerian Armed Forces. The examination was prepared and conducted` by the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. In 1985 the academy was upgraded to a degree awarding institution. Apart from the regular cadet, the institution also runs Short Service and Direct Short Service for holders of Degree and Higher National Diploma from Universities and Polytechnics. In 2005 president Olusegun Obasanjo commissioned the post-graduate school which commenced its activities in the 2005/2006 academic session. The institution also recorded tremendous achievement by producing many prominent military officers in Nigeria who contributed in the maintenance of peace in the country and abroad. Moreover, some of the products of NDA wrote quite a number of text books that are being used in Nigerian tertiary institutions. The contribution of NDA was thus beyond military training but also in the intellectual arena. Despite the achievement of NDA, the institution has been facing numerous problems, Such as favouritism in the recruitment of candidates. This research was carried out through the use of primary and secondary sources.</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE                 </strong></div> <div><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>The Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) was established on 5th February, 1964 to trains officers for the Armed Forces of Nigeria in response to the defence need of independent Nigeria. Before then, the institution responsible for Military training in Nigeria was known as the Royal Military Forces Training College (RMFTC).1After independence in 1960, the college became known as the Nigerian Military Training College (NMTC). The role of the Academy was to provide each officer cadet with knowledge, skills and values necessary to meet the requirements of a military officer through military, academic and character development. In 1964 NMTC was renamed Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). The NDA is an institution where selected young able-bodied men and women are groomed into well educated, courageous, virile and erudite subalterns. The vision of the NDA is to produce officers with broad-based training in both military and academic subjects designed to serve as a foundation for the future progressive development of officers of the Nigerian Armed Forces.2</div> <div>The mission of NDA similar to NMTC, is to provide each officer cadet with the knowledge, skills and values necessary to meet the requirements of a military officer through Military, Academic and character development.3 Since its establishment, the NDA has contributed towards maintenance of peace in the country and abroad. This research attempts to examine the history of Nigerian Defence Academy from 1964-2006. The research is divided into five chapters. Chapter one gives the general background of the Nigerian Defence Academy. Chapter two discusses the history of Kaduna where NDA is located area of study. Chapter three focuses on the origin of the Nigerian Defence Academy. Chapter four examines training and operational structures of the Nigerian Defence Academy. Finally chapter five provides summary and conclusions of the study.</div> <div><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></div> <p>Up till now, there are few researches on the history of military in Nigeria. Since 1960, when Nigeria attained its independence, it has been contributing in the maintenance of peace in the country. For instance apart from maintaining of unity of Nigeria during the Nigerian Civil War, the Nigerian Military have contributed in conflict resolution in other countries such as Liberia, Congo, and Sierra Leone among others. However, there are limited researches that reveal this achievement. Since 1964, the institution responsible for military training in Nigeria is the Nigerian Defence Academy. Hence, in order to clearly appreciate the achievement of Nigerian Military, it is imperative to first look at the role of military institution such as the Nigerian Defence Academy.</p>\n\nA HISTORY OF THE NIGERIAN DEFENCE ACADEMY 1964-2006<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A HISTORY OF THE NIGERIAN DEFENCE ACADEMY 1964-2006", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This study attempts to reconstruct the history of Yoruba migrants in Dutsin-ma local government from 1976-2015. The essence is to interrogate and explain the forms and dynamics of intergroup relations between the Yoruba migrant group and the host community. The study employed a historical methodology in investigating the forms of intergroup relations in the study area. It discovered that the relationship between Yoruba migrants and the host community has been largely cordial. More so, the Yoruba people have impacted positively in spheres such as the economy, education and infrastructural upliftment of Dutsin-ma town. The study recommends that inter-ethnic cooperation is a strategic necessity for development. Therefore, inter-ethnic mixture should be encouraged. It is hoped that policy makers will find this study useful. </div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1      INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>Yoruba people are seen in every part of the country and in many communities of the world, they are people who have left their homes in South-western Nigeria and have moved to other places to settle either temporarily or permanently. The movement of such people mostly from their places of origin to a new place occurs due to multiple reasons often summed up base on lee Everett “push” and “pull” reasons or factors of migration. Push factors have tended to drive people out in search of better living conditions while pull factors are believed to be socio-economic and political reasons that have attracted them to a particular place for better means of livelihood across the world. Migration is defined by Eisenstadt as the physical transition of individual or group from one society to another. This transition according to him, normally involves abandoning one social setting and entering another and different one. His emphasis is mainly on leaving a whole set of social life and of a person’s previous residential region and establishing a new set of social life in a latter or new region where they migrated,1 such people are generally referred to as migrants. In most cases, migrants play vital roles towards the development of the communities which they settle while in some other cases, the impacts of the migrants can also be negatively felt in the new environments they settled. Because relationship is prone to hiccups due to the fact that sometimes indigenes feel threatened by migrants usually as a result of land tussle or economic struggle over scarce resources. Places like Kano, Minna, Kaduna, Benue, Jos and Nasarawa state are examples of where indigenes have felt threatened and this has led to clash between migrants and host communities. Cases like this have led to security threats and displacement of people. Udo explains that migrants to rural areas do not require special skills to function effectively as farmers or petty traders, he further ascertain that migration leads to the development of rural areas and all exert considerable impact on the economy of the origin of migrant itself.2</div> <div>Among the various ethnic groups that have been active in migration processes across Nigeria for a long period are the Yoruba people who are highly mobile, town dwelling people, who built kingdoms and empires long before they came into contact with the European.3They are among the oldest surviving groups in the forest of the South of Nigeria including the Edo speaking people who have successfully established and maintained vast kingdoms within the forest environments of Nigeria.4</div> <div>Yoruba people in Nigeria, apart from religion affinity, can be said to be liberal that is why they easily go along and settle among other language groups as it is seen in Northern Nigeria. The Yoruba–speaking people of Nigeria are concentrated in Ondo, Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Kwara, Ekiti and Lagos States. While majority of the Yoruba live in Western Nigeria, there are also substantial Yoruba communities in the Republic of Benin and Togo as well as in the United States and United Kingdom.5 The Yoruba share a linguistics homogeneity as well as common traditions and traced their decent from a common ancestor called Oduduwa, who is believed to have established the Ife dynasty.6 The Yoruba were never united under a common government rather Yoruba land consisted of several powerful monarchial states such as Ife, Oyo, Egba and Ijebu etc. However, certain political positions were recognized throughout the whole of Yoruba land, the most important has been the Oni of Ife, who was regarded as the spiritual ruler of all Yoruba and the Alaafin of Oyo who was the political leader of the Yoruba people.7</div>\n\nA HISTORY OF YORUBA MIGRANTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A HISTORY OF YORUBA MIGRANTS", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Violence in general terms has been a cancerous disease that has continued to eat deep into the fabric of our society.

However it is on the bases that this project reconstruct the history of religious violence as it affect the people and government of Kaduna state from 1987 to 2011. It discuss religious violence, its causes and consequences in Kaduna. The researcher concludes by advancing that within the period of study violence has been a recurring phenomenon in the History of Kaduna and also recommend ways or means through which this violence can be ameliorated. </div> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0 Introduction                             </strong></div> <div>     Religious violence has its roots deep in the history of Kaduna State. As a state, Kaduna came into being in 1987 and in the same year religious violence erupted. Historically, Kaduna was part of Northern region in the three (3) regional structures of 1954. Present day Kaduna was the capital of Northern region when Nigeria was restructured into twelve (12) State on 27thMay 1967. It was named North Central State and later changed to Kaduna State in 1976. The old Kaduna had two provinces, Katsina and Zaria. On 23rd September, 1987 the state was split into two, Katsina province became a new state named Katsina state, while Zaria retained the name Kaduna.1 The name Kaduna is derived from the Hausa word “KADA” meaning crocodile, and Kaduna is the plural word for crocodile. Main towns in Kaduna are Kaduna (city capital), Zaria, Kagoro, Kafachan, Kachia and Zonkwa. Kaduna State consist of twenty-three (23) different local government areas and there are: Birnin, Gwari, Chikun. Giwa, Igabi, Ikara, Jaba, Jema's, Kachia, Kaduna North, Kaduna South, Kagarko, Kajuru, Kubau, Kudan, Lere, Makarfi, Sabon Gari, Sanga, Soba, Zangon Kataf and Zaria Local Government Areas. There are fifty-seven (57) different langue spoken in Kaduna which includes Acipa in  Eastern Birnin Gwari LGA, Amo in Saminaka LGA, Ashe Kachia in LGA, Aten in Jema'a LGA, Atsam in Kachia LGA, Ayu in Jema'a LGA, Bacama in Northeast of Kaduna town, Begbere-Ejar in Kachia LGA, Berom in Jema'a LGA, Bina in Saminaka LGA, Cinda-Regi-Tiyal in Birnin Gwari LGA, Cori in Jema'a LGA, Doka in Kachia LGA, Dungu in Saminaka LGA, Gbagyi in Kachia LGA, Gbari Gbiri-Niragu in Saminaka LGA, Gwandara in Kaduna State, Kachia LGA, Ham in Kachia and Jema'a LGA's, Hausa Idon in Kachia LGA, Idun in Jema'a LGA, Iku-Gora-Ankwa in Kachia LGA, Ikulu in Kachia LGA, Irigwe in Saminaka LGA, Izere in Jema'a LGA, Jere in Saminaka LGA, Jju in Kachia and Jema'a LGA's, Kadara in Kachia LGA, Kagoma in Jema'a LGA, Kaivi in Saminaka LGA, Kamantan in Kachia LGA, Kaningkon-Nindem in Jema'a LGA, Kanufi in Jema'a LGA, Kinuku in Saminaka LGA, Kono in Saminaka LGA, Kurama in Saminaka and Ikara LGA's, Kuturmi in Kachia LGA, Mada in Jema'a LGA, Mala in Saminaka LGA, Nandu-Tari in Jema'a LGA, Ningye in Jema'a LGA, Ninzam in Jema'a LGA, Nkwak in Birnin Gwari LGA, Numana-Nunku-Gwantu-Numbu in Jema'a LGA, Piti in Saminaka LGA, Pongu Small Numbers In Kaduna Town, Ruma in Saminaka LGA, Shamang in Kachia and Jama'a LGAs, Shama-Sambuga in Kaduna State, Birnin Gwari LGA, Sheni in Saminaka LGA, Surubu in Saminaka LGA, Tumi in Saminaka LGA, Tyap in Kachia, Saminaka, and Jema'a LGA's, Vono in Saminaka LGA, Yeskwa in Jema'a LGA, Zhire in Kachia And Jama'a LGA, but Gbari and Hausa are the major ones.2</div>      The issue of religious violence gained ascendancy and became aggravated in Kaduna State after the state was created in 1987. Religious violence in Kaduna State began in 1987 when there was a clash between Muslim and Christian Students during the observation of the annual evangelical week of fellowship of Christian Students (FCS). The violence started at the College of Education in Kafanchan and later spread to Zaria, Kaduna and Katsina.3 Between 1988 and 2011, there were several cases of religious clashes in Kaduna State in which over 50,000 lives were lost. Over one million people were internally displaced and billions of naira lost.4 The persistence of this crisis ignites scholarly interrogation. This research work therefore reconstructs the history of religious violence in Kaduna State. From 1987 up to 2011 several religious violence occurred in the State, most of these violence emerged from disagreements either between students or youths in the society and later exploded to clashes between Christians and Muslims in the State leading to losses in lives and property.</div>\n\nA HISTORY OF RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A HISTORY OF RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE", "id": 60}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Education is the bedrock and key to any nation’s national development.

Therefore, this project work sets to analyze and explore the historical and educational reasons behind the History and establishment of Western Education in Dutsin-Ma, Katsina State with particular reference to Dutsin-Ma Town and its environs, as the study is from 1976 – 2015.  Thus, efficient method of research was applied to come up with a reliable result, in the form of conducting interviews with resource persons, as well as consulting newspapers, magazines, archival and government documents, internet among others. Consequently, all the necessary measures and proper solutions to all the stakeholders are provided in the recommendation section.</div> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1  </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>The role of education in the development and transformation of human societies all over the world in the course of history cannot be overemphasized. This is because it is the wheel and hub which have propelled development and transformed the world to in all spheres. Education is important and central for societal development. Education has been the force behind the progress of all cultures and civilizations. However, western style of education came to “Ma” in the 20th century. This led to series of changes and development that transformed the society of “Ma”, even though it has its own limitations.</div> <div>The introduction of Western style of education in Nigeria with the arrival of Wesleyan Christian Missionaries in Badagry in 1842.[i]  It played an active role in the provision of formal education for the people. Between 1842 and 1914,[ii]about ten different Christian missions arrived in Nigeria, and began intensive missionary and educational work. Schools were built for the purpose of disseminating education and conversion of people to Christianity. The missions began to struggle for pupils/members such that there was a proliferation of primary schools established by different missions. The education received was limited to 4Rs i.e reading, writing, arithmetic and religion.[iii] This new missionary education prepared the recipient for new job opportunities in colonial service such as teachers, clerks, messenger and interpreters. Emphasis was placed on character training, most of the missions established primary schools with little emphasis laid on secondary and higher education, at the initial stage.[iv]</div> <div>Before 1940, Western education spread in schools through organized learning programs. Informal education is the learning which occurs outside the school programs in the south. Western education reached the northern part of the country when a missionary school was established at Lokoja in 1865. In 1865 the Bishop Crowther LGA Primary School was established in Lokoja, Kogi State by the Anglican missionary. It was then extended to other parts of northern states.[v]</div> <div>Following the emergence of Katsina Kingdom in the 15th century, the capital was noted as a citadel of learning. This development is associated with the introduction of Islam in West Africa around the 14th century or much earlier. However, according to some oral traditions and Henry Barth, Katsina Kingdom came into being during the early part of 13th century with a ruling dynasty at Abuttai (when the seat of power was at Abuttai) where Katsina is presently situated.[vi] Thus the history of Katsina Kingdom can be fully understood when we look at the coming of Islam in Katsina even though the precise date of it is not known i.e. when Islam was first introduced.[vii].</div> </div>\n\nA HISTORY OF WESTERN EDUCATION IN DUTSIN-MA TOWN, 1976 TO 2015<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A HISTORY OF WESTERN EDUCATION IN DUTSIN-MA TOWN, 1976 TO 2015", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This study has examined the history of Kaduna State Agricultural Development Project (KADP) in Kaduna State. The study found out that the activities of KADP have impact on lives of the Kaduna State indigenous farmers who were known to be traditional farmers. They heavily relied on subsistence farming for a couple of centuries. However, the emergence of the KADP in 1987 brought more agricultural changes in their lives as it introduced new agricultural programmes that improved the harvest yields in the area. More interestingly by the year 2000, the KADP programmes have improved the standard of living as well as general socio-economic activities of the agrarian communities in Kaduna State.However, this development was mainly achieved due to the involvement of other agricultural-based governmental and non-governmental organisations like The Federal Government of Nigeria, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Zaria, Institute of Agricultural Research and West African Agricultural Productivity Programme among others.</div> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>GENERAL BACKROUND</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>            Without any doubt, agriculture is one of the necessities for the growth and development of any particular country. This is because agriculture has some links with other sectors like the industrial sector and also peoples economic growth and development. However, agriculture involves the cultivation of land, raising and rearing of animals for the purpose of food for man, feed for animals and raw materials for industries. Agriculture involves cropping, livestock, forestry and fishing, processing and marketing of these agricultural products. Broadly, agriculture can be classified as crop production, livestock, forestry and fishing. Thus, the importance of agriculture in society goes beyond it being a source of food and raw materials for industries to provision of job opportunities and a source of foreign exchange. However, agricultural extension was ascribed by the colonial government as one of the important activities for economic take off in Nigeria.</div> <div>Agriculture is the mostly widespread activity, it serves as a means of livelihood for more than quarter of mankind, raw material for factories, which human beings depend upon and for feeding the agro allied industries. The surplus is sold to purchase other necessities of life such as clothes, can food, electric cookers, stoves, refrigerator, cables, satellite, television sets and radio sets among others. Many industries will shut down without agriculture. Despite the work of science and technology, the world is a dead place without food.1</div> <div>Agricultural development through the adoption of new farm input, technological knowhow, rural roads facilities. Rural electrification enhances increase in food production, provide employment, obviate rural urban drift as well as improve standard of living of the rural populace and social status. Government strategies to increase farm income of the rural farmers is designed in such a way that farmers input are scientifically and technologically improved to bring about greater output. Before the 1960s, Nigeria former regional governments namely the North, West, East, and Mid­-west, undertook different policies and specialization method of producing different crops within their territorial bound. This has shown that before the advent of the “oil boom”, the major foreign exchange earner for Nigeria was the sale of agricultural products such as cocoa, groundnut, cotton, coffee, rubber, palm oil and soya beans. But it was reported that even though the Federal Government currently derives most of its foreign exchange from petroleum, the earnings from agricultural export could still be much higher if appropriate and sustained policies are applied to the sector.2</div> In Nigeria, the year 1960-68 marked the period of agricultural development, to accelerate food production, generate foreign exchange and increase country’s balance of trade in the international market, projects were empowered to distribute seed, establishing cooperative farmers association and plantation units, provides extension farm centre, introduce modern farming techniques, industries for processing agricultural produce such as cotton, groundnut, maize, and palm oil. The second period of agricultural was between the years 1970-1980, was a period of prosperity and oil boom, agricultural development constraints have taken myriad dimensions ranging from physical problems such as lack of incentive, poor return, low yield of output, lack of fertilizer. Other problems include erratic rainfall, long unset and short upset of rain drought. There were also economic problems such as lack of capital and good transport and communication network, very little or no incentive to farmers to produce more, poor marketing/low pricing problems of agricultural productivity. <br/></div>\n\nA HISTORY OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, 1987 – 2000<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A HISTORY OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, 1987 – 2000", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This research is an attempt to reconstruct the History of Indigenous Industries under Colonial Rule in Daura District 1903-1960.

Other economics activities practiced in the area included domestication of animal, fishing, indigenous industries i.e pottery, craft, cloth weaving, cloth dyeing and beating and engagement in small scale enterprise.1</div> <div>Long before the advent of colonial administration, indigenous technology especially blacksmith, cloth weaving, pottery, hand craft, gasket making, butchering, thread making <em>(Kadi)</em> and textile industries were flourishing profession among the people of Daura. It was evident that metal work had advanced before the advent of colonial rule that revolutionalised trade and export of the economy of Daura particularly in the second half of the 19th century.</div> <div>However, these indigenous industries began to decline during the colonial period because of the policies of the colonial government in Daura District toward indigenous technology which was also applicable to the whole country.

The society of Zaria city during pre-colonial period had developed two forms of educational systems, Islamic education and traditional education. In a traditional educational system, elderly members of the society impart knowledge and skills to the younger members of the society both at home and outside the home while Islamic education was conducted in a formal way where classes were held. Prior to the advent of British colonial rule and western education in Zaria, most parents denied their women the right to education due to socio-cultural belief and economic poverty. The year 1976 saw  massive development of women education in Zaria city due to encouraging parent allowing their children to go to school free for all women, building of schools and the establishment of women association ‘Women in Politics’ in 1976 a driving factor to the development of women education in Zaria city. Therefore the development of women education brought somanyimpac to the society which include the rise of women activist like Haj GamboSawaba, HajiaRakiya Musa.

Thus the chapter provides the aim and objectives of the study and as well as the methodology the researcher has used in carrying out this research work. It also contributes to knowledge generally. The chapter also examine the geography of Zaria city and its actual foundation as both a political and commercial capital as wellas an emirate.</div> <div>Zaria city is situated in Zaria LGarea of Kaduna state. It is also one of the emirates of the Sokotocaliphate. The earliest inhabitants of the city were the hausa.Today the area is populated with different ethnic groups i.e. nupe, Yoruba who mostly came to the city for the seek of knowledge during the 19th century jihad and some were there for trade. The area is blessed with resources like fertile land and other natural resources which provide opportunities for human habitation. Majority of the people in the area were farmers and the staple crops grown include yam, guinea corn, maize, beans rice etc. they practice subsistence farming using local farm imputes. Other economic activities practice in the area included domestication of animals, local industries (crafts), and engagement in small scale enterprise.[ii]This research attempt to examine the development of women education in Zaria city 1976-2006. For a much understanding of this research work there will be need to first examine the socio-political and economic organisation of the area and then go further to examine the nature of indigenous education in Zaria city before the advent of colonial rule. The research also examines the colonial rule and the advent of western education, as well as the development of women education shall also be examined. The research goes forward to assess the development of women education in Zaria city, this will be backed up by raising issues like early marriage, poverty, insurgency etc. and how those problems were overcame in Zaria city prior to the women educational development. At last the research comes to examine the relative contributions of women to economic, political and social development in Zaria city. The reason that led to the witness and growth of women embarked in education during the period of study shall also be examined. The research is divided into five chapters. Chapter one gives thegeneral background of the study. Chapter two deals with the study area and socio-political formation. Chapter three focuses on women education before colonial rule and the advent of western education.

Hence, the phenomenon of migration and intergroup relations has remained inevitable overtime.1 This is because no community or society lives in isolation, and no community is self-sufficient in both production and consumption of goods and services by necessity of luxury.2 In like manner, the Nigerian societies, even before colonial period, were considered as neighbors as a result of migration and inter-group relations.3In other words, various scholars who studied migration provide different explanations on the concept. Abdulwahab,4 Amin,5 Crisp,6 Russell,7 Ahmed,8 Bako,9 and so many others have made reference and relate it to the movement of people of different categories and tribe such as workers, laborers, merchants, scholars, etc. from one village, town, city, area, geographical zone, state, country and continent to another.</div> <div>For centuries, several groups of migrants have been migrating to Katsina metropolis for various reasons that hinge on either push or pull factors. A significant feature that characterized the arrival of these migrant groups is the promotion of inter-group relations, a feature that was accelerated in the colonial and post-colonial period; especially with the colonial conquest of Katsina in 1903, the 1914 amalgamation, the independence of Nigeria in 1960, the post-civil war period (1970) and the creation of the state in 1981. These migrants are from both within and outside Nigeria. Thus over the years the migrants have form sizable communities and have been displaying visible impact on the different aspects of the Katsina economic and social life through interactions with the host community.10</div> <div>In the contemporary Nigerian society, it is generally accepted that the Igbo are synonymous with business. A scholar of the Igbo extraction has even termed the Igbo “a migration race” a phenomenon he asserted has an economic undertone. However, studies have revealed that the trend of economically motivated migration became common among the Igbo at the beginning of the 20th century and has remained their trade. The trend developed throughout the colonial period and led to the emergence of migrant Igbo in Katsina metropolis whose economic activities has had effects on the socio-economic development of Katsina during the period of our study (1987-2015). In like manner, Igbo presence in many part of the country has become so pronounced that in some cases, they dominate economic activities in the societies they reside and work. There is also a popular assertion in Nigeria that any society in Nigeria that does not have Igbo presence finds it difficult to make economic progress.</div>\n\nTHE IGBO FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DUTSIN-MA TOWN, 1976-2015<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IGBO FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DUTSIN-MA TOWN, 1976-2015", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1: Introduction:</strong></p> <p>The traditional title of Magajingari is used only in some part of Hausa land such as Sokoto, Katsina, Kano and Zamfara States1.

Ankpa local Government Area has a population of 267,353 according to the 2006 National census.2 Igala is the main ethnic group but has equally absorbed other ethnic groups such as the Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, Agatu and migarant Fulani.3</div> <div>The main religions of the inhabitant are Islam, Christianity and traditional religion. The name Ankpa originated from the Red Scenery called ‘‘EKPA’’ meaning ‘‘RED’’ later turned to be known and called Ankwa by the Hausa migrant and Ankpa by the Colonial masters.4 From the earliest, both religions adopted a gradual, quietist attitude towards the culture of the people which saw them integrate, intermingle and contribute immensely to the development of the society.5 Muslims, Christians and traditional religion engage themselves in activities that promote good understanding between them.6 The attitude of flexible engagement with others was generally effective in Ankpa Local Government Area because all the religions presented non-violently and largely without compulsion.7 Through the positive religious activities which include marriage ceremonies, festivals and funerals are attended by other followers of religions depending on interest and commitment.8</div> <div>Before the coming of Islam and Christianity in the 19th century to Ankpa Local Government Area the inhabitant are traditionalists. People travel from other areas like Imane, Olamoboro, Omala and Enjema to Ankpa to a water deity called ‘‘Ojaji’’ meaning (head of a River) which they believe to solve their problems like diseases, witchcraft and other spiritual attack in the communities.9 In Ankpa Local Government Area, the activity between the followers of these religions is cordial but sometimes crises do occur between them. They are all duty bound to serve the community when a call for such work arises. In this way, the people interact cordially together. Islam and Christianity have played a very important role in the History of the people and the coming of both religions to the area has changed the pattern of living in the area by bringing social changes and positive transformation to the people.10</div> <div><strong>1.1</strong>         <strong>Statement of the Research Problem</strong></div> <div>The basic factor that necessitated this research is to examine the activities of the three major religions of Igala people of Ankpa Local Government Area of Kogi from 1979 to 1992. The researcher will establish the transformation that occurs among the religions and the coming of Islam and Christianity to the area within the period of this study and the level of its consciousness among the people. </div>                                                          \n\nA HISTORY OF MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN ACTIVITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A HISTORY OF MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN ACTIVITIES", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p> <p>This is the fact that under proper management of economic policies, multinational corporations are the bed rock for developing countries and national integration as it provide greater opportunities by exploration and discovery of our major mineral resources were made possible by the MNCS(Multinational Corporations).  And also, our major transport networks were mostly developed by the corporations which provides development in many countries.
