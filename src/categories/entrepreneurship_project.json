In Nigeria, the total economic output of SMEs is about 50 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), and this sector employs in excess of 60 per cent of the total labour force (ISSER, 1999). Thus, SMEs form a large proportion of the firm tissue in Nigeria. One of the most important problems confronting SMEs concerns the issue of financing.</p> <p>Financing is necessary to help SMEs set up and expand their operations, develop new products, and invest in new staff or production facilities. Many small businesses start out as an idea from one or two people, who invest their own money and probably turn to family and friends for financial help in return for a share in the business. But if they are successful, there comes a time when they need further funds to expand or innovate further. Some SMEs often run into problems, because they find it much harder to obtain financing from banks, capital markets or other suppliers of credit.</p> <p>Almost every company we know of began as an SME. Vodafone as we know it today was once a little spin-off from Racal; Hewlett-Packard started in a little wood shack; Google was begun by a couple of young kids who thought they had a good idea; even Volkswagen at one point was just a little car maker in Germany (as opposed to being a giant small car maker globally) (Lukacs, 2005)</p> <p>Microsoft may be a software giant today, but it started off in typical SME fashion, as a dream developed by a young student with the help of family and friends. Only when Bill Gates and his colleagues had a saleable product were they able to take it to the marketplace and look for investment from more traditional sources (Amissah, 2009).</p> <p>2</p> <p>The growth of SMEs has been hampered by the lack of adequate knowledge and a well structured financial market for the mobilization of capital. The role of finance has been viewed as a critical element for the development of SMEs (Cook and Nixson, 2000).</p> <p>Recently, various funds have been setup to benefit SMEs but statistics provided by fund managers show that a disproportionate number of applicants have not been successful at accessing funding (Boateng, 2010).The need to explore alternative means of raising capital for business growth cannot be over emphasized. One of the innovative ways to raise funds for the growth of SMEs is venture capital.</p> <p>Venture capital is an investment in a start-up or growing SME that is perceived to have excellent growth prospects. Venture capitalists raise and manage funds which are a pool of money raised from both public and private investors. Venture capitalists identify entrepreneurs with promising new ideas and assist with funding and professional management.</p> <p>Venture capital investments provide the needed cash in form of equity for companies to develop technologies and products which, in turn, generate jobs and taxes that keep Nigeria competitive. The objective is to generate sufficient long-term capital gains from the investors and the venture capitalists. Venture capital assists investors to access equity capital to finance expansion of business while maintaining control. The expertise and extensive relationships of the venture capitalist through its network add value to the company and increase credibility with customers, and finally, the company gain access to the venture capitalist knowledge in accounting, budgeting, computer systems, and back-office operations. (Amissah, 2009)</p> <p>3</p> <p>In venture capital financing agreement the venture capital firm will provide financing to enable a business to undertake a project and in return the venture capital company gets an ownership stake in the business (Boateng, 2010)</p> <p>Limited data exist on venture capital as an alternative source for funds for SMEs.</p> <p>Therefore a research was made to gather inform the SME sector to know about the impact of venture capital in the growth of its</p> <p>business.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The SME sector constitutes in excess of 90% of the economy of the country. The need to provide affordable credit over a reasonable period for this sector cannot be over emphasized. SMEs, if properly structured and capitalized have the potential to grow and spearhead accelerated growth of this economy into a middle income status (Venture Capital Nigeria, 2008)</p> <p>SMEs still in Nigeria have been faced with liquidity and financing challenges leading to business failures under production Industrial disputes and sometimes closures by regulatory authorities.</p> <p>Just as it has been a great concern to all and sundry to promote the welfare</p> <p>of SMEs, it has also been a great cause of concern to all, the fact that the vital sub-sector has fallen short of expectation. The situation is more disturbing and worrying when compared with what other developing and developed countries have been able to achieve with their SMEs.</p> <p>4</p> <p>Their success is determined by their financing needs and the action of investors. SME financing needs reflect their operational requirements, while the action of investors depends on their risk perception and the attractiveness of alternative investment (which affects their willingness to invest). Government borrowing, the general economic climate, availability of collateral, quality of SME record keeping, and SME investor relations skills affect the way in which this challenge is managed</p> <p>Additionally many non-financial constraints inhibit the success of such enterprises. SME owners are reluctant to be transparent or open up involvement of their businesses to outsiders. They seem to be unaware of or oblivious to the obligations and responsibilities they have toward capital providers, and the need to acquire or seek support for technical services like accounting, management, marketing, strategy development and establishment of business linkages. Management and support services are perceived to be cost prohibitive and non-value adding</p> <p>Unfortunately since there is a dearth of long term investment funds for SMEs (as a consequence of the banks and securities markets shying away from the high risk investments in these sectors, it has became imperative for the Government to set up a scheme that will provide long term funding for the high risk investment needs of the SME sector. This has led to the establishment of Venture capital fund under the Venture Capital Trust Fund Act, 2004 (Act 680), to provide capital to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and to promote Venture Capital industry in Nigeria.(Venture Capital Nigeria,2008)</p> <p>Does Elsa Foods know of venture capital funds? Has it ever applied for funding from Venture Capital organisations? What motivated the organisation to go for venture 5</p> <p>capital funds? What benefits have choked from sourcing funds from venture capital managers? This study seeks to provide answers to these questions.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Aim/Objectives</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this research is to examine the impact of Venture Capital</p> <p>Financing on SME‟s.

Although there are different kinds of business enterprises that female and male can go into, often times, some businesses are regarded as more suitable for one sex and not the other. This means that there are some gender considerations in the choice of business one goes into and, by extension, in entrepreneurship development.</p> <p>Apparently, gender attitudes and behaviours may have positive or negative effect on entrepreneurship development in a society or economy.</p> <p>This research work therefore intends to take a critical look at gender considerations as they affect entrepreneurship development with particular reference to Northern Nigeria in general, using Oju Printing Press Limited Kaduna, Kaduna South Local Government area as a case study, and also to suggest the possible solutions to indentified problems and give recommendations where necessary.                            </p> <p>1.2       <strong>STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH  PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Entrepreneurship has generally been recognized as a good medium or strategy for economic development of an individual, a community and a nation. It is also a known fact that some gender considerations are often used in the choice of business or even the decision to go into business. For example, some businesses are regarded as more suitable to men than women. The question here is, is this the right approach to economic development through entrepreneurship? Of what effect is this approach to entrepreneurship development?</p> <p>These and other questions are what this research work intends to find answers to, and, if possible make recommendations where possible.</p> <p>1.3       <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to determine the relationship  between the gender and entrepreneurship development in Northern Nigeria, also to study some of the gender considerations in entrepreneurship development and its impact on economic development effort in Nigeria particularly Northern Nigeria. The study specifically hopes to suggest possible solutions to any gender related impediments to entrepreneurship development.</p> <p>1.4       <strong>STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following hypothesis has been formulated to serve as a guide for the study.</p> <p>H0:    That gender considerations have no significant effect on entrepreneurship development in Northern Nigeria.</p> <p>H1: That gender considerations, have significant effect on entrepreneurship development in Northern Nigeria.</p> <p>1.5       <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The findings of this study will provide a guide for any me on the establishment of a business in Nigeria. This study will help me ensure a proper approach to gender considerations in the decision and to any individual that want to establish a business (entrepreneur) in order to achieve maximum profit and productivity.</p> <p>1.6       <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research work will concentrate on gender considerations and entrepreneurship development in Northern Nigeria. The scope is limited to Oju Printing Press Nigeria Limited, Kaduna South, the management, staff and other employees of the organization.</p> <p>1.7       <strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the course of this study many problems were encountered. Collection of relevant data was a problem because what the organization regard to their “secret”.</p> <p>Other limitations of the research include cost of visiting the organization to see the people necessary to get the relevant information. Sometime the staff concerned may not be on seat.</p> <p>Time was another limiting factor faced by the researcher. A researcher will have to share the limited time.</p> <p>1.8       <strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Oju Printing Press Limited is a small-scale organization which employed over Two Hundred and Fifty (250) workers made of different categories like Managers, Supervisors, Intermediate and Junior workers.

The researcher study was on the growth of entrepreneurship education and a small scale business woman in Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State. In carrying out the study a sample size of 800 questionnaires were used but only 650 questionnaires were used retrieved and stratified, random sampling technique was used. Research questions were developed and two hypothesis were formulated and tested but based on the results, alternate hypothesis were accepted.It is advised that this work is limited to only Emohua local Government Area and so may not be advisable to draw a general conclusion for Nigeria.This study is significant in so many ways that will help protect entrepreneur’s in Nigeria and small business holder women in Emohua Local Government Area. It will also, further broaden their knowledge and understanding on entrepreneurship education and small business holder growth.</p>\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION AND THE GROWTH OF SMALL HOLDERS BUSINESS.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION AND THE GROWTH OF SMALL HOLDERS BUSINESS.", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     Introduction</strong></p> <p>An appraisal of small scale industries in employment creation in Nigeria: A study of Onitsha metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.1     Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Many scholars have written widely on small scale industries and its potency to generate employment, thus, underscoring the quintessence, significance and relevance of this sub-sector in the development of any given economy. The experience of developed economies in relation to the roles played by small scale industries buttresses the fact that the importance of entrepreneurship cannot be over emphasized especially among the developing countries. In order to highlight its significance in relation to the growth and development of a given economy, small scale industries have been variously referred to as a “source of employment generation”. This is because small scale industrial activities have been found to be capable of making positive impacts on the economy of a nation and the quality of life of the people (Adejumo 2000). Studies have established its positive relationship with stimulation of economic growth; employment generation; and empowerment of the disadvantaged segments of the population, which include women and the poor (Olurermi and Gbenga, 2011; Thomas and Muller,2000; Reynolds, 1987).</p> <p>          Nigeria as a country has numerous business and investment potentials due to the abundant, vibrant and dynamic human and natural resources it possesses. Tapping these recourses requires the ability to indentify potentially useful and economically viable fields of endeavors. Nigerians have made their marks in diverse fields such as science, technology, academics, business and entertainment.</p> <p>          Thus, small scale industries activities and innovative ingenuity in Nigeria have developed enterprises in the following areas, agricultural/agro-allied activities where there are foodstuffs, restaurants, fast food vending etc. in the area of information and telecom business, there are manufacturing and repairs of GSM accessories and the printing and setting of recharge cards. In hospitality and tourism business, there are hotels, accommodation, resorts centers, films and home video production; in oil and gas business, there are construction and maintenance of pipelines, drilling, refining bye products. In the area of environment and waste management business, there is refuse collection/disposal, recycle plant and drainage/sewage construction job. In the area of financial banking services, there are banking, insurance and stock trading. In engineering and fabrication work, there are machines and tools fabrications there is also the building and construction, where there are plan and design services and material sourcing (Agbeze, 2012)</p> <p>          These human and natural resources notwithstanding, Nigeria are still one of the poorest countries in the world and Africa despite its alleged strong economic growth. Chukwubuikem (2008) notes that youth’s full-time unemployment rate for 2006-2008 was 55.9 percent, 4 times higher (Salami, 2011). Many other industrial sub-sectors to such a vibrant one that they have been able to reduce to the barest minimum their unemployment and poverty level because of the immense contribution of the sub-sector to their economic growth and development but such cannot be said of Nigeria (Onugu, 2005). In respect of the above sad and deplorable situation, the government has done little to reduce the misery and frustrations of the citizen. This has foisted a state of hopelessness on majority of young people who have resorted to any means including crime to succeed in life. They resort to vices because they are not gainfully engaged. In other words, they are unemployed; unemployed, not because they lack the qualification but because the system has been crippled politically economically, socio-culturally and even religiously. People especially youths and graduates became displaced economically (Kuratko, 2009), a situation that clearly negates the millennium development goals for 2015, I and II: to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and to halve the proportion of people suffering from hunger respectively.</p> <p>          The dexterity with which hunger and poverty have devastated lives and future ambition of youths especially graduates in Nigeria, have led to scholars prescribing small scale industries development as the permanent cure for extreme hunger and poverty necessitated as one of the external forces that influence the development of small scale industries. The great need for small scale industries development in Nigeria today, more than ever, is necessitated by the rate of unemployment and its effect on both the people and the nation and the need for small and medium enterprises.</p> <p>          In spite of the fact that small scale industries development has been regarded as the bulwark for employment generation and technological development in Nigeria, the sector nevertheless has had its own fair share of neglect with concomitant unpleasant impacts on the economy against this backdrop. Entrepreneurship when and if gallantly developed in Nigeria will take its pride of place in fuelling unemployment and thus generating employment among Nigerian youths especially the graduates and once again, place the economy on a proper footing.</p> <p>          It is in this respect that this paper seeks to investigate the connection between small scale industries and employment generation in Nigeria; assessing the level of unemployment in Nigeria and how far entrepreneurship has thrived, and also examines the major problems of entrepreneurship and thus proposing some plausible strategies that can promote effective small scale industries that will help quell unemployment and thus generate employment for the Nigerians youths especially. Based on the above background, the study intends to investigate the role of entrepreneurial development in unemployment reduction in Nigeria with particular reference to Onitsha metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is a country with numerous business and investment potentials due to the abundant vibrant and dynamic human and natural resources it possesses. As good as the foregoing sounds, Nigeria continues to experience its share of social, economic and political upheavals which have often stunted its growth and development into the regional economic power that it strives to attain. Nigeria has a relative high rate of violent crimes (Onurubiko, 2009). The fact is that the Nigeria is becoming hostile to investment due especially to lack of steady and sustainable power supply/energy crises in spite of the various attempts are reviving this sector landing to firms depending on generators for their operation whose cost of buying, fueling and maintenance are high, thereby increasing the cost of operation in Nigeria.</p> <p>          Besides, high and multiple levies and taxations being paid by these companies, energy crises have combined to make the cost of doing business in Nigeria to be very exorbitant when the industries and factories closed shops or relocated to a friendlier economic environment, workers were laid off and prospects of recruiting new ones were dashed. All these exacerbated the crisis of youth unemployment in the labour market (Adeloye, 2010; Onifade, 2011). Therefore this research work intends to investigate the role of entrepreneurship development in unemployment reduction in Nigeria with particular reference to Awka, Anambra state.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>          The study intends to achieve the following objectives:</p> <ol><li>To determine the role of small scale industries in unemployment reduction in Nigeria.</li> <li>To determine if government has a key role to play in ensuring that small scale industries help in quelling unemployment.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>          The following research questions were formulated to guide the direction of this research work.</p> <ol><li>Does small scale industries development help in unemployment reduction in Nigeria?</li> <li>Do government have a key role to play in ensuring that small scale industries development help in quelling unemployment.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5     Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>          The hypothesis formulated for this research study include hypothesis one</p> <p><strong>H0:</strong> There is no significant relationship between small scale industries and unemployment reduction in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Hi:    </strong>There is significant relationship between small scale industries and unemployment reduction in Nigeria.</p> <p>Hypothesis Two</p> <p><strong>H0:   </strong>Government has no key role to play in ensuring that small scale industries help in quelling unemployment.</p> <p><strong>Hi:    </strong>Government has a key role to play in ensuring that small scale industries help in quelling unemployment.</p> <p><strong>1.6     Scope and Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>          The study focuses on entrepreneurship development as a panacea for unemployment reduction in Nigeria. The economic potentials of entrepreneurship shall also be explained as well as the benefit explained with particular reference to residence of Onitsha metropolis.</p> <p>          The limitations the researcher encountered during the survey are time constraint, lack of finance, respondent’s attitudes andtransportation constraints.</p> <p><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> Research of this nature requires sufficient time for the execution. But in the case of this project, the allotted time was quite insufficient. In this regard, the researcher was under pressure throughout the while work in order to meet the deadline.</p> <p><strong>Respondents Attitude:</strong> Some of the respondents appeared to be biased in their response and the greater percentage of the bias is during peak sales periods when the respondents had little or no time for non business discussion.</p> <p><strong>Finance:</strong> Finance has always been the pilot around which the success of any research revolves. In this case, the researcher was constrained financially because the researcher had a little stipend from the guardian.</p> <p><strong>Transportation:</strong> Due to the bad roads the researcher find it difficult to access the respondents.</p> <p><strong>Bureaucracy:</strong> This is one of the impediments of this research when the researcher visited the enterprise under study to make certain investigations; the authorities involved never gave him a free hand to make such investigations.</p> <p>          Finally, it is worthy to note that in spite of all these limitations, the researcher was able to cover meaningful the scope of the study.</p> <p><strong>1.7     Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>          It is worthwhile to lay great emphasis on the significance of this study target groups and potential recipients showing how it will add knowledge, contribute to knowledge or aid practice. Hence, this study will be indispensable to many. To the entire Nigerian populace, this study will broadly enlighten them on the concept of entrepreneurship and how small industries development brings about unemployment reduction in Nigeria scale.</p> <p>          Also, the Nigerian government is not left out. This promising research piece will clearly show the public authorities and government officials how to effectively develop small scale industries as they have been identified as engine of economic growth and development hereby providing employment for the teeming unemployed youth. The study will help the policy makers to recognize the importance of small scale industries in the provision of employment to the labour force for economic development. This shall further guide them to make trade policies to enhance the performance of small scale industries as regards their activities to accommodate mushrooming population that is attributed to high birth and fertility rates as well as rural urban migration within the country.</p> <p>          Also, to students and other scholars where intend to widen their knowledge in the study of the small scale industries development as a panacea for unemployment reduction, this study shall be a basis of reference since it focuses on the cause of the establishments, how the unique characteristics of the industries have facilitated their role in the provision of employment undertaken to harness their activities and how their activities contributes to economic growth and development.</p> <p><strong>1.8     Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Unemployment:</strong> Unemployment refers to a situation where people who are willing and capable of working are unable to find suitable paid employment.</p> <p><strong>Entrepreneurship:</strong> This is the willingness and ability of an individual to identify and successfully carry out investment opportunities in and environment.</p> <p><strong>Development:</strong> This means new stage or event, new product or invention.

However, inconsistencies in the socio-economic policies of successive governments contributed to the increase in unemployment and poverty. During this period, many workers were laid off, and early retirement of employees due to some shaky government policies.</p> <p>Nigeria as a developing country is improving in economic sectors such as science, technology, sports, entertainment, and agriculture. Innovative end- products are derived from each of this sectors-foodstuff from agriculture, in the area of technology we have phones/laptops repair, sales of recharge cards, in engineering we have cases of road construction, in tourism we have the preservation of our culture and the list continues. Notwithstanding all these human and material resources Nigeria is blessed with, it is still referred to as one of the poorest countries in sub-Sahara Africa (Salami,2011 p:10). It is obvious on the way some countries have encouraged the entrepreneur sector, thus reducing the level of unemployment to the barest minimum, but that cannot be said of Nigeria. As the government has done little or nothing to bring a lasting solution to this problem; thus leading to increase in crime and other vices just to meet ends needs.</p> <p>The role of entrepreneurship in the curbing of unemployment, unstable economic growth and development cannot be emphasized. The current state of the global world brings entrepreneurship to a fore. Countries practicing capitalism makes the current state of the economy glaring that private ownership of business is a way forward. The youths are unemployed not because they don’t have the qualifications; but because politically, economically and even religiously the systems are paralyzed (Kuratko, 2009).</p> <p>Entrepreneurship constitutes immensely to the social, economic, financial and otherwise development of any country. Due to this, successive governments have tried to revive this sector while current governments seem more serious; and that is why they saddled some agencies with the responsibility of achieving this-agencies like: National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP), National Directorate of Employment (NDE), etc. the truth still remains that for a country to grow in all ramifications, it must have strong private partners who involve in wealth creation, backed with great skills. (Akpomi ,2009 p:156).</p> <p>It is crystal clear that entrepreneurship development enhances the sustainable development of a country, the sector has been neglected and of cause, this has an effect on the economy. Bearing the aforementioned in mind, entrepreneurship if given the needed attention it requires will place Nigeria on the right pedestal nationally and internationally.</p> <p>This study is aimed at presenting entrepreneurship as a panacea to current economic challenges facing Nigeria, most especially the high level of unemployment.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>It is quite disheartening on how the teeming population of unemployed graduates of Nigeria keeps increasing on a daily basis. There are no white collar jobs and this is what every Nigerian graduate looks up to after his national youth service (NYSC).</p> <p>Due to this, some of resorted to very dubious means of making money, with cases of arm robbery attacks, kidnapping, prostitution, drug/human trafficking, oil theft, etc always on the news.</p> <p>Another problem to the subject matter is that the government is not doing the needful to revive the entrepreneurship sector and this is tied to a major problem of the country; which is corruption. The agencies saddled with this responsibility are dormant doing nothing, other than embezzling funds allocated for such task. On some occasions, you have the government allocate certain funds to purchase equipment meant to empower youths who have learnt some skills, but at the end of the day such funds are diverted.</p> <p>In addition to this, schools, secondary and tertiary institutions are lack entrepreneurship education of students. Students are not well enlightened on the need to have a skill and create their own wealth instead of waiting for the government to create employment.</p> <p>However, Nigeria being a mono economy also poses a challenge. Nigerians including the government concentrates so much on the oil sector, thus relegating other sectors of the economy that can create jobs for the unemployed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, these are some of the problems this study will be seeking ways of proffering solutions to.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>Aims/ Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The major aim of this study is to examine Entrepreneurship as a panacea to economic development; a case study of Etsako west.</p> <p>Other specific objectives include:</p> <ol><li>To examine the challenges of entrepreneurship in the sustainable development of Estako west.</li> <li>To examine the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development.</li> <li>To examine entrepreneurship education as a means of encouraging entrepreneurship in Estako west.</li> <li>To examine entrepreneurship as having a link with the economy of Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>Research questions</strong></p> <ol><li>What are the challenges of entrepreneurship in the sustainable development of Estako west?</li> <li>Is there a relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development?</li> <li>Is entrepreneurship education a means of encouraging entrepreneurship in Estako west?</li> <li>Is there a link between entrepreneurship and the economy of Nigeria?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>There are no challenges of entrepreneurship in the sustainable development of Estako West.</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>There are challenges of entrepreneurship in the sustainable development of Estako West.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the study/ Justification of the study</strong></p> <p>This study is meant to educate the general public, the government and policy makers on the need to encourage entrepreneurship.</p> <p>The public need to be well informed that gone are the days when Nigerians sit and wait for the government to create jobs; now is the time for private individuals to create jobs in other to enhance economic growth.</p> <p>Also, the government has a part to play in promoting entrepreneurship.

Recent dimensions to entrepreneurship have necessitated the need for formal education for entrepreneurs. There has been consequent rapid increase in the numbers of schools (primary, secondary and tertiary) all over the world. The continuous expansion in the educational and other training institutions is part of the quest for entrepreneurial capacity building. As indicated earlier changes in manpower needs induce appropriate reactions from the human resource development agencies.</p> <p>Formal education according to Bassey (2006) is a process of acculturation through which an individual is helped to develop his potentials and maximum activation in order to achieve self-fulfillment and happiness. Ajuzie (2005) sees education as an essential part of the society process employed to train the human beings to be functional and to adopt the behavioral patterns by the same society. Education is also an ever- present phenomenon in each phase of human civilization however diverse its nature in each era (Ekwosi, 2012). Embedded in these views is the role education plays in training human beings. The role of education in entrepreneurial capacity development cannot be over emphasized. Some people even see the importance of education in human development to the extent of presenting education as playing a complementary role in creation of human beings, hence they assert that God initiated creation and education completed it.</p> <p>The whole value of an individual that gives him his worth and determines his relative position in his society is a function of his education no matter the type. According to Amao-keinde (2000), education, as a process, embodies all forms of activities that fit an individual for social living. It helps to transmit culture from generation to generation. The desire of every society is that the individuals in the society get developed towards the overall development of the society itself.</p> <p>The school takes upper hand in the process of entrepreneurial development of the members of the society (Ajuzie, 2005). No society can exist and maintain continuity in norms and values without one form of education or the other. That a human being is different from a beast is as a result of the training (education) he received growing in human society imbibing the norms and values of that society. The need for proper education in the area of business management has led to the introduction of entrepreneurship education into the school curriculum.</p> <p>Entrepreneurship education as part of the total educational system is the type of education that involves the acquisition of skills, ideas and management abilities necessary for job creation. Proper education can only be gotten from a formal school. A formal school is an institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students or pupils under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is commonly compulsory. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university.</p> <p>An entrepreneur promotes employment rather than seeking for an employment. Therefore, there is a need to embrace this type of education and provide all the necessary resources needed to make functional. Quality entrepreneurship education could be used as a tool for fighting the war against poverty and unemployment in Nigeria. Therefore, quality entrepreneurship education will enhance job creation which will subsequently reduce unemployment, poverty and social vices in Nigeria. This will also help to improve the standard of living; hence promote social economic and political development in Nigeria which is the cardinal objective of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Also, for the recipient of entrepreneurship education to be a job creator rather than job-seeker, he might acquire essential basic skills and attitudes which will enable him to function as an entrepreneur.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Generally, there are some challenges militating against the production of quality entrepreneurial capacity in Nigeria. These may come from the government, parents or even from certain unpredictable environmental forces which are external. Unless these problems are looked into, the realization of the aim and objectives of quality entrepreneurship education in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Nigeria will be a mirage. It is therefore, against this background that this study examines role of formal school in promoting entrepreneurial capacities in Nigeria. Although, there is now a very serious attention paid to entrepreneurship education in tertiary institutions in Nigeria and the world-over.</p> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <ol><li>To examine the role of formal school in promoting entrepreneurial capacity in Nigeria.</li> <li>To determine the adequacy of school curriculum in promoting entrepreneurial capacity in Nigeria.</li> <li>To identify the factors militating against the promotion of entrepreneurial capacity through formal school.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the role of formal school in promoting entrepreneurial capacity in Nigeria?</li> <li>What is the adequacy of school curriculum in promoting entrepreneurial capacity in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the factors militating against the promotion of entrepreneurial capacity through formal school?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5       HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>HO: There is no significant relationship between formal school and promotion of entrepreneurial capacity in Nigeria.</p> <p>HA: There is significant relationship between formal school and promotion of entrepreneurial capacity in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <ol><li>The outcomes of this study will reveal the role of formal school in promoting entrepreneurial capacity in Nigeria.

In Nigeria the development of entrepreneurship has gone a long way to achieve industrialization and economic development. Management scholars agree that although management theory and practices have universal applications, the individual and groups with which it must interact, and the external environment differs in some way. It is acknowledged by management scholars also that there are many deviations in management theory all over the world.</p> <p>The attempt to discover the determinants of managerial success of entrepreneurs has always been a heart-throb among researchers of various fields of studies. Biographies of successful entrepreneurs and business men for instance reflected the tendency of the subject of such studies to explain their success in terms of virtue of hand work, thrift and clean living (Baridam 1995:15). As an alternative to biographical models are these studies that, turn the man who manipulates the omnipotent touch (Gases 1983: 20). Culture is dynamic in nature but cannot be change mechanically rather could be modified to suit a given environment. Almost every perception and behavior is guided by the human invention we call culture. Each culture shapes perception and behaviors by paving relative attention to some details of reality and ignoring others or by permitting some actions and forbidding others.</p> <p>Culture which forms parts of the complex education-sociological-cultural-political-legal-economic that interact and affect that performance of productive entrepreneurs is often the less treated and less emphasized amongst these foregoing factors by business people (terpstra et al 1991: 40); this notwithstanding the fact that it forms the bedrock on which the other factors operate. Speculations dealing with the supposed effects of cultural factors of an environment on the performance of productive enterprises in that environment are on the rife. However, empirical studies and a careful analysis of this situation in the context of entrepreneurship operating in developing countries remains to be exhaustively and satisfactorily treated. Though it can clearly be said that cultural factors have a substantial impact on managerial or entrepreneurial effectiveness and productivity measured in a given instance owing to the fact that sociological and cultural constraints are difficult to measure in quality. This is always a problem when one wishes to deal with human attitudes and values, it is often hard to distinguish popular misconceptions and myths from the realities of the situation (farmer et al 1965: 60) so, it therefore becomes patient to test a number of significant and operational hypotheses in order to explain and predict production efficiency with a high degree of accuracy and confidence in any given case.</p> <p>The issue of culture as it affects the performance of cultural factors affecting the performances of entrepreneurs should take into consideration firstly, the salient cultural constrain that impinge upon the operations of entrepreneurs or enterprises in the understudied and secondly, it should be established how these salient cultural constraints meet in one way or the other in the performance of firms. In addition socio-cultural variables also have impact on planning and control as well as the various production functions of these firms’ enterprises. Such as; research development, production, marketing and finance. This study, will attempt to identify the various cultural factors that affect entrepreneurial operations in the understudied environment and also determine how these cultural factors affect the performance of entrepreneurs in the said environment.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>The fact that entrepreneurs contribute to the development of less developed countries is irrefutable (freeman 1981: 50). The issue that a nation culture and primary socializations produce several constraint which impinge upon the operation of productive entrepreneurs operating in developing countries like Nigeria ought to carryout in depth analysis on the socio-cultural factors inherent in the environment before they proceed with that venture. The firm once it’s established is constrained by various factors inherent in the environment. Although all constraint areas (educational, socio-culture, political, legal, economic etc.) are common major difficulty that lie in the social-cultural sector (farmeret al 1967: 70).</p> <p>This case is very true, since the aspect of dealing with people oriented with strange custom and values usually present a problem. The above issue is reflective of the Nigeria situation, experts have posited that cultural constraint are the bottom line when considering the issue of in efficiency and poor performance of enterprises in Nigeria. This may not completely be true because whenever one is dealing with human attitudes and values, it is often hard to distinguish popular misconception from the realities of the situation. There arises therefore, a need to determine (empirically) whether the cultural constraint in Port Harcourt is significant enough to affect the performance of entrepreneurs operating therein. </p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>Purpose of Study</strong></p> <p>The general objectives of this study is to identify the impact of cultural factors on entrepreneurs performance. However, the specific objective of the study includes;</p> <ol><li>To identify various cultural factors that imitate against the performance of entrepreneurs and to what extent they affect them.</li> <li>To identify the present effect of cultural factors on entrepreneurial performance.</li> <li>To examine entrepreneurs reactions towards cultural changes and their coping strategies.</li> <li>To examine other non-cultural factors and the extent to which they affect entrepreneurs.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions with the study;</p> <ol><li>To what extent does Norms relate with entrepreneurs performance of some selected private firms in Port Harcourt?</li> <li>To what extent does belief system relate withentrepreneurs performance of some selected private firms in Port Harcourt?</li> <li>To what extent does attitude relate with entrepreneurs performance of some selected private firms in Port Harcourt.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>The following research hypothesis will guide the study;</p> <p>Ho1:      There is no significant relationship between Norms and the productivity of some selected private firms in Port Harcourt</p> <p>Ho2:     There is no significant relationship between belief system and the productivity of some selected private firms in Port Harcourt.</p> <p>Ho3: There is no significant relationship between attitude and the productivity of some selected private firms in Port Harcourt.</p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research study will be of great importance to the entrepreneurs interactiveness with the market and its customers. It will also be useful to the entrepreneur’s internal decision marketing process and will also influence the decisions to create new business. This finding of the research will improve or add to existing world of knowledge and will also create awareness of the Norms, belief system and attitude of Nigerians to foreigners who desire to create business in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7      </strong><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study was conducted and limited to target population, geographical boundary study variable and units of analysis. From the above statement, the target population will focus on selected private firms in Port Harcourt. The geographical boundary is Port Harcourt, the study variable will be divided into two: the independent variable represented as culture (having dimensions as; Norms belief system and attitude) and the dependent variable represented as entrepreneurial performance (having measures as; productivity). The unit of analysis is at the organizational level.</p> <p><strong>1.8      </strong><strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>According to Cosuala, 1985: 80), definition of terms is the most important facet of the research report, since without a common understanding of essential terms; the value of the research very be lost through misinterpretation.

Aside its importance to the economy, it is a sound way of reducing unemployment in Nigeria.</p> <p>Every big business starts as a small business, and it started with an entrepreneur (small business), who at first, earns little or no profit. It was the new ideas of small business that brought most big business empires that create multiple jobs for our teeming youths today in Nigeria. Untried ideas become annulations that become concepts that changed the business world. Small business is the basis for the economic back bone of many developed nations. Entrepreneurship is simply what makes a small business grow. Entrepreneurship occurs when an individual develops a new venture, a new approach to an old business or idea, or a unique way of giving the market place a product or service by using resources in a new way under conditions of risk. Small business triumphs and entrepreneurship are closely related to it. It is difficult to separate them. The unemployment situation in the country coupled with the new government instinctive towards easing social tensions among unemployed youths, through the programmed of the National Directorate of Employment (NDE), were intended to lure a lot of unemployed Nigerians, including graduates into self-determination through self-employment. Graduates and school leavers are now realizing that government and the established private companies are not ready to come to their aid directly, through paid employment due to the dividing state of the economy. Government has been playing appreciative role in promoting the survival and growth of small-scale enterprise in recognition of them flexible and adaptive nature as well as their re-generative power in promoting economic growth and development. Government also encourages people to establish their own small scale businesses so as to reduce the problem of unemployment in the country and also reduce the problem of importation of goods, more so, to encourage exportation. Government in believing that a dynamic and growing small manufacturing sub-sector can contribute significantly to the implementation of a wide range development effectives, has thus enunciated various policies to encourage their proliferation and make them veritable engines of growth and development.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>It has long been established that small scale businesses or enterprises is an economic booster but setting up this small or medium scale businesses has been an issue in Nigeria since most of the small businesses that have been established has either been stalled or have closed down completely. The lack of growth of small businesses in Nigeria even when some of these businesses have been well funded has been a cause for serious concern as it has made many small business owners job seekers again.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The following would be our aims /objectives of embarking on this study</p> <ol><li>The examine the challenges of setting up small businesses in Nigeria.</li> <li>To examine the prospects of setting up successful small businesses in Nigeria.</li> <li> To study the importance of setting up small scale businesses in Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>Research questions</strong></p> <ol><li>What are the challenges of setting up small businesses in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the prospects of setting up successful small businesses in Nigeria?</li> <li>Are most small businesses established in Nigeria successful?</li> <li>What is the importance of setting up small businesses in Nigeria?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5   Research hypotheses</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho</strong>: there is no significant relationship between the method of SME setup and its eventual success.</p> <p><strong>Hi</strong>: there is a significant relationship between the method of SME setup and its eventual success.</p> <p><strong>1.6.    </strong><strong>Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The outcome of this study would greatly benefit prospective small business owners on how to make their small businesses thrive.</p> <p>This study would also be of importance to economic policy makers, researchers and relevant stakeholders who are interested in an SME driven economy.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Scope/Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p>This study is on the prospects and challenges  of setting up small scale businesses in Nigeria with Uyo local government serving as the case study.</p> <p><strong>Limitations of study</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>1.        </strong><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</li> <li><strong>2.        </strong><strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

However despite this huge endowment Nigeria is also an energy deficient country whose economy suffers tremendously from the shortage of energy supply (Iwayemi, 2008). The shortage imposes huge cost on the economy and compels widespread private provision by different classes of energy users (Lee and Anas, 1998; Adenikinju, 2005). Additionally Nigerians often spend many productive hours queuing for petroleum products in the fuelling stations to buy fuel at government regulated prices because fuel supply scarcity has been a recurrent feature of the Nigerian energy market. Fuel scarcity in the economy and failing electricity supply create dual energy crisis for Nigeria (Iwayemi, 2008). Investment in back up generating facility is widespread and imposes significant costs on the economy. Small Scale businesses suffer the most from Nigeria’s energy poverty as they spend a large proportion of their capital (about 20- 25% of their investment) on back up generating facilities (Lee and Anas, 1991; Foster and Steinbuks, 2008). In fact Iwayemi, (2008) links most of the country’s economic woes including its inability to industrialize to the dismal performance of the energy sector. However power supply outages are not peculiar to developing countries alone considering the recent black outs in California and other parts of north Western United States of America. Though it has been the cardinal policy of government electricity policy and consumers desire to have power supply reliability, keeping the light on is an extremely difficult challenge (DOE, 2003) especially in a developing economy. Ukpong, (1973); Iyanda, (1982); Lee and Anas, (1991, 1992); Uchendu, (1993); Ajayi (1995), Adenikinju, (2005); Oseni and Pollit, (2013) have examined the cost of power outages and unreliable supply of electricity on firms and document firms survival strategies in Nigeria and Africa.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>This study builds on the previous studies by focusing on the small scale businesses in the North West Nigeria for many reasons. First the small scale businesses have a lot of contributions to make towards the development of the Nigerian economy in terms of providing employment and income opportunities for the people. Based on experience, these types of businesses provide the surest path to industrialization. Additionally the choice of small scale business is informed by the fact they are the dominant businesses found in the North West region of Nigeria but,like other parts of Nigeria, the North West region also suffers from epileptic supply of electricity and this affects small scale industries a lot.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>1. To determine the impact of deficient electricity supply on the operational performance of small scale businesses in north West Nigeria</p> <p>2.

It is also expected to highlight on the investment potentials for electricity generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure that the private sector could take opportunity of in closing the prevailing deficit. This is especially important considering the recent introduction of electricity market reform in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7   </strong><strong>Scope/Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p>This study covered the impact of electrical power outage on the operational performance of small scale industries in Kano state.</p> <p><strong>Limitations of study</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>1.        </strong><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection through the internet, questionnaire and interview.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher simultaneously engaged in this study with other academic work.

This assertion is confirmed in a research by Scott et al (2014) which reveals that, the proportion of SMEs in high-income countries citing electricity as a major constraint is half of their counterparts in the Sub-Saharan African and Asia countries. Cost and time spent on acquiring electricity were also higher in the Less Developed Countries compared with that of High-Income Countries. However, this study is examining the effect of electricity on the performance of SMEs in Nigeria.</p> <p>The effect of electricity power outage on SMEs in Nigeria posited that, the current electricity crises in the country were costing the SMEs over US $686.4 million of annual sales. The SMEs continued to record a huge loss day by day as a result of poor electricity supply.  These have been partly blamed on market and state failures, which have led to the poor electricity supply.</p> <p>In the interim, a lot has equally been said with regards to the appalling state of Nigeria's epileptic power sector according to Akuru and Okoro (2009). Energy consumers do not get electricity supplied to them because the local utility companies do not get power transmitted to them from the electric grid. The managers of electric transmission are quick to accuse the generating stations of insufficient generating MW capacity. And as if trading of blame has become routine with each of these sectors, the generating stations either claim they do not get enough gas to power their plants or they turn around and claim that the transmission companies themselves cannot boast of a strong transmission backbone to transmit what is being generated.</p> <p>Indeed, modern energy services can impact on the development of SMEs to a great extent. Issues that can affect the development of SMEs such as gross undercapitalization, decrepit infrastructural services, high start-up costs, corruption, and government indifference have been identified by Oboh (2002). A particular finding revealed the high cost of providing back-up energy (partly infrastructural) for SMEs which sometimes is as critical as three times the cost of publicly supplied electricity as discussed elsewhere (Adenikinju, 2003; Essien, 2001).</p> <p>In Nigeria and perhaps generally, SMEs classification have been done on the basis of capital investment and employed labour force while other criteria could be the annual turnover or gross output as mentioned by Anyanwu (2001). Until very recently, energy was rarely cited as one of the problems militating against the performance of SMEs in Nigeria and elsewhere.</p> <p>Several policies has been formulated by government at all levels (Federal, States and local government) in Nigeria to enhance growth and development of the SMEs as they contribute significantly to the GDP of the nation. This policies and objectives can only be realized when there is adequate power supply to the small business. Currently in Nigeria, managers of small business spend huge sums in procuring generating sets, fuel and the maintenance of the generators to operate their business successfully. This has however skyrocketed the operational cost and reduced their performance.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>The numerical value of Nigeria's GDP as at 2004 (and by all standards, now, because there have been no noticeable improvements) is a consequence of its poor electricity structure and this has affected the performance of SMEs, which is considered as a yardstick for economic independence of nations. However, a number of options that can be used to checkmate this unfortunate development exist. For instance, if the Nigerian government should consider the criticality of SMEs and fast-track programmes on the expansion and optimal operation of the current energy mix; within a very short time frame, these could be measured as an effort towards relief. SMEs villages/clusters can be built to promote industrial activities on the basis that such basic infrastructure like electricity, which is needed for spin-off as well as for sustainable operation, is collectively and affordably provided by the relevant host authorities to investors and operators. Standalone renewable energy (RE) systems are increasingly getting better than generating sets which still requires expensive and pollution-prone fossil fuels for their operation. Hence, efforts are needed by relevant authorities, tasked with the promotion of SMEs in Nigeria, to facilitate the provision and subsidized costs of procuring these renewable energy systems - some of which are readily available for small-scale use.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <ol><li>To examine the impact of electricity on the performance of SMEs in Nigeria.</li> <li>To identify the effectiveness of the electricity generating and distributing companies in Nigeria.</li> <li>To examine other factors affecting the performance of SMEs in Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the impact of electricity on the performance of SMEs in Nigeria?</li> <li>What is the effectiveness of the electricity generating and distributing companies in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the other factors affecting the performance of SMEs in Nigeria?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>HO: There is no significant relationship between electricity and performance of SMEs in Nigeria.<br/>HA: There is significant relationship between electricity and performance of SMEs in Nigeria.<br/><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <ol><li>The outcome of this study will educate the general public on the importance of electricity to the performance of SMEs in Nigeria.</li> <li>It is also anticipated that the federal government will tap into the vital information provided by this research in the overall economic development to set up working mechanisms for the promotion of SMEs.</li> <li>Another important thinking is the fact that it will add to the limited but growing catalogue of research on electricity economics in Nigeria.</li> <li>Small businesses can also benefit, to some extent, from the information presented in this study which serves as a guide to alternative viable sources of power generation and even job creation.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study will cover the effect of electricity on the performance of SMEs in Nigeria.

A further search of the literature also reveals that researchers have been inconsistent in their definition of entrepreneurship. There are a minimum of a hundred definitions to explain the concept of entrepreneur and entrepreneurship. Their meanings depend on when they were devised and on the society in which the various researchers developed them (Di - masi, 1999). In the last century, many writers have identified entrepreneurship with the function of uncertainty and risk bearing and others with the coordination of productive resources, the introduction of innovation and the provision of technical know - how (Hoselitz, 1952) cited in  Izurnet, (2000). During the sixteen century, people who organized and managed military and exploration expeditions in France were called\"Entreprendre\".  The word entrepreneur originates from the French verb \"Entreprendre\" and the German word \"unternehmen\" both of which means to undertake (Afonja, 1999). In the oxford dictionary, an entrepreneur is defined as one who organizes, manages and assumes the risks of a business enterprise. <br/>The early 18 century French economist Richard cantillon (Circa, 1755) introduced the term entrepreneurship. In his writings, he formally defines entrepreneur as the agent who buys means of production at certain prices in other to combine them into a new product. He further defines entrepreneurship as self employment of any sort where the entrepreneur is the bearer of the uncertainty and risk. Shortly there after, the French economist jean Baptist sayed (1824) defines the entrepreneur as someone who shift economic resources out of an area of lower to an area of high productivity and greater yield. He added to cantillon definition by including the idea that an entrepreneur is one who brings other people together in order to build a single productive organization. But says definition, according to peter Drucker (1985), does not tell us who the entrepreneur is. And since they coined the term almost two hundred years ago, there have been lack of consensus over the definition of entrepreneur and entrepreneurship. In the 19th century, British economist such as Adam smith, David Ricardo and john Stuart mill defined the concept of entrepreneurship under the broad English term of business management (Burnett, 2000). However, schum peter (1947) argues that whereas the writing of smith and Ricardo suggest that the lively undervalued the import ants of entrepreneurship, mill actually stresses its significance for economic development and growth. He further claims that entrepreneurship requires \"no ordinary skills\" and laments the fact that there is no good English language equivalent wants to encompass the specific meaning of the French term entrepreneur. The necessity of entrepreneurship for production was also recognized by Alfred Marshall in 1890 when he asserted in his treatise of principle of economics that there are four factors of production i.e. land, labor, capital and organization. Entrepreneurship, both technical and commercial, is the driving element behind organization. He further argue that the skills associated particularly with technical entrepreneurship are rare and limited in supply and that the ability of entrepreneurs are so great and so numerous that very few people that exhibit them all in a very high degree. Another research carry out by Penrose (2006) posit that entrepreneurship, particularly technical entrepreneurial activity, involves identifying opportunities within the economics system, filling market deficiency through input - completing activities including the process of identifying, developing and bringing a vision to life. This vision may an innovative idea, an opportunity or a better way of doing something. The end result of this process is the creation of a new venture the expansion of an existing one carried out under condition of risks and considerable uncertainty (Meyer et.al, 1976). Therefore, in recognition of the considerable risk and uncertainty with entrepreneurship, Afonja (1999) made a clear distinction between technical entrepreneurship and commercial enterprenuship. The former involves product manufacture or the provision of technical service while the letter involves trading, buying and selling or provision of non - technical services. The prerequisites for success and risk factors involved differ significantly for the two types of entrepreneurship.<br/>Therefore, the focus of this study is on the effect of technical entrepreneurial characteristics on the performance of small industry manufacturing operators in the food, textiles, and wood processing and fabricated metal products all of which are generally important in the industrialization of a developing economy such as Nigeria.<br/>2.3    <strong>The Characteristic of an Entrepreneurship</strong><br/>Personality attributes have been studied extensively and a wide range of tests has been developed to identify and even measure them. Such testing, termed \"psychometric testing\" has become common place and is now standard part of the interview process with many enterprises. The psychometric testing revealed many varying characteristics from an entrepreneur to another. Any attempt to describe entrepreneur characteristics against only one dimension would be inadequate. To give a holistic view, the characteristics of entrepreneur as reported by scholars and researchers of different disciplines are discussed below (Egbe, 2006).<br/>2.3.1<strong>   Need for Achievement </strong><br/>McClelland work on the need for achievement identified     psychological characteristics present in entrepreneurs. He specified three attributes from his overall theory of need for achievement as characteristics of entrepreneur (a) individual responsibility for solving problems, settings goals and reaching these goals through their own efforts. (b) Moderate risk taking as a function of skill, not chance; and (c) knowledge of result of decision task accomplishment. Since he is result oriented means that he must always set clear and meseaurable goals. A result and action oriented entrepreneur must also, therefore, be goal oriented. He set goals that are high, challenging and difficult but realistic and attainable. After setting the goals and objectives, he then he determined to know the result of his efforts in achievement the set targets. Bearing in mind the goals set, he persists even in the face of adversity and difficulty to achieve these goals. He is preservers, determine and persistent to ensure that his objectives are met. (Obodoechi, 2007). The entrepreneur should define the goal he set for him self in terms of resources, time frame and measurement .for instance , for an entrepreneur to say, `I want to make a profit` this goal is not define in terms of resources, timeframe and not measurable as such. Making profit in any business I a relative term, that involve ambiguity. An entrepreneur should set a goal like this, `I want to make a profit of N10 million, at the end of financial year.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL CHARACTERISTICS ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL CHARACTERISTICS ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> ABSTRACT <p>This research work is on causes of business failure and possible solutions with a case study of Faith printing press, Uyo. business failure is when  a firm is suffering from either technical insolvency or bankruptcy or when it happens that a firms total revenue do not cover its total cost , this can be avoided by finding  solutions to business failure by way of managing recourses in a proper way.

This is because it involves a lot of technicalities ranging from the task of planning to control of such plans in order to achieve the desire objectives of profit maximization. It is in view of this, that this study is mainly centered on the floating of a business to a stage where it finds it difficult to keep it’s head above water.</p> <p>In the late 70s business was in its period of boom, the economy was doing well at that point in time and the exchange rate was appreciable within this period. International trade was easy as a result of lesser trade restrictions and foreign exchange control.</p> <p>During this period, Faith printing press was a beneficiary of the prevailing policies such as the importation of papers and other printing materials. These goods were usually tax free by the agencies concerned, as a result of the significance the government attaches to the publishing sector and the clearance procedures at the port were effective and efficient then.</p> <p>In the late 80’s as a result of the military take-over, various decrees and policies came into place. The economy became unbearable for the citizens and their purchasing power became very low, thereby forcing business not to live up to their required billing. What followed was that industries started operating on short run, and later businesses started folding up.</p> <p>The various trade restrictions, VAT policies on goods imported did not help matters. The result effect of all these, was folding up of businesses. Against the business affected was then within our locality the -Faith printing press. The concerns shown people in the locality spearheaded an agenda to resuscitate the company and prevent it from total collapse.</p> <p>The process of doing this proved difficult due to the extent of funds require to source for foreign exchange needed for the importation of raw materials there were other problems that seem intractable. But the people and company unite make persistence efforts to resuscitate the company but the more difficult problems that resulted, Motivated an interest to study the problems of business failure and the possible solutions.</p> <p><strong>1.1   HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF FAITH PRINTING PRESS</strong></p> <p>Faith printing press is a sole proprietorship business. It is own by Chief Gabriel O. Faith. It was established on 20th August 1969 and was situated at V.V.I Lagos/Keffi Street, Uyo.</p> <p>Faith printing press was set-up with the objective of providing the best quality printing jobs to customers at affordable prices and at the due appointed time. At the early life of the press, it started with letterpress and binding machine. Namely:  Adana, Letterpress Heidelberg and Cutting Machines.</p> <p>In the course of expansion, the press relocated to N.C-.3 Oshogbo Road, Uyo in 1979. The press increased its machineries by purchasing Rota prints, plate maker, camera, and kond. During this period the press has increased its area of specialization from letter press to offset printing.</p> <p>In 1985, the press moved to J.11 main street Badarawa Uyo and finally relocated to its permanent site V.V. 15 Nassarawa Road, Uyo in June 1993. in its present site, it has acquired additional machines such as multilith 1850,   Stitching machine, computers and Ruling machines.</p> <p>This organization is engaged in the publishing of companies Annual reports, text-books, invoices, Receipts calendars, invitation cards, Business cards e.t.c. Faith printing press is an organization worthy to be emulated, Judging by its achievement within the period of its existence. The organization has render a lot of its services to prominent companies &amp; government parastatals within this country, among them are: Nitel Headquarters- Lagos, National electric power authority Uyo, Uyo state water board, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Uyo, Bayero University Kano, Nice Top papers industries Uyo etc.</p> <p>Below is a sample of what Faith printing press Organizational chart should look like.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Managing</p> <p>Director</p> <p>Press                                                        maintenance      </p> <p>Manager                                                    manager/ engineer</p> <p>                                        Production </p> <p>      </p> <p>Cashier</p> <p>                                        Cashier                      Receptionist</p> <p>                            </p> <p>        Lithographer           printing section             Finishing section</p> <p>               With                   And                           And</p> <p>        Apprentices                Apprentices                Apprentices</p> <p>        Drivers                                                        Gate men                                                </p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Business entrepreneurs today are making a lot of efforts in order to make their investment a perpetual going concern.

Making up about 97% of the entire economy, they serve as a source of employment generation, innovation, competition, economic dynamism which ultimately lead to poverty alleviation and national growth. Tax policy is one of the factors that constitute the Small businesses’ economic environment. This research work tries to establish if any relationship exists between the growth of Small businesses and the tax policy environment in which they operate in Nigeria. Questionnaires were distributed to Small businesses in Calabar, Nigeria and non probability judgmental sampling method was employed. It was found out that from most Small businesses surveyed; they were faced with the problem of high tax rates, multiple taxation, complex tax regulations and lack of proper enlightenment or education about tax related issues. Although there was a general perception that tax is an important source of fund for development of the economy and provision of social services, the study revealed a significant negative relationship between taxes and the business’ ability to sustain itself and to expand. In order to obtain a vibrant and flourishing SME sector, the tax policy needs to be appropriate such that it will neither be an encumbrance to the Small businesses nor discourage voluntary compliance. A suggested solution is by increasing tax incentives through reducing tax rates and increasing tax authorities’ support services towards small and medium enterprises.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER I</strong><br/><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The desire to build a civilized country with a strong and sound economy is the desire of every Country, including Nigeria. Tax payment is the demonstration of such a desire, although some income earners see it as a means of exploitation by the government. Tax payment is a voluntarily contribution imposed by the Government on personal income earners, companies, investors, exporters, importers etc. revenue realized from taxation is a major source of revenue to the Government of Nigeria, and as such is an important tool used in the development of Nigeria and her economy. A country’s tax policies and systems are greatly related with business ventures in that country. An economy that enacts favorable and progressive tax laws and policies will definitely breed successful and finance-healthy business organizations. Once businesses flourish, the economy flourishes as well, as there is no quicker way of stirring the affairs of an economy without the help of organizations that move services, goods, money and investments from those with surplus to those with deficit; those with marketable ideas/output to those who need these ideas and products. In essence, businesses and tax policies greatly depend on one another for survival. If one is greatly affected, the other follows suite.</p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The Nigerian Tax System has undergone significant changes in recent times. With the help of various studies and research done by tax experts, tax laws are being reviewed with the aim of repelling obsolete provisions and simplifying the main ones. Under current Nigerian law, taxation is enforced by the 3 tiers of Government, i.e. Federal, State, and Local Government with each having its sphere clearly spelt out in the Taxes and Levies (approved list for Collection) <br/>Small businesses are generally recognized as important drivers of economic success. They are a key ingredient in the “ecology of firms” in a healthy economy, as job creators, sales generators and a source of tax/fiscal revenue. In Nigeria the importance of small business as a creator of jobs, particularly for those with a low skills level, is widely recognized. Small, medium and micro-enterprises (“SMMEs”) contribute 36.1% of the country’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) and employ 68.2% of the workforce in the private sector. In the agriculture, construction and retail sectors, SMMEs employ more than 80% of the total workforce. Over the last few years, the growth in employment by SMMEs has exceeded the growth in their contribution to GDP, highlighting the job creation potential of this sector of the economy.<br/>Regulations and red tape are reported as one of the constraints to the expansion of businesses both in Nigeria and internationally. International research in this field shows that tax regulatory compliance costs are a significant portion of the total regulatory cost. Several other patterns emerged from the various local and international studies performed, among the most important being that tax compliance costs comprise a much larger proportion of total compliance costs for smaller firms. <br/>Furthermore, various research has suggested that any effective approach to assist small business requires both policy and administration model adjustments in order to be effective. The 2005 year, therefore, saw the beginning of a process of structural change that was intended to build a positive tax compliance climate in Nigeria.<br/>This report is focused on the survey of the compliance experience of professional accountants and bookkeepers (referred to as “tax practitioners” for the purposes of this document) in respect of their small business clients in Nigeria. It will be complemented by two related surveys, one of small businesses that are registered with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), regarding their time and cost requirements for tax compliance, and one of informal businesses, regarding their perceptions about tax compliance.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Small and medium enterprises (Small businesses) form the core of majority of the world’s economies. A study carried out by the Federal Office of Statistics shows that in Nigeria, small and medium enterprises make up 97% of the economy (Ariyo, 2005). However, the mortality rate of these small firms is very high. According to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) Nigeria, 80% of SMALL BUSINESSES die before their 5th anniversary. Among the factors responsible for these untimely close-ups are tax related issues, ranging from multiple taxations to enormous tax burdens etc. In many government policies, small and medium enterprises are usually viewed and treated in the same light as large corporations. However, their size and nature makes them unique. Therefore, in dealing with small and medium enterprises, these unique qualities need to be considered. In levying of taxes for these enterprises in particular, issues that need to be considered are how these tax policies can be designed to bolster the growth of Small businesses and the most effective ways to administer them. The importance of Small businesses as a mechanism of economic growth and development is often ignored. They are perceived as minute establishments that have minimal effect on the state of the economy. However, if conducive environment is created for these Small businesses to grow through proper regulation, the SME sector has the highest propensity to transform our economy. In the same light, taxes are important for the government as they are the major source of funds for government expenditure. Income obtained from taxation of individuals and businesses are used to run governments as well as provide infrastructure such as good roads, water supply, and electricity which are essential for the smooth running of these businesses that are mainly manufacturing companies and as such rely on these commodities to survive.<br/>Tax burden is a major problem in Nigeria as many business organizations are not favored by the tax systems and policies in place. Some businesses are already collapsing; while majority are still struggling to meet up with high tax rates to ensure their businesses still exist. According to a study conducted by Bateman (2007), it was reported in a survey that 90% of business owners admitted that taxes were a huge constraints to their businesses, as they claim taxes are high and do not allow new businesses to cover up initial cost.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH</strong><br/>In-order to achieve the purpose of this research, the following are the objectives of the research:</p> <div> <ol><li>To identify the challenges of Nigerian tax policies.</li> <li>To examine the influence of these challenges on small businesses and the economy as a whole.</li> <li>To identify ways of properly addressing the challenges of Nigerian tax policies in order to favour small businesses as well as encourage tax compliance.</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>In order to achieve the objectives stated above, the following research questions were used as a guide in achieving the objectives of this research:</p> <div> <ol><li>What are the various challenges facing tax policies in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the influences of the challenges of tax policies in Nigeria on small businesses and the economy?</li> <li>What must be done to address the challenges of tax policies in Nigeria to suite small businesses?</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study gives a clear insight into the various ways in which tax policies in Nigeria can be executed efficiently to still favor small businesses and how some taxation policies in Nigeria can be properly tackled. The study also gives a clear insight into the various causes of why small businesses fail in Nigeria as well as the challenges of the tax policies in Nigeria. The findings and recommendations of the researcher will help in building a strong and better tax policy system in Nigeria, if taken seriously by government and the general public. The challenges of taxation in Nigeria are outlined in-order for drastic measures to be taken to tackle these challenges and meet the prospects of the general public so that revenue from tax policy to the government can be increased.</p> <p><strong> SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research focuses mainly on the impact of Nigerian tax policies on the economy and small businesses in Nigeria.

Apart from increasing per capita income and output, Small Medium businesses create employment opportunities, enhance regional economic balance through industrial dispersal and generally promote effective resource utilization considered critical to engineering economic development and growth. However, the seminal role played by Small Medium businesses notwithstanding its development is everywhere constrained by inadequate funding and poor management. The unfavourable macro economic environment has also been identified as one of the major constraints which most times encourage financial institutions to be risk-averse in funding small and medium scale businesses. The reluctance on the part of financial institution to fund Small Medium businesses can be explained by the insufficient capital base of banks and information asymmetry that often exists between Small Medium businesses and lending institutions.</p> <p>This study critically examines the availability of business credit to small business in Nigeria, and how more funding can be made to support small businesses. However, this chapter, forms the basic foundation for this study as it presents the objectives of the study, and the statement of problem that motivated the researcher to undertake the study.</p> <p>1.2 <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY AND ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE</strong></p> <p>During the 1990s, a number of studies documented that lending to small businesses and the economic activity of small businesses were affected by financial sector disruptions, such as the widespread merging of banks of all sizes and the capital shortfalls occasioned by large loan losses.<br/>Although not much previous research has examined discrimination in small business credit markets, there has been an active debate on the question of whether banks discriminate against minority applicants for mortgages. In an influential study in that area, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston tried to collect any information that might be deemed economically relevant to whether a loan would be approved along with the borrower’s race andf financial status (Munnell et al., 1996). In the raw data larger firms had 10 percent of their loans rejected versus rejection rates of 28 percent for small scale businesses. After controlling for the large number of variables collected to establish the credit-worthiness of the borrowers (including, the amount of the debt, debt/income ratio, credit history, loan characteristics, etc.) small scale businesses were still percentage points less likely to be granted the loan.<br/>A variety of criticisms have been launched at this study (see, for example, Horne 1994; Day and Liebowitz, 1998; Harrison, 1998); responses to these criticisms are found in Browne and Tootell (1996). The most common critique indicates that we cannot make a determination of discrimination unless those small businesses whose loans are approved have a greater likelihood of repayment. This argument rests critically upon an implied assumption that the distribution of repayment probabilities for large companies and small businesses is identical. His figure indicates that if this assumption is met and if firms discriminate against small businesses by setting a higher bar for loan approval, then the mean rate of repayment among small businesses conditional upon loan approvalwill be higher for large and smaller firms.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></p> <p>Small businesses and entrepreneurial ventures which are usually considered as the engine that run the economy are usually denied access to credit due to their risky nature. This disturbing threat has existed for a very long time and needs proper attention from both government agencies and non governmental agencies as well. The importance of small businesses in the development of Nigeria cannot be overlooked. Without proper credit availability to small businesses, the economy as a whole will suffer. The objectives of economic planning cannot be achieved if small businesses do not do well. Keeping this in view, the Bank of Nigeria has streamlined Bank’s lending operations to ensure that banks’ credit actually benefits small and medium businesses in Nigeria. This strategy is intended to improve the economy and to develop rural areas in Nigeria.</p> <p>However, there is some anecdotal evidence that most beneficiaries of business credit from most financial institutions are salaried workers and large scale companies, whose ability to repay loans are believed to be better than that of small scale businesses. Moreover, this belief is not always the case as some small businesses who go for loans are well profitable and well managed.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong><br/>This paper is aimed at the following objectives:</p> <div> <ol><li>To examine the relationship that exist between small scale businesses and financial institutions that grant business credits in Uyo.</li> <li>To identify the challenges faced by small businesses in securing business credit in Uyo.</li> <li>To examine the degree of business credit availability to small businesses in Uyo.</li> <li>To identify the effects of businesses credit availability on small businesses in Uyo.</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>The following questions were used by the researcher in achieving the research objectives of this study:</p> <div> <ol><li>What relationship exists between you and financial institutions that grant credit in Uyo?</li> <li>What challenges do you face when securing credit for your business?</li> <li>How often business credit is made available to you when you apply for it?</li> <li>What effects have the availability of business credit had on your business?</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is very important because it is aimed at examining the effects of business credit availability and its effect on small businesses in Uyo. The paper will provide some relevant recommendations for policy makers, development agencies, entrepreneurs, and small business managers to help seek better ways to increase business credits to small businesses, and appropriate strategies to improve the small business sector in Nigeria.<br/>Secondly, the study is also vital since it suggest to small businesses certain strategies they can adopt before seeking business credits, to make their borrowing process easier and more effective. This will go a long way to increase the efficiency and profitability level of small businesses in Uyo. Any time these strategies are put in place, access to business credit increases, and the participation of more people in entrepreneurial activities will also increase, hence the economy of Nigeria will be improved.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The area chosen for this study is Uyo in the Eastern region of Nigeria. The study is limited to the effects of business credit availability on small businesses in Uyo, using various small businesses in Uyo as a focus point.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>In undertaking this research, the researcher encountered the following problems;<br/>1. The time used to undertake the study was limited. The time was loaded with other academic activities and as a result limited time was made available the study.<br/>2. Also, response from the various small business owners through the questionnaire provided by the researcher was also a bit slow. This is because of reasons such much work load on the part of the respondents.</p> <p><strong>1.8 CHAPTER SCHEME</strong> <br/>The project will be organized around following chapters;<br/>Chapter one gives an introduction to the research work. It gives the basic information about the company and the research being undertaken. This chapter therefore consists of the background of the study and organizational profile, statement of the problem, objectives, research questions, significance of the study, scope of the study, and limitations encountered by the researcher.<br/>Chapter Twoconsists of the literature review and the theoretical framework<br/>Chapter three gives details of the research methodology. The research methodology represents the various ways and methods which the researcher used in order to gain his information.<br/>Chapter Fourgives the analysis and interpretation of the information gathered by the researcher.<br/>Chapter five gives the findings and conclusion of the researcher. Here, conclusions will be drawn based on the findings and their implications will also be given.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF BUSINESS  CREDIT AVAILABILITY ON SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF BUSINESS  CREDIT AVAILABILITY ON SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Background to the Study</strong><br/>Small and Medium Scale Enterprises are sub-sectors of the industrial sector which play crucial roles in industrial development (Ahmed, S. 2006). Following the adoption of Economic reform programme in Nigeria in 1981, there have been several decisions to switch from capital intensive and large scale industrial projects which was based on the philosophy of import development to Small and Medium Scale Enterprises which have better prospects for developing domestic economy, thereby generating the required goods and services that will propel the economy of Nigeria towards development. It is base on this premise that Ojo O. (2009), argued that one of the responses to the challenges of development in developing countries particularly, in Nigeria, is the encouragement of entrepreneurial development scheme. Despite the abundant natural resources, the country still finds it very difficult to discover her developmental bearing since independence. Quality and adequate infrastructural provision has remained a nightmare, the real sector among others have witnessed downward performance while unemployment rate is on the increase. Most of the poor and unemployed Nigerians in order to better their lots have resorted to the establishment of their own businesses. Consequently, Entrepreneurship is fast becoming a household name in Nigeria. This is as a result of the fact that the so called white collar jobs that people clamor for are no longer there. Even, the touted sectors (Banks and companies) known to be the largest employer of labour are on the down-turn following the consolidation crisis and fraudulent practice of the high and mighty in the banking sector. The companies of course are folding up as a result of erratic power supply, insecurity and persistent increase in interest rate which has lead to high cost of production and undermines profit making potentials of companies operating in Nigeria. As a result of banking sector practices and continuous folding up of companies, a lot of Nigerians are thrown into unemployment  which inevitably detriment the economic situation of the country.<br/>Since the office jobs that people desire are no longer there for the teeming population, and few ones that succeeded in getting the jobs are thrown out as a result of the factors identified above, the need for the government and the people to have a rethink on the way-out of this mess became imperative. Hence, the need for Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) became a reality as a means of ensuring self independent, employment creation, import substitution, effective and efficient utilization of local raw materials and contribution to the economic development of our dear nation (Nigeria). All the aforestated benefits of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises cannot be achieved without the direct intervention of the government and financial institutions. Over the years, a number of policies have been formulated by the government with a view to developing Small and Medium Scale Enterprises. The Nigerian government under the then leadership of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo promulgated micro-finance policy and other regulatory and supervisory framework in 2005.<br/>The research will therefore examine the impact of small and medium enterprise development on youth empowerment in Kaduna metropolis.<br/>1.2    <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong><br/>There has been stunted growths and sluggish development in the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) regardless of increasing targeted government assistance streamlined to benefit firms operating in this sector. There were several policies in the past which gave priorities to entrepreneurship development, indicating the trust in government policy in support of SMEs. The government of Nigeria identified entrepreneurship development as a major thrust to achieve economic development through SMEs growth and development. <br/>This made Nigerian government both at National and State as well as local government to prioritize small and medium enterprises development initiatives by. As such the prioritization of the small and medium scale by government at different level is echoed in almost every policy document.<br/>For example in the industrial development policy in vision 2020, the Nigeria aim is to promote and support small and medium enterprise as they are viewed as an important engine for employment creation and economic growth. Although the government of Nigeria has been advancing targeted support in marketing, management and finance and worse still others collapsed. Egbe (2004) in this regard rated Nigeria as having one of the lowest small and medium scale sector's share of employment in the world, when \"250 employees\" was considered the yard stick in the definition of small and medium scale enterprise. Targeted government assistance has been observed to play a pivotal role in starting, growing and medium scale enterprise in Nigeria, (Beck, 2005; Zainab, 2008; Herbert 2008 and Atino, 2001). Although some entrepreneurs in SMEs have received both financial and non financial assistance, many are still small or are facing viability problems. In Nigeria, the SMEs sector is facing to contribute meaningfully to the national economy as was experienced elsewhere when governments advanced target support. Targeted government support to SMEs was found to translate into economic development in countries like Indonesia where SMEs accounted for 98% of employment creation and growth with Japan and Thailand having their SMEs contributing 81% and 78% to gross domestic product (GDP) (Okoh, 2009).<br/>This contrast has promoted the researcher to carryout a study to investigate the impact of small and medium scale enterprise on youth empowerment in Kaduna. As well as to find out the forms of government support render to small and medium scale enterprises in Kaduna.<br/>1.3    <strong>Objective of the Study</strong><br/>The central objective of the study is to examine the impact of small and medium scale enterprises development on youth empowerment in Kaduna Metropolis.  The specific objectives are:</p> <ol><li>To assess how small and medium scale enterprises development affect employment generation in Kaduna Metropolis.</li> <li>To investigate the forms of targeted government support rendered to small and medium scale enterprise in Kaduna Metropolis.</li> <li>To analyze the efficacy of government capacity building programmes and support to promote the development of SMEs among youth in Kaduna Metropolis.</li> <li>To evaluate the sufficiency of youths empowerment through SMEs development initiatives in Kaduna and recommend possible policy adjustments.</li> </ol> <p>1.4    <strong>Research Questions</strong><br/>In order to affectively investigate the problem of this research, the researcher formulated the following research questions:</p> <ol><li>What are the effects of small and medium scale enterprises     development on employment generation in Kaduna Metropolis?</li> <li>What kind of support does the government render to small and medium scale enterprise in Kaduna Metropolis?</li> <li>How effective is government capacity building programmes and support in promoting the development of SMEs among youths in Kaduna Metropolis?</li> </ol> <p>How sufficient is youth empowerment through SMEs development initiative in Kaduna Metropolis?<br/><strong>1.5 Statement of hypothesis</strong><br/>In order to confirm the impact of SMEs development on youth empowernment in kaduna metropolis and fully appreciate their respective relevant significance, the following hypotheses is   postulated:<br/>H0: There is no significance relationship between SMEs development and youth empowerment in Kaduna metropolis.<br/>H1: There is significant relationship between SMEs development and youth empowerment in Kaduna metropolis. <br/>1.6<strong>    Significance of the study</strong><br/>The study will be beneficial to entrepreneurship development; as such Kaduna state government can utilize the findings of the research as a basis for policy formulation as regard entrepreneurship development.<br/>The study will also contribute to the existing knowledge on entrepreneurship development.<br/>It is also worthy to note that the study can be use as a basis for further research, as the research can be use as a spring board for further research as well as a good reference material to students undertaking similar research.<br/>1.8<strong>     Scope of the study</strong><br/>The study covers an empirical examination of the effect of small and medium scale development on youth empowerment in kaduna metropolis.

SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE BUSINESSES", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study of the role of government agencies towards the development of small scale enterprises is quite interesting. These enterprise have a very important impact on the life of everybody in the society. Small independence business are everywhere and in every line of work, they can also be seen in every community. This business is as old as man. So virtually everything is done in life involved the element of business. Small scale enterprise constitutes an importance in todays business activities or system. The role of small scale enterprise in our economic history however, has been one of the distribution and contribution.<br/>Although its relative importance has decline with the growth of the big business, small scale business is till major contribution to the countries economy. Business in Nigeria today is made up of both large and small business. Today small scale enterprise have to enjoy more prestige than ever before because of its vital contribution to the nations economy. So vital is small scale business. There are successful small scale enterprise operating like the manufacturing plants, retails, stores, wholesales, drugs, computers, construction firms and hundred of other type of business. <br/>Nigeria population was estimated to be 140 million in 2007 with about 75% of this made up of small scale enterprise operators. Lack of full study of government agencies in the development of these enterprises especially, the financial institution made it impossible to   know the size, structure and function of these small scale business to the development of the economy.</p> <p>Government agencies are charged with the responsibilities among others to carryout duties and deliver utilities as may be regulated from time to time on behalf of the government for the purpose of uplifting the standard of living. Government agencies such as bank of industry (BOI) is charged with the responsibility like provision of medium and long term finances by way of equity funding, loan and lease financing, guarantees, investment in corporate bonds business development services, co-financing, working capital finance and    promotion of small scale enterprises and industries project, co-sponsoring financial institutions and small scale enterprises.<br/>This bank of industry was formerly originated from Nigerian industrial development bank limited was established in 1964 following the reconstruction of the investment company of Nigeria limited (ICON) NIDB was set up primarily to accelerate Nigerian industrialization. <br/>The bank was to conceive shortly after Nigerian attains independence in 1960. The idea was to set up development financial institution to serve as a dedicated window for channeling fund from within and outside the country to the young nation states industrial sector. Economic reconstruction fund (NERFUND) in the last regime of Obasanjo administration is renamed as BOI.</p> <ol><li><ol><li><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></li> </ol></li></ol> <p>Most government agencies have undergone number of re-organization especially bank of industry (BOI) which affect their forces and activities that leads to effective performance and lack of proper control on their activities.<br/>The most obvious problems of Bank of Industry (BOI) is how to produce or provide efficient financial resources technical assistance, security on loan given out to customer (SSE) evaluating of project that are financed which may take more time than stated at the beginning.</p> <p>Also the project time table, which depends on nature and complexity of the project, it may take one to two years sometimes longer from when project was identified to when it was commissioned.</p> <p>On the part of small scale enterprises (SSE) how effective are they utilizing the services rendered to them by the bank of industry (BOI). Also are they able to cope with the policies adopted by this agencies (BOI) in obtaining loan and other services rendered such as interest rate on capital collateral facilities and the role of government.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aims and objectives of the study is to analyse various role played by (BOI) in developing of small scale enterprises as well as the activities of government policies such s provision of infrastructural facilities, provision for local finance, facilitating and funding industries and funding institutions like the (CIRD), (FIRO) and (SSICS) to what does the policies of government are achieved towards developing Small scale enterprise.</p> <p>It is also to analyze the various ways by which bank of industries (BOI) has contributed effectively to the development of he economy through the role played in financing and provisions of other necessary features for development of Small scale enterprise.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study is to serve a reference material to other students who may write on, make research on similar topic and serve as recommendation to bank of industry (BOI) in discharging its functions to the customers as well as the mode of rendering services to the customers small scale enterprise</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>Based on the subject matter, the researcher prefer to use the following questions for research findings;</p> <ol><li>What are the problems of small scale business?</li> </ol> <ol><li>What are the roles of small scale?</li> </ol> <p>3.     Are banks of industry the sole financier of small scale enterprise      <br/>4.     Does government have favourable policies towards development of small scale enterprise</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will cover the area of activities and role played by the government agency (BOI) in developing small scale enterprises.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is not an easy assignment for a student to conduct a research work without encountering two or more problems one of such problems faced by the researcher was lack of adequate information which the researcher could obtain for necessary research work as some of the organization officials formed to be very busy and required for some signatory from the department before giving out information to be used.</p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Small Scale Enterprises (SSE):</strong> a type of business that is run and managed by a single person</p> <p><strong>NIDB</strong>:              Nigeria Industrial Development Bank<br/><strong>BOI</strong>:                 Bank of Industry<br/><strong>NBCI</strong>:               Nigeria Bank for Commerce and Industry<br/><strong>NERFUND</strong>:       National Economic reconstruction Fund<br/><strong>FIIRD</strong>:             Federal Institute of Industrial Research<br/><strong>SSCF</strong>:               Small Scale credit fund<br/><strong>Interest</strong>:          Certain amount that are charged on borrowed money<br/><strong>Capital</strong>:            Money<br/><strong>Development</strong>: The gradual growth of some thing, so that it <br/>becomes more advanced, stronger<br/><strong>Community</strong>:     Local country side</p>\n\nA CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF BANK OF INDUSTRY TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES INNIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF BANK OF INDUSTRY TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES INNIGERIA", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>It is an undisputable fact that Nigeria of the pre-independence era was predominately small scale in its productions and marketing activities. Industrial revolution brought about a shift from the orthodox trade by barter to a more sophisticated marketing system where consumers satisfaction becomes the ultimate goal of the most businesses. Thus small scale business becomes the next option since they stood a better chance of offering a more  personal relationship with customers as well as socio economic satisfactions of societal needs.<br/>Unfortunately the   over concentration on t he oil sector which Nigeria  hoped will boost economic growth led to the negligence of the small scale industries until economic depression set in during  the oil boom period. This and other factors led to the   quest for private participation in the various economic sectors through the Small Scale Industries especially in the present civilian government where the Industrial Development Centres (IDCS )  have  embarked upon a loan scheme  for small business to enhance their contribution to national economic development. The question now is, will small scale contributes to  nation's economic  development? One might wonder if this will be  realistic, but  it is quite obvious that Nigeria as a  country developing very slow due to economic dependency of the country. It therefore becomes apparent that the way out of the problem lies within Nigeria. What are found in Nigeria are basically the large scale operations which have given the most contributions to the economy of the developed nations across the globe. One would therefore questioned the backwardness of small scale business to government negligence of the small industries. Nevertheless the immense contributions of small scale industries in terms of increased industrial  output job creation, improvement of standard of livening and general economic development  has reawakened  government interest  and support on these small scale industries.</p> <p>1.1     <strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE STUDY</strong><br/>It is against this background that the next generation computers  was  established  on the 15th February 2000 to boost the computer industry without which Nigeria economy development cannot be fully achieved. The firm which started with capital base of one Hundred Thousand Naira  (N100,000) with the owners as the manager and no  organizational structure deals with booth computer  hardware and software.<br/>The services rendered by the organization include Typing, photocopying, internet services, computer assembling supply and installation of computers maintenance and training of manpower through apprenticeship. The firm has so far been able to meet the needs of business organization's and individuals within Kaduna North. <br/>Nextgen computers as it is popularly know has  over three hundred (300)customers patronizing the  business today and they have ten 10 trainees which is the maximum number accepted by the firm in order to  ensure they are given adequate and standard training and a lot of students have   graduated from the school since inception. Each apprentice pays some  amount of money. Those on certificate course pay five thousand Naira (N5,000), while the  diploma course worth twelve thousand naira (N12,000.00), the mode of payment can be  done instalmentally. The certificate course is   under  taken for a period of  six months while the diploma course  takes a period of one year  for completion. Finally  the firm is still at its growth stage and it  trying its best  to improve and expand its  cervices so as  to contribute greatly to Kaduna and   subsequently Nigeria as a  whole.                      </p> <p>1.2     <strong>STATEMENT OF GENERAL PROBLEMS</strong><br/>Small and enterprises are everywhere in every sector and are seen in every community. However Nigeria has witness the proliferation of small business aimed at increasing industrial output and subsequent economic growth and development through the efficiency of  small scale  enterprises.  <br/><br/>There are some questions however that should be asked where answers could suggest solutions to the problem under study.</p> <ul><li>What is the relationship between small scale industries and standard of living of Nigeria businessmen and entire  populace?</li> <li>Is there a positive correlation between small scale industries and economic development?                                                                      </li> <li>What is the position of the small scale enterprises under the computer  industry? Are there problems associated with  operation of both hardware and software?                                                         </li> <li>How do business  owners asses the success or otherwise?</li> <li>Does the success of the small scale industries rest only on the activities of small scale enterprises or it also depends on some macro economic variables in the environment?</li> <li>Does the success of next generation computer academy guarantee Nigeria's economic development? Or is there more to that?</li> </ul> <p>These questions among others form the foundation upon which the research  is built.</p> <p>1.3     <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of this research is to assess the ROLE OF SMALL SCALE INDUSTRIES TO NIGERIA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, other objective include: <br/>i. Assessing the possible problems which could hinder small business success.<br/>ii. Why some small business succeed <br/>iii. Assessing the size and composition of small business, their marketing, financial, legal and management aspect government intervention an other environmental factor  which  are likely to affect the small scale  industries. Suggested solutions would be made necessary after drawing conclusions from the above.<br/>1.4     <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The research is beneficial to policy makers, Next Generation Computer Academy and the general public in view of the following revelations.</p> <ul><li>To policy makers the  research will acquainttem with the joy and frustration.</li> <li>To Next Generation Computer Academy it will expose the strength and or weaknesses of their operations.</li> <li>To general public the research will serve as an asset to students especially those who intend to be come self employed, lecturers and other researches particularly in marketing accountancy and business studies.</li> </ul> <p>1.5     <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study is restricted to small scale business in the computer industry in Kaduna North and covers the operations of next generations computer academy from year 2005 till date.</p> <p>1.6     <strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Given the economic hardship in the country and prevailing cost of living it was not easy to meet up with the financial requirements of the study. Time indeed was another major consideration with too many things to met up within a short space of time preparation for test and examination. <br/>In administering the questionnaires, the respondents were quite cooperative but some of the respondents have to fill under close  supervision to avoid irrelevant answers especially where the questions were open ended. Another limitation that applied to this study is the fact that the study focuses on Next  Generation computer alone and the sample for the study restricted to Kaduna North Local  Government area only.<br/>It is however hoped that these characteristics of customers be further confirmed in other areas within the country to enable a comprehensive  review of some of the recommendations. <br/>1.7     <strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/><strong>Ho</strong>:    The small scale industries do not contribute significantly to Nigeria's economic

<p><strong>1.1  </strong><strong>      Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Over the years there have been many definitions of  entrepreneurship and they have all been acceptable definitions but i define it as the capacity and willingness to develop, organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks in order to make a profit. The most obvious example of entrepreneurship is the starting of new businesses.</p> <p>In economics, entrepreneurship combined with land, labor, natural resources and capital can produce profit. Entrepreneurial spirit is characterized by innovation and risk-taking, and is an essential  part of a nation's ability to succeed in an ever changing and increasingly competitive global marketplace.</p> <p>One can simply say that entrepreneurship as the pursuit of a self-owned business or company. Entrepreneurs are people who are willing to take risks to make a profit, whether by inventing a new product or opening their own company, it is also the behavior of starting business or taking on financial risk with the hope of making a profit. Entrepreneurship is almost a way of life. If you have it in you, then it permeates everything that you do.</p> <p>Entrepreneurship is the act of starting a company, arranging business deals and taking risks in order to make a profit through the skills acquired (Omolayo 2006). Entrepreneurship education can also be described as the term given to who has innovative ideas and also posses the ability to transforms it to profitable activities. Entrepreneurship in other words is the process of bringing together creative, innovative ideas and coupling these with management and organizational skills in order to combine people, money and resources to meet an identified need and create wealth. In the same vein, Nwangwu (2007) opined that entrepreneurship is a process of bringing together the factors of production, which include land, labour and capital so as to provide a product or service for public consumption. However, the operational definition of entrepreneurship is the willingness and ability of a person or persons to acquire educational skills to explore and exploit investment opportunities, establish and manage a successful business enterprise.</p> <p>Entrepreneur can be defined as an innovating individual who has developed an ongoing business activity where none existed before. Meredith (1983) defined an entrepreneur as a person or persons who possesses the ability to recognize and evaluate business opportunities, assemble the necessary resources to take advantage of them and take appropriate action to ensure success. Entrepreneurs are people who constantly discover new markets and try to figure out how to supply those markets efficiently and make a profit.</p> <p>An Entrepreneur is a person that searches for change, responds to change, and exploits change by converting change into business opportunity.</p> <p>Political instability and inconsistencies in the social-economic policies of successive government led to the emergence of high level unemployment in Nigeria. In the mid 80s, the Nigeria economic collapsed while youth and graduate unemployment hit the roof. There was large-scale layoff of workers and early retirements as a result of structural adjustment policies and bad economic trends in the country. In the face of this situation entrepreneurship, which would have salvaged the situation, was not encouraged. It has been observed that tertiary education has not been properly included with philosophy of self-reliance such as creating a new cultural and productive environment, that will promote pride in self-discipline, encouraging people to take part actively and freely in discussions and decisions affecting their general welfare, promoting new sets of attitudes and culture for the attainment of future challenges.</p> <p>According to Nwangwu (2007), the failure of tertiary education to inculcate the above philosophy in students has led to wastages in terms of both human and natural resources. This is because the youth and graduate from tertiary institutions are not equipped with the skills with which to exploit the natural resources that abound in Nigeria. All these factors have rendered the pursuit of self-reliance among our graduates difficult to retain. Whether technology alone will be sufficient to achieve an entrepreneurship sustainable future is unclear. This will depend on public and private support for entrepreneurship beneficial technologies and the extent to which further growth in world population and economic output will compromise per capita emissions reductions and a more efficient use of natural resources.</p> <p>Sustainable development is a pattern of economic growth in which resource use aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for generations to come (Paul, 2005). Sustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social challenges faced by humanity. Sustainable development requires balancing environmental, societal and economic considerations in the pursuit of development and an improved quality of life. Sustainability includes intergenerational equity, gender equity, just and peaceful societies, social tolerance, environmental preservation and restoration, poverty alleviation and natural resource conservation (Paul, 2005). The major essential tool for achieving sustainable development includes the following:</p> <ul><li>Improve the quality of basic education;</li> <li>Reorient existing education programmed to address sustainable development;</li> <li>Develop public awareness and understanding; and</li> <li>Provide training for all sectors of private and civil society.</li> </ul> <p>Education for Sustainable Development is the focus or projection of education that seeks to equip people towards creating a sustainable future. Stakeholders such as government, businesses, educational institutions, media, and organizations play important roles in achieving sustainable development. Each of these sectors has a different vision of sustainable development. Some are interested in environmental preservation and protection; some have economic development interests while other may be more interested in social development. According to UNESCO (2003) the way each nation, cultural group and individual views sustainable development will depend on its own values.</p> <p>In many European nations, Universities and technical colleges trained students of science, economics and business management in skills that helps to build more sustainable societies. Programs such as Peace Education, Human Right Education, Environmental Education and Youth Entrepreneur schemes are carried out in many schools (UNESCO, (2003). Hence, such initiatives help students and teachers to gain an understanding of the inter-linkages needed for sustainable development (Paul, 2005). The emphasis has been on education that will provide life and occupational skills that will enhance the potentials of individual, reinforcing self-sufficiency and improving quality of life.</p> <p>Entrepreneurial competency is defined as the capability of entrepreneurs to face effectively a critical situation by making sense of environmental constraints and by activating relational and internal specific resources’ (Iandoli, (2007). Entrepreneurial competencies are defined as individual’s traits, such as specific knowledge, motives, features, self images, social roles and abilities which result in venture’s success. Some entrepreneurial competencies can be learned through formal education, other competencies are tacit and depend on individual’s characteristics and are built during the person’s life, experience, and career (Brownell, (2006).</p> <p>Entrepreneurial competencies associated with the firm’s performance and competitiveness business growth and success (Mitchelmore and Rowley, (2010). Acquiring entrepreneurial competencies is of key importance for entrepreneurs willing to achievement oriented entrepreneurs. Issues relating to the competencies development process relating to entrepreneurs have generally been neglected. Competencies play an important role in successful entrepreneurship. Surprisingly, the research on the entrepreneurial competencies is rather limited (Mitchelmore and Rowley, (2010).</p> <p>This study examines the effect of automobile technology students’ competency on entrepreneurship for sustainable development in Lagos State. Also, change in basic technologies of production, transport and consumption rather than modifications of existing products and processes or the adoption of end-of-pipe technologies are also considered.</p> <p>However, such changes alone will be largely insufficient for achieving the ultimate goal of sustainable development. To achieve that, more fundamental changes in technology are needed.</p> <p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>There are basically two ways a graduate can end up , either into the soft skill level which is gaining employment in a corporate world(white-collar job) or entrepreneurial skills(business owner) to start one’s own business. In Nigeria’s economic environment which has unemployment as one of its major problems, it is of benefit that when a student acquires proper knowledge in entrepreneurship skills such student would be able to discover what they can lay their hands on if corporate employment does not come. The importance of entrepreneurship to any economy is like that of entrepreneurship in any community. Entrepreneurial activity and the resultant financial gain are always of benefit to a country. If a student has entrepreneurship skills then they will recognize a genuine opportunity when you come across one and that makes unemployment reduction possible.</p> <p>The present education system encourages cramming and memory and not on creativity and practical application of knowledge and this is unhealthy and unstable for a virile technological advancement and   entrepreneurship development .Also fear of failure by the people to take risk on entrepreneurial activities, while an unstable and conducive political environment drives away people that are planning to embark on entrepreneurial activities hence it does not make knowledge delivery on entrepreneurial skills available to students.</p> <p>In addition, government programs are not designed to promote technological and entrepreneurship sustainability in Nigeria, the level of infrastructural development provided by the government is still very low and this has been affecting to a very high extent the level of productivity and entrepreneurial activities in the country.Judging by the figures that are coming out of the Education Ministry in Nigeria, In the last few years, at least 60% of graduates are not able to get employment immediately. Because of that, they go into one entrepreneurial venture or another, but unfortunately they have not been adequately prepared to face the challenges of venturing.</p> <p>Introduction of entrepreneurship skills in our curriculum and making it compulsory in education system in order to prepare students for proper skills needed in venturing into any business they can after graduating as this will help reduce unemployment. However, the education institution need to encourage entrepreneurship skills right from the curriculum itself and government should also take initiative in encouraging the students by providing conducive climate for the same.</p> <p>Teachers and faculties should motivate students in being interested in this aspect of the curriculum and it should be emphasized as a very important knowledge that may be useful after completion of studies.</p> <p>More so, Entrepreneurial development through education will advance the economy of the nation hence much credence should be given to it and ingrained with focus on profitable personal development. Infrastructure provision and non-profitable organization invitation into sponsoring various entrepreneurial programs and funding in institutions is a very important aspect in the growth and development of entrepreneurship development and employment level of a nation.</p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study will be to:</p> <ol><li>Examine automobile technology student competency on entrepreneurship.</li> <li>Find out the effect of entrepreneurship on sustainable development in Lagos state.</li> <li>Explores some of the policy issues in achieving a shift towards a more sustainable development in Lagos State.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The result of this studies will be useful to the youth both graduates and undergraduates. This is because it will help them to be aware, prepare and improve on personal development of their entrepreneurial skills hence gives chance to those who are not lucky or do not become gainfully employed in the so called ‘White-Collar’ jobs to start their own business with the little possible finance they lay their hands on.</p> <p>Secondly, The result of the study will be useful to the government as it will lay emphasis on the various ways in which entrepreneurship skill development in students can reduce unemployment and also point out the various ways this can be done and policies that will be put in place to make sure that entrepreneurial activities can be directed toward productive ends conducive to economic progress.</p> <p>Thirdly, the society is a large faction to gain from this study by making known the importance of delivering the knowledge of entrepreneurship skills can go a long way to meet local needs from hairdresser, financial consultant, emergency plumber and other local but important business owners.

Before now, entrepreneurs have been recognized as an essential ingredient of economic development. The manner it has been explained in the Western societies has varied from time to time to suit the changing values of socio-economic reality.</p> <p>To Schumpeter (1961), an entrepreneur is a dynamic agent of change, or the catalyst who transformed increasingly physical natural and human resources into corresponding production possibilities. For any economy to grow and develop there is need for entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship has been defined as the willingness and ability of an individual to seek out investment opportunities, establish and run an enterprise successfully. Over the years, several attempts have been made to explain economic growth, within the past three decades or so, one factor which has been emphasized as a pre-requisite to economic growth is entrepreneurship.</p> <p>In the context of our society, an entrepreneur will be assumed to include any person who runs a business. Thus, the man who owns a departmental store, bookshop, beer parlour, printing press, beauty saloon, publisher, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer etc is an entrepreneur (Nwachukwu, 1990) small and medium scale business owners in this country have on their own made immense contribution to the development of the national economy over the year.</p> <p>On the other hand, despite the contributions made by entrepreneurs to the economy they are often faced with some problems which include:</p> <p>v <strong>High Degree of Business Uncertainty:</strong> Entrepreneurship development is faced with high level of uncertainty associated with enterprise ownership, there is constant threat of government interventions, political instability and degrees etc. Because of these, one has to expect changes in monetary policy, credit policy, etc.</p> <p>v <strong>Limited Profit Opportunities:</strong> This is as a result of low level of real income and limited market, even now, the situation is the same with economic depression and most business enterprise are folding up because they cannot break even what more making profit.</p> <p>v <strong>Problem of Power Supply:</strong> Power failure possesses a lot of problem for entrepreneurs which make them spend more for alternative resources.</p> <p>v <strong>Insufficient Capital:</strong> Most entrepreneurs find it difficult to borrow from banks, because of the processes involved and because of this reasons, he/she has limited resources to work with.</p> <p>Other problem encountered by entrepreneurs include family problem, emotional problem, work overload, cultural barrier, work insecurity, work pressure, high cost of materials etc.</p> <p>All these and lots more causes problem for small scale business owners which might lead to stress. The effect of stress in the work place can be sometimes serve that same researchers have been prompted to equate it effect with “combat stress” or battle fatigue.” (Nelson et al). stress lowers individual and organisational performance which lead to both production and quality suffering (Nelson and Quick, 1996).</p> <p><strong>1.2             </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Stress in the workplace is a growing problem with extensive cost to individual, organisations and the society at large. Often times, small business owners are faced with high level of stress, this is because work and its demand often dominate their lives (Jamal, 1997), clear separation between work and non-work activities are frequently non-existence, moreover, an average work day can easily extend to 12 hours or longer (Jamal and Badawi, 1995).</p> <p>Although many industrialised nations and their citizens might be enjoying the frit of their industrial revolution through ever-higher standard of labour they are enjoying these fruits less than was anticipated. This may be due to large measure to the excessive level of stress in their lives (Karasek et al.,) stress is widely accepted as a potential drawback of small business owners (Akande, 1992 et al).</p> <p>Therefore, this study will examine how stress affect the performance of small business entrepreneurs and also evaluate the problems associated with stress in business and probably suggest solutions.</p> <p><strong>1.3             </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives for this study include:</p> <p>v To determine the impact of business stress on the performance of small business entrepreneurs.</p> <p>v To determine the impact of work motivation on the performance of small business entrepreneurs.</p> <p>v To determine the impact of social support on the performance of small business entrepreneurs</p> <p>v To determine the impact of collegiality on the performance of small business entrepreneurs</p> <p>v To determine the effect of unmet expectation on the performance of small business entrepreneurs</p> <p>v To determine the impact of autonomy in the performance of small business entrepreneurs.</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>This research would be guided by the following questions, and hypothesis</p> <ul><li>How does stress affect the performance of small scale business?</li> <li>How often do you experience business stress?</li> <li>What are the causes of business stress?</li> <li> What measure can be taken to over-come business stress?</li> <li>How do businessstress contribute to the failure of Small-scale businesss? <ul><li>In what way does stress affect ones performance?</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>To provide answer to the research questions arising from this study, the following hypotheses are postulated.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis One</strong></p> <p>Ho:    There is no significant relationship between business stress and business performance</p> <p>H1:    There is significant relationship between business stress and business performance</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Two</strong></p> <p>Ho:    There is no significant relationship between business stress and negative affectivity</p> <p>H1:    There is significant relationship between business stress and negative affectivity</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Three</strong></p> <p>Ho:    There is no significant relationship between business stress and work motivation</p> <p>H1:    There is significant relationship between business stress and work motivation</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Four</strong></p> <p>Ho:    There is no significant relationship between business stress and marital status</p> <p>H1:    There is significant relationship between business stress and marital status</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Five</strong></p> <p>Ho:    There is no significant relationship between business stress and the numbers of years in business.</p> <p>H1:    There is significant relationship between business stress and the numbers of years in business</p> <p><strong>1.6     RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The study is based on primary data collected using a structured questionnaire which  was basically structured questions relating to the objectives use study. Chi-square was being employed to analyse the information collected.</p> <p><strong>1.7SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Numerous studies has explored the causes of occupational stress and these include: the  pressures, job dissatisfaction, job insecurity, poor supervision, boring repetitive work, work over load, lack of communication, too much or too little responsibility, poor work/life balance etc (Kaal, 1973).  Little is known on how work motivation, social support and collegiality help to reduce the impact of stress on performance of small business entrepreneurs, and how unmet expectation also affects their performance.</p> <p>This research therefore helps to advance the researchers knowledge in respect to the topic and also enable her contribute to the finding of solution to the problem for which the research is based.</p> <p><strong>1.8SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study is limited to some particular businesses such as the Mechanical/Autorical, Transport Service, Business Venture/Bulk Sales (Antisan). This is to say that the study is restricted to some selected workers and some business eexecutive in Yaba Area of Lagos State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.9LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the course of the study, there were some set backs that have hindered the full realisation of the objective of this study.  First, is that the study is limited to only 100 business owners compared to the large number of entrepreneurs in LagosState.</p> <p>Also, there was a poor response by some entrepreneurs especially the Transport Service who less believe in paper work and therefore fail to fill their questionnaires promptly, while some collected the questionnaires and refuse to return them thereby reducing the total number of questionnaires distributed.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF BUSINESS STRESS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SMALL SCALE ENTERPRENEUR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF BUSINESS STRESS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SMALL SCALE ENTERPRENEUR", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1       Background to the Study</p> <p>1.2       Statement of Problem</p> <p>1.3       Objective of the Study</p> <p>1.4       Research Question</p> <p>1.5       Statement of the Hypothesis</p> <p>1.6       Scope of the Study</p> <p>1.7       Definition of Terms</p> <p>1.8       Justification of the study</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>2.0       Introduction</p> <p>2.1       Trade Exhibition Defined</p> <p>2.2              Concepts Of Trade Exhibition</p> <p>2.3              Trade Exhibition And Advertising</p> <p>2.4              Importance Of Trade Exhibition</p> <p>2.5              Reason For Trade Exhibition</p> <p>2.6              Importance Of Exhibition In Marketing Of Consumer Goods</p> <p>2.7              Evaluation Trade Exhibition Results</p> <p>2.8              Marketing Communication</p> <p>2.9              Small &amp; Medium Scale Entrepreneurship</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p><strong>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>3.1       Research Design</p> <p>3.2       Determination Of Population And Sample Size</p> <p>3.3              Sampling Techniques</p> <p>3.4              Data Collection Method</p> <p>3.5              Research Instrument</p> <p>3.6       Questionnaire Design</p> <p>3.7       Validity</p> <p>3.8       Reliability</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p><strong>DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p>4.1       Bio-Data Analysis</p> <p>4.2       The Consumer</p> <p>4.3       Test Hypothesis</p> <p>4.4       Discussion of Findings</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.0       Summary Conclusion &amp; Recommendation</p> <p>5.1       Conclusion</p> <p>5.2       Recommendation</p> <p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The origin and traditional background of trade fairs can be traced to the time when neither good communication network of security needed for the establishment of pertinent commercial relationship were easily obtain.</p> <p>The first significant trade fair in Nigeria was held in 1960 to add glamour to Nigeria Independence Celebration, through with less business motives.  The first trade fairs with international magnitude was held in 1977 and 60 countries attended.</p> <p>Over the years companies have come to accept trade exhibition as an effective way of creating awareness and this invariably stimulate the demand for their product.  Trade Fair or exhibition can be effectively used regardless of the product lifecycle but it will be better applied at the introduction stage of a product.</p> <p>This will allow patient consumers to know the product use and its design. It is noteworthy that trade exhibition could be as small as one main exhibition in one room apartment, it can also be general or specialized exhibition, which could be held for commercial and non-commercial exhibition we are however interested in commercial exhibition.  In recent time trade exhibition has gained prominence in the manufacturing industries.  At present three international trade fair were held annually in Nigeria, Lagos, Kaduna &amp; Enugu international trade fairs.   These fairs are organized by the Nigerian Association of Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA).</p> <p>The reason for organisation participation in trade exhibition as given by Christian Peterson (1972) are as follow:-</p> <ol><li>It could be used to create positions impression on the mind of the potential buyers or to correct negative impressions.</li> <li>It could be used to serve as opportunity for a company without a regular sales force to show case their product to the public.</li> <li>Trade exhibition could be used to test marketing product pending commercialization.</li> <li>Trade exhibition could be used to test marketing product pending commercialization.</li> <li>Trade exhibition could be used to show trade prestige i.e. if a company want to be seen among it competitors as a leader.</li> <li>Trade exhibition is specifically use by small scale business to compete with large firm in already crowded business.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>I have been encouraged to write on this topic because of the attitude of some business organisation who falls to realize and appreciate the role of trade exhibition play in the survival of any business organisation.  The negative attitude of organisation toward the use of trade exhibition of promote the image of the company’s product has led to an increase level of imitation and life of many consumers are endangered and inadequate information about the organisation and its product.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research study is directed towards finding out how effective trade exhibition is in marketing of consumer goods.</p> <ol><li>To know the extent trade exhibition has created awareness for the product of the manufacturer.</li> <li>To know if trade exhibition can be used to forecast the demand for the company’s product.</li> <li>To know if trade exhibition achieve the objectives set by the company.</li> <li>To know or determine trade exhibition contribution to consumer relationship with the company.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4     Research Question</strong></p> <p>This study shall address the following research questions:</p> <p>i.          How often do you buy at trade exhibition?</p> <p>ii.         Does trade exhibition create awareness for the company product?</p> <p>iii.        Has trade exhibition influence consumer’s decision to buy a product?</p> <p>iv.        Does trade exhibition attract new consumer and increases the usages by existing consumers.</p> <p>v.         Does trade exhibition increase sales productivity in small and medium scale entrepreneurship </p> <p><strong>1.5       Statement of the Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>This study shall address the following research questions:</p> <p>H0:       Trade exhibition have no impact on the company Sales.</p> <p>H1:       Trade exhibition has impact on the company’s sales</p> <p>H0:       Trade exhibition does not create awareness for the company’s product.</p> <p> H1:      Trade exhibition create awareness for the company product.</p> <p>H0:       That trade exhibition does not used to test in the market for consumer’s product.</p> <p>H1:       That trade exhibition is used to test in the market for consumer product.</p> <p>H0:         Trade exhibition does not increase sales productivity in small and medium scale entrepreneurship.</p> <p>H1:         Trade exhibition increases sales productivity in sm0061ll and medium scale entrepreneurship </p> <p><strong>1.8       Justification of the study</strong></p> <p>Apart from the financial and time constraints that justified the scope of the a trade exhibition this study aims to get information about the effectiveness of trade exhibition in marketing consumer goods in Nigeria with special reference to a fast moving consumer goods like ANTINA beauty Soap. It is possible to know the effectiveness of trade exhibition in marketing of consumer goods, trade exhibition was a major factor that contributed to the increase in sale of a particular product that is engaged in the also creating potential awareness is always rekindie in case of old customer and customer.  This marvelous marketing advancement is usually made possible and practicable by the effect of trade exhibition strategy employed by Loyalted Product Limited.</p> <p>Trade exhibition has really contributed to the sale of company product as well as increasing turnover with the view that the personnel highly believed that trade exhibition has enormously contributed to the company progress.</p> <p><strong>1.5       Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>This research intend to throw light on the need for trade exhibition in marketing of consumer goods the finding of the study will therefore be used to:</p> <ol><li>Throw more light on how consumer react to trade exhibition and its benefit in term of informing them about the product and at the same time enhancing the company’s product image.</li> <li>The management of the company concerned will be able to know those that may arise as a result of competition.</li> <li>It help the management of Loyalted Limited to really comprehend the benefit of trade exhibition.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.6 Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of study is exclusively restricted to the operation department marketing in small &amp; medium scale entrepreneurship. However, it should not be misconceived that the study has no relevance to other organizations in Nigeria they are bound to face such problem considering the globalized nature of organizational environment.</p> <p>The present study is limited to many aspects. Providing information of effective trade exhibition as a marketing tool in small &amp; medium scale entrepreneurship. It is not possible to take into consideration each and every criterion in this study.</p> <p>It will be very difficult to carry out the study of this nature virtually every company in <br/>Nigeria (both public and private sector) in Nigeria.  Hence, the researcher decided {enter her study on effectiveness of trade exhibition as a marketing tool in small &amp; medium scale entrepreneurship.

While it is proper that research and development programme should be embanked upon.                              </p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p><strong>                                                                Pages</strong></p> <p><strong>Title page                                                                 i      </strong></p> <p><strong>Certification                                                             ii</strong></p> <p><strong>Dedication                                                                        iii</strong></p> <p><strong>Acknowledgement                                                     iv</strong></p> <p><strong>Abstract                                                                    vi</strong></p> <p><strong>Table of content                                                               vii</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Historical Background of  Nestle Nigeira  Plc    1  </strong></p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of  research problems                               4 </strong></p> <p><strong>1.3   Objectives of the study                                    5</strong></p> <p><strong>1.4   Statement of Research questions                              6</strong></p> <p><strong>1.5   Statements of research hypotheses                   6</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6   Significance of the study                                  7</strong></p> <p><strong>1.7   Scope and Limitations of the study                   7</strong></p> <p><strong>1.8   Operational  Definition of terms                                8</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>2.1   Introduction                                                     9</strong></p> <p><strong>2.2   Historical background of strategy                              14</strong></p> <p><strong>2.3   Theoretical frame work                                             15</strong></p> <p><strong>2.3.1 The classical theory of strategy                                16</strong></p> <p><strong>2.3.2 The evolution theory of strategy                               16  </strong></p> <p><strong>2.3.3 The proccessual  theory of strategy                  17  </strong></p> <p><strong>2.3.4 Systemic  theory of strategy                                     18</strong></p> <p><strong>2.4   Backward integration strategy                           19  </strong></p> <p><strong>2.5   Problems of benefits of backward integration strategy23  </strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p><strong>RESEARCH METHODS</strong></p> <p><strong>3.1   Introduction                                                    48</strong></p> <p><strong>3.2   Research design                                                        48</strong></p> <p><strong>3.3   Characteristics of population of the study         49</strong></p> <p><strong>3.4   Sample size and sampling design                               49  </strong></p> <p><strong>3.5   Re statement of research questions                   50           </strong></p> <p><strong>3.5   Re-statement of research hypotheses                        50  </strong></p> <p><strong>3.6   Analytical tools                                                         51</strong></p> <p><strong>3.7   Test of validity  and reliability  of research instrument52</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p><strong>DATA ANALYSIS  AND PRESENTATION</strong></p> <p><strong>4.1   Introduction                                                     53</strong></p> <p><strong>4.2   Frequency table                                                        53  </strong></p> <p><strong>4.3   Chi-square                                                        67  </strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p> <p><strong>5.1   Summary of findings                                         74 </strong></p> <p><strong>5.2   Conclusion                                                               75</strong></p> <p><strong>5.3   Recommendations                                            75</strong></p> <p><strong>5.4   Limitations                                                               76</strong></p> <p><strong>        Bibliography                                                     77</strong></p> <p><strong>        Appendix                                                          81</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF NESTLE NIGERIA PLC</strong></p> <p>Nestle Nigeria plc is associated with the nestle group, the single largest food company in the world and it is known worldwide for its top quality products.</p> <p>Nestle Nigeria plc began simple trading in 1961 and has today grown into a leading manufacturing and marketing company. It is a public quoted company listed since 1978 on the Nigeria stock exchange with about 20,500 shareholders participating.</p> <p>Nestle Nigeria Plc of Switzerland owns about 43% of the company’s equity. Nestle Nigeria plc manufacturing complex is located at Agbara Industrial Estate in Ogun State.</p> <p>The main products were designed in line with modern manufacturing methods which ensure efficient production of the following:</p> <p>v Infant cereals – nestle golden morn.</p> <p>v Instant family cereals, nestle milo – beverage drink.</p> <p>v Chocomilo – chocolate sweets, maggi cubes, maggi chicken, maggi crayfish, maggi super onion spices.</p> <p>Nestle Nigeria plc obtains most of its agricultural raw materials locally from contract farmers and out growers in partnering agreement that enables the benefits from the technical advice and assistance of the company’s agricultural services department and at the same time, guarantee to the company continuous supply of raw materials that meet their high quality standards.</p> <p>The company pursue the use of backward integration strategy by pursuing its sustainable agricultural initiative(SAI) where she involve herself with collaborative research with the university of agriculture, Abeokuta(UAAB) of popularisation of soya beans which brought into being the a selection of soya beans varieties with improved seed colour, seed size, and seed yield.</p> <p>The company’s objective is to satisfy the requirements of the consumers with high quality food products with long shelf life adapted to the taste and food habits of the consumers and as a result, she has continuously invested in Nigeria by building and commissioning in 1991 at agbara, ogun state a fully integrated plant producing concentrated sorghum malt extract from locally malted sorghum, and in June 1995, Nestle Nigeria plc commissioned another plant at agbara which produces enzymatic hydrolyzed plant protein mix.(EHPPM).</p> <p>The investments represent successful and significant effort at replacing imported raw materials in the manufacture of milo food drink and the maggi range seasonings.</p> <p>The company being conscious of her social responsibility is committed to environmental policies, programmes, and practices into each business as an element of management in all functions. She always thrives to minimize the impact of her environment through the utilization of packaging and manufacturing process that are internationally recognized to have a minimum impact on the environment.</p> <p>With her historical root in nutrition, wide product portfolio, strong brands, research and development competence, skilled and motivated professionals, and efficient management, the company is positioned to committed to the progress, prosperity, economic development, and industrial growth of Nigeria.</p> <p>Through the use of vertical integration strategy, the company seeks to achieve a clear cut competitive advantage over competitive products by ensuring that their products are available wherever, whenever, and however the consumers want their continuous attention is also given to developing the professional leadership skills of staffs at all levels so that they can directly contribute to growth and a higher level of performance.</p> <p>To stimulate industrial growth, the company has a policy of long term sustainability business practice. Over 75% of their raw materials are sourced locally by their selves through the use of employed farmers and suppliers and also support an ever increasing standard of living through employment generation, increased income, infrastructure improvements, and a growing concern for the interest of the community here in Nigeria through the application of the nestle environmental management (NEM) and complies with applicable environmental legislation.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>In this twenty first century, the world is a global market (Diacon, 2003) characterized by competitiveness where a firm has to compete against another firm all over the world. Backward integration strategy has helped to identify the things that need to be done, gives idea, redefined by experience, as to how they should be done and achieve competitive advantage for the organization.</p> <p>Backward integration strategy is known and accepted as the process by which a firm takes ownership or increased control of its supply system. It serves to streamline the organization to provide better cost controls, and to eliminate the middleman, because of efficiency and lowered cost of production as it is possible for the firm to become more competitive in the market place.</p> <p>Although backward integration strategy improves organizations performance, but there are still doubts on the assertions that backward integration strategy is more applicable to manufacturing firms as compare to service companies. Therefore, the assertions can be made to the followings:</p> <p>v Managing employees’ performance as an integral part of the work.</p> <p>v Quality metrics that were not focused on customers.</p> <p>v The effect of contraction in output that slackening global demand is generating.</p> <p>v Lack of availability of skilled workforce.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of this research study includes the following:</p> <p>v To compose manufacturing industry to the usefulness of Backward integration strategy as designing a management policy that documents the expectations of individual and organizational which provides a meaningful process by which employees can be rewarded for noteworthy contributions to the organization and also provide a mechanism to improve individual/organizational performance as necessary.</p> <p>v To ensure that industries, especially the manufacturing ones sees the usefulness of Backward integration strategy and how it can help in maximizing the net profit of the organization which is achievable by strategizing very simple strategies for both product lines and production processes as per making difficult decisions to cutting costs quickly and cheaply to avoid repeated morale sapping cuts.</p> <p>v To make sure that manufacturers are alerts to opportunities for expansions as valuation drops when owners look for quick exits. Research and marketing may also be the key, enabling strong positioning to take advantage of the future upturn.</p> <p>v To provide suggestions and recommendations on the effect of backward integration strategy on organizational performance and also make appropriate recommendations for future researches on the area of its specialization.</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF RESEACH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>v What effect does backward integration has on organizational performance in manufacturing industries?</p> <p>v How do manufacturers key into the need of the growing market through integration strategy?</p> <p>v Is backward integration strategy and organizational performance related to growth and profitability?</p> <p>v Does backward integration strategy focuses on customers’ satisfaction?</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p><strong>H0      :       </strong>Backward integration strategy does                                                                                               </p> <p>not have significant effect on organization’s performance.</p> <p><strong>H1      :       </strong>Backward integration strategy have significant</p> <p>effect organization’s performance.</p> <p><strong>H0      :       </strong>Backward integration strategy is the same as                           organization’s growth and expansion.</p> <p><strong>H1      :       </strong>Backward integration strategy is not the same as     organization’s        growth and expansion.</p> <p><strong>H0      :       </strong>Backward integration strategy increases an</p> <p>Organization’s  profitability.</p> <p><strong>H1      :</strong>       Backward integration strategy does not increases</p> <p>an organization’s profitability.</p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>A study of this kind is expected to make theoretical and practical contributions to the manufacturing industries.

After reviewing theory and research on small venture performance measures in general and in manufacturing industries in particular, we propose that performance measures of small business ventures constitute a combination of short-term and long-term measures. Furthermore, both types of measures include both subjective and objectives dimension. Using data from a survey of 55 workers from an enterprise in Lagos State, we found out that the characteristics of entrepreneurs have a strong impact on the performance of small business enterprises in Lagos State as the majority of the respondents generally supported the research proposition. The study emphasizes the importance of mapping the ventures achievements, allocating resources, and developing managerial skill to improve its performance and ability to survive in the long run.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1      Background to the study</p> <p>1.2      Statement of the problem</p> <p>1.3      Objectives of study</p> <p>1.4      Research Question</p> <p>1.5      Research Hypothesis</p> <p>1.6      Significance of the Study</p> <p>1.7      Limitation of Study</p> <p>1.8      Definitions of Terms</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>2.1      Introduction</p> <p>2.2      Conceptual classification of Definition of Small business Enterprises</p> <p>2.3      Theory of Research on small Business Performance measure</p> <p>2.3.1 Objectives Vs. objective performance</p> <p>2.3.2 Short-terms Long-term performance Consideration</p> <p>2.4      Small Business Enterprises and Management</p> <p>2.4.1 Advertisement Management     </p> <p>2.5      Promoting for Global Competitiveness through Best Practices</p> <p>2.6      Entrepreneurship and small Business Enterprises in Lagos State</p> <p>2.7      Financing the Small Business Enterprises</p> <p>2.8      Development programmes to Assisting the Development of  Small</p> <p>Business Enterprises         </p> <p>2.9      Limitation &amp; Shortcoming of Small Business </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p><strong>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>3.1      Introduction</p> <p>3.2      Research Design    </p> <p>3.3      Study Population               </p> <p>3.4      Sample &amp; Sampling Techniques</p> <p>3.5      Sources of Data     </p> <p>3.6      Nature of Data       </p> <p>3.7      Statement of Hypothesis</p> <p>3.8      Method of Data Analysis </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p><strong>PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS &amp; INTERPRETATION</strong></p> <p>4.1      Introduction</p> <p>4.2      Respondent’ Socio-Demographic Characteristics</p> <p>4.3      Respondent’s Response to The Research Questions</p> <p>4.4      Test of Hypothesis            </p> <p>4.5      Decision of Result  </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION &amp; RECOMMENDATION</strong></p> <p>5.1      Summary of Major Findings</p> <p>5.2      Conclusion</p> <p>5.3      Recommendations</p> <p>5.4      Suggestion for Further Study</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1            </strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project takes a broad look on the small business enterprises and their effect employment generation in Lagos State  performance, evidence from Charles Isimeme and Son Nigeria Limited, Sharon House, Plot 6, Bisi Oluwole Crescent, Agbado Lagos. Management practices of small business enterprises is a type of business which does not require any legal procedures and can be owned and managed by one man or by group of friends as the case may be. In Nigeria, the Third National Development Plan (1975-1980) Defines a small business enterprise as a manufacturing or service organization which employs not more than 10 people.</p> <p>In addition, the individual research unit of the Obafemi Awolowo University (1987) defines it as “One whose total assets or capital is less than 50,000 Naira and employing fewer than 50 fulltime workers”. Glosetal (1976) referred to it.</p> <p>Skill of motivating employees that will enable the employees work towards achieving great success.</p> <p>Skill to tackle problem before they arise i.e a good sales manager should have the foresight to see problems that can arise in the future and should take appropriate safeguard.</p> <p>Time management skills which involves manager working under tight schedule and has to keep up to the deadlines fixed by the clients, he has to have exceptional time management skills.</p> <p>A sales manager has to be diplomatic and tactful so that he can easily mediate the internal conflict that arises time to time in every company.</p> <p>Negotiating skills which involve a sales manager properly negotiating with the customers as well as with the employees.</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT MANAGEMENT</strong></p> <p>Advertisement contributes immensely in promoting the total sales of the business. Earlier advertisements used to appear in print media or electronic medical that is in the newspaper or in TV, radio and cinema. But nowadays, advertisements are being displayed on vehicle like buses, taxis and in public place like shopping mail and streets.</p> <p>Reach of advertisements has further been widened by arising of TV commercial and by advertising in company webs and other websites. Advertising creates public awareness about the particular product, which results in increase in sales and in turn increases profits. So, advertisement management plays a vital role in the success of a small business.</p> <p><strong>PROMOTING SMALL BUSINESS FOR GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS THROUGH BEST PRACTICES</strong></p> <p>The ultimate in competitiveness through best practices is the ability of the firm to gain and sustain competitive advantages over its rival at least in some areas of its operations so as to succeed in today’s highly competitive business world. This advantage may derive from a lowest cost position, which a firm enjoys in the industry while realizing better-than average returns on its investments. On the other hand, a firm may gain a competitive advantage by offering products or services with greater differentiation, which customers perceive as unique and attractive and are, therefore, willing to pay premium prices for them.</p> <p>These two broad – based options (low cost strategy and product differentiation strategy) for achieving strategic advantage dominated the scene for decades before the recent emergence of speed or quick response as an important form of competitive edge. This is the ability of a firm to respond to customer needs faster than competition. A firm must hold at least one of these options in order to succeed and earn above average returns on its investments. A firm that earns more than one of them is in a particularly strong competitive advantage when customers perceive that its  products or services are better than those of its rivals. An enterprises can, however, create this perception in numerous ways, including those mentioned briefly above. Studies have shown that in the long run, an enterprise that is unable to have one or more of these competitive advantages most probably cannot earn above normal or average profit (Dess and Miller, 1993). This is so because performance that results in only normal profits is not particularly noteworthy or attractive since normal profits are just average. It is necessary for enterprise, large or small, to strive to perform and earn above normal profits through “pursuit of advantage that is now the central theme of strategic management at the business level”. He further emphasized this point in his article “competitive advantage: The cornerstone of strategic thinking”, where he stated.</p> <p>The process  of strategic management is coming to be defined, in fact, as the management of competitive advantage i.e as a process of identifying, developing and taking advantage of enclaves in which a tangible and perceivable business advantage can be achieved.</p> <p>Since SMEs compete in the same markets with their large rivals offering the lowest prices can be successful in some instances, but it can be a dangerous approach to building a competitive advantage. By their nature, SMEs have special advantages over their large rivals that enhance their creating competitive advantages using factors other than low cost.</p> <p>The existing firms, whether small or large, typically do not welcome new competitors and may adopt various tactics to discourage new entrants to the market, the entrepreneur who wants to break into an existing market requires to fortify himself with some strategy advantage or ‘entry wedge’ to do successfully. Before selecting such a strategy, it is necessary for the entrepreneur to recognize and understand the underlying forces of competitive pressure so that he or she best position his or her enterprise to cope with the industry environment, otherwise, he or she would find it very difficult to create a competitive advantage. A renowned marketing and strategic management expert, Michael Porter, in his work competitive advantage, presents five marketing forces that collectively determine the nature and degree of competitive in the industry:</p> <ol><li>Bargaining power of buyers</li> <li>Threat of substitutes</li> <li>Bargaining power of suppliers</li> <li>Rivalry among existing competitors</li> <li>Threat of new competitors</li> </ol> <p>Depending on the circumstances in a given industry, the power of buyers and the threat of substitutes influence the prices that competing firms charge. The bargaining ability of powerful suppliers’ impacts on the cost of raw materials and other inputs just as the intensity of competition influences prices as well as cost of doing business in areas such as product development, sales force, advertising, plant and so forth. The threat of entry puts a limit on prices and shapes the required investment in order toward off new entrants (Moore and Petty, 1997).</p> <p>As “A wholesales whose annual sales do not exceed 9.5 million dollars is a small business”. A manufacturing company that does not have more that 250 employees is ordinarily classified as a small scale enterprise and under some circumstances it remains in that classification even though it employs up to 1000 workers.</p> <p>Management practices of small scale enterprises are however very important in the Nigerian economy and it would not be overstatement to say that are the foundations upon which the large business are built.</p> <p>Some of the importances are listed below:</p> <ul><li>They constitute the very basis of the national economy.</li> <li>They initiate the development of local technology.</li> <li>They provide an effective means of stimulating indigenous entrepreneurship.</li> <li>They foster greater employment creation per unit capital invested.</li> <li>They help to mitigate rural-urban migration.</li> </ul> <p>Having defined small scale enterprises, emphasis will now be placed on sourcing of funds, promotional mix and marketing. The situation quite easy to state but the task of accomplishing it requires the combination of many resources of the organization which would be communicated in form of messages to the consumer and Nigeria as a country. This will lead to increase in the business profit. Small scale enterprises sources for funds from friends, relatives and personal income but sometimes find it difficult to secure loans from banks they have no collateral securities.</p> <p><strong>Promotional Mix:</strong> Is made up of advertising, personal selling, publicity and sales promotion. It is obvious that a business cannot exist in isolation of the society in which it operates. Therefore, promotional activities and source of fund should view with all seriousness and its importance is immeasurable and unlimited in the processing and marketing of goods and services.</p> <p><strong>1.2            </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Management practices of small scale enterprises has a lot of positive impact on performance and such impact includes processing, distribution and marketing of products to the consumers in the desired quantity through middlemen or directly to the consumers. However, this service could be hindered by the following factors:</p> <ul><li>Financial Shortage: Capital is in short because the business lacks the collateral security to enable it secure loans for expansion and this impose a serious constraints on the aspirants of the entrepreneurs and business ventures.</li> </ul> <p>1.3      <strong>OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <ul><li> To determine if advertising is effective in the promotion of sales in small business enterprises.</li> <li>To ascertain whether sales will improve in future if there is further improvement in innovation.</li> <li>To know the extent to which SBEs have contributed to improvement on the industrial productivity in Nigeria.</li> </ul> <p>In the course of this study, the researcher recognized the hostile economic climate of the country as a result of the government economic policy and its effect on the business. The report will focus mainly on the following:</p> <p>The impact of unstable policies introduced by the government and its effect on process and fund management. This impact of the unstable exchange rate on the economy causing inflation and loss in money value.</p> <p>The distribution policy of the economy and its effect on the business. The effect of some government agencies on management practices of small scale enterprises. To offer advise on how management practices of small scale enterprises could increase its profit and also how it can survive by procuring enough funds, through marketing activities necessitate this study.</p> <p><strong>1.4            </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ul><li>Do small and Medium scale enterprise create more employment opportunities for the citizenry?</li> <li>Do small and medium scale enterprises generate more income for the government?</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.5            </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>Ho:</strong> Small and medium scale enterprises do not create more employment opportunities for the citizenry.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Hi: </strong>Small and medium scale enterprises creates more employment opportunities for the citizenry.</p> <ol><li><strong>Ho:</strong> Small and medium scale enterprises do not generate more income for the government.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Hi:</strong> Small and Medium Scale Enterprises generate more income for the government.</p> <p><strong>1.6            </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Nigeria organization regularly spend huge sum of money and other resources on processing and promotional strategies. The study of the effective processing and promotion strategies for product is to identify the areas that can be improved upon and maximize the returns on promotional activities. This study is aimed at encouraging management practices of small scale enterprises to look into future rather than limiting its ideas on the present happening in the country.</p> <p>It is viewed that most management practices of small scale enterprises in the next few years find it difficult to replace their machinery and equipment because of high replacement cost even though they have been making profit in the past, it could lead to the fold up of many business and as such the consumer will suffer because small scaling distribution of resources and products is even.</p> <p><strong>1.7            </strong><strong>LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study covers areas of Ogun State and will be restricted to Charles Isimeme and Sons Nigeria Limited, Sharon House, Plot 6, Bisi Oluwole Crescent Richard Olagoke Street, Alli-Ishiba Igbala, Sango- Otta, Ogun State.</p> <p>The management practices of small scale enterprises is a business that can be set up with some amount of capital which is relatively scarce and difficult to raise. Also, there is limited time available for this study coupled with academic work. It cannot be studied in a single study, however the availability of raw materials and human resources and types of funds are relevant to this type of business.</p> <p><strong>1.8            </strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Small scale enterprises serve as a good starting point for young entrepreneurs. They have some special characteristics that distinguish them from large ones. People go into such business to make money or as a result of inheritance, others find themselves in small businesses due to job dissatisfaction or desire for independence. For the purpose of this research work, there will be need to defines the following terms as they will be used interchangeably.</p> <ul><li><strong>Business:</strong> There is the sum total of the organized efforts by which people engaged in commerce and industry provides the goods and services needed to maintain and improve the standard of living and quality of life to which each of us may aspire.</li> <li><strong>Entrepreneur:</strong> This is the individual or group who engages in business under capitalistic system to earn to a profit anticipating and satisfying the needs and wants of the people.</li> <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This consists of those efforts which affect transfer in ownership of goods and care for their physical distribution.</li> <li><strong>Marketing Mix:</strong> This refers to the combination of decision elements in a company’s programmes.</li> <li><strong>Selling:</strong> This refers to the functions and activities undertaken to secure the ‘scale’ or distribution of the quality and design of the products manufactured by a firm among consumers.</li> <li><strong>Sales Promotion:</strong> This includes “those marketing activities and publicity, that stimulate consumer purchasing and dealer effectiveness, such as displays, shows and expositions, demonstration, and various non recurrent selling effort not in the ordinary routine”.</li> <li><strong>Personal Selling:</strong> This is defined as the sellers promotional presentation conducted on a person-to-person basis with the buyer i.e. a direct face-to-face form of promotion.</li> <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> This is a non-personal sales presentation usually directed to a large number of potential customers with identified sponsor.

We are in uncharted territory and need people in all sectors and at all ages who can “think out of the box” to identify and pursue opportunities in new and paradigm changing ways.</p> <p>Entrepreneurship can be a societal change agent, a great enabler in all sectors.  Not everyone needs to become an entrepreneur to benefit from entrepreneurship but all members of society need to be more entrepreneurial.  The public sector, private sector, academia and non-profit sectors all have roles to play in facilitating the development of effective ecosystems that encourage and support the creation of innovative new ventures.  We need to create the types of environments that are conducive to encouraging entrepreneurial ways of thinking and behaving.</p> <p>Much has been written about the impact of entrepreneurship on economic growth.  If we are to attain the Millennium Development Goals of reducing poverty, we must develop human capital in all countries and societies, in remote regions as well as major cities, and world.  While the contexts around the world vary dramatically, entrepreneurship, in its various forms, can equip people to proactively pursue those opportunities available to them based on their local environments and cultures.  We have seen a number of “waves” in entrepreneurship education, starting a century ago, developing in phases and now expanding exponentially.  By making entrepreneurship education available to young people and adults alike, we are preparing the next wave of entrepreneurs to enable them to lead and shape our institutions, businesses and local communities and create an enabling environment for sustainable employment.</p> <p>Entrepreneurship is a sure way to bringing fulfillment to the aspiration of an individual, and a major weapon to curbing unemployment, poverty and underdevelopment problems in any country.  Consequently, its importance to the economic wellbeing of an individual and family cannot be over-emphasized. Entrepreneurship is first and foremost a mindset of human beings, focused towards the generation or profitable ideas.  Entrepreneurs are visionary, goal-driven, innovative individuals or teams that are oriented to developing a new business and making it a profitable one (Hisrich and Lagan-fox, 2005).  Nigerian economy is an emerging one that is characterized by a large influx of entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises.  The emergence of this category of people makes it somewhat important and necessary for researchers to understand and mange them effectively.</p> <p>Entrepreneurs play an important role in any given economy and are the prime movers of economic development.  Entrepreneur is derived from the French verb “entrependre” which means to undertake, to attempt, to try in hand, to contract for, or to adventure (Girad, 1962).  Entrepreneurship is the process of wealth creation and individuals referred to as entrepreneurs create this wealth by being innovative.  The traditional perspective described entrepreneurship in purely economic terms.  For example, Cantillon (1755), describes the entrepreneur as any individual who is self-employed, thereby actively taking the risk of economic uncertainty.  The entrepreneur in the context of this paper is the originator or creator of a profit seeking organ of the society or economic organization established for the purpose of providing goods and services for the consumption of the society, in which such organizations located.  The entrepreneur is often referred to as the agent of economic, technological and social systems (Ogundele and Olayemi, 2004).</p> <p>Small businesses are generally regarded as the driving force of economic growth, job creation and poverty reduction in developing countries. They have been the means through which accelerated economic growth and rapid industrialization have been achieved.  While the contributions of small businesses to development are generally acknowledged, entrepreneurs face many obstacles that limit their long-term survival and development.  Research on small-business development has shown the rate of failure in developing countries is higher than in developed world.  (Arinaitwe, 2002).  Scholars have been indicated that starting a business is a risky venture and warn that the chances of small-business owners making it past the five-year mark are very slim.  Theyshould develop both long-term and short-term strategies to guard against failure (Sauser, 2005; Monk, 2000).  In Nigeria, Arowomole, (200) asserted that every successvie government continue to emphasis on entrepreneurship emergence.  This is probably to find a better way of nurturing the emergence of entrepreneurship by looking for those determinants that could effectively and positively affect the entrepreneurship emergence as well as the performance.</p> <p>With reference to above, many past studies have documented the significant impact of entrepreneurial factors such as individual determinants, external factors and firm characteristics on entrepreneurial performance.  For instance, Mohd (2005); Blackman (2003); Ogundele (2007); Colin et al., (2005) and Lawal (2005) argued that individual determinant which is also called entrepreneurial characteristics significantly and positively affect both entrepreneurial emergence and entrepreneurial performance.  Similarly, Van de ven (1993); Mohd (2005); Arowomole (2000); Kuratko et al., (2004) and (Radiah, Mohd and Ab, 2009) have asserted that external factors predict and significantly affect entrepreneurial performance as well as the emergence of entrepreneurship of any country.  With respect of this, Van de van (1993) has further argued that any study within the field of entrepreneurship development without the consideration of external factors which he nicknamed external environment should be considered incomplete and invalid.  Accordingly, Johan et al., (2005); Mohd (2005); Lin (2006) and Dean et al., (2000) argued that firm characteristics such as firm size, nature of firm etc affect the performance of the firm.  From the above, there is no doubt that past studies have really given attention to the impact of individual determinants, external factors and firm characteristics on firm performance (Rebecca, 2009; William, 2009; Zhang et al., 2008; Okpara et al., 2007; Ogundele, 2007).  However, despite this attention extended to these factors, Man, Lau and Chan, (2002) have argued that all these factors reference in this study still deserve further attention in the study of entrepreneurship and small business.</p> <p>While different factors such as individual determinants, external factors and firm characteristics have been found to influence entrepreneurial performance to different extents, the results are often inconsistent (Man et al., 2002, Yanfeng and Si, 2008, Kisfalvi, 2002; Dean et al., 2000; Pelham, 1999; (Chandler and Hanks, 1994; Cooper, 1993).  In order to tackle this problem, past studies have suggested contingency relationships on different conditions and interactions (Fanga, Evans and Zou, 2005; man et al., 2002).</p> <p>This research attempts to ascertain, empirically, the determinants of entrepreneurial emergence and performance as a tool for sustainable employment, as perceived by indigenous entrepreneurs in Nigeria.  The assumptions being tested are that entrepreneurial emergence and performance though affected by several sets of factors if properly tackled can serve as a means or tool for sustainable employment for the Nigerian populace.</p> <p><strong>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The financial and economic crisis has added to the pre-existing economic, social and political challenges in Nigeria.  Thus, there is an urgent challenge to develop policies and strategies to generate decent and productive jobs through the promotion of sustainable micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises in Nigeria.  Recognizing the role of the entrepreneurship for growth, employment creation and poverty reduction, countries in the West African region are encouraged to engage in a process of sound economic reform, particularly tackling the promotion of an enabling business environment and the adequacy of the education system, which the labour market needs.</p> <p>Nigeria facesmany problems.  The challenges faced by entrepreneurs in developing countries are monumental and quite similar.</p> <ol><li>There is massive unemployment, partly as a result of retrenchment in government and organizations.  Due to the economic situation of the country, more “entrepreneurs” are emerging.  This is as a result of the unavailability of jobs (i.e. more supply of labor, less demand for it) in the market, and the need or search for survival.</li> </ol> <ol><li>Another challenge is the unstable and highly bureaucratic business environment.  The laws governing private enterprise, especially business registration and taxation systems, are believed to be overly and difficult to understand.  Contract and private property laws are often poorly designed and/or enforced.  As suggested by Kiggundu(2002), Pope (2001), and Stevenson (1998) the unfavorable institutional/regulatory environment is often accompanied by the added expenses of corruption and bribery.  Other problems encountered by entrepreneurs in transition economics include poor macroeconomic policies, limited access to short-term and long term financial capital, and a lack of managerial experience.  Nigerian entrepreneurs reported that they were frequently harassed by government officials who extorted money from their businesses.</li> </ol> <ol><li>Poor infrastructure including bad roads, water shortage, erratic electric supply, and poor telecommunication system represent additional challenges faced by small business owners (Mambula, 2002).</li> </ol> <ol><li>Difficulty in gaining access to bank credits and other financial institutions proved to be a major obstacle hindering the process of Nigerian entrepreneurship emergence.</li> </ol> <ol><li>The most serious and damaging problem threatening the state of entrepreneurship in Nigeria is a lack of government interest in and support for MSEs (Ariyo, 2005).  This poor attitude toward for private sector explains why there explains why there has never been any real attempt on the part of government to develop any programs or lasting policies to support small businesses.</li> </ol> <p>This research project studies the critical importance of sustainable enterprises through entrepreneurship in achieving social development goals, economic diversification, income generation and poverty reduction in Nigeria.  It also highlights a number of challenges facing the crucial development of entrepreneurship.  Some of the challenges are structural; others are the result of the ongoing financial and economic crisis.  A conducive business environment with an efficient legal and regulatory framework is primordial for entrepreneurship as a tool for sustainable job creation.</p> <p><strong>1.2       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The underlying principle of this study is to examine the importance on entrepreneurship as a tool for sustainable employment.  The study is also geared towards achieving the following objectives:</p> <ul><li>To examine the viability of entrepreneurship as a tool for sustainable employment.</li> <li>To raise awareness of the importance of entrepreneurship as a tool for sustainable employment.</li> <li>Consolidate existing knowledge and good practices in entrepreneurship around the world to enable the development of innovative new tools and approaches.</li> <li>Provide recommendations to governments, academia, the private sector and other actors on the development and delivery of effective entrepreneurship.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.3       RELEVANT RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following questions were designed to probe into the viability of entrepreneurship as a tool for sustainable employment.</p> <ul><li>Is entrepreneurship really a tool for sustainable employment?</li> <li>What impact does entrepreneurship have on sustainable employment?</li> <li>What challenges does entrepreneurship face in creating sustainable employment?</li> <li>Are there other benefits of entrepreneurship apart from creating sustainable employment?</li> <li>Does entrepreneurship guarantee sustainable employment?</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is expected to make contribution to knowledge in the following areas:</p> <ul><li>Provide information about entrepreneurship in relation to sustainable employment in the Nigerian economy.</li> <li>An essential material for scholarly discourse in management science relating to Entrepreneurship.</li> <li>Assist in providing information on the viability of entrepreneurship as a tool for sustainable employment in the Nigerian economy.</li> <li>Provide information on the challenges of entrepreneurship in Nigerian.</li> <li>Provide information for future research works on entrepreneurship/</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.5       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>            1.         H0:       Entrepreneurship is not a tool for sustainable employment.</p> <p>                        H1:       Entrepreneurship is a tool for sustainable employment.</p> <p>2.         H0:       Environmental and Personal factors affect entrepreneurship as a tool  for sustainable employment.</p> <p>H1:       Environmental and Personal factors do not affect entrepreneurship as a tool for sustainable employment.</p> <p><strong>1.6       SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study focuses on the viability of entrepreneurship as a tool for sustainable employment in the Nigerian economy.  It systematically analyses the steps involved in becoming an entrepreneur and creating sustainable employment.</p> <p><strong>1.7       LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is limited in scope to finding out how entrepreneurship can serve as tool for sustainable employment.  However, the selection of few small and medium scale business owners in Lagos remains a limitation of the study, as a result of inability to consider the total population of small and medium scale business owners in Lagos.  Time, cost and instruments are also part of the limitation of study.  Hence, the generalization of the finding is restricted as a result of time and cost constraint.</p>\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A TOOL FOR SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A TOOL FOR SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study delved into impact of credit management on the operation of selected small scale enterprises in Nigeria.

Many government and development organizations have focused on the promotion of medium-scale enterprise (SMEs) as a way of encouraging broaden participation in the private sector. The promotion of SMES and especially of those in the informal sector is viewed as a variable approach to sustainable development because it suits the resources in Africa.</p> <p>The contemporary business environment faced with a number of challenges particularly the globalization process is on course is attempt to standardize operation. One the strategies used in coping with globalization is credit management. Credit management refers to those decision variables that influence the amount of trade credit that is, investment in recurable which a business firm may undertake to any given time. It plays a vital role in promoting small scale industries in Nigeria.</p> <p>The promotion of small scale industrial business is well recognized and much better strategies of industries development in developed and developing countries and its ability to enhance entrepreneurial and management skills.</p> <p>In (1973) Nigeria Small Scale Industries Association defines small scale business as those having investment like capital, land, building and equipment up to 60,000 and employing no more-than fifty people.</p> <p>Some scale industries a business could be referring to the sector of economy that is mostly concern with the distribution and marketing both industrial and domestic products. According to Ajonbadi (2002) saying Small Scale Industry is an industry which the total capital employed is over 1.5 but not more than 50 million including working capital of it 100 workers.</p> <p>The research work is to analyze critically the impact analysis of credit management strategies to sector of trade, the problem in managing credit problems and with the aim of finding a lasting solution to the problems and expand the activities of small scale business in the economy in order to arose the attraction both government and individual.</p> <p><strong>1.1    STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Small medium businesses have limitations and problems that account for their failures. All business organization is irrespective of their objectives have philosophy of growth, survival and adaptiveness. (LAWAL, 1993).</p> <p>The important role which small scale enterprise play in the economics of nations, from the first to the last sage in the developmental countries makes them very relevant in many aspects of economic policies especially those of industrial development. However, the extent to which these enterprises contribute to industrial development depends on the level of growth and development of these enterprises.</p> <p>In Nigeria, just as in most other countries, small scale enterprise are more in number than large scale enterprises. This is not surprising given the nation's how level of development in both human resources and capital formation.</p> <p>Small Scale Firms like medium firms, however create bulk of the employment provided in the promotion of entrepreneurship and utilization of indigenous technology as well as ensuring even and more appropriate location of industries.</p> <p><strong>1.2    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general objective of the study is to examine the impact of credit management on the operation of selected small scale enterprises in Nigeria.</p> <p>Evidence has shown that small scale firms usually carryout <strong>\"NICHES\"</strong> and produces highly specialized service of product in a geographical area and do not perceive any clear competition.</p> <p>1.        The main purpose of this research is to understand the types of credit, standard of credit, administration of credit and credit terms.</p> <p>2.        Then review the problems of managing credit of small scale business in Nigeria, with the aim of finding lasting solution to them and possibly bring up innovational and ideas general towards expansion in the growth and development of small scale enterprises (SME) in the state.</p> <p>3.        To intensively review the role of the government over the year in the small scale industry enterprises so as to draw attention of the government to the development of the sector.</p> <p><strong>1.3    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>i)          Do survival of small scale business depend on accessibility of credit facility?</p> <p>ii)         Does institutional incentives given by government agencies affect the effort of small scale business in Nigeria?</p> <p>iii)       Is there significant relationship between credit management and small scale enterprises performance?</p> <p>iv)       To what extent do credit management influence small scale enterprises productivity?</p> <p>v)        Is there any significant relationship between credit management and small scale enterprise profitability?</p> <p>vi)       Does credit management reduce fraudulent act in SSEs?</p> <p>vii)      Does credit management reduce materials wastage in SSEs?</p> <p><strong>1.4    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>HO      -           There is no significant relationship between Credit management and</p> <p>Small Scale Business in Lagos State.</p> <p>H1       -           There is significant relationship between Credit management Small</p> <p>Scale Business in Lagos State.</p> <p>HO      -           Credit management strategy of SMEs do not have significant effects</p> <p>on their profitability.</p> <p>H1       -           Credit management strategies of small scale enterprises have a</p> <p>significant effect on their profitability.</p> <p><strong>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The important of small and medium enterprises in the economy. AT the end of the study, the researcher expects that the finding will serve as a point of reference to the managing of business organization student, professional, student of economist and general public. This study will reveal the relevant of credit management.</p> <p>This study also contributes to knowledge in terms of provisions of additional information in the form of ideas, opinions and views from the field (industry operators) to develop and move the sector forward by way of checking the relationship that exists between the financial institution and SMEs in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study covers credit management SMEs in Nigeria, particularly in Lagos State and does not extend to other sectors. This study is restricted to selected small scale enterprises in Ikeja local government of Lagos State. The study covers a representative numbers of the generality of SMEs. No special consideration is given to sex, age and nationality in collecting data from the respondents.</p> <p>The level of accuracy in this study is proportional to the availability of information that the respondents are willing to give. Also, there is this uncertainty that information given is without bias. Also, undertaking a research study is a serious business. It requires a commitment of time, money and energy, both intellectual and physical. Hence, balancing the study with academics and going to work is a Herculean task.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Definitions of Terms</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Credit Management</strong>: decision variables that influence the amount of trade credit that is, investment in recurable which a business firm may undertake to any given time.</li> <li><strong><em>Banks</em></strong><em>: </em>This is a financial institution that aid in collection of deposit and granting loans and other auxiliary service to the public.</li> <li><strong><em>Banking:</em></strong>Is a service delivery business in which information is pivotal, whether in the honoring of cheques or other withdrawals.</li> <li><strong><em>Consolidations:</em></strong>This is another term used in place of merger and acquisition.

It can also be called strategic planning. Strategic management is that set of direction and actions which leads to the development of an effective strategy to help achieve corporate objectives. It is the careful selection and correct application of tools that determine entrepreneurial success.</p> <p>It is felt that strategic management, a key pillar for corporate survival, may be adapted and applied to ensure better entrepreneurial performance on a more consistent basis. Strategic management materials appear to be written primarily for larger corporations. It suggests elaborate involvement, high cost and complex architecture as prerequisites. The reaction of Small-Scale Business Enterprise is naturally one of being intimidated; and therefore most small scale entrepreneurial  prefer to operate in the usual manner and mindset. Where there is no change, different results cannot be expected. Anthony Robbins (2007), the most famous Neurolinguistic Programming specialist, once remarked: <em>To keep on doing the same thing and expect a different result is a form of insanity.</em></p> <p>For reasons stated above, a research on strategic approach to management of Small-Scale Business Enterprises is therefore examined.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Some Nigerian Business Organizations are without formal plans or where there are formal plans they do operate without adhering to them. Some argued that the market place changes so fast for a plan to be useful. All business organizations are heading somewhere but unfortunately some do not know where they are going, then any road will lead them there. This therefore emphasizes the need for organizations to utilize strategic planning concepts.</p> <p>Strategic management implementation has been challenging to many organizations. They crunch vast amounts of consumer data, hold planning sessions frequently, and use various techniques to develop strategy. Still, they  miss the mark a lot of the times. Some strategic management problems faced by organizations include;</p> <ul><li>Companies tend to ignore one complication along the way: They can’t develop models of the increasingly complex environment in which they operate. As a result, contemporary strategic-planning processes don’t help enterprises cope with the big problems they face.</li> <li>Several Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) admit that they are confronted with issues that cannot be resolved merely by gathering additional data, defining issues more clearly, or breaking them down into small problems. Their planning techniques don’t generate fresh ideas, and implementing the solutions those processes come up with is fraught with political peril.</li> <li>Most Organizations do not progress at all walloping in serious planning problems.</li> </ul> <p>Therefore, there is need to investigate why the above problems persist and examine ways by which strategic planning could assist.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research aims at examining the impact of strategic management on the organizational performance. The specific  objectives of the study include;</p> <p>i       To appraise the value of strategic management concepts and techniques as applied to organizations.</p> <p>ii.     To examine the impact of strategic management in organisation’s success.</p> <p>iii     To provide some guidelines with which organisations can apply the strategic management ideas and skills, in a time-saving manner,</p> <p>iv    Suggest methods that may prevent major crisis and business failures.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>   <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following questions are pertinent to this work;</p> <ol><li>To what extent are strategic management concepts and techniques important in an organisation?</li> <li>Is there any significant relationship between organization strategic management and organizational performance?</li> <li>Has Lawrenzo Cargo and Logistics Ltd been able to put in place  effectively plan on how to acquire knowledge on strategic management ideas and skills?</li> <li>To what extent is Planning as a managerial function relevant to the existence of Lawrenzo Cargo and Logistics Ltd?</li> <li>What are the Strategic Management concepts and techniques organizations need to make it achieve their aims and objectives?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5   RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this study, it is necessary that working hypotheses be established. To this end, the following hypotheses were tested:</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS ONE</strong></p> <p>Ho:   There is no significant relationship between Strategic management and organizational performance</p> <p>H1:  There is significant relationship between Strategic management and organizational performance.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS TWO</strong></p> <p>Ho:  Acquiring strategic management ideas/skills is not   important to the management of an organization.</p> <p>H1:   Acquiring strategic management ideas/skills is important to the management of an organization.</p> <p><strong>1.6   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Research methodology deals with the description analysis and interpretation of various methods employed for collecting relevant information necessary for research work.</p> <p>For the purpose of collecting necessary data for this research work, primary and secondary data collection method are used. The primary data collection method will be through the following:</p> <p>1.     Structured questionnaire</p> <p>2.     Personal unstructured interview</p> <p>3.     Observation</p> <p>The secondary data are collected from reports and documents from the company. Also, materials from library and desk research literatures were used.</p> <p>In this study, descriptive method are used to analyze data and also in testing hypothesis, chi-square (X2) was employed. Findings from this research study will be discussed in the light of the research problem hypothesis, purpose research questions, literatures of the research and other relevant issues conclusions will be drawn and recommendations and suggestions also will be made.</p> <p><strong>1.7   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Without doubt, strategic management plays an integral role in the management of business. It is a managerial tool that cannot be overlooked. Hence, the motivating factor of this work is to elucidate information on the need to be more proactive in manager’s planning toward the sustenance of business enterprise.</p> <p>Strategic management endeavours to achieve effective and efficient programs to accomplish the organization’s mission. As a philosophy, it changes how managers looks at competitors, customers, markets and even the organization itself.</p> <p>The significance of this research work is to stimulate management’s awareness of the strategic implication of environmental events and internal decision.</p> <p>Strategy is needed to focus effort and promote coordination of activities. Without strategy an organization becomes bunch of individuals, hence strategy is required to ensure collective actions and concentration of efforts towards achieving organizational plans and objective</p> <p><strong>1.8     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project work examines the Impact of Strategic Management on Organisational Growth, it is designed to capture data and achieve research objectives for Lawrenzo Cargo and Logistic Ltd only.

STUDY </strong></p> <p>Small business enterprise plays a key role in expanding and diversifying industrial production and also contributes to such objectives as employment generation, poverty eradication, improved income distribution and fulfilling basic needs of most developing countries.</p> <p>Small business enterprises was defined by the Central bank of Nigeria in it’s guideline that it is any business organization with an annual turnover of less than five hundred thousand naira. (CBN Guide (2002).</p> <p>Small business enterprise may be seen as a business which is independently owned and managed and which does not dominate its relevant market segment of interest (Griffin and Ebert, 1999) Unemployment is undoubtedly a big challenge to any government, development planner the private sector and society at large. This is why it is very important to pay particular attention to the creation of employment because according to Tomori (1998), the consequence of unemployment (whether prolonged or short-term), leaves a scar on every individual, family or country that is faced with the problem.</p> <p>In the first instance, the degree of frustration and poverty experienced by the unemployed person who is willing to work but cannot find a job is considerable. His or her frustration could be transformed into violence or crime, which in-turn whether collective or individual can shake up any political system and cause instability. Second, the loss of income to individuals and households is equally great; the under-utilization of labour resources create poses a difficult problem for society in terms of the wastage in manpower resources which may have probably been expensively trained. Small business enterprises have been favored as institutions that are capable of providing solutions to the high level of unemployment menacing the country. Small business enterprises is an independent business which is managed and which does not dominate its relevant market segment  of  interest, managed by its owner or part owner and has a small market share (Bolton Report, 2006).</p> <p>Today, the unemployment problem has eaten even deeper into fabrics of the Nigeria  society  and threatened her economic growth, much more than was bargained for and has left little to be desired indeed, the situation has deteriorated to the level  that graduates of higher institution spend  up to three to four years at home after graduation without any sign of “white-collar” jobs coming their ways, thus, it has been argued that people who lose their jobs or are prematurely relieved from active civil service, pensioners delinquent youths, unemployed graduates even suffers of HIV/AIDS, all of these groups, and many others, could solve their problems of unemployment by starting a business of their own in the small business enterprises (SBEs).</p> <p>Small business enterprises believed to be the engine room for the development of any economy because they form the bulk of business activities in a growing economy like that of Lagos State. This is manifested in the following ways.   </p> <ol><li>Employment generation capacity of about fifty percentage of global working population</li> <li>Small business enterprises constitute major avenues for income generation and participation in economic activities in the lower income and developing societies.    </li> <li>National economic development prospects hangs on entrepreneurial energy of vibrant small business as most big business concern grew from small scale to become big icons.</li> <li>As they grow they protect nations from the geographical cost benefit permutations of a few multinational who are ever prepared to close up their business and relocate at the slightest provocation or appearance of economic downturn.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.1   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong>                                      </p> <p>For any economy to be developed, people must be prepared to place their money or resources on short-term and long term investment and bear business risks.  In Nigeria, there was lack of authentic up to date information on the role played by small Business Enterprises towards economic growth and development and most especially through creation of job opportunities for the people (AJALA E.M 1999)</p> <p>The irregular government policies, poor financial aid and poor infrastructural problems that ginger the cost of production, make the   small business enterprises to be baffling with survival rather than creation of employment as expected. As a result the researcher intends to find out at what rate has SBEs in Nigeria create employment.  </p> <p><strong>1.2   OBJECTIVES OF STUDY </strong>  </p> <p>The major objective of this study is to determine the role played by small business enterprises in generating employment opportunities for the people of Lagos State in order to enhance the growth and development of the economy.  </p> <ol><li>To examine the extent to which small business enterprises creates employment opportunities in Lagos State.</li> <li>To study the mechanism that assists and support small business enterprises and their contribution to employment generation.</li> <li>To examine how small business enterprises create employment opportunity in the manufacturing sector.</li> <li>To know if financial institutions encourages small business enterprises to achieve its predetermined objective.</li> <li>To study if infrastructural provision helps small business enterprises to grow in Lagos State.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3           RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.To what extent has Small Business Enterprises create employment opportunity in Lagos State?</p> <p>2.    How does Small Business Enterprises improve the standard of living of average Nigerians?      </p> <p>3.     Does financial institution help Small Business Enterprises to achieve it predetermined objectives?</p> <p>4.     To what extent has Small Business Enterprises help to reduce unemployment rate in Lagos State?</p> <p>5.     How does infrastructural provision help small business enterprise to grow in Lagos State?</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH HYPOTHESES         </strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>   Small Business enterprises have no positive impact on employment creations in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>Hi:</strong>    Small Business Enterprises have positive impact on employment creations in Lagos State</p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>   The availability of infrastructural provision on Small Business Enterprises would not have any impact on employment generation in Lagos State.  </p> <p><strong>Hi:</strong>    The availability of infrastructural provision on Small Business Enterprises would have impact on employment generation in Lagos State.  </p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY   </strong></p> <p>The significance of this study is very important to individual or groups, firms, and the nation at large.

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p> The ultimate goal of every firm in business is profit i.e. (Profit Maximization) and cost minimization in order to maximize shareholder wealth. Many industries today are facing problems due to the expansion through increases sales and the introduction of new product. Some on the other hand are facing problem of contraction owing to the introduction of substitute material.  It is vital that management should be in position to plan for these changing levels of activities.</p> <p>Apart from the problem of contraction and expansion during economic depression, an enterprise may be faced with the alternative of closing down or selling it at a price below the total cost.</p> <p>Hence profit planning and control becomes difficult as a result of product offered and the action of competitor. In order to solve the problem created by the above situation profit, planning, cost, and their behaviour at different separating level, one of the most important tools developed by accountants to assist management in meeting the challenges is cost volume profit analysis.</p> <p>According to I.M Pandey the analytical technique used to study the behavior of profit in response to changes in volume, cost and price, is called “Cost volume profit analysis” It is  a device used to determine the usefulness of the profit planning process of the firm.</p> <p>The entire field of profit planning has become associated with the cost volume profit relationship in organization. In micro-economics course, profit  maximization is frequently cited as the goal of the firm; Profit maximization stressed the efficient use of  capital resources but it is not specific with respect to the time frame over which profit are to be measured; Profit maximization function largely as a theoretic goal with  economist using it to prove how firms behave rationally to increase profit.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it ignores many real-world complexities that financial management firms must deal everyday with. Two major factors not considered by the profit maximization are Uncertainty and timing.</p> <p><strong>1.1   STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The rising magnitude of the incessant profit or loss in Nigeria business organization over the year has become a thing of concern to managers; government, Policymakers, academia, entrepreneurs, financial analysis, economist and other stakeholders in the country’s economy. Various studies have been carried out to explain with empirical evidence, the factors driving profit and loss in business organization</p> <p>The challenges facing most firms is numerous particularly during the period of economic depression or recession characterized by high liquidation of many companies, merger and acquisition, low technological powers, shortage of foreign exchange to buy needed raw material, high cost of production, erratic powers supply, high volume of imported goods and the advanced state of competition has affected drastically the maximization profit and cost maximization in most business organisation.</p> <p>In a competitive world the key factors are cost price turnover and profit and these are factors which no business organization can ignore.</p> <ol><li>Management is faced with the problem of how to make effective and efficient use of their available scarce resources in order to achieve the objective of profit maximization.</li> <li>Most management and organization lack under-standing on the importance of cost minimization as an effective tool or technique that has help in the sustainability on most business organization.</li> <li>Most organization is faced with high cost of production which has led to inefficient utilization of the cost volume profit analysis technique.   </li> </ol> <p><strong>1.2   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Profit planning and control are essential ingredients of every successful business in the world. The efficiency of management is measured by the amount of profit or loss in a given accounting year. The general objective of this study therefore will be;</p> <p>1)           To find a way of making use of scarce resource in order to achieve profit maximization.</p> <p>2)           To highlight the importance of profit using cost volume profit analysis over other forms of technique.</p> <p>3)           To identify the problems encountered in the economy that leads to lack of practical application of profit maximization.</p> <p>4)           To evaluate the extent to which the use of profit maximization on Dangote Cement Plc has been efficient.</p> <p><strong>1.3   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1)           Does your organization use cost volume profit analysis as a tool for profit planning and control?</p> <p>2)           Apart from cost volume profit analysis; what other techniques do you employ in the profit planning and control?</p> <p>3)           What problems does Dangote Cement Plc encounter in the profit planning and control?</p> <p>4)           In what ways specifically has the application of cost volume profit analysis helped the organization to achieve efficiency and effectiveness?</p> <p><strong>1.4      STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>1.     HO:   Cost volume profit analysis as a tool for profit planning and control is  not used in Dangote Cement Plc.</p> <p>        H1:   Cost volume profit analysis as a tool for profit planning and control in Dangote Cement Plc.</p> <p>2.     HO:   The application of cost volume profit analysis has not helped Dangote Cement Plc to be efficient and effective in its operations.</p> <p>        H1:   The application of cost volume profit analysis has helped Dangote Cement Plc to be efficient and effective in its operations.</p> <p>3.     HO:   Dangote Cement Plc does not employ other techniques in  profit planning and control apart from cost volume profit analysis.</p> <p>        H1:   Dangote Cement Plc employs other techniques in profit</p> <p>        planning and control apart from cost volume profit analysis.</p> <p><strong>1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is hoped that this study will be of importance to students (Accounting, Banking and Finance, Business Administration, Economics etc) staff and management of business organization, the individuals in banking profession and the shareholders of the companies.</p> <p>The students are to be aware of the role played by profit maximization in business organization. Profit maximization is an essential tool in all business organization.</p> <p>In a competitive world, the key factors are cost, price turnover and profit, and these are factors which no business organization can ignore. Therefore, the significance of the study is as follows:</p> <ol><li>How the study of profit maximization and cost minimization of Dangote Cement Plc knows how their profit margin is increasing over time.</li> </ol> <p>2.     It is useful to student in schools since it will serve as a source of reference to them in the nearest future.</p> <p>3.     It is useful to the state since it is used by government in making decision for improvement of the states.</p> <p>4.     It is useful to the economy as a whole since it is used by policy makers to maximize profit in the economy.</p> <p>5.     It is a basis for understanding, contribution, margin pricing, related short run decisions and transfer pricing.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is to analyze the effectiveness of profit maximization tool in business growth in Nigeria as a tool for profit planning and control in general but with particular reference to Dangote Cement Plc. This is with the view of finding out how the company, has been able to manage cost in order to maximize profit.</p> <p><strong>1.7   LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study of the effectiveness of profit maximization as strategic tool in business growth in Nigeria using Dangote Cement Plc., Lagos State. In carrying out this study, I was faced with number of constraints some of which are:</p> <p><strong>FINANCE:</strong> Inadequacies of funds affected expenses on distribution and collection of questionnaires to respondent and from respondents; printing of questionnaires and other transport expenses in conducting the research.</p> <p>TIME: There is need to observe lots of protocols in respects to levels of management before the collection soring that the primary data collected would be dependable to some extent, also the rationing of time so as to accommodate my other courses.</p> <p>Nevertheless, these constraints were taken care of and with limited errors and variances. </p> <p><strong>1.8   ORGANISATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is presented in five chapters. The first chapter introduces the study and establishes the problem to be addressed in the study. The background, the scope as well as the significance of the study is also discussed. Chapter two explores the review of literature; the third chapter reviews the research methodology and theoretical framework to be used. The fourth chapter presents the result of the analysis data and trend of Dangote activities in Nigeria during the years under review; while chapter five presents the conclusion, summary and recommendation of the study.</p> <p><strong>1.9   HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF DANGOTE CEMENT INDUSTRY</strong></p> <p>Dangote Group of Companies was established in May 1981 as a trading business with, an initial focus on Cement, the group diversified overtime into a Conglomerate trading, salt, flour, sugar and fish. By the early 1990s, the Group had given into one of the largest trading conglomerate operating in the country.</p> <p>In November 1992, Dangote Cement was incorporated on 4th, it was formally known as the Obajana Cement Plc and it was commissioned in 2003 as the largest cement plant in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>In comparison to local peers, Dangote Cement Plc significantly outplays other cement manufacturers, as it presently control about 57% of local manufacturing capacity, this is expected to rise even further to about 67% on completion of Ibese plant and Obajana’s 3rd and 4th by Q1.11 combining manufacturing (excluding BCC) and imports, Dangote Cement accounted for about 40% of total Cement supply as at 2009; overall market share rose to about 49% with the inclusion of BCC.</p> <p>In line with Nigeria’s Millennium Development Goals, the huge deficit in infrastructure especially adequate housing and transportation – roads, rails and ports, present a major case for continuing growth in cement consumption in Nigeria over the next 10 years at least. Based on a broad base argument that cement demand is more likely to continue rising. In the medium to long term,</p> <p>we assess in this report, the key scenario, undergirding our expectation for cement demand in Nigeria, and present our outlook for Dangote cement’s revenue and profitability in the near to long term.</p> <p>The company was granted a pioneer status for a period of 3 years with effect from January 1st 2009. The company is therefore exempted from payment of income tax in respect of profit accruing from manufacturing and sales of cement during the period to December 1st 2011.</p> <p><strong>1.10 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>1.     <strong>BREAK EVEN POINT:</strong> This is the level of operations at which a business revenue and expired costs (expense) are exactly equal.</p> <p>2.     <strong>BUSINESS:</strong> A commercial activity engaged in as a means of livelihood or profit, or an entity which engages in such activities.

The knowledge used in practical ways in industry (Oxford 2005). It is the knowledge, process, tools, methods and systems employed in the creation of goods and improving in services. Technology is the result of man’s learned and acquired knowledge or his technical skills regarding how to do things well (Khalil, 2000). Technological innovation provides the life-blood of economic activities. Technological innovation is a tool for economic growth and the application of those inventions to meet emerging business opportunities, and to meet social needs, and environmental challenges.</p> <p>For any organization to be able to compete, it must be technologically innovative. Technological innovation and core competitiveness enjoy symbiotic relationship (Prhanlad &amp; Hamel, 1990). Technological Innovation Capability (T.I.C) is an important component of the core competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, and core competitiveness play a role in promoting or influencing technological innovation. Technology should be so designed to be able to match the marketing capability of the organization and be seen as reflecting in the strategic plan of the firm and its overall success.</p>\n\nTECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS FOR GROWTH OF SMES IN NIGERIA: THE ROLE OF MANAGEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS FOR GROWTH OF SMES IN NIGERIA: THE ROLE OF MANAGEMENT", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research work strives to evaluate the extent of development in Entrepreneurship in a depressed economy like Nigeria.  A closer and pragmatic approach was adopted by using Nigerian Association of Small-Scale Industrialists (NASSI) Enugu State Chapter.  NASSI has been seen as one of the nation’s governmental agency involved in manpower development and training and financing small-scale industrialists.

The advantages claimed for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are various, including: the encouragement of entrepreneurship (Olorunshola, 2003); the greater likelihood that SMEs will utilise labour intensive technologies (Salami, 2003) and thus have an immediate impact on employment generation (Udechukwu, 2003, Ogujiuba et. al., 2004, Henriques and Klock 1999); they can usually be established rapidly and put into operation to produce quick returns; SMEs development can encourage the process of both inter- and intra-regional decentralization (Ogujiuba et. al., 2004); and, they may well become a countervailing force against the economic power of larger enterprises (Salami, 2003). More generally the development of SMEs is seen as accelerating the achievement of wider economic and socio-economic objectives, including poverty alleviation (Udechukwu, 2003).</p> <p>Notwithstanding the recognition of the important roles SMEs play in these countries, their development is largely constrained by a number of factors, such as lack of access to appropriate technology; limited access to international markets, the existence of laws, regulations and rules that impede the development of the sector; weak institutional capacity, lack of management skills and training, and most importantly finance. While some of these factors such as financing have received adequate attention in the literature, some of them, such as technology, have not.</p> <p>Investment in technology and keeping up with information technology (IT) is increasingly important to all firms (Farag et al, 2009). Technology plays a crucial role in the development of new SMEs. Technology not only helps in evolving a multi-pronged strategy but also in maximising business opportunities. IT is perceived as essential to achieve sales. Alter (2002) noted that information has the highest likelihood of making a difference if it is integrated into structured business processes and used by people with the knowledge and training needed to interpret it and apply it correctly. Opara et al (2010) assert that the influence of technology goes beyond isolated behavioural changes for the optimization of organizational productivity; it also, affects the culture prevalent in the organization.</p> <p>However, the use of technology involves cost. Computer hardware and software need to be bought and installed. SMEs without access to capital may find it difficult to purchase necessary technology. The rising cost of production inputs in Nigeria especially the cost of electricity and other operating costs can constrain growth. It is therefore pertinent to examine the relevance of information technology to the operations of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises in Nigeria in the face of the challenging business environment.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Despite the potential role of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) to accelerated growth and job creation in developing countries, their development is hampered by a number of factors. One of these factors among others is access to Information Technology (IT). SMEs often have difficulties in gaining access to appropriate technologies and information on available techniques. Despite the numerous institutions providing training and advisory services, there is still technology-gap in the SME sector as a whole. This is because most small and medium scale entrepreneurs cannot afford the high cost of computer hardware and software.</p> <p>The inaccessibility to appropriate Information Technology places significant constraints on SME development. Even though SMEs tend to attract motivated managers, they can hardly compete with larger firms. In most cases, SMEs utilize foreign technology with a scarce technical support. The lack of support services or their relatively higher cost can hamper SMEs' efforts to improve their management, because consulting firms are often not equipped with appropriate cost-effective management solutions for SMEs. They usually acquire foreign licenses, because local patents are difficult to obtain.</p> <p><strong>1.3      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The broad objective of this study is to examine the relevance of information technology to the management of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria. The specific objectives of the study are as follows:</p> <ol><li>To evaluate the role of Information Technology in the activities and operations of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs);</li> <li>To appraise the impact of Information Technology on the managerial practice of SMEs;</li> <li>To investigate the effects of Information Technology on the performance of SMEs.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4      RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>According to the objectives stated above, the research questions that would be examined in the course of the study are as follows:</p> <ol><li>What role does Information Technology play in the activities and operations of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs)?</li> <li>How has Information Technology impacted on the managerial practice of SMEs?</li> <li>How has the adoption of Information Technology affected the performance of SMEs?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5      RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>Based on the research questions stated above, the hypotheses to be tested in the course of this research are stated below:</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS (1)</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>     That Information Technology does not play any significant role   in the activities and operations of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs).</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong>      That Information Technology plays significant role in the activities and operations of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs).</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS (2)</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>     That Information Technology has not impacted positively on the       managerial practice of SMEs.</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong>      That Information Technology has impacted positively on the managerial     practice of SMEs.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS (3)</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>      That Information Technology has not improved the performance of SMEs.</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong>      That Information Technology has improved the performance of SMEs.</p> <p><strong>1.6      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Besides finance, there are other critical elements that are germane to the survival and competitiveness of Small and Medium Scale enterprises (SMEs). One of such factor is Information Technology. This study is significant because it would help to evaluate the role of Information Technology in the activities and operations of a vital segment of the real sector - Small and Medium Scale enterprises (SMEs), which have been identified as having very high potential in promoting economic growth and development.</p> <p>While several studies had been conducted on the relevance of Information Technology to large firms, to the best of my knowledge, no study has been conducted on the relevance of same to Small and Medium Scale Enterprises especially in Nigeria. Therefore, this study would strive to bridge this research gap by establishing the link between the adoption of Information Technology and the managerial efficiency of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises.</p> <p><strong>1.7      SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Information Technology is the multi-disciplinary study of the collection, processing and storage of data; of the use of information by individuals and groups, especially within an organisational context; and of the impact, implications and management of artifacts and technologies applied to those activities. It is therefore evident that the scope of the Information Technology is broad, and encompasses both organisational and technical matters.</p> <p>This study shall focus on the extent to which Information Technology (IT) is relevant to the management of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises in Nigeria. This study shall not be restricted to the book-keeping and accounting aspects of Information Technology but shall also cover its relevance to planning and forecasting, marketing, decision-making etc. Most of the information and data needed for the study would be gathered from existing literature and from a survey that would be conducted among selected staff of Card Centre Nigeria Limited a card manufacturing company located in Victoria Island in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.8      DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>Data</strong>:- This is any symbol, sign, image, sounds or measure which is in a form which can be directly captured by a person or a machine.</li> <li><strong>Information</strong>:- This is a valuable data Until it is placed in an appropriate context, data is not information.</li> <li><strong>Technology</strong>:- This constitute all the knowledge (know-how and know­ why), products, processes, tools, methods, and systems employed in the creation of goods or in providing services (Omar and Sapuan, 2010)</li> <li><strong>Information Technology</strong>:- This is the hardware, software and other tools and equipment used by the participants while doing their work (Alter, 2002).</li> <li>Information System:- “a work system whose business process is devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulating, and displaying information, thereby supporting other work systems\" (Alter, 2002:6).</li> </ol>\n\nTHE RELEVANCE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE RELEVANCE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA", "id": 38}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER I</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The desire to build a civilized country with a strong and sound economy is the desire of every Country, including Nigeria. Tax payment is the demonstration of such a desire, although some income earners see it as a means of exploitation by the government. Tax payment is a voluntarily contribution imposed by the Government on personal income earners, companies, investors, exporters, importers etc. revenue realized from taxation is a major source of revenue to the Government of Nigeria, and as such is an important tool used in the development of Nigeria and her economy. A country’s tax policies and systems are greatly related with business ventures in that country. An economy that enacts favorable and progressive tax laws and policies will definitely breed successful and finance-healthy business organizations. Once businesses flourish, the economy flourishes as well, as there is no quicker way of stirring the affairs of an economy without the help of organizations that move services, goods, money and investments from those with surplus to those with deficit; those with marketable ideas/output to those who need these ideas and products. In essence, businesses and tax policies greatly depend on one another for survival. If one is greatly affected, the other follows suite.</p> <ol><li><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ol> <p>The Nigerian Tax System has undergone significant changes in recent times. With the help of various studies and research done by tax experts, tax laws are being reviewed with the aim of repelling obsolete provisions and simplifying the main ones. Under current Nigerian law, taxation is enforced by the 3 tiers of Government, i.e. Federal, State, and Local Government with each having its sphere clearly spelt out in the Taxes and Levies (approved list for Collection)</p> <p>Small businesses are generally recognized as important drivers of economic success. They are a key ingredient in the “ecology of firms” in a healthy economy, as job creators, sales generators and a source of tax/fiscal revenue. In Nigeria the importance of small business as a creator of jobs, particularly for those with a low skills level, is widely recognized. Small, medium and micro-enterprises (“SMMEs”) contribute 36.1% of the country’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) and employ 68.2% of the workforce in the private sector. In the agriculture, construction and retail sectors, SMMEs employ more than 80% of the total workforce. Over the last few years, the growth in employment by SMMEs has exceeded the growth in their contribution to GDP, highlighting the job creation potential of this sector of the economy.</p> <p>Regulations and red tape are reported as one of the constraints to the expansion of businesses both in Nigeria and internationally. International research in this field shows that tax regulatory compliance costs are a significant portion of the total regulatory cost. Several other patterns emerged from the various local and international studies performed, among the most important being that tax compliance costs comprise a much larger proportion of total compliance costs for smaller firms.</p> <p>Furthermore, various research has suggested that any effective approach to assist small business requires both policy and administration model adjustments in order to be effective. The 2005 year, therefore, saw the beginning of a process of structural change that was intended to build a positive tax compliance climate in Nigeria.</p> <p>This report is focused on the survey of the compliance experience of professional accountants and bookkeepers (referred to as “tax practitioners” for the purposes of this document) in respect of their small business clients in Nigeria. It will be complemented by two related surveys, one of small businesses that are registered with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), regarding their time and cost requirements for tax compliance, and one of informal businesses, regarding their perceptions about tax compliance.</p> <ol><li><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></li> </ol> <p>Small and medium enterprises (Small businesses) form the core of majority of the world’s economies. A study carried out by the Federal Office of Statistics shows that in Nigeria, small and medium enterprises make up 97% of the economy (Ariyo, 2005). However, the mortality rate of these small firms is very high. According to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) Nigeria, 80% of SMALL BUSINESSES die before their 5th anniversary. Among the factors responsible for these untimely close-ups are tax related issues, ranging from multiple taxations to enormous tax burdens etc. In many government policies, small and medium enterprises are usually viewed and treated in the same light as large corporations. However, their size and nature makes them unique. Therefore, in dealing with small and medium enterprises, these unique qualities need to be considered. In levying of taxes for these enterprises in particular, issues that need to be considered are how these tax policies can be designed to bolster the growth of Small businesses and the most effective ways to administer them. The importance of Small businesses as a mechanism of economic growth and development is often ignored. They are perceived as minute establishments that have minimal effect on the state of the economy. However, if conducive environment is created for these Small businesses to grow through proper regulation, the SME sector has the highest propensity to transform our economy. In the same light, taxes are important for the government as they are the major source of funds for government expenditure. Income obtained from taxation of individuals and businesses are used to run governments as well as provide infrastructure such as good roads, water supply, and electricity which are essential for the smooth running of these businesses that are mainly manufacturing companies and as such rely on these commodities to survive.</p> <p>Tax burden is a major problem in Nigeria as many business organizations are not favored by the tax systems and policies in place. Some businesses are already collapsing; while majority are still struggling to meet up with high tax rates to ensure their businesses still exist. According to a study conducted by Bateman (2007), it was reported in a survey that 90% of business owners admitted that taxes were a huge constraints to their businesses, as they claim taxes are high and do not allow new businesses to cover up initial cost.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH</strong></p> <p>In-order to achieve the purpose of this research, the following are the objectives of the research:</p> <ol><li>To identify the challenges of Nigerian tax policies.</li> <li>To examine the influence of multiple taxation on the profitability of small businesses and the economy as a whole.</li> <li>To identify ways of properly addressing the challenges of Nigerian tax policies in order to favour small businesses as well as encourage tax compliance.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In order to achieve the objectives stated above, the following research questions were used as a guide in achieving the objectives of this research:</p> <ol><li>What are the various challenges facing tax policies in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the influences of the challenges of tax policies in Nigeria on small businesses and the economy?</li> <li>What must be done to address the challenges of tax policies in Nigeria to suite small businesses? <ol><li><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ol></li> </ol> <p>This study gives a clear insight into the various ways in which tax policies in Nigeria can be executed efficiently to still favor small businesses and how some taxation policies in Nigeria can be properly tackled.

The findings and recommendations of the researcher will help in building a strong and better tax policy system in Nigeria, if taken seriously by government and the general public.

Reduced trade barriers, spread of technology and lower costs for communication and transportation have sharpened international competition. This intense competition in global and local markets requires firms to improve their competitiveness. This improvement not only benefits the firms themselves, but also has a direct impact on the competitiveness of an economy as a whole. A nation's standard of living is increasingly dependent on the competitiveness of its firms.</p> <p>The international business literature is replete with empirical and conceptual works pertaining to competitiveness. However, there is still debate among several disciplines regarding how the competitiveness of these firms should be measured and what factors affect competitive performance.</p> <p>The purpose of this thesis is to develop and implement an adequate framework of firm competitiveness. Accordingly, a complete competitiveness analysis must define what competitiveness means and how it is to be measured and also identify the most important factors that determines it, the interactions between these factors and how they affect the competitiveness of the small scale industries.</p> <p>This thesis tries to offer a framework to understand the meaning of firm competitiveness and its application. Our specific research question is: “What are the determinants of competitiveness in successful SSIs operating in distressed industries and exposed to international competition?”</p> <p>Note that the nature and types of (SSIs, SMEs, and small businesses) are often considered together because it may be difficult to draw a distinct line of demarcation between them.</p><p> 1.1BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </p> <p>Small Scale Industry (SSI) according to the National Council of Industries (NCI) is an industry with a labour size of 11 - 100 workers or a total cost of not more than N50 million, including working capital but excluding cost of land (NASMI 2003). Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) defined Small Scale Industry in line with the definition given by the National Council on Industry. Both asserted that a Small Scale Industry is an enterprise with a labour size of between 11 - 100 workers or a cost of between N1.5 - N50 million including working capital but excluding cost of land (NCI 2003).</p> <p>Small Scale Industries form the nucleus of majority of the world’s economies. It has been argued that they are effectual instruments for economic growth and development in Developed and Less Developed Countries (Nitani, 2005). This is consequent of the fact that SSIs contribute monumentally to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and produce extensive amounts of locally consumed products (Saleh and Ndubuisi, 2006). Small Scale Industries play paramount roles in the economic growth of any country incorporating industrialised countries because they account for more than half a country’s output and employment (Hussain et al, 2008). More so, Udechukwu (2003) avows that the development of SSIs is an integral element in the growth strategy of most economies, which holds particular significance for developing countries like Nigeria.  In Nigeria, Small Scale Industries make up about 97% of the economy (Stephen, 2011). Though viewed as quite infinitesimal in structure, however, they are the most paramount and inevitable enterprise as far as Nigerian economy is concerned due to their sheer vastness when compared to their Medium and large Scale counterparts. They form the significant part of any market economy in Nigeria because they are represented in all major branches of manufacturing and service sectors (Obokoh, 2008c). They are the engines of growth in Nigerian economy and a veritable tool for the development of indigenous technology, rapid industrialization, generation of employment for the teeming youths; providing about 50% of all jobs, also the pivot for sustainable economic development in Nigeria (Onugu, 2015). More so, in lieu of their inventive nature, they pioneer the utilization of our vast natural resources which can in turn culminate to increase in Gross Domestic Product via higher productivity, and by so doing, overhaul the standard of living of the rural populace where they have uttermost dominance.</p> <p>        In recent times, it is quite pathetic that the fatality rates of these inevitable enterprises have increased tremendously thereby putting the economy and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country in jeopardy especially at the global outlook. According to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMIDAN) Nigeria, about 80% of SSIs die before half decade of initial start-up. Key to this ugly trend is poor competitive status of the Nigerian SSIs in general (Onyemenam, 2004). Competitiveness, according to Andrea (2010) is viewed as the capability of companies, industries, regions, nations and supranational regions to create a relatively high income factor and relatively high employment levels on a sustainable basis, while permanently being exposed to international competition.</p> <p>        The government in attempt over the years to boost the competitiveness of SSIs has embarked on umpteen economic policies such as Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI) strategy, Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) trade, Financial Market Liberalisation (FML) etc. (Giron &amp; Owie, 2008). These policies were made in a bid to develop the country economy via creating a prospective operating environment for SSIs to thrive with firm competitiveness.</p> <p>        The Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI) policy was meant to improve the industrial potentials of SSIs, however, some analysis opine that the programme’s success was on the low ebb. The ISI programme however, was marred by impedances ranging from policy instantaneousness and shabby staunchness on the part of the government and its Agencies to instigate and optimally implement economic programmes (Adegbite &amp; Ayadi, 2008). The shabby commitment and instantaneousness were fingered to the government’s ineptitude and lackadaisical attitude to prudently and judiciously manage the revenue proceeds from the sale of primary products with public governance shortly after independence, towards sustainable economic development of the county (Akyuz &amp; Gore, 2001).</p> <p>        Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product per capita was put to $300 per annum in 1998 and in 2001 was estimated $1,169. The country is pigeonholed among the Less Developed Countries of the Sub Sahara Africa under the tariff order of 2005, (UNSD, 2009). Less Developed Countries in accordance with World Development Report are countries that their level of economic and social development are lower than that of advanced capitalist West Countries due to their low industrial base and dependence on primary product export. Nigeria’s zenith dependence on primary product (crude oil) and subsequent low industrial base vis-à-vis SSIs bizarre competitiveness and growth was exposed during the drop in international market price for primary products in 1980’s (Akinlo 1996) and hitherto in recent time, resulting in balance of payment problems. Sequel to this sordid development, the government in a bid to attenuate the problem, attempted to create a favourable competitive environment for its SSIs and boost her industrial base by embarking on a deep-seated economic reform process termed Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) with the interest of SSI’s firm competitiveness at the cutting edge, in respect to International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank’s (WB) recommendations (Okome, 199).</p> <p>        The Structural Adjustment Programme’s core remit aim was to create a competitive business environment for manufacturing SSIs. Towards this effect, SAP prepared the ground for radical liberalisation of the Nigerian economy (Onyeonwu, 2003). This liberalisation was extended to financial market with the aim of creating avenues for hitch-free and less exorbitant access to finance by SSIs, so as to boost their competitive ability. It was generally believed that the financial market was tremendously curbed by government’s regulation of the interest rates via CBN (Akinlo &amp; Odusola, 2003). In order to make liberalisation of the financial market effective, the government removed the curb on exchange rate movement to allow for free flow of investible funds to and fro outside and within the country and also make market forces determine the Naira exchange rate (Obadan, 2006). The liberalisation of financial market that culminated in the deregulation of interest and exchange rates was initiated with the fore sole aims; to maintain a positive real interest rate so as to encourage savings which would make funds available and accessible to SSIs, and by so doing, boost competitiveness.  The latter aim was to devaluate the naira exchange to make import of finished goods more exorbitant and less attractive to Nigerians (Ikhide &amp; Yinuba 1998), and by so doing, provide an enabling competitive environment for the SSIs.  It was also envisaged that this would provide the needed avenue for SSIs development via the utilisation of local raw materials and intermediate inputs for production (Dawson, 1994), and also create chance to exploit the domestic and international markets occasioned by the liberalised business environment (Vachani, 1994). In so doing, SSIs would have hitch-free environment to compete optimally and contribute meaningfully to the economic development of Nigeria and boost the country’s low ebb industrial base by attenuating the astronomical level dependence on primary products (Obokoh, 2008).</p> <p>         However, despite the perceived advantages of these activities and/or policies, geared towards creating high competitiveness of SSIs, the outcome created impedances to SSIs competitiveness and performance in Nigeria, which invariably speak less volume of their determinants to competitiveness of SSIs. They have put SSIs in position where they have to struggle for survival and have even led to the death of some SSIs contrary to the expectations of exporting their finished products as was anticipated. Mores so, Nigeria’s GDP since inception hitherto have not come up to scratch as anticipated, which fingers to the unfavourable nature of these activities as determinants of competitiveness, to create better competitive advantage for SSIs when manipulated. Thus, this foretells that there are major determinants to SSIs competitiveness in desertion, which if critically instigated will anticipatorily increase SSIs competitiveness in both domestic and global markets. It is on this note that this thesis is founded, to assess the major determinates of competitiveness of Small Scale Industries in Nigeria, with a view to improve SSIs competitiveness in Nigeria to sustainable thrive and development.</p><p> <strong>1.2</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong> </p> <p>Competitiveness of Small Scale Industries (SSIs); which entails the degree of superiority by which SSIs produces goods, services and related functions when compared to peers (Onyemenam, 2004), is a key and inevitable factor to sustainable growth and development of any country whether developed or less developed. A Small Scale Industry with mediocre competitiveness risks failure and in the same vein not adding to any meaningful increase in GDP. Consequently, SSIs have been recognized by governments and development experts as the main engine of economic growth and a major factor in promoting private sector development and partnership (Basil, 2005).</p> <p>Over the years and hitherto, findings have shown that most small scale businesses particularly in Nigeria die within their first five years of existence due to lack of competitiveness, (Aremu &amp; Mukaila, 2011). It was also revealed that between the sixth and tenth year a smaller proportion fails leaving about of five to ten percent to come up to scratch vis-à-vis domestic and global competition, survive, thrive and grow to maturity. The government in a bid to ameliorate the dismal competitiveness of SSIs embarked on a number of umpteen activities but these efforts amounted to building castles in the air due to the recent international plunge in oil price in 2015 and 2016, which yet exposes Nigeria’s astronomical level dependence on crude oil and subsequent low industrial base, a synonymous situation which occurred in 1980’s that culminated in the liberalization of financial market to boost SMIs competitiveness and thrive.</p> <p>The government over the years in an attempt to promote SSI competitiveness, apart from enacting economic policies, have also advanced loan facilities to Small Scale Industries via establishments, or agencies created for the purpose. These include, the Nigerian Bank for Commerce and Industry (NBCI), Small Scale Industries Credit Scheme established under the third National Development Plan, National Economic Reconstruction Fund (NERFUND) and Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP) was also established as the micro-credit scheme geared towards investment promotion and poverty alleviation in the various local governments in Nigeria (Udechukwu 2003). However, despite all the incentives by the government, small scale industries still fail thereby leading to a fall in Nigerian economy as they are considered the cutting edge of any county’s economic growth, boosting GDP as well as employment rates etc. Consequently, Nigeria still trails in the world’s economy ranking and about 33.1% population of Nigeria live below poverty line (Zhattau, 2013), and unemployment rate hiked from 7.5% in the first quarter of 2015 to 8.20% in the second quarter of 2015. Consequently, this poses unanswered questions such as; are the efforts made by government to boost the competitiveness of Small Scale Industries properly formulated and implemented. Did new firms especially SSIs in Nigeria systematically sought to identify ways to survive; did they arrive at the appropriate determinants of SSI’s competitiveness? If not affirmative, then what are the major determinants of competitiveness of small scale industries? Considering the significance of the problem, it is against this that the researcher seeks to investigate the determinants of competitiveness of small scale industries in Nigeria. This study seeks to identify and enumerate the determinants of competitiveness of a firm operating in a volatile economy like Nigeria’s.</p> <p>The happenings in the world economy and Governments responses to them</p><p> 1.3OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </p> <p>The main objective of the study is to explore and analyse the determinants of competitiveness of Nigeria’s Small Scale Industries vis-à-vis the extent to which theentrepreneurial competencies i.eknowledge, capabilities and resources of the owner) and changes in the impact of the firm’s external environment on its competitiveness i.e changes in theglobal economy as well as the extent and effects of government policies and provisions in creating an enabling economic environment)The firm’s internal environment .the firm’s internal resources, processes and capabilities.</p> <p>Changes in global business environment are related to globalization of production and markets, high rates of technological development and modernization, short product life cycles, high degree of diversification of products and services, increasing value of intangible production, creative capital and knowledge economy in the global economy; increasing requirements for environmental friendliness and safety of products; Increased demands for quality of goods and services, introduction of unified international quality standards.</p> <p>Government provisions are the provision of infrastructure facilities, quality and cost of infrastructure facilities, as well as government’s policies and incentives to SSIs. Infrastructure facilities are related to power, transportation (roads, ports, and air), market information, technology upgrade and quality certification. Government’s incentives refer to access to finance, credits and loan facilities, tax deduction, economic policies etc. Specifically, the study will strive to achieve the following objectives;</p> <p>(i) Examine the extent to which the entrepreneurial competencies i.e the knowledge, capabilities, processes and resources of the owner contribute to determining the competitiveness of SSI.</p> <p>(ii) Examine the extent to which the firm’s internal environment. i.e the firm’s internal resources, processes and capabilities contribute to determining the competitiveness of SSI.</p> <p>(iii) Impacts of the external Business Environment on competitiveness of small business</p> <p> This thesis therefore seeks contribute to the national competitiveness by providing deeper understanding of the dynamics of firm-level competitiveness and provides some implications and suggestions for further studies.</p><p> 1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </p> <p>Based on the set objectives, this thesis sought answers to the following research questions:</p> <p>(i) What are the effects of entrepreneurial competencies on the competitiveness of Small Scale Industries?</p> <p>(ii) To what extent has the firm’s internal environment i.e the firm’s internal resources, processes and capabilities contribute to the competitiveness of Small Scale Industries?</p> <p>(iii) What are the effects of external business environment on the competitiveness of Small Scale Industries?</p><p> 1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES </p> <p>The following null Hypotheses will be tested in the course of the thesis;</p> <ol><li>Ho1: There is no significant relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and the competitiveness of Small Scale Industries.</li> <li>Ho2: There is no significant relationship between the firm’s internal resources, processes and capabilities and the competitiveness of Small Scale Industries.</li> <li>Ho3: There is no significant relationship between the external business environment and the competitiveness of Small Scale Industries.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>Nigeria as a country has been tormented by high level of poverty, unemployment and subsequently a high crime rate. This sordid development has been a thorn in the flesh to the three tiers of government and the country in general. Every concerned Nigerian has been perturbed on how to devise a panacea to these ever hiking pathetic developments. Given the paramount and inevitable role which SSIs play in advanced economies, and considering the direction of the fiscal and  policies, which is primarily aimed at creating stable economy, attenuating poverty via generation of employment, re-orientating values, and stimulating real economic growth, it becomes very imperative for the competitiveness of SSIs sub-sector to be rejuvenated. The Small Scale Industries remain absolute vehicle for such anticipated radical overhaul in Nigeria economy. Thus, if the attainment of Vision 2020 is to be feasible, the competitiveness of Small Scale Industries needs to be made firm and formidable by the government.</p> <p>        This thesis is thus intended to analyse critically the determinants of the competitiveness of small scale industries and proffer appropriate recommendations for addressing them so as to make SSIs contribute meaningfully to the development of Nigeria.</p> <p>             More so, the  result of the study if squarely implemented will give the Small Scale Industries the edge to hitch-free operations so as to come up to scratch vis-à-vis the challenges of domestic and global industrial and economic competitions. It will also help policy makers such as government agencies in the provision of favourable economic policies to create a firm competitiveness among Small Scale Industries in Nigeria. Finally, it will also help other scholars in further research into all aspects of promoting the growth of Small Scale Industries for sustainable economic growth, and to the researcher; it is an immense benefit in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of a Master of Science in Business Management at University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus.</p><p> 1.7  SCOPE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>This thesis was delimited to the determinants of competitiveness of Small Scale Industries (SSIs). It examines the effects of the entrepreneurial competencies, the firm’s internal resources, processes and capabilities, and the external business environment the external business environment includes. Government incentives refer to access to finance, credits and loan facilities and tax deductions and provision of enabling business environment etc. However, no attempt was made to delve into the intricate analysis of empirical data using advanced statistical methods and also, the study area is limited to only a handful of small scale industries out of umpteen SSIs scattered all over the country.</p><p> 1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS </p> <p>The terms used in this study, which have inimitable meaning that could be subjected to different interpretations by different readers of this thesis, are defined as thus:</p> <p><strong>(i)</strong> <strong>Small Scale Industries (SSIs):</strong> An enterprise whose total cost including working capital but excluding cost of land is between ten million naira (N10,000,000) and one hundred million naira (N100,000,000) and/or a workforce between eleven (11) and seventy (70) full-time staff and/or with a turnover of not more than ten million naira (N10,000,000) in a year.</p> <p><strong>(ii)</strong> <strong>Competitiveness:</strong> This refers to the capability of small scale industries to create a relatively high income factor and relatively high employment levels on a sustainable basis, while permanently being exposed to global and international competition.</p> <p><strong>(iii) Infrastructure: </strong>This refers to power, transportation, market information, telecommunication, upgrades and quality certification which are inevitable for the optimal operation of Small scale industries.</p> <ul><li>Onyemenam, C.E.

In achieving this, the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector is usually relied upon because of extant scholarly knowledge of its capacity to contribute to economic development.</p> <p>In 2002, the Honourary Presidential Council on Investment (HPACI) SME sector profile reveals that the SMEs contribute as much as 40% of GDP in developed economies and some developing nations. The report further shows that SMEs constitute over 90% of firms in Nigeria with a meagre 1% contribution to GDP. This disproportionate contribution is as a result of factors within the business environments.</p> <p>Studies have adduced several reasons including access to finance, infrastructural limitations, entrepreneurial competence of owner-managers and the impact of multiple tax, to explain differences in SMEs contributions to GDP (Kessides, 1993; Sule, 1980 and Anyanwu, 1994; HPACI, 2002, and Aruwa, 2004). Foremost of these barriers are inadequate finance and lack of infrastructures. Kessides (1993) recognises the significance of infrastructure in the process of economic growth.</p> <p>Interestingly, the Honourary Presidential Council on Investment (HAPCI, 2002), after an in-depth study of the SME sector, gave the reasons limiting the role of SMEs as the hub of entrepreneurship in Nigeria. Some of the reasons given were infrastructural limitations, access to finance, access to enterprise support services, unfavourable business environment and poor access to information about sources of raw materials and market network. There is a recurrence on the greater impact of limited access to finance, entrepreneurial incompetence and inadequate infrastructure in the SME literature.</p> <p>The need to improve SME development in Abuja is particularly timely given the crises and attendant less propitious economic situation that has bedevilled the capital since the 1980s. This manifested by way of the deplorable nature of socio-economic infrastructure. This has the effect of imposing heavy cost and of shifting of resources away from productive private investment since domestic and foreign entrepreneurs would only invest where infrastructure exists and satisfactory rate of return is assured.</p> <p>Sani (2001) observes that indices of micro-economic infrastructural facilities are inadequate and the operation of the functional ones has not been efficient. This indeed has dire consequences in promoting business activities in Nigeria. The SME sector in Nigeria operates in an environment with very poor infrastructure, which deter prospecting firms from entry and hinders effective performance and international competitiveness (Aruwa, 2004).</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>In-adequate power supply and bad roads are major social and economic infrastructures hindering effective operations of small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria. Constant power outages for example, do not encourage business activities as most skilled and un-skilled jobs are greatly dependent on electricity.</p> <p>The provision of infrastructure services to meet the demands of businesses-both small and medium scale, is one of the major challenges of economic development in Nigeria. The provision of economic and social infrastructure can expand the productive capacity of the Nigerian economy by creating enabling environments for small and medium scale businesses in an economy, thereby encouraging economic development.</p> <p>This is not always the case as small businesses in Nigeria suffer from bad roads to constant power outages. A study conducted by Ogbonnaya (2010) demonstrated empirically that no matter how novel the policies or incentives to drive the industrial sector are, if the infrastructural problems are not fixed, the policy objective of accelerating the growth of the industrial sector may not be realized.</p> <p>The significance of infrastructure in the process of economic growth has long been established. Infrastructure has been seen as the basic requirement for business establishment and survival. The costs of acquiring infrastructures are significantly enormous for SMEs to bear and therefore, government intervention is inevitable. However, the depth of impact, the degree of impact or relationship coefficient has not been established particularly in respect of Kaduna state. This makes this paper distinguishable.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main aim of the study is to evaluate the role of economic and social infrastructure in promoting business activities in Nigeria. Other specific objectives are:</p> <ol><li>To identify infrastructure challenges that affect business activities in FCT Abuja.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.       What infrastructural challenges affect the smooth operation of businesses in Abuja?</p> <p>2.       What role have economic and social infrastructure played in promoting small business activities in Abuja?</p> <p>3.       What policies if introduced by the government will help promote small and medium scale business activities in Abuja?</p> <p><strong>1.5     Statement of Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The study developed two operational hypotheses as stated below:</p> <ol><li>H0: Infrastructural facilities in FCT Abuja is inadequate.</li> </ol> <p>                   H1: Infrastructural facilities in FCT is adequate.</p> <ol><li>Ho:   Infrastructural facilities does not have significant impact on</li> </ol> <p>the performance of businesses in FCT.</p> <p>H1: Infrastructural facilities have significant impact on the performance of businesses in FCT.</p> <p><strong>1.6       Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>Small and Medium scale Enterprises (SMEs) in Africa rely largely on own savings, not only to grow but also to innovate, firms often need real services support and formal finance assistance, failing which under-investment in long term capabilities (training and R&amp;D) may result, (Oyelaran-Oyeyinka, 2003).</p> <p>Besides finance, there are critical elements (including: knowledge, skills and experience of staff; capacity and quality of internal facilities; information and knowledge of market; intellectual and managerial leadership; external infrastructure and the incentive system at the micro and macro levels) that lacking within technology support institutions themselves. These undermine the effectiveness of their support to Small and Medium scale Enterprises (SMEs). This study is significant because it would help to evaluate the operations of a vital segment of the industrial sector – Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) , which have been identified as having very high potential in promoting economic growth and development (Oni and Daniya, 2012). The evaluation shall be done with special focus on their financing thereby adding to the existing literature on the subject matter.</p> <p>This study will be of great benefit to the following:</p> <p><strong>Government</strong></p> <p>This study highlights and critically examines the various infrastructural challenges faced by small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria. The study will enable government bodies and other stakeholders to make policies that will help fast-track the provision of adequate and quality infrastructures to create enabling environment for small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Students</strong></p> <p>The study will also be a great importance to students both at basic and tertiary levels. Findings and recommendations will guide students in research and further studies.</p> <p><strong>Manufacturing Companies</strong></p> <p>Since most manufacturing companies depend on small and medium scale enterprises for their survival, the study will go a long way in assessing the role manufacturing companies can play in strengthening the operations of small and medium scale enterprise in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Other Researchers</strong></p> <p>The study will provide foundation for future studies. Based on research questions and recommendations given in the study, further research studies can be developed from the project work.</p> <p><strong>1.7     Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research work focuses on the role infrastructures such as economic and social infrastructures have played in  the promotion of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria paying special attention to the impact the government of Nigeria has on the development of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises for a period of three (3) years 2009. The research intends to study the essential problems encountered by Small and Medium Scale Enterprises and suggest ways by which they can be adequately and efficiently promoted.</p> <p>Most of the information and data needed for the study would be gathered from existing literature and from some selected business owners in FCT Abuja.</p> <p><strong>1.8     Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>Limitations faced in the course of the research were accessibility to information, difficulty in accessing the target sample during working hours due to the busy nature of their operations, inability to use a large sample size due to time and resource constraints, unwillingness of small business owners to reveal confidential information in fear of competitions.</p> <p><strong>1.9     Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Business: </strong>The Oxford Learner’s Dictionary defines business as a commercial activity, a means of live hood, a trade, profession, occupation, etc.</p> <p><strong>Capital:</strong> capital can be defined s man-made productive asset that are set aside for the production of other assets.

So that the ability of SMEs to develop positively and drive economic growth in the Nigeria will become real. Simple random sampling technique was employed in selecting the 100 SMEs that constituted the sample size of the research. Structured questionnaire was designed to facilitate the acquisition of relevant data which was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics which involves simple percentage graphical charts and illustrations was tactically applied in data presentations and analysis. The findings of the study reveal that significant number of the SMEs benefitted from the loans even though only few of them were capable enough to secure the required amount needed. Interestingly, majority of the SMEs acknowledge positive contributions of loans towards increasing their returns and sales thus placing them in the competitive arena. It is recommended that Banks should review their interest rate downwards and also share best practices with their SME customers especially on the efficient use of loans; this will boost their productivity and support SMEs in Nigeria.</p> <p> <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Introduction and Background</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria, available data from the Registrar General Department indicates that 90% of companies registered are micro, small and medium enterprises (Mensah, 2004). This target group has been identified as the catalyst for economic growth of the country as they are a major source of income and employment to many Nigeriaians. According to Mensah (2004) Small enterprises employ between 6 and 29 employees with fixed assets of $100 Thousand with Medium enterprises employing between 30 and 99 employees with fixed assets of up to $1 Million, Hallberg (2001) put forward that SMEs account for majority of firms in an economy and a significant share of employment. Like other countries of the world, SMEs in Nigeria have the tendency to serve as sources of livelihood to the poor, create employment opportunities, generate income and contribute immensely to economic growth. Small firms are the engines for economic development of several developed countries such as the US and Japan (Hallberg, 2001).</p> <p>Developing countries such as Zimbabwe have also identified the potential of small firms to turn economies with negative growth into vibrant ones. For this reason, several governments in developing countries offer funding to small firms either directly or by guaranteeing the payment of such loans as lack of funding is cited as one of the major challenges faced by small businesses. Obert and Olawale (2010) argues that due to limited resources by governments, not all small firms receive funding from the government; therefore, the other option would be to go for bank loans Obert and Olawale (2010)<strong>.</strong> Despite its increasing roles, access to credit by</p> <p>1</p> <p>SMEs remains one major constraint to Nigeriaian SMEs. According to Augusto et al (2008), most large companies usually start as small enterprises, so the ability of SMEs to develop and invest becomes crucial to any economy wishing to prosper.</p> <p>Although countries’ definitions of what constitutes an SME for legal or statistical purposes are typically based on the number of employees, banks generally define SMEs in terms of average annual sale; an indicator that is more easily observable, a good proxy of an SME level of business activity, and, thus, more useful to banks’ business and risk management purposes (Augusto et al 2008). Augusto et al (2008) further points out that the threshold of annual sales used by banks varies by country, according to the size of the economies and structure of their corporate sector. Augusto et al (2008) hints that in Argentina, a company is considered to be an SME when its average annual sales are approximately between 300,000 and 30 million US dollars. In Chile, the range goes from around 90,000 to 24 million US dollars.</p> <p>In Colombia, banks consider SMEs those firms with annual sales between 400,000 and 13 million US dollars (although for most domestic banks the range is between 100,000 and 5 million. In Serbia, SMEs are typically defined as having annual sales between 500,000 and 10 million Euros. A vast number of data on SMEs in Nigeria also suggest SMEs are more financially constrained than large firms. For example, using data from 10,000 firms in 80 countries, Beck et al (2006) showed that the probability that a firm rates financing as a major obstacle is 39% for small firms, 38% for medium-size firms, and 29% for large firms.</p> <p>Mensah (2004) states that a major barrier to rapid development of the SME sector is a shortage of both debt and equity financing. However Mensah (2004) postulate that</p> <p>equity shortage occurs because Equity investors seek highest return consistent with</p> <p>2</p> <p>the risk of the investment and since SME investments are difficult to evaluate, their investments take time to mature and among others major institutional investors such as insurance companies are not allowed to invest in private SMEs. Hence there are many who believe that the single most important factor constraining the growth of the SME sector is the lack of finance.</p> <p>There are many factors that can be adduced for this lack of finance according to Mensah (2004). For instance a relatively undeveloped financial sector with low levels of intermediation; Lack of institutional and legal structures that facilitate the management of SME lending risk; High cost of borrowing and rigidities interest rates. Thus Because of the persistent financing gap, many interventions have been launched by governments and development partners to stimulate the flow of financing to SMEs over and above what is available from exiting private sector financial institutions. Karimunda and Barumwete (2006) put forward the fact that, there are several reasons why a SME need a loan such us the financing of new branches, of new projects and more. Companies do not always have the capacity for finance their own business that is why they have sometimes to turn to other financers. However, when companies need new capital, they firstly resort to their internal generated funds.</p> <p>After these sources, SMEs turn to equity financing by addressing closely related investors. These sources exhibit very low costs and may be for example equity capital from the owner, family or friends. Despite these, there are others types of financing that one can use: external equity financing and external debt financing. For SMEs, possibilities for using external equity finance are limited since the majority of these companies are privately managed. Companies can also use venture capitalist as alternative means of equity financing.</p> <p>3</p> <p>However, these possibilities are difficult for SMEs since most of them do not always meet the return expectations. They thereby become less attractive for this group of investors. Other alternatives to financing are private placements and corporate bonds. Unfortunately, these types of financing are too expensive for SMEs or have limited resources. Therefore bank loans seem to be an appropriate way to finance SMEs’ capital requirements and seem to be an appropriate way. As a result, SMEs prefer most frequently debt funding by bank loans. The bank financing is tremendously attractive and seems to be realistic and a more reliable source to SMEs. Mensah (2004) states that recently, as banks and other financial institutions have sought to broaden their loan portfolio, SMEs have become an increasingly attractive customer group. Traditionally, however, financial institutions in Nigeria have been cautious with lending to SME groups because of high default rates and risks associated with the sector. Few banks have therefore developed an explicit policy for SME target groups taking the particular requirements and needs into consideration, an example is the development of customized financial products and appropriate credit management systems.</p> <p>Only few banks have SME specific loan products, and many of these are donor funded. Since SMEs are scarcely finance by equity due to risk in its operation amongst others, the last resort is thus debt financing and this is usually financed by financial institutions through the granting of loans. Debt financing according to Ayadi et al (2009) continues to be the primary source of financing for SMEs in Europe, much more important than venture capital. This implies, for one thing, that an efficient functioning of credit markets is of utmost importance for SMEs – and the economy at large – to thrive. This problem seems to be particularly severe in transition economies, whose catching-up may suffer from continued wide-spread</p> <p>exclusion of SMEs from external bank finance. Of recent, there has been an increase</p> <p>4</p> <p>in the recognition of the role played by small firms in national economies. Their contribution to job creation and poverty alleviation has been recognized by several governments of developing countries to the extent that they now include them in their development plans.</p> <p>Abor (2005) proposed among the support structures include offering funding to the small firms’ sector, usually at concessionary rates. But whether the use of such debt improves the profitability, thereby enhancing sustainability, is not well known Abor (2005). However, despite the importance of the small business sector, access to finance is a frequently cited problem. Sources of capital are more limited for SMEs compared to large firms.</p> <p>Therefore, unlike large, particularly publicly-listed firms, SMEs do not have the option of issuing shares or debentures in the capital market. Even if they are allowed to participate in the capital market, the high transaction costs associated with publicly issued debt and equity will be too expensive for them. Owing to their inability to access the public debt and equity markets, SMEs tend to be heavily reliant on commercial banks as a source of debt financing (Berry et al., 2002). Research by Berry et al<em>.</em> (2002), documents the reliance of SMEs on bank debt as a source of financing. These researchers, however, point out that access to bank debt is, paradoxically, a frequently cited challenge for SMEs.</p> <p>SMEs are often relatively new and lack a consistent track record of profitability that would demonstrate the capability to repay a loan. In addition, many SMEs lack assets that could be used as collateral. SMEs are also more prone to financial distress and failure. Commercial banks, because of these factors, consider lending to SMEs a high risk. Therefore, commercial banks often deny loans or offer loans to SMEs at higher</p> <p>rates of interest to accommodate the perceived high credit risk of SMEs according</p> <p>5</p> <p>Coleman and Cohn (2001). The inaccessibility of debt finance to SMEs can further be attributed to information asymmetry. Rwelamila et al. (2004) indicates that this arises when one party to a transaction has better information than the other.</p> <p>SMEs may have more information about their future prospects than the banks. Since banks do not have the necessary information, even small firms with profitable investment opportunities are turned down when requesting credit facilities. Banks, therefore, introduce restrictive covenants and also collect collateral from small firms to mitigate this problem Bose and Cotheren (1997).The question is what the impact of this loan on these SMEs is? Traditionally, debt finance has been viewed as less expensive than equity. It furthermore has been used both to decrease the average cost of capital and enhance shareholders returns.</p> <p>However, there is a negative side to debt, since interest payments must be made regardless of market conditions. This vulnerability is an important factor that firms must consider when making capital structure decisions. In addition Glen (2004) states, there is a very strong economic and statistical link between macroeconomic variables and a firm’s ability to meet debt obligations. The macro-economic environment implies the level of aggregate demand, the level of interest rates, and the level of inflation. A positive macro-economic environment results in a rise in aggregate demand and positively impacts on the ability of a firm to meet debt obligations.</p> <p>The ability to service debt becomes problematic when the macro-economic environment deteriorates; resulting in the insolvency of firms (Glen, 2004). Rwelamila et al. (2004) affirm that, during the early stages of starting a firm, many</p> <p>owners commit themselves to the use of debt, which might be one of the sources of</p> <p>6</p> <p>finance available to them. The use of debt can be disastrous, as high interest rates and unfavorable repayment schedules are often overlooked due to the pressure of financing the firm.</p> <p>Against this background, the study investigates whether SMEs in developing countries can use debt and still remain solvent in this era of high interest rates. Furthermore, SMEs often pay interest premiums and a host of non-interest fees such as application and other transaction fees when borrowing from commercial banks. The cause of this is that SMEs are considered a high credit risk compared to large firms. This high cost of funds because of increased risk increases the costs of debt for small firms.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Problem statement</strong></p> <p>Inferring from the above, SMEs serve as sources of livelihood to the poor, create employment opportunities, generate income and contribute to economic growth. There is also the potential of small firms to turn economies with negative growth into vibrant ones, not to mention the fact that most large companies usually start as small enterprises, so the ability of SMEs to develop and invest becomes crucial to any economy wishing to prosper. From the argument above the only easier finance options for SMEs are loans (Debt financing) assess from financial institutions, thus it’s necessary to examine the impact of these loans on the performance of SMEs.

Apart from increasing percapita income and output, Small Medium businesses create employment opportunities, enhance regionaleconomic balance through industrial dispersal and generally promote effective resourceutilization considered critical to engineering economic development and growth. However,the seminal role played by Small Medium businesses notwithstanding its development is everywhere constrainedby inadequate funding and poor management. The unfavourablemacro economic environmenthas also been identified as one of the major constraints which most times encourage financialinstitutions to be risk-averse in funding small and medium scale businesses. The reluctanceon the part of financial institution to fund Small Medium businesses can be explained by the insufficient capitalbase of banks and information asymmetry that often exists between Small Medium businesses and lendinginstitutions.</p> <p>This study critically examines the availability of business credit to small business in Nigeria, and how more funding can be made to support small businesses. However, this chapter, forms the basic foundation for this study as it presents the objectives of the study, and the statement of problem that motivated the researcher to undertake the study.</p> <ol><li><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY AND ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE</strong></li> </ol> <p>During the 1990s, a number of studies documented that lending to small businesses andthe economic activity of small businesses were affected by financial sector disruptions, such asthe widespread merging of banks of all sizes and the capital shortfalls occasioned by large loanlosses.</p> <p>Although not much previous research has examined discrimination in small businesscredit markets, there has been an active debate on the question of whether banks discriminateagainst minority applicants for mortgages. In an influential study in that area, researchers at theFederal Reserve Bank of Boston tried to collect any information that might be deemedeconomically relevant to whether a loan would be approved along with the borrower’s raceandf financial status (Munnell et al., 1996). In the raw data larger firms had 10 percent of their loans rejected versusrejection rates of 28 percent for small scale businesses. After controlling for the large number ofvariables collected to establish the credit-worthiness of the borrowers (including, the amount ofthe debt, debt/income ratio, credit history, loan characteristics, etc.) small scale businesses were still percentage points less likely to be granted the loan.</p> <p>A variety of criticisms have been launched at this study (see, for example, Horne 1994;Day and Liebowitz, 1998; Harrison, 1998); responses to these criticisms are found in Browneand Tootell (1996). The most common critique indicates that we cannot make a determination ofdiscrimination unless those small businesses whose loans are approved have a greater likelihood ofrepayment. This argument rests critically upon an implied assumption that the distribution ofrepayment probabilities for large companies and small businesses is identical. Hisfigure indicates that if this assumption is met and if firms discriminate against small businesses by setting ahigher bar for loan approval, then the mean rate of repayment among small businessesconditional uponloan approvalwill be higher for large and smaller firms.</p> <ol><li><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></li> </ol> <p>Small businesses and entrepreneurial ventures which are usually considered as the engine that run the economy are usually denied access to credit due to their risky nature. This disturbing threat has existed for a very long time and needs proper attention from both government agencies and non governmental agencies as well. The importance of small businesses in the development of Nigeria cannot be overlooked. Without proper credit availability to small businesses, the economy as a whole will suffer. The objectives of economic planning cannot be achieved if small businesses do not do well. Keeping this in view, the Bank of Nigeria has streamlined Bank’s lending operations to ensure that banks’ credit actually benefits small and medium businesses in Nigeria. This strategy is intended to improve the economy and to develop rural areas in Nigeria.</p> <p>However, there is some anecdotal evidence that most beneficiaries of business credit from most financial institutions are salaried workers and large scale companies, whose ability to repay loans are believed to be better than that of small scale businesses. Moreover, this belief is not always the case as some small businesses who go for loans are well profitable and well managed.</p> <p><strong>1.3 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>This paper is aimed at the following objectives:</p> <ol><li>To examine the relationship that exist between small scale businesses and financial institutions that grant business credits in Uyo.</li> <li>To identify the challenges faced by small businesses in securing business credit in Uyo.</li> <li>To examine the degree of business credit availability to small businesses in Uyo.</li> <li>To identify the effects of businesses credit availability on small businesses in Uyo.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following questions were used by the researcher in achieving the research objectives of this study:</p> <ol><li>What relationship exists between you and financial institutions that grant credit in Uyo?</li> <li>What challenges do you face when securing credit for your business?</li> <li>How often business credit is made available to you when you apply for it?</li> <li>What effects have the availability of business credit had on your business?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is very important because it is aimed at examining the effects of business credit availability and its effect on small businesses in Uyo. The paper will provide some relevant recommendations for policy makers, development agencies, entrepreneurs, and small business managers to help seek better ways to increase business credits to small businesses, and appropriate strategies to improve the small business sector in Nigeria.</p> <p>Secondly, the study is also vital since it suggest to small businesses certain strategies they can adopt before seeking business credits, to make their borrowing process easier and more effective. This will go a long way to increase the efficiency and profitability level of small businesses in Uyo. Any time these strategies are put in place, access to business credit increases, and the participation of more people in entrepreneurial activities will also increase, hence the economy of Nigeria will be improved.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The area chosen for this study is Uyo in the South-south region of Nigeria.The study is limited to the effects of business credit availability on small businesses in Uyo, using various small businesses in Uyo as a focus point.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In undertaking this research, the researcher encountered the following problems;</p> <p>1. The time used to undertake the study was limited. The time was loaded with other academic activities and as a result limited time was made available the study.</p> <p>2. Also, response from the various small business owners through the questionnaire provided by the researcher was also a bit slow. This is because of reasons such much work load on the part of the respondents.</p> <p><strong>1.8 CHAPTER SCHEME</strong></p> <p>The project will be organized around following chapters;</p> <p>Chapter one gives an introduction to the research work. It gives the basic information about the company and the research being undertaken. This chapter therefore consists of the background of the study and organizational profile, statement of the problem, objectives, research questions, significance of the study, scope of the study, and limitations encountered by the researcher.</p> <p>Chapter Twoconsists of the literature review and the theoretical framework</p> <p>Chapter three gives details of the research methodology.

Some business organizations are formed to earn income for owners. Other business organizations, called nonprofits, are formed for public purposes. These businesses often raise money and utilize other resources to provide or support public programs.</p> <p>Organization is a broader term, as it includes businesses and other groups of people not organized for commercial purposes. Clubs and sports teams are examples of non-business organizations. Organizations have a specific structure and hierarchy. People and systems create a culture within the organization and guide its operation. Different organizations have different policies, work flows and objectives.</p> <p>Management is universal in the modern world. Every organization requires the making of decision, the coordination of activities, deciding in advance when, why how and who does what, setting of standards, measuring performance against standard and reviewing the standards. Numerous managerial activities have their own particular approach to specific types of problems which fall under headings such as production and operation management human resources management, management of health delivery system and others.</p> <p>According to Nwachukwu (2007) management is the act of getting things done through and with others. Another definition by Launer (1999) he refers to management as the corner stone of organization effectiveness and is concerned with arrangements for the carrying out of organizational processes and the execution of work.</p> <p>Kountz (2006) management is an operational process initially best dissected by analyzing the management functions. The five essential managerial functions are planning, organizing, staffing, directing, leading and controlling. These tasks of management are interrelated and actually dove tail into each other. Planning sets the stage by helping the organization to determine where it wants to go (objectives) and how to get there (strategies and tactics). These objectives and strategies determine the type of organizational structure most suitable for the organization.</p> <p>Organization structures are designed to fit the strategies which are meant to achieve the objective and both strategies and objectives are the outcome of planning.</p> <p>There is no human endeavor that does not require proper management for it to function efficiently. For every type of organization either government establishment or private enterprise, there is need for qualified managers to handle its activities. Management and organizations are seen as the product of their historical and social times and place and to understand the evolution of management theory in terms of how people wrestled with matters of relationship at a particular time in history. The lesson here is to learn from the trials and tribulation of those who have preceded us in steering the fortunes of formed organization.</p> <p>It is now obvious to everyone that, of the factors that are necessary for economic take off, none is to be stressed more often than management characteristically, the developing countries are known for their low technological progress and extremely low labor productivity. A realistic approach to the development of these countries call for qualified high level manpower especially at the management level. In present day organizations it is the manager that determines the appropriate technology required and the best way to efficiently and effectively utilize all types of resources, be it physical or human.</p> <p>The Nigeria scene portrays the situation very adequately. Despite her abundant natural resources and rich environment, the economy of Nigeria has not quite taken off most organization do not operate smoothly and efficiently. The management cadre which is a sine qua non for economic development is lacking. The government in many instances has assumed the function of entrepreneur and taken over the management functions, instances abound to convince everyone that the government has not fared well as a good manager, and has even performed worse than private entrepreneurs.</p> <p>The need for management is essential to the development of organizations, be it small scale or large scale industries, therefore, whenever people work together, there is generally a need for the coordination of efforts in order to attain expected result in reasonable time, and with minimum amount of money, discomfort or energy. A manager is expected to be vast in knowledge and to possess special talents or abilities quite different from non-managers.</p> <ol><li><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></li> </ol> <p>No organization, no matter its size can survive without an effective managerial function and good organization, therefore, there is need for sound and qualified man and women to operate in every organization especially small scale enterprises; and also there should be capable hands to manage the financial affairs in order to ensure a sound system of operation in the enterprise.</p> <p>It is important to note that, effective operation is not exclusive concern of only one person or department within an organization, it must involve every staff who should have the interest of the organization at heart in order for it to achieve it set goal and objectives.</p> <ol><li><strong>Objectives of the study</strong></li> </ol> <p>This project intends to assess the impact of efficient management function in the survival of small scale industrial towards the achievement of the overall goals and objectives of the organization.</p> <p>Specifically this project has the following objective:</p> <ol><li>To find out the relationship between management business organization and managerial efficiency on small scale enterprises.</li> <li>To examine some strategies for business organization and managerial efficiency set out by small scale enterprises.</li> <li>To find the role of business organization and managerial efficiency on small scale enterprises.</li> </ol> <ol><li><strong>Research questions</strong></li> </ol> <p>In order to achieve the stated objectives for the study the following research questions will be asked:</p> <ol><li>What relationship exists between business organization and management efficiency of small scale enterprises?</li> <li>How does business organization and managerial efficiency impact small scale enterprises?</li> </ol> <p>3.

Ordinary least square regression was used to test the hypothesis. The study found out that there is significant relationship between venture capital financing and performance of small and medium enterprises in Akwa Ibom State. The performance of SMEs was the same for the year 1999 and 2014. SMEs experienced the highest performance in the 2012 with a performance rate of 98.9. The study then concluded that there is a statistically significantly strong positive relationship between venture capital financing and the performance of small and medium scale enterprises in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state. Proper recommendation were made to enhance the interest of researchers for further study of venture capital financing and the performance of small and medium scale enterprises in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Governments throughout the world are nowadays turning their attention to small-scale enterprises. This is because attempts to promote economic progress by establishing large industries have usually failed to improve the lives of the majority of the populations concerned (White Paper on International Development, 2000). Therefore, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are now viewed as important in even and equitable economic development.</p> <p>RoK (2005) clearly show that the sector is not only a provider of goods and services but also a driver in promoting competition, innovation and enhancing the enterprise culture which is necessary for private sector development and industrialization. The sector should effectively respond to challenges of creating productive and sustainable employment opportunities, promoting economic growth and poverty eradication in the country.</p> <p>SMEs will play a significant role in contributing to the national goal of wealth creation and making Nigeria an industrialized country ( Liedholm 1998). Lack of access to credit is a major constraint inhibiting the growth of SMEs sector. The issues and problems limiting SMEs acquisition of financial services include lack of tangible security coupled with inappropriate legal and regulatory framework that does not recognize innovative strategies for lending to SMEs. Limited access to formal finance due to poor and insufficient capacity to deliver financial services to SMEs continues to be a constraint in the growth and expansion of the sector. Formal financial institutions perceive SMEs as high risk and commercially unviable As a result only a few SMEs access credit from formal financial institutions in the country. Various types of assistance have been provided to SMEs to boost their growth and development by making them more profitable (Institute of Economic Affairs &amp; Society for Economic Development (IEA/SED, 2001). Several Organizations including business associations, voluntary organizations and other nongovernmental organizations have set up programs to enhance the factors that influence development of SME especially as it relates to enterprise growth and development.</p> <p>The types of assistance offered by these organizations vary with some giving financial assistance, others training and extension services, pre-constructed commercial shades or assisting in marketing of products (Admati, &amp; Pfleiderer (1994). Despite the large number of assistance programs, the growth and development of SME has not been satisfactory. Ventures have collapsed as soon as assisting organizations pull out of the project, and remaining ones have remained small. According to the study undertaken by Hallberg (1998) and Mead and Liedholm (1998), access to finance is an important ingredient to development. Financial constraints are likely to affect business creation and improvement.</p> <p>Venture Capital is one source of non-bank financing, which is quite prevalent in developed financial markets for small or start up firms (Keuschnigg 1998). Venture Capitalists are organized providers of financing for winning but risky business proposals by small and medium enterprises that have a promising but as yet unproven idea. If the Venture Capitalists are convinced that a business idea is promising, they will take an ownership stake in the business. It is expected that country’s small businesses whose growth has been constrained by shortage of capital or increased cost of borrowing will have another source of finance.</p> <p>There is empirical evidence of the effects of venture capital financing in the industrialization of developed countries. In the United States of America, the role of Venture Capital financing has been instrumental throughout its industrialization; however it became institutionalized after the 2nd World War. Before World War II, venture investment was a monopoly led by wealthy individuals, investment banking syndicates and few family organizations with a professional manager (Hisrich and Peters, 2002). For example, over the years, the Rockefeller family has made the initial capital contribution to a number of successful businesses.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Small and medium, enterprises in Nigeria have difficulties in growth due to lack of finance. They hardly grow beyond start-up stage. Others go out of business at a very early stage. The study undertaken by Hallberg (1998), and Mead &amp; Liedholm (1998) reveals that access to finance is an important ingredient to development of SME. They have few alternatives of accessing finance other than relying on their retained earnings to finance their investments. Notwithstanding the financial difficulties faced by SME presently in Nigeria, alternative sources of funds have to be sought to sustain this important sector. Venture capital financing, which is quite prevalent in developed countries, has played a big role in enhancing growth of SMEs by providing equity capital. In countries where venture capital financing has been practice, it has brought tremendous improvement to the small and medium enterprises. The researcher feels that it is important to examine the relationship between venture capital financing and performance of small and medium enterprises in Nigeria considering the poor level of development experienced in the sector in the country.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <ol><li>To evaluate the benefit of venture capital to SMEs performance</li> <li>To evaluate the level of venture capital accruing to SMEs in akwa ibom state.</li> <li>To evaluate the performance of SMEs in the year 2001- 2015</li> <li>To determine the relationship between venture capital and SMEs performance</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What are the benefits of venture capital to SMEs performance?</li> <li>To what level is venture capital accruing to SMEs in akwa ibom state?</li> <li>What is the level of performance of SMEs in the year 2001- 2015?</li> <li>Is there any relationship between venture capital and SMEs performance in akwa ibom state 2001-2015?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The study came up the hypothesis as stated below in order to elicit information on the performance of SMEs and venture capital financing.

In recent years there have been a lot of disasters and uncertainties affecting personal lives and the business environment across the globe. These events have had adverse effects on the socioeconomic activities on developed and developing nations; particularly Nigeria. There have been violent floods, fire outbreaks, traffic accidents, occupational hazards, accidental damage to properties and harm caused to lives, theft and armed robbery, as well as other unforeseen events that impact negatively on various economic ventures; especially the private sector investment activities. These mishaps remind us of the need to adopt risk management measures. Risk is everywhere but the business world is much exposed to it. To overcome the losses arising from these risks some take up insurance, others do not.</p> <p>Aizenman and Marion (1999), highlight the adverse effects of risks on investment using macroeconomic data from more than forty (40) developing countries. They emphasized the fact that the uncertainty about business decisions in the future and the resulting gains cannot be optimistic.</p> <p>Despite efforts by successive governments through economic reforms to heighten the private sector to complement government’sinvestments and enhance economic growth, the</p> <p>sector’s                        response   is   relatively   low;   and   thi</p> <p>Entrepreneurs make decisions regarding their investment in a dynamic and risky environment.</p> <p>1</p> <p>The outcomes of their decisions are generally not conclusive due to the uncertainties associated with the future outcomes. Variability in future outcomes is the biggest source of risk, particularly among Small, and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs). The use of insurance as a risk mitigation tool provides confidence and prospects in successful business decisions, however to some degree.</p> <p>The basic function of insurance is risk transference; risk is transferred from one party (the insured) to another party (the insurer). The transfer of risk by no means eliminates the possibility of misfortune, but the insurer provides financial security and tranquillity for the insured when the insured risk occurs. In return, an insured pays a premium in a very small amount when compared with the potential losses that may be suffered (Morton, 1999).</p> <p>Insurance as a risk management tool in Nigeria is made extensive and mandatory by the Insurance Act, 2006 (Act 724). The Act makes it compulsory for private commercial property owners such as hotels, restaurants, hospitals and clinics, Auto shops, manufacturing firms and many other related businesses to obtain fire and liability insurance just as it is compulsory for vehicle owners to obtain the Third Party Motor Insurance cover under the compulsory third party</p> <p>motor insurance Act 1958 (Act 42). Sections 1 not construct or cause to be constructed a commercial building without insuring with a registered</p> <p>insurer the liability in respect of construction risks caused by negligence or the negligence of servants, agents or consultants which may result in bodily injury or loss of life to or damage to property of any workman on the site or of any member of the public; every commercial building shall be insured with an insurer against the hazards of collapse, fire, earthquake, storm and flood, and an insurance policy issued for it; the insurance policy shall cover the legal liabilities of an</p> <p>2</p> <p>owner or occupier of premises in respect of loss of or damage to property, bodily injury or death suffered by any user of the premises andical thir satisfaction and financial leverages to investors buying insurance to safeguard business interests.</p> <p>The compliance of the Act (Act 724) is in doubt: as the 2007, ENGAS company filling station gas explosion at Asokwa in Ashanti Region did not fulfil its obligation per the law; the 2011 fire explosions at the Western Steel and Forging Ltd in Tema caused injury, death and damages to people and properties; also, the destruction of properties at Kantamanto Market and the VRA computer room (housing its server) by fire evidence the need for insurance covers to minimize the effects of hazards to SMEs, Government Agencies and Departments; hence, the call on government with other stakeholders to assist victims.</p> <ol><li><strong>Problem Statement</strong></li> </ol> <p>Risk is one of the most overlooked areas in SMEs in spite of the fact that it is clear to</p> <p>most entrepreneurs that, operating any business involves risk such as losses associated with property, income, injury and liability. These risks are inevitable to most entrepreneurs in businesses. Prudent business owners take steps to minimize the risk of their businesses in other to maximize returns on investments. A good risk management system is a continuous process of analysis and communication to select the appropriate tool to manage risk.</p> <p>SMEs in Nigeria serve as vital indicative sources of growth, technological innovation and flexibility. However, they are saddled with towards growth and development strategies. SMEs are exposed to many risks in their ordinary</p> <p>course of business, such as interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, market risk, natural disasters, political risk, and technological risk and so on, that minimize their profit by increasing their</p> <p>3</p> <p>financial losses. However, insurance enshrined in sections 183 and 184 of the Insurance Act, 2006 (Act724) to serve as a buffer in the event of mishaps is not given the attention it deserves regardless of its significance to mitigate the effects of risks resulting from disasters or unexpected events. In Uyo, the level of patronage of insurance by SMEs as a risk transfer mechanism to mitigate risks such as collapse of building, fire outbreaks, accidents, burglary, business interruptions, and dishonesty of personnel tend to be wavy. What were the recovery measures in the wake of the potential losses and financial hardships?</p> <p>In view of this, the researcher examined the extent to which non-life insurance was used as a risk management tool by SMEs.</p> <ol><li><strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></li> </ol> <p>The research broadly sought to assess the extent to which SMEs adopt insurance as a risk management and minimizing tool and the benefits there in. Specifically, the research intended to achieve the following objectives to:</p> <ol><li>Identify what business risk(s) SMEs face;</li> </ol> <ol><li>Examine the response of SMEs towards the use of non-life insurance to mitigate pure risk(s);</li> </ol> <ol><li>Assess the benefits SMEs derive from using insurance as a risk management tool;</li> </ol> <ol><li>Identify any problems SMEs encounter in using insurance; and</li> </ol> <ol><li>Find out solutions to the challenges that SMEs encounter in using insurance.</li> </ol> <p>4</p> <ol><li><strong>Research Questions</strong></li> </ol> <p>The main research question addressed was: do SMEs use insurance to mitigate business risk(s)? The specific related questions to solve the research problem included the following:</p> <ol><li>What were the risk exposures that an SME was faced with?</li> </ol> <ol><li>Did entrepreneurs of SMEs have enough insurance for their businesses?</li> </ol> <ol><li>What was the level of response to using insurance as a risk management tool?</li> </ol> <ol><li>What benefits did SMEs derive from using insurance as a risk management tool?</li> </ol> <ol><li>What were the problems that SMEs encounter in using insurance?</li> </ol> <ol><li>What were the solutions to overcome the challenges that SMEs encountered in using insurance?</li> </ol> <ol><li><strong>Significance/Justification of the Study</strong></li> </ol> <p>The study would help identify the reasons for the level of patronage of insurance as a risk transfer mechanism and create a changed behaviour of the owners of SMEs. The research would benefit, risk managers, business consultants and business continuity consultants by identifying areas that they might need to consider when preparing disaster recovery plans, particularly for SMEs. Findings that emerged from the study would serve as a spring board to generate interest for further research into the other aspects of insurance challenges. The research work would also be of enormous assistance to various levels of educational institutions in the country, especially the universities as reference material for further studies and research work on insurance as a risk management strategy. The study would further contribute to the existing literature on mitigating and providing confidence to entrepreneurs in their investment decisions. Also, the insurance</p> <p>5</p> <p>regulator in the country should find it useful to adopt pragmatic means to enforce the unenforced insurance Acts in the country. Lastly, it might influence the level of premium incomes of non-life insurance companies in the country.</p> <ol><li><strong>Method of the study</strong></li> </ol> <p>The researcher made use of the survey method to generate primary data to achieve the objectives of the study, (Zikmund, 2000). A multiple stage sampling design was used to draw sample frame to avoid any bias. First, the metropolis was clustered into three electoral constituencies, constituting 19(nineteen) towns (Figure 3.1). A cluster sampling of 4(four) small scale businesses, 5(five) medium scale businesses were taken from each sample elements from the: central, south and north constituencies respectively. Nine (9) business units were clustered from each town. SMEs were divided into different clusters according to the number of employees. A total of 171 registered and non-registered SMEs were sampled and questioned. Different clusters of SMEs had the same number of employees as one sub-cluster. All thirteen insurance companies in the metropolis were</p> <p>respondents to section “C” of the question were contacted.</p> <p>Primary data was collected from respondents per the questionnaire. In gathering data, the researcher self-administered 13% of the questionnaire, while 87% of the remaining questionnaires were administered by trained personnel to administer and gather information from the entrepreneurs. The rationale for using this approach was to allow the respondents ample time with monitoring to answer at their own pace without taking them away from their work. The trained personnel read and interpreted questionnaires to non-literate respondents. In answering the questionnaire, the</p> <p>6</p> <p>respondents were asked to indicate their responses to the questions on a five point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree),  (Likert, 1932). Also closed and opened ended response questions were analysed.</p> <p>The researcher made use of qualitative and quantitative survey design for this study. The design involved the collection of data concerning the study. Frequency tables and percentages (%), figures and cross tabulation were used in analyzing the data with the aid of Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).</p> <ol><li><strong>Scope and Limitation of the Study</strong></li> </ol> <p>The study covered the use of insurance as a risk management tool by SMEs, evidence and</p> <p>prospects in the metropolis. Four categories of insurance protection were classified for any businesses: property, liability, people and income (Dorfman, 2008). These categories remained the focal points of reference in the research. Indemnification and risk pooling of the various categories of insurable risks enhance commercial transactions and the provision of credits by reducing losses. The research took a period of five months.</p> <p>Uyo Metropolis was one of the 20 administrative districts in the region of the area of study. It is the central business district and the capital of the northern region. The Metropolis shares boundaries with Savelugu-Nantong to the North West, Yendi to the East and Gonja to the South.</p> <p>The Uyo metropolis is the political, economical and financial capital of the region. The major government departments, NGOs and ministries have Uyo as the operational centre.</p> <p>7</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF INSURANCE IN MINIMIZING BUSINESS RISK IN SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF INSURANCE IN MINIMIZING BUSINESS RISK IN SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Nigeria happens to be one of those countries that desire to build a civilized nation with a strong and sound economy. Demonstration of such a desire is seen in Tax payment, but most citizens see it as government’s means of exploitation. Tax is a contribution imposed by the Government on income earners, importers, companies, investors, exporters, etc. (Holban, 2007).</p> <p>Revenue generated from tax happens to be a major source ofGovernment revenue in Nigeria, which makes it an important tool in the development of her economy. Every nation’s tax policy and equally their systems are related, greatly, with businesses and ventures in that country. A successful and finance-healthy business environmentis the result of aneconomy that enacts favorable tax policies. As businesses do well, the economy flourishes as well. This is because there is no faster way of quickening things in an economy other than the help of organizations that move goods, money services, and investments from those with surplus to those with deficit; those with marketable ideas/output to those who need these ideas and products. This shows that, businesses and tax policies are inter dependent. Each can’t do without the other.</p> <p>Tax System in Nigerian in recent times, has undergone notable changes. Various studies and researches by tax experts have helped as Tax laws are being reviewed with the aim of replacing non relevant provisions while simplifying the main ones. The current Nigerian lawplaced the responsibility on the shoulders of the 3 tiers of Government to enforce taxation with each having its jurisdiction clearly spelt out in the Taxes and Levies (approved list for Collection).</p> <p>Small businesses as generally recognized as drivers of economic success are a key ingredient in the “ecology of businesses” in a healthy system. They create jobs; generate sales which are sources of tax and fiscal revenue for government. The importance of small business as a creator of jobs cannot be ignored, especially for those with low skills. Small, medium and micro-enterprises (“SMMEs”) as they are generally categorizedemploy 68.2% of the workforce in the private sector while contributing to 60% of the country’s GDP. SMBs employ more than 60% of the total workforce in sectors like the agriculture,retail, construction etc. This has over the years, seen to the growth in employment by SMBs and has quadrupled their contribution to the nation’s GDP. Indeedthis sector of the economy, hold a hugepotential for job creation!</p> <p>One of the constraints to the expansion of businesses both in Nigeria and beyond are regulations otherwise known as red tapes in tax. As reported by International research, tax regulatory compliance costs are a significant portion of the total regulatory cost. There are several other patterns that haveemerged from the various local and international studies carried out, among the most imperative being that tax compliance costs comprises a much larger proportion of total compliance costs for smaller ventures.</p> <p>Furthermore, various studieshave suggested that for any approach to assist small business to be effective it will require both policy and administration model adjustments. The year 2005 saw the start of a process of structural change, intended to build a positive tax compliance climate for income earners and businesses in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) form the core of majority of the world’s economies.Federal Office of Statistics carried out a study that shows thatsmall and medium enterprises make up 98% of the economy in Nigeria; however, the mortality rate of these small businesses has been on the increase (Arroyo, 2005). According to Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of NigeriaSMEDANan SMB body in Nigeria, 70% of businesses into manufacturing, retailing and Agro based in Nigeria die off before their 5th anniversary.Tax related issues like multiple taxations and enormous tax burdens such as double tax assessment on the profit of the business and income of the owner are among the factors responsible for these untimely business close-ups. Reason has been that small and medium enterprises are usually viewed and treated in the same light as large corporations in many government policies. This is a major setback, the ignoring of their different unique natures. It is paramount to considerthese unique qualities, while dealing with small and medium enterprises. There is a needto consider issues on how these tax policies can be designed to encourage the growth of Small scale businesses with the most effective ways to administer them.</p> <p>Many businesses are not favored by the existing tax policies thereby making Tax a burden and a major problem for Start-Ups in Nigeria. Like we saw earlier, some businesses are already at the verge of collapse, while to ensure their businesses still exist, majority are still struggling to meet up with high tax rates Bateman (2007). A recent survey has shown that 91% of business owners admit that taxes have been huge constraints on their businesses, as it does not allow new businesses to cover up initial cost because taxes are high.</p> <p>An explanatory example of a medium scale business that has wind up in recent time precisely year 2014 in Uyo urban was Agatha Garden and Hotel Ltd (Source)  Letter of Cessation of business  written to Debt Management and Enforcement office(DM&amp;EO) of the Federal Inland Revenue Service(FIRS) dated 23rd October,2014 Referenced FIRS/SS/RHQ/DMO/113</p> <p>The content of the letter accompanied by other relevant reports not made available to me as requested for the purpose of this research work state that management of the Hotel decided to cease business activities because the cost of running the business was more than the revenue generated coupled with the series of uncollectable Tax Audit liabilities raised from 2007 to 2013 when the company was handling some major contract work with Mobile unlimited.</p> <p>According to the Federal Inland Revenue service (FIRS)Audit report</p> <p>Theincome generated by the Hotel was taxable and must be paid based on the audit findings</p> <p>However, failure will attract legal action against the Hotel management which was already been instituted by the Legal Department of the Service through Debt Management and Enforcement office</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to examine the impact of taxation on small and medium scale businesses in Uyo urban. Specific objectives of the study are:</p> <ol><li>To examine the relationship between multiple taxation and SMBs survival in Uyo Urban.</li> <li>ToIdentify the multiple taxes which the owners and operators of SMBs have been paying in Uyo Urban.</li> <li>To trace the failure or close up of Small and medium Scale Businesses in Uyo Urban to Multiple taxation.</li> <li>To find out the after effect of the business failures or close ups on the owners, operators, employees and the state in general.</li> <li>To recommend better ways of reducing the incidence of multiple taxation on SMBs in Uyo Urban.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In-order to guide the study and achieve the above stated research objectives, the following questions were formulated:</p> <ol><li>What relationship exists between multiple taxation and survival of small and medium scale businesses in Uyo urban?</li> <li>What are the various forms of multiple taxes which the owners and operators of SMBs have been paying in Uyo Urban?</li> <li>How can the failure or close up of Small and medium Scale Businesses in Uyo Urban be traced to Multiple taxation?</li> <li>What are the after effect of the business failures or close ups on the owners, operators, employees and the state in general?</li> <li>What better ways can be implemented to reduce the effect of multiple taxation on SMBs in Uyo Urban?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>1. Ho: There is no significant relationship between multiple taxation and SMBs’ survival.</p> <p>Hi: There is a relationship between multiple taxation and SMBs survival</p> <p>2. Ho: Multiple taxation do not account for business failures or close ups in Uyo Urban.</p> <p>Hi:Multiple taxation accounts for business failures or close ups in Uyo Urban</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study when conducted could give a clear insight into the various ways in which tax policies in Nigeria can be executed efficiently to still favor small businesses and how some taxation policies in Nigeria could be properly tackled. The study could also give a clear insight into the various causes of why small businesses fail in Nigeria as well as the challenges of the tax policies in Nigeria. The findings and recommendations of the researcher would help in building a strong and better tax policy system in Nigeria. The effects of multiple taxation on small and medium scale businesses are outlined in-order for drastic measures to be taken to tackle these challenges and meet the prospects of the general public so that revenue from tax policy to the government can be increased.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research focuses mainly on the impact of taxation on SMBs in Uyo Urban. The study only torches on the various taxes collected from SMBs, challenges tax policies in Nigeria and how it can affect self employed business men and women, traders, and other forms of sole proprietorship businesses.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The only limitation faced by the researcher in the course of carrying out this study was the delay in getting data from the various respondents. Most respondents were reluctant in completing questionnaires administered to them due to their busy schedules and nature of their work. The researcher found it difficult to collect responses from the various respondents, and this almost hampered the success of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.9 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Chapter one of this study includes the general introduction, background information about the study, statement of the problem, objectives of the study, research questions, scope of the study, significance of the study, and the limitation of the study.</p> <p>Chapter two reviews all relevant literatures relating to the study as well as the researcher’s views concerning previous studies on the effect of multiple taxation on Small and Medium Scale Businesses.</p> <p>Chapter three includes the methodology applied in collecting and analysing data, population definition, study site, and limitations.</p> <p>Chapter four presents the results of the study as well as data analysed, and the interpretation of the analyzed data.</p> <p>Chapter five includes a summary of the study, conclusion and recommendations based on the findings from the study.</p> <p><strong>1.9.1 Historical Background of Uyo Urban and multiple Taxation System</strong></p> <p>Uyo is a city in south-south Nigeria and is the capital of Akwa Ibom State, a major oil producing state of Nigeria. The city became the capital of Akwa Ibom State on September 23, 1987 following the creation of Akwa Ibom State from erstwhileCross River State. The University of Uyo resides in this city. The population of Uyo, according to the 2006 Nigerian Census which comprises Uyo and Itu, is 436,606.while the urban area, including Uruan, is 554,906.</p> <p>The city can be accessed by road via the A342 highway, as well as Abak Road, Nwaniba Road, Itu Road, and Aka Road. Nearby airports include the Uyo Airport, also known as the Akwa Ibom International Airport.</p> <p>Uyo is a fast-growing city, as the city has witnessed massive infrastructural growth in the past nine years. It has an intensive network of divided highways, such as the IBB Way, AtikuAbubakar Avenue, UdoUdoma Avenue, NsikakEduok Avenue, and EdetAkpan Avenue which is an eight-lane superhighway and currently the widest road in the Uyo metropolis.[citation needed] Currently, flyoversare being constructed to ease traffic. Three flyovers have already been completed at the Itam axis of the urban area which is under Itujurisdiction. Plans are in process for more flyovers as well as ongoing dualisation of Aka road, ongoing construction of Ring Road 3 with flyovers (a portion of it will be ten lanes) and the dualisation of WellingtionBassey Way</p> <p>Thisunprecedentedinfrastructural development has led to increase in the number of new businesses thereby also translating to increase government internally generated revenue through Taxation.</p> <p>However, the process of generating revenue by the Akwa Ibom State Internal Revenue Service over time has been challenging reason been that small and medium business owners are complaining and in most case resistant to TaxAuthority because of multiple Taxes.</p> <p>Notable among the multiple tax imposed in places such as URUA AKPANAMDEM(Akpanamdem Market) include general market tax, Environmental sanitation fees, security fees and kiosk/space fees</p> <p>Trycircle operators (keke) in February 2015 staged a peaceful demonstration against what they term multiple tax been collected by the state tax force an affiliate of the state ministry of transport and environment.</p> <p><strong>1.10 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Tax: </strong>According to Ariyo(2005), a<em>tax</em> is a financial charge or other levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a state or the functional equivalent of a state to fund various public expenditures.</p> <p><strong>SMB</strong>: Small and Medium Scale Businesses</p> <p><strong>Multiple Taxation</strong>: When a single amount of money is taxed more than once, often by two or more different authorities in a way that may be unfair or illegal (Bateman, 2007).</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>Ariyo, D.

Production scheduling and control as a part of the function of management deals with the scheduling and controlling of physical resource to be used by an enterprises to produce goods and services. By (Aleje A. B. Strategic Planning and control 1996) it is a design process through which input or raw materials are converted or transformed into output of useful product or service. Before production could be achieved, there must be a plan to that effect, this plan involves before production of goods or services to satisfy human wants is the major hold that keep every organization going smoothly.</p> <p>The organization also divided the choice of materials from which to start production with, the choice of facilities required the choice of route or services of work/task to be applied the choice of handling and storage system to be used for moving materials within the premises.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Most organization production activity are slow and the time give to complete a given tasks always exceed the expected given time. The researcher wants to investigate and know the reasons behind lower productivity among employees. The problems of production scheduling and control are discussed in this work and solutions suggested. At times the use of quantitative techniques in assigning jobs in an organization is not done well, the researcher want to see the reasons behind this. The inventory levels of organization are not properly maintained they    get short of materials due to lack of good control of stock. Lastly, the researcher want to know the problems associated with activity of scheduling in relation to noodles production and solution suggested.</p> <p>1.3     <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>For the successful accomplishment of any work, there must be a reason or purpose of setting such task. The objectives of the study are as follows.</p> <ul><li>To find out how production scheduling and inventory control is actually carried out in the organization.</li> <li>To numerate the degree of consumption of goods and service produce in the organization by the consumers.</li> <li>To find out whether Indomise Company is using quantitative techniques in planning production process.</li> <li>It will show us the importance of scheduling and control activities in the process of producing or manufacturing a product.</li> <li>To find out the problems facing in production scheduling and control and also suggest on how to alleviate the problem.</li> </ul> <p>1.4     <strong>STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>In the course of the research work, the following hypothesis shall be tested.</p> <p><strong>HO:</strong>    Inventory control done not affect the production performance in an organization.</p> <p><strong>Hi:</strong>     Inventory control affects the production performance in an organization.</p> <p>1.5     <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study of the project work cannot be over emphasized, it will help managers and organization to know which of the methods to apply at any given situation or circumstance they find themselves. It will also help organization to maximize profit through effective use of plant and machines and by taking corrective measure. The organization will see its own lapses and improve on them so as to meet its own objectives other organization in the same line can effect correction on their various productive systems.</p> <p>1.6     <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project work covers certain areas of the said organization. The major areas covered are the noodling line where the actual production scheduling and control activities mostly take place, it covers other departments in relation to production because they are all interrelate. It also looks at the use of mathematical techniques applied in the production of noodles. It also looks at the problem of scheduling activity to machine and the scope and concept of control in production management and its importance.</p> <p>1.7     <strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the course of writing this work, some limitations were encountered. For instance, due to high cost of transportation it has not been easy in conducting this research. Also time constraints or limited time is another factor.  Another problem is that some of the employees shows nonchalant attitude toward this work. Despite these problems faced the researcher was chanced to gather effective materials necessary for the successful completion of the project.</p> <p>1.8     <strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The historical background of Indomie Company Kaduna.

The importance of this sector cannot be over emphasized, especially in a typical developing country like ours where the level of youth unemployment is rising beyond control. Hence small and medium scale industries generate employment opportunities per unit of capital investment because they are generally more labour intensive which are more capital in nature. A large scale industry that cost N20million for instance, may employ a mere 70 (seventy) workers or less. Where as a small and medium scale industry that cost just N150,000 (one hundred and fifty thousand naira) may employ about 20-30 workers.</p> <p>Small and medium scale business specialized in the production and marketing of various products and services ranging from food, beverages, drinks/sachet water, cosmetics, spare parts and many others.</p> <p>Kilby (1969) acknowledge the diversity of terms of the degree of specialization and division of labour and the quantity of raw materials and output and the character of markets being served by small and medium scale businesses. As a result the bulk of Nigerian business falls within the small and medium scale business which account for over 80% of the number of enterprises in the country. (Ekunna 1992 Pg.160)</p> <p>Several number of small and medium scale business are successful while other fail or are staggering for survival due to poor background management, lack of qualified manpower, poor capital base, lack of marketing research and appropriate technology and credit rating among banks and other lenders. These problems continue to militate against the establishment, survival and growth of small and medium scale business in Nigeria. Although successful government in Nigeria have been emphasizing on the importance of small and medium scale business and have established institutional support agencies to facilitate industrialization.</p> <p>However, small and medium scale business still operate in uncertainty and are faced with serious obstacles, this raises the questions of whether  the federal government is actually up to the responsibility in the promotion of small and medium scale business in Nigeria.</p> <ol><li><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE ESSAY</strong></li> </ol> <p>The main objectives of this study is to evaluate the impact of federal government in the promotion of small and medium scale business in Nigeria. This study will specially seek to achieve the following:</p> <ol><li>To evaluate the marketing challenges facing small and medium scale businesses.</li> <li>To identify the sources of funds to the activities of the industry.</li> <li>To find out the extent of government involvement in  promoting the activities of the business.</li> <li>To bring to light the contribution of the industry to the development of national diploma in marketing.</li> </ol> <p>Finally, it is myhope that the students of marketing and others in related discipline will find this study very informative and useful tool in their respective studies.</p> <ol><li><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ol> <p>As the title of this essay indicates, the study focuses its attention to federal government support to small and medium scale business enterprises in Nigeria, it causes various policy, guidelines, direct and indirect financial assistance and other programs and initiatives designed to promote this vital sector of the country.</p> <ol><li><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ESSAY</strong></li> </ol> <p>The significance of this study lies basically on its contribution to knowledge and its benefits to individual and organization.

The Declaration asserts that every individual has the right to dignity, freedom, equality, a basis standard of living that includes freedom from hunger and violence and encourages tolerance and solidarity. The MDGS were made to operationalize these ideas by setting targets and indicators for poverty reduction in order to achieve the right set forth in the declaration on a set fifteen-year timeline. The aim of the MDGS is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world’s poorest countries. The MDGS call for a global partnership to address the most critical issues of our time (Mfam, 2009). The Millennium Development Goals (MDGS) are eight international development goals that were officially established following the Millennium Summit of the United Nation in 2000, following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. All 193 United Nations members and at least 23 International Organizations have agreed to achieve these goals by the year 2015. The goals are includes evaluating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing child mortality rates, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other disease, ensuring environmental suitability and developing a global partnership for development.</p> <p>Aremu (2008) observes that, the UN declaration stormed the world with a sort of refreshing atmosphere of hope when world leaders adopted the MDGS which besides embracing most of the objectives, included poverty dimension connected to hunger, water diseases, HIV/AIDS, orphans and urban poverty among others. Each of the goals has specific stated target and dates for achieving those targets. To accelerate progress, the G8 finance ministers agreed in June 2005 to provide enough funds to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the African Development Bank (ADB) to cancel an additional $40 to $55 billion in debt owned by members of heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) to allow impoverished countries to re-channel the resources saved from the forgiven debt to social programs for improving health and education and for alleviation poverty.</p> <p>Business Education can contribute significantly to accomplishment of millennium development goal in Nigeria and ensuring that the young learners have the skills, knowledge, and capabilities to perform their full role in Nigeria in the 21st century. Business Education enables young people to appreciate the interplay between modern society and its supporting economic, financial, and administrative structures by using models, techniques, and technology; and to understand and make informed judgments about aspects of society in local, national, and international contexts.</p> <p>Business Education through Business Management, Administration and IT, Economics and Accounting makes a significant contribution to preparing young people for work and life through developing skills, including literacy, numeracy, health and well-being, enterprise, financial literacy, global citizenship, communication, problem solving, and Information Communications Technology.</p> <p>However, Business Education is part of the experiences and outcomes at each stage and every student in Nigeria should be able to engage and develop through the subject. Practitioners and stakeholders involved in Business Education are now keen to ensure that all learners benefit from excellence in learning and teaching.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The major focus of business education is the development of the individual vis-à-vis the society. It is also a major tool for the quick transformation of any nation. The National Policy on Education (2004) has rightly described business education as instrument per excellence. In recognizing this crucial role of business education to human, entrepreneur and social development and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGS, 2000), have led to a greater attention being paid to advancement in business education. However, business education has contributed to the realization and accomplishment of various objectives in the millennium development goal which includes quality education development, poverty reduction through entrepreneurship development, gender equality and the application of modern information technologies. The researcher is hereby examining the impact of business education on the accomplishment of millennium development goals in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <ol><li>To examine the impact of business education on the accomplishment of millennium development goals in Nigeria.</li> <li>To examine the level of realization of the millennium development goals in Nigeria.</li> <li>To identify the factors limiting the accomplishment of the millennium development goals in Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the impact of business education on the accomplishment of millennium development goals in Nigeria?</li> <li>What is the level of realization of the millennium development goals in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the factors limiting the accomplishment of the millennium development goals in Nigeria?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>H0: Business education does not influence millennium development goal</p> <p>H1: Business education influence millennium development goal</p> <p><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <ol><li>The outcome of this study will educate students and educators of business education and the general public on the impact of business education on the accomplishment of millennium development goals in Nigeria.</li> <li>This research will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of the effect of personality trait on student’s academic performance, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will cover the impact of business education on the accomplishment of millennium development goals in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p> <strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

As part of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) of 1986, the Nigerian Government initiated a large scale restructuring </p> <p>Of the financial sector and the liberalization of the regulations concerning financial institutions and markets. This was justified on the basis of existing market failures which</p> <p>arose from externalities and lack of information</p> <p> Using the econometric techniques, we found, that financial liberalization increased the real deposit ratio and also will lead to a substitution into financial asset resulting in a greater supply credit to finance real investment for capital market development and economic growth. Consequently, we recommend that for macroeconomic stability, efficiency and proper development of the financial system, direct control should be discouraged while indirect control should be encouraged through the market mechanism.                                                                                                </p> <p> <strong> CHAPTER   ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> Just like other African Economies, Nigeria’s financial sector is underdeveloped and unorganized. It is characterized by dualism, market segmentation and spatial fragmentation [Iyoha, 2002]. Financial sector facilitates the conduct of trade transactions, the efficient use of financial resources, mobilization of savings and risk taking which are central to sustained Economic Growth and Development.</p> <p>According to T.W. Oshikoya and Osita Ogbu [1995], financial liberalization in several African countries has been implemented largely through Structural Adjustment Programs. In Nigeria, until the adoption of structural adjustment program in 1986, financial repression and bureaucratic control of interest rates were the order of the day.</p> <p>Economic Development creates demands for particular types of financial arrangements and the financial system responds automatically to these demands. Finance, is argued to act as a catalyst in the process of Development but if repressed could become fetters or obstacles to the Growth process [Ikhide, 1997].</p> <p> Even though the money and capital markets in Nigeria are not as deep as desirable, a start seems to have been made in the late 1980s and early 1990s to develop a more robust and balanced financial structure that would improve the ability of the domestic financial system to mobilize savings and contribute to self sustained Economic Growth [Iyoha, 2002].</p> <p>The objectives of the liberalization are to build more efficient, robust and deeper financial systems, which can support the growth of private sector enterprise. Efficiency entails two components; which are improved credit allocation and more or higher quality financial services for a given level of inputs [Brown Bridge and Gayi, 2001].</p> <p>The role played by the financial sector is an Economy can be important in determining Economic Growth. A growing empirical literature demonstrates that the Development of the financial system has positive effects on the long run rate of Economic Growth and the volume and efficiency of investment [Fry, 1995 Philip Arestis et al, 2002], through the removal of the elements of financial repression, particularly controlled interest rates, financial sector liberalization is expected to lead to higher nominal and real interest rate [Emenuga, 2001]. </p> <p>  The capital market is divided into two segments: the primary market where companies’ shares are issued for the first time before being quoted on the stock exchange and secondary market where is trading is done in existing stocks. The capital market has served as a source of long- term fund to finance investment in the private sector of the Nigerian Economy.                                                                   </p> <p> The liberalization of the financial sector involved liberalization of interest rates, promotion of market based system of credit allocation and enhancing completion and efficiency of the regulatory and supervisory framework [Ikhide, 1997]</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>This study attempts to examine the extent to which the liberalization policy has resolve the problems existing in the system which are direct controls, the pervasive Government intervention in the financial system and the resultant stifling of competition and resource misallocation.</p> <p> This study attempts to find out the extent to which the liberalization policy has resolve the problem of externalities, which relates to the distortions caused by high and volatile inflation.</p> <p> This study is concerned with the impact of the liberalization policy on the information problems, which is in the form of informational asymmetries between the suppliers and uses of financial services.</p> <p><strong>1.3 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will undertake an analysis of the financial liberalization policy with a view to identifying the reason that led to the adoption of the policy. The focus will be on measuring the influence and effects of financial sector liberalization on some capital market Development indicators as far as the availability of Data permits. The period of the study is from 1970- 2004 in order to carry out a trend analysis on the before the liberalization period [1970 – 1985] and after the liberalization [1986 – 2004].</p> <p><strong>1.4 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Financial sector reforms in Nigeria has embraced a number of policies designed to increase the size, improve the efficiency and raised the diversity of the financial system. This goal is achieved through financial liberalization which is viewed as the process of moving towards market- determined prices on all classes of financial products, characterized by symmetric entry and exit conditions to all participants increasing internationalization as represented by the opening up of domestic markets to international competition [Ikhide, Yinusa, 1998].</p> <p> The liberalization of financial institutions and markets is an improvement in financial intermediation, which is considered a necessary condition for stimulating investment, raising productive capacity and fostering Economic Growth and Development.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong>5   <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>   The general objective of this study is to determine the extent to which financial liberalization have led to the development of the capital market in Nigeria. To achieve this general objective, the following specific objectives will be examined.</p> <p>1. To provide a comprehensive insight into the structure of the capital market in Nigeria.</p> <p>2. To examine the impacts of liberalization on the Development of the capital market.</p> <p>3. To access the impact of reform policies like debt conversion programs.</p> <p>1.<strong>6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>This study will be based on the following Research Questions:</p> <p>1. Has the financial sector liberalization measures been effective in achieveing its stated objectives?</p> <p>2. Has the financial sector liberalization measures been able to solve the repressed nature of the Nigerian capital market?</p> <p>3.

Following the adoption of Economic reform programme in Nigeria in 1981, there have been several decisions to switch from capital intensive and large scale industrial projects which was based on the philosophy of import development to Small and Medium Scale Enterprises which have better prospects for developing domestic economy, thereby generating the required goods and services that will propel the economy of Nigeria towards development. It is base on this premise that Ojo O. (2009), argued that one of the responses to the challenges of development in developing countries particularly, in Nigeria, is the encouragement of entrepreneurial development scheme. Despite the abundant natural resources, the country still finds it very difficult to discover her developmental bearing since independence. Quality and adequate infrastructural provision has remained a nightmare, the real sector among others have witnessed downward performance while unemployment rate is on the increase. Most of the poor and unemployed Nigerians in order to better their lots have resorted to the establishment of their own businesses. Consequently, Entrepreneurship is fast becoming a household name in Nigeria. This is as a result of the fact that the so called white collar jobs that people clamor for are no longer there. Even, the touted sectors (Banks and companies) known to be the largest employer of labour are on the down-turn following the consolidation crisis and fraudulent practice of the high and mighty in the banking sector. The companies of course are folding up as a result of erratic power supply, insecurity and persistent increase in interest rate which has lead to high cost of production and undermines profit making potentials of companies operating in Nigeria. As a result of banking sector practices and continuous folding up of companies, a lot of Nigerians are thrown into unemployment  which inevitably detriment the economic situation of the country.</p> <p>Since the office jobs that people desire are no longer there for the teeming population, and few ones that succeeded in getting the jobs are thrown out as a result of the factors identified above, the need for the government and the people to have a rethink on the way-out of this mess became imperative. Hence, the need for Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) became a reality as a means of ensuring self independent, employment creation, import substitution, effective and efficient utilization of local raw materials and contribution to the economic development of our dear nation (Nigeria). All the aforestated benefits of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises cannot be achieved without the direct intervention of the government and financial institutions. Over the years, a number of policies have been formulated by the government with a view to developing Small and Medium Scale Enterprises. The Nigerian government under the then leadership of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo promulgated micro-finance policy and other regulatory and supervisory framework in 2005.</p> <p>The research will therefore examine the impact of small and medium enterprise development on youth empowerment in Kaduna metropolis.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>There has been stunted growths and sluggish development in the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) regardless of increasing targeted government assistance streamlined to benefit firms operating in this sector. There were several policies in the past which gave priorities to entrepreneurship development, indicating the trust in government policy in support of SMEs. The government of Nigeria identified entrepreneurship development as a major thrust to achieve economic development through SMEs growth and development.</p> <p>This made Nigerian government both at National and State as well as local government to prioritize small and medium enterprises development initiatives by. As such the prioritization of the small and medium scale by government at different level is echoed in almost every policy document.</p> <p>For example in the industrial development policy in vision 2020, the Nigeria aim is to promote and support small and medium enterprise as they are viewed as an important engine for employment creation and economic growth. Although the government of Nigeria has been advancing targeted support in marketing, management and finance and worse still others collapsed. Egbe (2004) in this regard rated Nigeria as having one of the lowest small and medium scale sector’s share of employment in the world, when “250 employees” was considered the yard stick in the definition of small and medium scale enterprise. Targeted government assistance has been observed to play a pivotal role in starting, growing and medium scale enterprise in Nigeria, (Beck, 2005; Zainab, 2008; Herbert 2008 and Atino, 2001). Although some entrepreneurs in SMEs have received both financial and non financial assistance, many are still small or are facing viability problems. In Nigeria, the SMEs sector is facing to contribute meaningfully to the national economy as was experienced elsewhere when governments advanced target support. Targeted government support to SMEs was found to translate into economic development in countries like Indonesia where SMEs accounted for 98% of employment creation and growth with Japan and Thailand having their SMEs contributing 81% and 78% to gross domestic product (GDP) (Okoh, 2009).</p> <p>This contrast has promoted the researcher to carryout a study to investigate the impact of small and medium scale enterprise on youth empowerment in Kaduna. As well as to find out the forms of government support render to small and medium scale enterprises in Kaduna.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The central objective of the study is to examine the impact of small and medium scale enterprises development on youth empowerment in Kaduna Metropolis.  The specific objectives are:</p> <ol><li>To assess how small and medium scale enterprises development affect employment generation in Kaduna Metropolis.</li> <li>To investigate the forms of targeted government support rendered to small and medium scale enterprise in Kaduna Metropolis.</li> <li>To analyze the efficacy of government capacity building programmes and support to promote the development of SMEs among youth in Kaduna Metropolis.</li> <li>To evaluate the sufficiency of youths empowerment through SMEs development initiatives in Kaduna and recommend possible policy adjustments.</li> </ol> <p>1.4    <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>In order to affectively investigate the problem of this research, the researcher formulated the following research questions:</p> <ol><li>What are the effects of small and medium scale enterprises     development on employment generation in Kaduna Metropolis?</li> <li>What kind of support does the government render to small and medium scale enterprise in Kaduna Metropolis?</li> <li>How effective is government capacity building programmes and support in promoting the development of SMEs among youths in Kaduna Metropolis?</li> </ol> <p>How sufficient is youth empowerment through SMEs development initiative in Kaduna Metropolis?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Statement of hypothesis</strong></p> <p>In order to confirm the impact of SMEs development on youth empowernment in kaduna metropolis and fully appreciate their respective relevant significance, the following hypotheses is   postulated:</p> <p>H0: There is no significance relationship between SMEs development and youth empowerment in Kaduna metropolis.</p> <p>H1: There is significant relationship between SMEs development and youth empowerment in Kaduna metropolis.</p> <p>1.6<strong>    Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The study will be beneficial to entrepreneurship development; as such Kaduna state government can utilize the findings of the research as a basis for policy formulation as regard entrepreneurship development.</p> <p>The study will also contribute to the existing knowledge on entrepreneurship development.</p> <p>It is also worthy to note that the study can be use as a basis for further research, as the research can be use as a spring board for further research as well as a good reference material to students undertaking similar research.</p> <p>1.8<strong>     Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>The study covers an empirical examination of the effect of small and medium scale development on youth empowerment in kaduna metropolis. The study also identifies the practical approaches use in developing entrepreneurship as well as the problems militating against entrepreneurship development. The study is limited to Kaduna metropolis.</p> <p>The study covers a time from 2006 – 2011.</p> <p>1.7<strong>    Limitation of the study</strong></p> <p>The study is limited to Kaduna metropolis, as it will be difficult to cover other part of the state due to the duration of this study.</p> <p>For the fact that a survey study was used as the research design as well as the questionnaire as the research instrument, it is not certain if the same result would be obtained if other designs and instruments were used. Besides, another limitation is that the respondents could have either over exaggerated or understate their responses while scoring the items in the questionnaire. Also the nonchalant attitude of some of the respondents could affect the validity of their response to the questionnaire. This limitation should be taking cognizance of other researches conducting similar studies.</p> <p>1.9<strong>    Definition of terms</strong></p> <p>-        <strong><em>Entrepreneurship</em></strong>: is an innovative act, which includes endowing existing resources for new wealth – producing capacity (Afonja, B. 1999).</p> <p>-        <strong><em>Entrepreneur</em></strong>: An individual that identifies develops and brings vision to life under – condition of risk and a considerable uncertainty (Bashar, O. 2005)</p> <p>-        <strong><em>Entrepreneurial Characteristic</em></strong>: These are traits that make an individual an entrepreneur (Tonga, R. 2009).</p> <p>-        <strong><em>Business Performance</em></strong>: The success or failure of an enterprise (Tonga, R. 2009).</p>\n\nIMPACT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ON YOUTH EMPOWERMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ON YOUTH EMPOWERMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 52}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Small and Medium enterprises are the catalyst for economic growth in most economies thus, the fundamental objective of this study is to investigate the impact of loans on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria. So that the ability of SMEs to develop positively and drive economic growth in the Nigeria will become real. Simple random sampling technique was employed in selecting the 100 SMEs that constituted the sample size of the research. Structured questionnaire was designed to facilitate the acquisition of relevant data which was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics which involves simple percentage graphical charts and illustrations was tactically applied in data presentations and analysis. The findings of the study reveal that significant number of the SMEs benefitted from the loans even though only few of them were capable enough to secure the required amount needed. Interestingly, majority of the SMEs acknowledge positive contributions of loans towards increasing their returns and sales thus placing them in the competitive arena. It is recommended that Banks should review their interest rate downwards and also share best practices with their SME customers especially on the efficient use of loans; this will boost their productivity and support SMEs in Nigeria.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF BANK LOANS ON SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF BANK LOANS ON SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p> The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between the contributions of insurance companies and the growth of SMEs in NICON basing on the following objectives; to examine major factors that affects the growth of SMEs; to assess the contribution of insurance companies to the growth of SMEs; to investigate the factors inhibiting the purchase of insurance cover by SME operators and to determine the strength of the relationship between insurance companies and growth of SMEs. The research was descriptive in nature involving quantitative methods which was administered through questionnaires. The total sample comprised of 65 respondents of all the managers and employees of National Insurance Corporation. Simple random sampling was used whereby the researcher went to NICON and administered questionnaire to the sampled or selected employees. Primary data was obtained from the library materials, textbooks, NICON brochures, internet and journals. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS and frequency distribution tables. Findings revealed that innovation is a strong empirical evidence for fast growing SMEs, competition has a great effect on SMEs industry and credit remains a great challenge to the growth of SMEs. Besides that insurance companies mitigate risks and enhance loan acceptability by SMEs sector with banks. However low income earned by SMEs, high premium cost and paperwork and experience and beliefs inhibit the purchase of insurance cover by SMEs. Nevertheless, there is a strong positive relationship between insurance companies and the growth of SMEs at Spearman Correlation Coefficient.</p> <p> It was concluded that improvement in business skills increases the performance of SMEs. However insurance companies do not lowers insurance rates and offer protection to SMEs income statements. In addition SMEs being small in size and their inability to fully understand the document limits them to get insurance cover. It was recommended that management of NICON need to build a great relationship with SMEs as their customers in orders to develop and grow them in trust and also lower the premium rates to SMEs in order to improve on their performance. Also NICON need to have a fresh look at the scope and spectrum of services provided to SMEs and has a better understanding on the scale of enterprise sector.</p>\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES TO THE GROWTH OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE BUSINESSES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CONTRIBUTION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES TO THE GROWTH OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE BUSINESSES", "id": 54}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study looked at the Impact of Venture Capital Financing on SMEs in the Uyo Local Government area. Efforts by successive Government to improve on the performance and growth of SMEs had led to the enactment of different policies and act including the Venture Capital Fund to assist SMEs. SMEs still in Nigeria have been faced with liquidity and financing challenges leading to business failures under production Industrial disputes and sometimes closures by regulatory authorities.</p> <p>In order to achieve the objectives for the study, 50 questionnaires were administered to Manager/SME owners operating within the Uyo Local Government area with focus on Elsa Foods Ltd using convenience sampling techniques. It was generally observed that SME‟s prefer-financing andselfoccasionally received support from financial institutions. The findings further shows that SMEs continue to rely on many financing options both at their conceptual and expansion stage. Majority of the SMEs were however not aware or had little knowledge about Venture Capital Financing as an alternative to financing. Firms that had benefited from Venture Capital Financing stated that they did not only receive capital inflow but was accompanied with monitoring, technical skills and expertise, access to management, marketing and distribution and reputation for attracting further finance. The study recommends that SMEs need to recognize the potential advantages of seeking equity finance from venture capital. Venture capital fund managers can do much to encourage venture capital investment from corporate investors. Government and policy makers should play a dual role as both facilitators and educators in encouraging the venture capital process.Following from the conclusions and recommendation a more detailed research involving SMEs from different industries and states is highly recommended.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF VENTURE CAPITAL FINANCING ON SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF VENTURE CAPITAL FINANCING ON SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA", "id": 55}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUD</strong><strong>Y</strong></p> <p>The issue of employment is very germane to any economy; this is why one of the main macroeconomic objectives of any country is to attain full employment. The issue of employment is paramount to Africa and Nigeria in particular, where high-level poverty is obvious with rising unemployment rates. However, in order to combat the problem of poverty, Oni (2006) argued that reducing the level of unemployment will increase the income level in the economy and thereby reduce the level of poverty. To increase the level of employment, some scholars have argued that the flow of goods and services (trade flows) could propel employment generation, especially in developing countries.</p> <p>According to Pieper(2006), growth in employment has a feedback on economic growth, such that an increase in labour incomes would expand domestic demand, which in turn would lead to sustainable GDP growth and reducing risks of excessive reliance on uncertain foreign markets. Given this fact, trade can absorb Nigeria’s surplus labour and this can go long way in alleviating poverty for the majority of the poor Nigerians.</p> <p>        Economists have long been interested in factors which cause different countries to grow at different rates and achieve different levels of wealth. One of such factors is foreign trade. Nigeria is basically an open economy with international transactions constituting a significant proportion of her aggregate output. To a large extent, Nigeria’s economic development depends on the prospects of her import and export trade with other nations. Foreign trade provides both foreign exchange earnings and market stimulus for accelerated economic growth (Obadan, 2004). Nigeria’s relatively large domestic market can support growth but alone cannot deliver sustained growth at the rates needed to make a visible impact on unemployment and poverty reduction. Hence Nigeria has continued to rely on foreign market as well (World Bank, 2002).</p> <p>        Many economists generally agree that openness to international trade accelerate development. The more rapid growth may be a transition effect rather than a shift to a different steady states growth rates, clearly, the tradition takes a couple of decades or more so, that is, it is reasonable to speak of foreign trade openness accelerating growth rather than merely leading to a sudden onetime adjustment in net income (Dollar and Kraay, 2001).</p> <p>Nigeria is characterized with a ‘dualistic’ labour market in which the minority of workers have regular formal sector jobs, while majority works in the informal sector, with a large pool of surplus labour. This is seen from its rapidly increasing labour force. The impact of trade liberalisation on employment growth in Nigerian economy; considering the vision of the country, the welfare of its people and its economic position in the world today, tend to be a special area of interest for the academic world and for policy makers.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In spite of the country’s large pool of surplus labour, rapidly growing labour force and increasing employment, the share of employed workers in total labour force has been declining since 1980, coupled with this, in the last two decade, the trend has been below 70%,which is an indication of high unemployment as more than 30% of its active population are unemployed.</p> <p>This trend is not surprising as Nigeria is highly dependent on imports for most of its raw materials inputs (CBN, 2007) and the employment effect of these imports might be positive if a significant portion of imports serves as inputs for labour intensive industries. However, this trend has given rise to debates in developing countries where concerns have been expressed over the loss of jobs due to import competition (Ghose 2003) and deindustrialisation as result of increased imports</p> <p>However, government has tried to reverse this trend through the implementation of policies to diversify the country’s export base away from oil so as to promote a stronger export performance. Such export policy includes export promotion strategies in which incentives were given for the promotion of non-oil exports particularly agriculture and labour intensive manufactures. As noted by Arbache (2010) and Rama (2011), globalisation increases employment level in countries embracing the strategies. Therefore, there had been an ongoing argument between government and public, while the former opined that her export promotion policies have increased the level of employment, majority of the people believe that unemployment is on the rise; it is against this backdrop that we consider it interesting to determine whether the flow of imports and exports have brought any significant effects on employment growth in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this research is to empirically examine the impact of trade liberalisation on employment growth in Nigeria between the year 1981 to 2013.</p> <p>Specifically, the study also seeks:</p> <ol><li>To examine the trend in trade liberalisation vis a vis employment growth in Nigeria.</li> <li>To examine the extent at which trade liberalisation can generate employment.</li> <li>Proffering appropriate framework based on the policy recommendations made.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>This study aims at answering the following research questions:</p> <p>i       Does a long or short run relationship or both exist between trade flows and employment?</p> <p>ii. To what extent is Nigeria’s total employment growth rate attributed to domestic factors and external factors?</p> <p>iii. What are the factors that hinder trade liberalisation?</p> <p><strong>1.5   RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following hypothesis will be tested in the course of this study:</p> <p>H0:   Trade liberalisation has no significant impact on employment growth in Nigeria.</p> <p>H1    Trade liberalisation has significant impact on employment growth in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The findings of this study will provide an insight as to whether trade liberalisation has any significant impact on Nigeria’s employment growth. Hence, policy makers will be able to formulate an articulate and comprehensive policy with respect to trade liberalisation management in Nigeria.  This research will also provide an objective view to the relevance of trade liberalisation on employment growth in Nigeria. The findings of this research will also serve as a useful reference material for further research on the impact of trade liberalisation on employment growth in Nigerian economy.</p> <p><strong>1.7   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The analysis that will be made in this study shall be based on macroeconomic data in Nigeria economy. Due to the linearity nature of the model formulation, Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation method would be employed in obtaining the numerical estimates of the coefficients in the model using Eviews.</p> <p>Two multiple regression models shall be used in the estimation. The model shall seek to investigate the effect of trade liberalisation on employment growth in Nigeria. This is a follow up on the objectives of study stated earlier.</p><p> 1.8   SCOPE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>The economy is a large component with lot of diverse and sometimes complex parts; this research work will only look at a particular part of the economy (Trade). This work cannot cover all the facets that make up the Trade sector, but will look at trade liberalisation has been used by the government for the stabilization, and attaining economic development.</p> <p>The empirical analysis and estimation covers the period between 1981 and 2013. This restriction is unavoidable because of the non-availability of some data.</p> <p>The data for this study would be obtained mainly from secondary sources; particularly from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) publications such as the CBN Statistical Bulletin, CBN Annual Reports and Statements of Accounts, and National Bureau of Statistics publications.</p> <p><strong>1.9   LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Finance is one of the elements that assist a good research. Financial constraint created difficulties in the process of this research work; however, it did not hinder the research.</p> <p>The main limitation of this study is time constraint. The time allotted for the completion of this research is not adequate based on recent and contemporary happening with respect to the impact of trade liberalisation on employment growth in Nigerian economy.</p> <p><strong>1. 1.0 ORGANISATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study shall be divided into five chapters. The first chapter provides the background of the subject matter justifying the need for the study. Chapter two presents related literature concerning trade liberalisation on employment growth in Nigeria. The research methodology, which includes the theoretical framework, sources of data, model formulation, estimation techniques etc, are stated in chapter three while data presentation, analysis and interpretation  of regression result were made in chapter four. Concluding comments in chapter five reflects on the summary, conclusion, recommendations and suggestion for further studies based on the findings of the study.</p> <p><strong>1 .1.1 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>The following words are operationally defined as they would be used in this research study.</p> <p><strong>Trade liberalisation: </strong>The removal or reduction of restrictions or barriers on the free exchange of goods between nations. This includes the removal or reduction of both tariff (duties and surcharges) and non-tariff obstacles (like licensing rules, quotas and other requirements).</p> <p><strong>Foreign Trade: </strong>This is a trade between two or more countries. It is also referred to as international trade or external trade. It is a trade outside the national boundaries of countries. Foreign trade could be bilateral trade, which is trade between two countries or multilateral trade, which is trade between more than two countries.</p> <p><strong>Employment: </strong>This is a state of having a legitimate paid work. This is the opposite of unemployment.</p> <p><strong>Economic Growth: </strong>This refers to the increased over time of an economy’s capacity to produce those goods and services needed to improve the well-being of the citizens in increasing number and diversity. It is the study of the process by which productive capacity of the economy is increased over time to bring about rising level in national income.</p> <p><strong>Economic Development: </strong>This is a multi-dimensional process involving the provision of basic needs, acceleration of economic growth, reduction of inequality and unemployment, eradication of poverty as well as changes in attitude, constitution and structure in the economy.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION ON EMPLOYMENT GROWTH IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION ON EMPLOYMENT GROWTH IN NIGERIA", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p> For both developing and developed countries, small and medium scale firms play important roles in the process of industrialization and economic growth. Apart from increasing per capita income and output, Small Medium businesses create employment opportunities, enhance regional economic balance through industrial dispersal and generally promote effective resource utilization considered critical to engineering economic development and growth. However, the seminal role played by Small Medium businesses notwithstanding its development is everywhere constrained by inadequate funding and poor management. The unfavourable macroeconomic environment has also been identified as one of the major constraints which most times encourage financial institutions to be risk-averse in funding small and medium scale businesses. The reluctance on the part of financial institution to fund Small Medium businesses can be explained by the insufficient capital base of banks and information asymmetry that often exists between Small Medium businesses and lending institutions.</p> <p>This study critically examines the availability of business credit to small business in Nigeria, and how more funding can be made to support small businesses. However, this chapter, forms the basic foundation for this study as it presents the objectives of the study, and the statement of problem that motivated the researcher to undertake the study.</p> <p><strong>1.2 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY AND ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE</strong></p> <p>During the 1990s, a number of studies documented that lending to small businesses and the economic activity of small businesses were affected by financial sector disruptions, such as the widespread merging of banks of all sizes and the capital shortfalls occasioned by large loan losses.</p> <p> Although not much previous research has examined discrimination in small business credit markets, there has been an active debate on the question of whether banks discriminate against minority applicants for mortgages. In an influential study in that area, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston tried to collect any information that might be deemed economically relevant to whether a loan would be approved along with the borrower’s race andf financial status (Munnell et al., 1996). In the raw data larger firms had 10 percent of their loans rejected versus rejection rates of 28 percent for small scale businesses. After controlling for the large number of variables collected to establish the credit-worthiness of the borrowers (including, the amount of the debt, debt/income ratio, credit history, loan characteristics, etc.) small scale businesses were still percentage points less likely to be granted the loan.</p> <p> A variety of criticisms have been launched at this study (see, for example, Horne 1994; Day and Liebowitz, 1998; Harrison, 1998); responses to these criticisms are found in Browne and Tootell (1996). The most common critique indicates that we cannot make a determination of discrimination unless those small businesses whose loans are approved have a greater likelihood of repayment. This argument rests critically upon an implied assumption that the distribution of repayment probabilities for large companies and small businesses is identical. His figure indicates that if this assumption is met and if firms discriminate against small businesses by setting a higher bar for loan approval, then the mean rate of repayment among small businesses conditional upon loan approvalwill be higher for large and smaller firms.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></p> <p>Small businesses and entrepreneurial ventures which are usually considered as the engine that run the economy are usually denied access to credit due to their risky nature. This disturbing threat has existed for a very long time and needs proper attention from both government agencies and non governmental agencies as well. The importance of small businesses in the development of Nigeria cannot be overlooked. Without proper credit availability to small businesses, the economy as a whole will suffer. The objectives of economic planning cannot be achieved if small businesses do not do well. Keeping this in view, the Bank of Nigeria has streamlined Bank’s lending operations to ensure that banks’ credit actually benefits small and medium businesses in Nigeria. This strategy is intended to improve the economy and to develop rural areas in Nigeria.</p> <p>However, there is some anecdotal evidence that most beneficiaries of business credit from most financial institutions are salaried workers and large scale companies, whose ability to repay loans are believed to be better than that of small scale businesses. Moreover, this belief is not always the case as some small businesses who go for loans are well profitable and well managed.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p> This paper is aimed at the following objectives:</p> <p>1. To examine the relationship that exist between small scale businesses and financial institutions that grant business credits in Uyo.</p> <p>2. To identify the challenges faced by small businesses in securing business credit in Uyo.</p> <p>3. To examine the degree of business credit availability to small businesses in Uyo.</p> <p>4. To identify the effects of businesses credit availability on small businesses in Uyo.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p> The following questions were used by the researcher in achieving the research objectives of this study:</p> <p>1. What relationship exists between you and financial institutions that grant credit in Uyo?</p> <p>2. What challenges do you face when securing credit for your business?</p> <p>3. How often business credit is made available to you when you apply for it?</p> <p>4. What effects have the availability of business credit had on your business?</p> <p><strong>1.5. RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>Business credit is not readily available to SMEs in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>Business credit is readily available to SMEs in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> This study is very important because it is aimed at examining the effects of business credit availability and its effect on small businesses in Uyo. The paper will provide some relevant recommendations for policy makers, development agencies, entrepreneurs, and small business managers to help seek better ways to increase business credits to small businesses, and appropriate strategies to improve the small business sector in Nigeria.</p> <p> Secondly, the study is also vital since it suggest to small businesses certain strategies they can adopt before seeking business credits, to make their borrowing process easier and more effective. This will go a long way to increase the efficiency and profitability level of small businesses in Uyo. Any time these strategies are put in place, access to business credit increases, and the participation of more people in entrepreneurial activities will also increase, hence the economy of Nigeria will be improved.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> The area chosen for this study is Uyo in the Eastern region of Nigeria. The study is limited to the effects of business credit availability on small businesses in Uyo, using various small businesses in Uyo as a focus point.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> In undertaking this research, the researcher encountered the following problems;</p> <p> 1. The time used to undertake the study was limited. The time was loaded with other academic activities and as a result limited time was made available the study.</p> <p> 2. Also, response from the various small business owners through the questionnaire provided by the researcher was also a bit slow. This is because of reasons such much work load on the part of the respondents.</p> <p><strong>1.8 CHAPTER SCHEME</strong></p> <p> The project will be organized around following chapters;</p> <p> Chapter one gives an introduction to the research work.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</strong></p> <p>Taxation is one of the major fiscal policies the government of any nation such as Nigeria can use to achieve economic stability and in the financing of capital expenditure. Various taxes are levied upon the income, wealth or gain of an individual, family and business firm by the government for the purpose or benefits of the general public.</p> <p>Tax by a simple definition is a financial charge or other levy imposted upon a tax payer which could be an individual or a legal entity from the point of view of the student researcher by a state such that failure to pay is punishable by law. Thus, taxation cannot be regarded as a voluntary payment or donation but an enforced contribution exacted pursuant to legislative authority. In modern taxation system such as Nigeria, taxes are levied, in money which could be use for myriads of functions or purpose such ay a expenditure on public order, protection of lives and property, economic infrastructure  cures such as roads, public works,   social  engineering  and  the  operation  of  government itself (Carrol, et al 2000).</p> <p> The taxes collected by the government no doubt emanate from varying sources ranging from personal income tax, company income tax, capital gain tax, property tax, education, tax, task but to list a few.</p> <p> The Nigerian government in attempt to raise revenue and enhance the economic development of Nigeria has subjected many firms to multiple taxations which they are mandated or made compulsory to pay irrespective of the sector the business firms operate or else take the wrath of the law A survey carried out by the Manufacturers Association of Nigerian (MAN1) and (Centre for International Private Enterprise ICIPE) identified multiple taxation as the bane of private sector business growth in Nigeria (Anyamvu, 2012).      The survey established the relationship between multiple taxations in the pilot state across the three tiers of government and re-affirmed its negative effects to private sector growth and businesses in Nigeria.</p> <p> According to the survey, it was established that multiple taxation could lead to divestment as well as jeopardize foreign direct investment coming into Nigeria, while adversely affecting the Competitions of</p> <p> existing businesses and their survival, Moreover it was also established that currently most businesses in Nigeria consider the tax environment as unfriendly and disincentive to business, stressing that it engenders loss of man hour to both the government and private businesses.</p> <p> According to Osagie (2012) tax environment inNigeria especially the policy on multiple taxation increases the cost of doing business in the country. As a matter of fact, some business including manufacturing companies have shut down production while in some cases, have relocated their factories to other West African countries which are considered to be more investment friendly. Against this back drop, this project examines the effects of multiple taxation on business survival in Nigeria.</p>\n\nEFFECTS OF MULTIPLE TAXATION ON BUSINESS SURVIVAL IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF MULTIPLE TAXATION ON BUSINESS SURVIVAL IN NIGERIA", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study of the role of government agencies towards the development of small scale enterprises is quite interesting. These enterprise have a very important impact on the life of everybody in the society. Small independence business are everywhere and in every line of work, they can also be seen in every community. This business is as old as man. So virtually everything is done in life involved the element of business. Small scale enterprise constitutes an importance in todays business activities or system. The role of small scale enterprise in our economic history however, has been one of the distribution and contribution.</p> <p> Although its relative importance has decline with the growth of the big business, small scale business is till major contribution to the countries economy. Business in Nigeria today is made up of both large and small business. Today small scale enterprise have to enjoy more prestige than ever before because of its vital contribution to the nations economy. So vital is small scale business. There are successful small scale enterprise operating like the manufacturing plants, retails, stores, wholesales, drugs, computers, construction firms and hundred of other type of business.</p> <p> Nigeria population was estimated to be 140 million in 2007 with about 75% of this made up of small scale enterprise operators. Lack of full study of government agencies in the development of these enterprises especially, the financial institution made it impossible to   know the size, structure and function of these small scale business to the development of the economy.</p> <p>Government agencies are charged with the responsibilities among others to carryout duties and deliver utilities as may be regulated from time to time on behalf of the government for the purpose of uplifting the standard of living. Government agencies such as bank of industry (BOI) is charged with the responsibility like provision of medium and long term finances by way of equity funding, loan and lease financing, guarantees, investment in corporate bonds business development services, co-financing, working capital finance and    promotion of small scale enterprises and industries project, co-sponsoring financial institutions and small scale enterprises.</p> <p> This bank of industry was formerly originated from Nigerian industrial development bank limited was established in 1964 following the reconstruction of the investment company of Nigeria limited (ICON) NIDB was set up primarily to accelerate Nigerian industrialization.</p> <p> The bank was to conceive shortly after Nigerian attains independence in 1960. The idea was to set up development financial institution to serve as a dedicated window for channeling fund from within and outside the country to the young nation states industrial sector. Economic reconstruction fund (NERFUND) in the last regime of Obasanjo administration is renamed as BOI.</p> <p><strong>1.2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Most government agencies have undergone number of re-organization especially bank of industry (BOI) which affect their forces and activities that leads to effective performance and lack of proper control on their activities.</p> <p> The most obvious problems of Bank of Industry (BOI) is how to produce or provide efficient financial resources technical assistance, security on loan given out to customer (SSE) evaluating of project that are financed which may take more time than stated at the beginning.</p> <p>Also the project time table, which depends on nature and complexity of the project, it may take one to two years sometimes longer from when project was identified to when it was commissioned.</p> <p>On the part of small scale enterprises (SSE) how effective are they utilizing the services rendered to them by the bank of industry (BOI). Also are they able to cope with the policies adopted by this agencies (BOI) in obtaining loan and other services rendered such as interest rate on capital collateral facilities and the role of government.</p> <p><strong>1.3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1. The aims and objectives of the study is to analyse various role played by (BOI) in developing of small scale enterprises as well as the activities of government policies such s provision of infrastructural facilities, provision for local finance, facilitating and funding industries and funding institutions like the (CIRD), (FIRO) and (SSICS) to what does the policies of government are achieved towards developing Small scale enterprise.</p> <p>2. It is also to analyze the various ways by which bank of industries (BOI) has contributed effectively to the development of he economy through the role played in financing and provisions of other necessary features for development of Small scale enterprise.</p> <p><strong>1.4. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study is to serve a reference material to other students who may write on, make research on similar topic and serve as recommendation to bank of industry (BOI) in discharging its functions to the customers as well as the mode of rendering services to the customers small scale enterprise</p> <p><strong>1.5.

On one hand are group which function through direct governmental control known as Formal Financial Institutions such as Commercial Banks, Insurance Companies and Mortgage Banks. And on the other hand are those financial institutions which are not directly controlled by government, called Informal Financial Institutions such as money lenders, cooperative societies, thrift and loan societies, local bankers, cooperatives etc. It should however be noted that statutory dominance of formal financial sector since independence is hinged on the thinking that the sector would stimulate the growth of the economy and ensure the upliftment of the socio-economic lives of the people.</p> <p>It has been contended that the Formal financial sector will promote savings and investment, improve opportunities for credit, and engender reduce poverty. But it has been observed that Formal financial institutions have seriously come short of the expectations as they have made things harder for Nigerians through stringent conditionalities for credit, poor customer services and high interest rates (Frank, 1998). Even the micro finance institutions that was created for the purpose of developing the small and medium scale enterprises has not been able to realize any of the objectives for which it was created, thereby leaving the small and medium scale enterprises to be sourcing for their respective means.</p> <p>The introduction of the informal financial institutions by individuals and groups is to cushion the effects of the Formal financial institutions on the socio-economic wellbeing of the people. This practically done by borrowing loans to small and medium scale enterprises and individual for the purpose of expanding their respective businesses. It has been acknowledged all over the world that small and medium scale enterprises are the powerful tool any country can use to stimulate fast and sustainable socio-economic growth.</p> <p>The informal financial institutions are creation of the indigenous people with aim of making credit/loan facilities more accessible to the people and SMEs so as help solve their socio-economic and financial problems (Gulong, 2012). Although not directly under the control government and its authorities, Informal Financial Institutions have pierced through government institutions and organizations, and variety of formal and informal organizations. In almost all organizations, there seems to be existence of Informal Financial institutions established for specific or general purposes which allow people to contribute funds periodically which are given to members as loans or credit. A typical example is the cooperative societies formed by various staffs of government establishments and institutions.</p> <p>Small scale enterprises prefer to operate with these institutions as their conditions for credit are soft, coupled with faster administration of loans with low interest rate compared to Formal Financial Institutions. Takum Local government area of Taraba State is semi-urban area which is composed of varying population in terms of occupations as it is composed of government workers, farmers, traders and business men/women, private sector workers and transporters. However, the area does have formal banking system, but most people depend on informal financial institutions existing in the area for their financial transactions such as savings and loans. This study is therefore aimed at determining the contribution of informal financial institutions on the growth of small scale enterprises in Takum Local government area of Taraba State.</p> <p>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The contribution of informal financial institutions has been explained by variously by researchers and thinkers. According to Aryeetey (1995) Informal Financial Institutions could be conceptualized as those institutions that embrace all financial transactions that takes place beyond the functional scope of various countries and other financial sector regulation. These institutions are not controlled directly through major monetary and financial policy instruments but are created by individuals and groups with no legal status. Studies on the impact of informal financial institutions on business development have been conducted by researchers and they found positive effects of informal financial institutions such as micro-credit programmes on the growth of business and the welfare of the people.

This study seeks to investigate empirically the factors influencing the entrepreneurial intentions of fresh graduates. The area of this study covers attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and self-efficacy and how these influence the intentions of graduates to become entrepreneurs. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaire and related literatures were reviewed. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and hypotheses was tested using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique. The finding suggests that the four factors examined has significant relationship with entrepreneurial intentions. It was therefore recommended that entrepreneurial values be promoted among graduates and graduates should be exposed to the skills required by entrepreneurs.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The role of intentions has been acknowledged to be relevant in the managerial literature (Sutton, 1998). Studies have shown that intentions have the ability to predict both individual behavior (Ajzen, 1991) and organizational outcomes such as survival, development and growth (Mitchel, 1981). Hence, the capability to understand and predict intentions becomes a point of interest for both managers and entrepreneurs (Tubbs and Ekeberg, 1991).</p> <p>Intentions have been proved to be the best predictors of individual behaviours particularly when the behavior is rare, hard to observe or involves unpredictable time lags. The establishment of new ventures and the creation of new values in existing ones, which have been identified by Bird (1988) as the two outcomes of entrepreneurial intentions are good examples of such behaviours. It has been argued that most behaviours of social relevance such as health-related behaviours or the establishment of new organizations are under volitional control.</p> <p>Intention refers to a state of mind directing a person’s attention (and therefore experience and action) towards a specific object or path in order to achieve something. Entrepreneurial intention refers to a cognitive representation of actions to be implemented by individuals to either establish new independent venture or create new value within existing companies.</p> <p>It is certainly true that entrepreneurial ideas begin with inspiration; though intentions are needed in order for them to become manifest. Krueger (2000), argued that individual do not start a business as a reflex, but they do it intentionally. Hence, especially at the birth of an organization, the impact of entrepreneur’s intention is predominant; as a consequence, the founder’s intention determines the form and direction of a nascent organization at its inception.</p> <p><strong>1.1         </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The level of unemployment of graduates in Nigeria has become a national issue as the numbers of graduates from public and private higher educational institutions that join the job market increases each year. Academic qualifications can no longer guarantee immediate employment upon graduation, instead graduates are required to show a positive attitude towards the changing job market by investigating entrepreneurship as a possible basis for a career. In fact entrepreneurship would help these new graduates develop their own career and also ease the current unemployment issue by expanding the job market. Entrepreneurship is therefore the solution to the problem of unemployment.</p> <p>The ability of new graduates to engage in entrepreneurial behaviour depends on a number of factors, thus there is need to conduct a study focusing on the entrepreneurial intentions and the factors affecting new graduates decision to engage in entrepreneurial behaviour.</p> <p>This will therefore necessitate the following questions:</p> <p>1               What is the effect of attitude on entrepreneurial intention?</p> <p>2               What is the effect of subjective norms on entrepreneurial intention?</p> <p>3               What is the effect of perceived behavioural control on entrepreneurial intention?</p> <p>4               What is the effect of self-efficacy on entrepreneurial intention?</p> <p><strong>1.2         </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The following hypothesis will be tested in the study:</p> <p>Ho1.   There is no significant relationship between Perceived behavioural control and entrepreneurial intentions.</p> <p>Ho2.   There is no significant relationship between self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intentions.</p> <p>Ho3.   There is no significant relationship between Attitude and entrepreneurial intentions.</p> <p>Ho4.   There is no significant relationship between Subjective norm and entrepreneurial intention.</p> <p><strong>1.3         </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major aim of this study is to determine and investigate the factors influence on the entrepreneurial intentions of fresh graduates. Other accessory objectives includes</p> <p>2               To determine the effect of attitude on entrepreneurial intentions</p> <p>3               To determine the effect of subjective norm on entrepreneurial intentions</p> <p>4               To determine the effect of perceived behavioural control on entrepreneurial intentions</p> <p>5               To determine the effect of self-efficacy on entrepreneurial intentions.</p> <p><strong>1.4         </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Several research studies exist in the field of entrepreneurship and enrepreneurship intentions of university students (Turker and Selcuk, 2008) and fresh graduates in Nigeria (Shittu and Dosunmu, 2014). There is no existing study on the factorial analysis of entrepreneurial intention among fresh graduates in Nigeria. The only study close to this study is that of shiitu and Dosunmu, (2014) but it only looked at family background as a factor affecting entrepreneurial intention. Hence this study is significant to the extent that is seeks to fill this knowledge gap by examining other factors such as attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and self-efficacy and their impact on entrepreneurial intention of fresh graduates in Nigeria.</p> <p>The study will also form the basis for further studies and contribute to existing body of literatures in the field of entrepreneurship. It will also serve as a pointer to the solution of the problem of unemployment of fresh graduates in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5         </strong><strong>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Several challenges were encountered in this study which are considered as limitations. Firstly, this research study is entirely based on self-reported measures. A social desirability bias may appear in our study because subjects sometimes respond to surveys in a manner that make themselves meet society’s desires. An anonymity guarantee was reassured to the respondents. Some evidence shows that a self-report of dishonest behaviour can be quite accurate and the bias should have no impact on the testing of the model (Beck and Ajzen, 1991; Becker et al., 2006). Second, the dependent variable used in this study is the intention to engage in entrepreneurial behaviour rather than the actual behaviour itself. Even though many researchers have indicated that behavioural intention is an adequate proxy of actual behaviour (Allen, Fuller and luckett, 1998), the self-report method is still subjective to the bias of CMV.</p> <p>Lastly, despite its extensive application, theory of planned behaviour has been criticized that it does not sufficiently elicit affective aspects for making decision. By introducing affective variables such as fear, mood and enjoyment, the variance explained in intention can be greatly increased. Therefore future research might consider including affective variables into the theory of planned behaviour.</p> <p><strong>1.6         </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study focus specifically on the factors affecting entrepreneurial intentions of fresh graduate in Nigeria. It examines four factors such as attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and self-efficacy. The study is restricted to only fresh graduates in Delta State, issele-uku NYSC camp. It is hoped that the views of these fresh graduates will reflect the views of other fresh graduates in the country.</p>\n\nDETERMINANTS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS AMONG FRESH GRADUATES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINANTS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS AMONG FRESH GRADUATES IN NIGERIA", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research work, the Factors Influencing Entrepreneurial Performance of Small Scale Business. The general objectives of this study are to assess the factor that influence entrepreneurial performance in small and medium scale enterprise (SMEs) and also to assess how each factor identified affects the success of the of the entrepreneur in small scale business. The primary data for this research work was obtained through questionnaire response, personal interview and personal observation. This was supplemented with secondary data. Chi-square technique was used as a tool to test the hypothesis. It was observed that there is a significant relationship between personality trail and entrepreneurial performance and other variables such as demographic feature, research and development (R&amp;D), technology etc can also influence the performance of entrepreneur in small scale sectors. In the light of the above, it was recommended that entrepreneurial development should become part and parcel of tertiary institutions curriculum and also entrepreneur should be encourage to attend training programmed in business management. This research works concluded that entrepreneurship is regarded as an integral part in the business culture of Nigeria economy and particularly as an engine for job creation and economic growth.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.0    <strong>Background of Study</strong></p> <p>Entrepreneurship is increasing recognized as an important driver of economic growth, productivity, innovation and employment, and it is widely accepted as key aspect of economic dynamism. This has amplified the studies on small and medium enterprises (SME) growth and more importantly the formal and informal attributes associated with the entrepreneurs who have led their companies successfully to growth stage.</p> <p>Certainly, for an entrepreneur to be successful in terms of establishing any form of small scale business, certain factors must be put into consideration that can boost the inspiration of the entrepreneur for effective and efficient management of his or her business in achieving the set objectives.</p> <p>An entrepreneurs can be seen as people who have the ability to see and to evaluate business opportunities to gather the necessary resources to take advantages of them and to initiate appropriate action to ensure success Meredith et al (1982).</p> <p>According to Ozigbo (2000), argued that there is no legal or single clear cut of definition of what constitutes small scale enterprise in Nigeria. And the classification of businesses into small, medium or large is a subjective and quantitative judgment Ekpenyoung and Nyound, (1992) under the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) monetary and credit policy guideline for 1996, as reported by Ozigbo (2000), small scale enterprises is an enterprise with fixed assets excluding land, but including working capital not exceeding ten Million Naira (l0m).</p> <p>In view of the above, it is necessary to study or review several factors that influence the performance of entrepreneurship in small scale business.</p> <p>Obviously, there are various factors that can influence entrepreneurial performance either positively or negatively such as change in present life style, education, personal values, age, work history, role Models and Support systems, moral support network and professional support network, these factors can rather make or mar the performance of entrepreneurship.</p> <p>Most importantly, it is very necessary in this background of study to recognized the fact that the management of entrepreneurship is always at the hand of one or two persons who put their idea, skills, techniques, creativities and resources together in order to implement or innovate some thing new and they also act or serve as the manager’s proprietors and pioneers who pilots the affair of that business because entrepreneur are seen to be optimistic moderate risk taker and believing in his or her ability to control his or her own business rather than just making money.</p> <p>Carland, Hoy et at (1984) define an entrepreneurship as an individual who established and managed a business for the principle purpose of profit and growth.</p> <p>In this context entrepreneurs could make much better choice, ironically by adopting some strategies and principles for achieving a better entrepreneurial performance.</p> <p>The following are some of the strategies to employs,</p> <p>         Do your research,</p> <p>         Have a good mentor,</p> <p>         Learn to exercise patience,</p> <p>         Stay within your budget,</p> <p>         Always be moving,</p> <p>         Make sure you enjoy what you do,</p> <p>         Self confidence and perseverance,</p> <p>         Feasibility studies,</p> <p>         Management training and development,</p> <p>This picture that emerge might lead one to conclude that, despite the attempts by government to support small scale business in Nigeria, small firms have not be able to fully realize their potential because of the hostile environment borne by economic decline.</p> <p>Conclusively, it appeared that entrepreneurs are face with economic difficulties, which lead to the study of factors influencing entrepreneurial performance in order to profile a reasonable solution for sufficient and effective performance.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Studies have shown that self-awareness or personal knowledge can improve the performance of entrepreneur, but lack of studies on the part of entrepreneur prompt the question about its importance. The major concern is that, an entrepreneur should have in-depth knowledge about the existing and inevitable environmental factors. The most probable factors contributing to this problem is believed to be the possibility of certain environmental factors.</p> <p>The problem and its dimension may be stated as follow:</p> <p>a)      The environmental factors which consist of dynamism, munificence, complexity and industry characteristics.</p> <p>b)      Weak environmental orientation in terms of autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, competitive and aggressiveness.</p> <p>c)      The demographic characteristics which consist of growth, age, education and marital status.</p> <p>d)      Lack of entrepreneurial skills, in research and development (R &amp; D), insufficient funds (capital) and poor expertise.</p> <p>1.3 <strong>  Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to ascertain a superior managerial performance with special emphasis on entrepreneurial competences required for a successful performance.</p> <p>The general objective is as follow:</p> <p>a)      To assess the factors that affects the success of the entrepreneur in small scale business.</p> <p>b)      To assess how each factors identified can affect the success of entrepreneur in small scale business.</p> <p>c)      To examine how research and development (R &amp; D) can improve an entrepreneurial performance in small scale business.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The above research problem and purpose leads to the formation of question at which the answer to those questions would proficient solution to the problem. The questions are stated below;</p> <p>1.      What are the relationship between environmental factors and entrepreneurial performance in small scale business?</p> <p>2.      What are the relationship between research and development (R&amp;D) and entrepreneurial success?</p> <p>3.      To what extent does technology affect entrepreneurial performance in small sale business?</p> <p>1.5    <strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>H01:  There is no significant relationship between personality trait and entrepreneurial performance.</p> <p>H02:  There is no significant relationship between research and development and entrepreneurial success.</p> <p>H03: There is no significant relationship between technology and entrepreneurial performance in small scale business.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research work focus on a niche-segment which indicates entrepreneurial performance in few selected small scale business in Asaba, Delta State capital. It also limits itself on how an entrepreneur’s can improve their skills for effective and successful performance in small scale business.</p> <p>This research work covered a duration of 10 (ten) years from (2002-2012), with the use of primary data like questionnaire and direct interview being carried out among residents in Asaba, Delta State capital.</p> <p>1.7    <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research study indicates the value, knowledge and contribution of difference scholars in regards to factors influencing entrepreneurial performance in small scale business.</p> <p>The need to study this research topic becomes imperative because it highlight the following;</p> <p>a)      Vital information that can enhance an entrepreneurial success in small scale business.</p> <p>b)      The need for an entrepreneur to adopt managerial skills for effective performance.</p> <p>c)      The efficacy of technology toward entrepreneurial success.</p> <p>d)      Also to identify the series of factors that influence entrepreneurial performance.</p> <p>Thus, the success of business is due to many factors, but among the greatest determinants of a business success is the entrepreneur.</p>\n\nFACTORS INFLUENCING ENTREPRENEURIAL PERFORMANCE IN SMALL SCALE BUSINESS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS INFLUENCING ENTREPRENEURIAL PERFORMANCE IN SMALL SCALE BUSINESS", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A<strong>BSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this study is to determine the impact of entrepreneurial education, personal attitude, social norm and perceived behavioural control on entrepreneurial intentions. Entrepreneurial intention is concerned with the inclination of a person to start an entrepreneurial activity in the future. It is a key determinant of the action of new venture creation determined by exogenous variables such as: Social Norm, Perceive Behavioural Control, and entrepreneurial education among others. Survey design was adopted, and the statistical tool employed comprises of frequency, as well as regression analysis. The study made use of a sample of 210 undergraduate students of Delta State University. The findings show that Personal Attitude, Social Norm, Perceive Behavioural Control and entrepreneurial education have proved to be a primary predictor of future entrepreneurial behaviour, that perceive behavioural control influences positively on entrepreneurial intentions and that personal attitude is positively related to entrepreneurial intentions. It was concluded that entrepreneurship education programs significantly raised student’s intentions toward entrepreneurship by inspiring them to choose entrepreneurial career. The study further suggest that further research could test the actual behaviour of students after intention to ascertain levels of correspondences between intentions and impact using longitudinal survey research design.</p> <p><strong>1.2     RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Despite the importance of entrepreneurship to economic development, the role of students in promoting entrepreneurship remains largely unstudied. Thus a better understanding of the factors that affect students’ and their entrepreneurial intentions could have theoretical and practical implications to policy makers (both the government and university). Lack of empirical evidence on entrepreneurial tendencies and intentions in Nigeria largely informed us in undertaking this unique study. The rising unemployment level is one of the most challenging problems faced by our leaders today, hence the youths are littered everywhere not having jobs to do.</p> <p><strong>1.3     RESEARCH OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this study is to determine the impact of entrepreneurial education, personal attitude, social norm and perceived behavioural control on entrepreneurial intentions (EI).</p> <p>The specific objectives are to:</p> <p>1       Determine the impact of personal attitude and EIs among undergraduate students</p> <p>2       Ascertain the relationship between Social Norm and EI among undergraduate students</p> <p>3       Access the relationship between Perceive Behavioural Control and EI among undergraduate students</p> <p>4Determine the impact of entrepreneurial education on entrepreneurial intentions among undergraduate students</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The study seeks to answer the following research questions:</p> <p>1       What is the impact of personal attitude and EIs, among undergraduate students?</p> <p>2       What is the relationship between Social Norm and EI among undergraduate students?</p> <p>3       What is the relationship between Perceive Behavioural Control and EI among undergraduate students?</p> <p>4       What is the relationship between entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intentions among undergraduate students?</p> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>In order to answer the above mentioned research questions, the following hypotheses were formulated:</p> <p>HO1   There is no significant impact of personal attitude and EIs among undergraduate students.</p> <p>HO2   There is no significant relationship between Social Norm and EI among undergraduate students.</p> <p>HO3   There is no significant relationship between Perceive Behavioural Control and EI among undergraduate.</p> <p>HO4There is no significant relationship between entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intentions among undergraduate students.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL EDUCATION ON ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS AMONG UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL EDUCATION ON ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS AMONG UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS", "id": 63}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0      INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Oshimili North LGA with headquarters at Akwukwu-Igbo was created out of the defunct Oshimili LGA in December, 1996. It has a population of about 80,000 people who are predominantly operating Small and Medium Scale businesses.</p> <p>There is controversy that small and medium scale business in any country where they operate play important role in the economic growth and development of that country or nation and it improves the quality of life of individuals (Ohanemu, 2006).</p> <p>       Business organizations anywhere in the world operate within environments which according to Adidu &amp; Olanye (2006) is an aggregate of all conditions, events, circumstances and influences that surround and effect the business organization.</p> <p>       In management, the term “Environment” does not necessarily mean physical surroundings but, it is used as a total forces, factors and influences that surround and affect business organizations as a separate entity as well as other business organizations. This means that business organizations must interact with those forces that influence its decisions, directions, actions, size, health, profitability and performance of the organization as a whole.</p> <p>       Ukaegbu (2004) stated that the contemporary environment is becoming dynamic and competitive and since business organizations do not operate in vacuum, they affect and are affected by environment conditions. Therefore, business organizations irrespective of their objectives must take into consideration, these environmental opportunities and constraints. Businesses affect the environment by providing the required goods and services thereby contributing to the development of the business by presenting opportunities and threats. One thing to be emphasized at this point is that, the extent to which managers could identify, evaluate and react to the environmental forces will have considerable impact on organizational performances.</p> <p>       Kuye, (2004), emphasized that the need to study business environments is very important considering the fact that business organizations do not operate in vacuum and an effective management in complex and dynamic society requires the assessment of strengths and weaknesses of the organization and the opportunities and threats provided by the challenges of the external environment, hence for survival and growth, organizations must cope and adopt to these challenges posed by the ever changing environment (internal &amp; external) in which managers operate means that mangers must not only be aware of what constitutes the elements of their business environment but also should be able to respond to the forces of the environment which inevitably impinges on the operations of the business organization.</p> <p>Ukaegbu (2006) further stated that the relationship between a business organization and its host environment can be examined from three strategic ways;</p> <p>       Firstly, the organization can be viewed as importing various kinds of inputs (resources), such as human resources, capital, managerial and technical inputs. These inputs are then transformed to provoke output which takes the form of goods and services. A second approach is the study of the relationship between the organization and the society. It focuses on the demands and legitimate rights of different claimants such as employees, consumers, suppliers, stakeholders, government and the community. A third approach is to view the organization as operating in an external environment of opportunities and constraints. Thus no single approach is sufficient for all times and in all circumstances. They are complementary. The elements external to the organization affects its performance as well as those elements within the organizations.</p> <p>1.2   <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The effects of environment on organizational performance vary from one situation to another. The environment suitable for the growth of a particular business may be hostile to the survival of another business. The problems that necessitated this research are as follows:</p> <ul><li>Assess impact of environmental factors that has the performance of small scale enterprises in Oshimili North Local Government Area</li> <li>The ability to identify, evaluate and react to the challenges are critical to organizational performance.</li> </ul> <p>Therefore, this study seeks to investigate the impact of business environment on organizational performance of small scale business in Oshimili North Local Government Area.</p> <p>1.3   <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study is to assess the extent to which environmental factor affects the performance of small business enterprises, evaluate it, determine its success and failure and discuss its likely effects on organizational survival and growth.

Consequently this study therefore recommends that: government should re-introduce the small business credit scheme so that beneficiaries can use them to run the micro, small and medium enterprises; government, chamber of commerce and other non-governmental organization should regularly organize seminars for potential and actual small and medium enterprise operators where they should be educated on how to plan, organize, direct and control their businesses there should also be a re-introduction of soft loans for small and medium business by the government and financial institution to enhance the performance of SMEsin community development.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background Of The Study</strong></p> <p>SMEs have been discovered to be a key driver for a country’s economic growth (Schmiemann, 2009) hence, SMEs cannot be overlooked in the economic development of any country. Okongwu (2001) argues that SMEs are recognized as the main source of economic growth and a major factor in promoting private sector development and partnership, in developed and developing countries. SMEs help to create employment and are often seen as very important for the growth and innovation of dynamic economies (Mutula and Brakel, 2006). Therefore, economic growth and development in Africa can be achieved through the emergence of strong SMEs, which will later grow to become major players in the developing economy. SMEs help to diversify economic activities that have significant contributions to imports and exports, they are flexible and can adapt quickly to changing market demands (Ongori, 2009). Thus, SMEs contribute more and more to the national and international economies of the world.</p> <p>According to Wattanapruttipaisan (2003), the significance of SMEs for growth, productivity and competitiveness of the economies in both developed and developing countries is acknowledged universally, since SMEs bring about substantial local capital formation, contribute to improved living standards and achieve high levels of productivity. SMEs are identified as a major means of achieving equitable and sustainable industrial diversification.</p> <p>The contributions of SMEs to Nigeria’s economy are not contestable as about 10% of the total manufacturing output and 70% of the industrial employment are by SMEs (Aina, 2007). Through the utilization of local resources, SMEs promote industrial and economic development and are responsible for the production of intermediate goods and the transformation of rural technology (Aina, 2007). Nigerian SMEs not only provide employment and income for majority of its citizens but are also recognized as the breeding ground for domestic entrepreneurial capabilities, technical skills, technological innovativeness and managerial competencies for private sector development (SMEDAN, 2005, Aina, 2007).</p> <p>The assistance of SMEs to any economy are obvious, as SMEs are known to contribute to the development of several economies in terms of output of goods and services and creation of jobs at relatively low capital cost (Apulu and Latham, 2010). SMEs also improve forward and backward linkages between economically, socially and geographically diverse sectors of many economies (SMEDAN, 2005). Thus, the development of SMEs is an essential element in the growth strategy of many economies including Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of The Problem</strong></p> <p>      The key problem facing most small scale enterprises is lack of finance whether for the establishment of new industries or to carry out expansion plans. The inability to attract financial credit or resources has hindered or stifled the growth of small scale enterprise. The reasons for the lack of fund include the followings:</p> <ul><li>High rate of inflation that led to the vast depreciation of Naira exchange rate, thus making it difficult for most Small Scale  enterprise to obtain required inputs for expansion.</li> <li>Low level of savings in the economy, which leads to low capital formation.</li> <li>High rate of interest charged on loans, which scares off potential Small Scale enterprise.</li> <li>The unwillingness of retail banks to grant credit to Small Scale enterprise  because of the low creditworthiness of these enterprises has also hampered their growth over the years.</li> <li>     Bothered by the persistent decline in the performance of the industrial sector and with the realization of the fact that the small and medium scale enterprises  hold the key to the revival of the manufacturing sector and the economy, the Central Bank of Nigeria successfully persuaded the Bankers’ Committee in 2000 to agree that each bank should set aside 10 percent of its annual pre-tax profit for equity investment in small and medium scale enterprises. To ensure the effectiveness of the programme, banks were expected to identify, guide and nurture enterprises to be financed by the scheme. The activities targeted under the scheme included agro-allied, information technology, telecommunications, manufacturing, educational establishments, services, tourism and leisure, solid minerals and construction. The scheme was formally launched in August 2001. As at end-December 2009, the cumulative sum set aside by banks was N42.2 billion. The sum of N28.2 billion or 67.1 per cent of the sum set aside had been invested (CBN, 2009). But the fact still remains that with these provisions made are in most cases not accessible to the Small Scale Industries.</li> <li>    The main thrust of this study is to evaluate the performance of small and medium scale enterprises in community development with specific attention from Anambra South Senatorial zone, Anambra State.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.3 Objective of The Study</strong></p> <p>The specific objectives of this study is</p> <p>1 To determine the sources of financing SMEs from the respondents;</p> <p>2 To ascertain the role of SMEs in community development; and</p> <p>3 To identify factors militating against SMEs in community development.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions                                                                         </strong></p> <p>This study was guided by the following research questions:</p> <p>1 To what extent do small  scale enterprise contribute to towards economic development of a community ?</p> <p>2 What are the problems encountered by the small scale enterprise in sourcing for funds?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>The following null hypothesis was given for this study</p> <p>i Ho: Small Scale enterprise do not contributes immensely towards economic development of a community.</p> <p> Hi: Small Scale enterprise contributes immensely towards economic development of a community.</p> <p>ii Ho: Small scale enterprises do not encountered problems in source for funds.</p> <p>Hi : Small scale enterprises  encountered problems in source for funds.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Organization Of The Study</strong></p> <p>This paper is divided into five sections.

The study used primary and secondary source of data, data for this research work were collected using questionnaires and personal interviews on micro enterprises, data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution and simple percentages. Findings and recommendations were made most of the micro entrepreneurs have 2-5 workers working for them ad are basically and mostly into service business. There years of business experience are 1-3 years and most of them started their businesses through you-win initiatives, entrepreneurial initiatives help to reduce un-employment. Government initiatives such as NDEP,BOI YES and YOU-WIN programmes should be sustain to help in sustaining entrepreneurial development, consistent entrepreneurial training and support should regularly be organize for micro-entrepreneurs in order to fast-track and help them grow from strength to strength.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1.       <strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>In recent times entrepreneurs have been referred to as necessary pre-requisite to mobilize capital exploit natural resources and create markets to carry on trade (Harbison &amp; myers 2004). Entrepreneurs are agents who perform a vital role in the economic growth of a country and are linked to the overall industrial development of a linked tothe overall industrial development of a nation, some of this characteristics are risk-takers, decision-maker, perseverance, organizers and planner, innovative function, and Gap filling ability.</p> <p>However, successive government in Nigeria has introduced various entrepreneurial developments. These programmes include Family Economic Advancement programmes (FEAP) Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAP) Green Revolution Programme (GRP) National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) at national level, State Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (SEEDS) at state level and Local Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy  (LEEDS) at local government level, Poverty Alleviation Programme (PAP), and most recently,  the National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP). These programmes failed to achieve their objectives because of poor design; it was in realization of the scenario that the Federal Government of Nigeria announced the inclusion of entrepreneurial education in higher institutions of learning as a way of promoting entrepreneurial spirit among Nigeria youths to take up self employment. This has led to the launching of programmes such as youths enterprise with innovation plan aimed at job creation and micro enterprises by encouraging band supporting aspiring entrepreneur youth in Nigeria to develop and execute business ideas (Flippo E 2008), micro enterprises is a relative concept because t varies among countries and within a particular country per time. For instance, a small or medium size enterprise in an advanced country like United State of America or Britain can be considered a large scale industry in Nigeria (Ogundele 2002). National Economic Reconstruction Fund (NERF) sees micro/cottage enterprise as the smallest carder in the level of business range with a maximum capital of N1,000,000.00 (one million naira) and maximum labour of ten. Small and Medium Enterprise Development Association of Nigeria (SMEDAN) helps to promote Entrepreneurship culture through initiative that build business confidence, positive attitude, pride in success, support and encouragement of new ideas, social responsibility, providing inter firm linkage and promotion of research and development. Finally, since entrepreneurship Nigeria is assumed to play a role of solving the problem of employment generation, facilitators of Economic recovery, National Development and poverty reduction stakeholders must come to agreement on entrepreneurial development initiatives because it is a harbinger of economic reconstruction and transformation (ihua, 2009).</p> <p>1.2.       <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The increasing incidence of poverty in Anambra State was in spite of the various resources and efforts exerted on poverty related and micro enterprises programmes and schemes, in the country. This suggests that the programmes and schemes were ineffective and ineffectual, despite the huge resource invested in them. It is either the government is playing politics to their initiatives y laying lip services to the programmes, thereby making its existence only in theory, or not supporting the plan with enough resources. However, some government officials misappropriate the limited resources, enriching themselves and entrepreneurship cannot be developing in isolation with the right policies and opportunities that serves as engine room for its growth.</p> <p>It is a known fact that poverty constitutes an obstacle to rapid economic development in the state. Poverty is also directly responsible for the crimes in the city as well as rural areas and manifest itself in prostitution, thuggery, exposure to risk, corruption, robbery and fund (popularly called 419), street life, drugs and so n. This is as a result of unfulfilled aspirations result from unemployment, lack of adequate access to resources to start-up micro businesses (Osemeke, 2012).</p> <p>1.3.       <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The broad objective of the study is to examine Entrepreneurship development initiatives and micro-enterprises sustenance in Awka Metropolis, Anambra State.</p> <p>The specific objectives of the study are:</p> <ol><li>Determine the entrepreneurial initiatives that can sustain micro-enterprises.</li> <li>Investigate the extent entrepreneurial initiatives can reduce unemployment.</li> <li>Identify the challenges of entrepreneurial development initiatives on micro enterprises sustenance.</li> </ol> <p>1.4.       <strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <ol><li>To know whether entrepreneurial initiatives can help to reduce unemployment.</li> <li>To know to a very large extent how entrepreneurial initiatives can sustain micro enterprise.</li> </ol> <p>1.5.       <strong>HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>H0</strong>: Entrepreneurial initiatives do not influence the development of micro enterprise in Awka Metropolis.</p> <p><strong>H1</strong>: Entrepreneurial and initiatives influences the development of micro-enterprise in Awka Metropolis.</p> <p>1.6.       <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study will cover entrepreneurial development initiatives and micro-enterprise sustenance in Awka Metropolis for the year 2016.</p> <p>1.7.       <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will be of great benefit to micro entrepreneurs in their business, it will provide them with basic information about entrepreneurial initiatives and how they affect their business.

The purpose of the study is to find out the financial problems and survival strategies of small and medium scale enterprises. Four research questions and four null hypotheses were raised. The sample size was 140. Questionnaire was used to collect the data. Frequency tables, percentages, and z-test were used to analyse the four hypotheses. The result revealed that small and medium scale industry face a lot of financial problems and these problems is mainly as a result difficulty in raising capital. These problems have hampered its survival. In view of these findings the researcher made some recommendations to these problems.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>        Since Nigeria attained independence in 1960, considerable efforts have been directed towards the nation’s industrial development. The initial efforts were government-led through the vehicle of large industry, but lately emphasis has shifted to Small Scale Industries (SSIs) following the success of SSIs in the economic growth of Asian countries (Ojo, 2003). Thus, the recent industrial development drive in Nigeria has focused on sustainable development through small business development. Prior to this time, particularly judging from the objective of the past National 4-Year Development Plans, 1962-68 and 1981-85, emphasis had been on government-led industrialization, hinged on import-substitution.</p> <p>      Since 1986, government had played down its role as the major driving force of the economy by a process of commercialization and privatization (Beyene, 1999). Emphasis, therefore, shifted from large-scale industries mainly to small scale industries, which have the potentials for developing domestic linkages for rapid and sustainable industrial development. Attention was focused on the organized private sector to spearhead subsequent industrialization programmes. Incentives given to encourage increased participation in these sectors were directed at solving and/or alleviating the problems encountered by industrialists in the country, thereby giving them greater leeway towards increasing their contribution to the national economy.</p> <p>Interest in the role of Small Scale enterprises in the development process continues to be in the forefront of policy debates in developing countries. The advantages claimed for Small Scale enterprises (SSEs) are various, including: the encouragement of entrepreneurship, the greater likelihood that SSEs will utilise labour intensive technologies and thus have an immediate impact on employment generation (Ayozie&amp;Latinwo, 2010); they can usually be established rapidly and put into operation to produce quick returns; SSIs development can encourage the process of both inter- and intra-regional decentralization (Ogujiuba et al., 2004); and, may become a countervailing force against the economic power of larger enterprises (Salami, 2003). More generally the development of SSIs is seen as accelerating the achievement of wider economic and socio-economic objectives, including poverty alleviation (Safiriyu and Njogo, 2012; Ayozie and Latinwo, 2010; Udechukwu, 2003).</p> <p>The role of finance has been viewed as a critical element for the development of Small Scale enterprise Previous studies have highlighted the limited access to financial resources available to smaller enterprises compared to larger organisations and the consequences for their growth and development (Hossain, 1998; Wattanapruttipaisan, 2003; Berger and Udell, 2004; Ogujiuba et al., 2004; etc). According to Valverde et al (2005) bank credit play a crucial role in providing external financing to Small Scale Industry (SSIs). But in Nigerian context, this crucial source of finance for Small Scale Industry is apparently non-functional (Kadiri, 2012). This is evident in the ratio of loans to Small Scale Industry to Commercial banks’ total credit, which shows that a meager 0.16% of commercial banks’ total credit was granted to Small Scale Enterprises in the last quarter of 2011 (CBN, 2011). More worrisome is the fact that this ratio has been falling over the years and continued unabated in the post-consolidation era (Iorpev, 2012).</p> <p>Typically, smaller enterprises face higher transactions costs than larger enterprises in obtaining credit (Olorunshola, 2003). Poor management and accounting practices have hampered the ability of smaller enterprises to raise finance. Information asymmetries associated with lending to small-scale borrowers have restricted the flow of finance to smaller enterprises. In spite of these claims however, some studies show a large number of small enterprises fail because of non-financial reasons.</p> <p>          The panacea for solving problems of economic growth in developing countries often reside in the development of small scale industries. The establishment of those industries has been the centrepiece of industrial development of many countries such as India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Indonesia, to mention a few. It is expected that the gains to be derived from the establishment of small-scale industries will be translated into the generation of employment at a low investment cost. These industries will also be able to harness raw materials locally and serve as raw inputs to the large-scale industries. Therefore, this study seeks to investigate the financial problems and survival strategies of small scale industries.  </p><p>   </p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of  The Problem</strong></p> <p>      The key problem facing most small scale enterprises is lack of finance whether for the establishment of new industries or to carry out expansion plans. The inability to attract financial credit or resources has hindered or stifled the growth of small scale enterprise.

A total of 50 respondents were considered out of the entire population of small scale and medium enterprises.  The findings indicated that the performance of small scale business is affected by stock levels, capital employed, daily expenses, daily sales and the average amount of taxes paid annually.Most business owners are aware of taxes paid, uncertain of the mode of assessment and little assistance is given as regards tax awareness. The findings revealed the problems faced by the small and medium business men as regards mode of assessment, collection and tax collectors, inefficiency by tax collectors, loss of equipment, loss of sales and loss of stock as a result of taxes.Recommendations on impact of taxes included; improvement on the method of collecting taxes, educating the business community about its different tax rates and  introducing a scheme that allows tax payers to pay the tax obligation.</em></p> <p><strong>                                                CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>                                             INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>   Taxation increases incentives for public participation in the political process and creates pressure for more accountability, better governance, and improved efficiency of government spending. Taxation also creates incentives for governments to upgrade their institutions for tax collection and administration and to provide more public services (Moore, 2007).</p> <p>   Taxes have existed virtually as long as there have been organized governments. The first tax law legislation was introduced in 1919 and ever since then taxes have evolved through a number of reforms. The government in an attempt to widen the tax base and collect more revenue has had to levy several taxes especially on business enterprises in Nigeria which constitute a large part of the formal sector. The taxes charged on business enterprises in Nigeria include; corporation tax, value added tax, presumption tax and exercise duty. In 1997 the Income Tax Act was made. This was to give guidance in assessment and computation of taxes (Campsy, 1997). The Nigerian government has made some recommendable efforts to promote development through taxation since the inception of the current taxation laws for purposes of promoting development. The main objective of taxation in Nigeria has always been to mobilise resources needed to meet the aspiration of government. This is because for any government to be effective, strong, competent and capable of spearheading development, resources have to be readily available in its treasury so as to be in position to provide goods and services to the people adequately. The Nigerian government has always had to ensure proper resource mobilization (Musa, 1992).</p> <p>   According to Manasseh (2000), a tax is generally referred to as a compulsory levy imposed by government upon various categories of assets and taxation is a compulsory and non refundable contribution imposed by government for public purposes. In Nigeria a considerable fraction of the businesses are sole traders operating small scale business, locally owned and managed by individuals or families and often with very few employees working at a single location (Nigeria development bank report, 1988). Taxation in Nigeria is based on system that existed in Britain as it was a British colony. This also applied to other colonies elsewhere and for East Africa, one tax system operated under British administration. This process began in 1900 with the hut tax regulation which imposed a standard charge for every hut/dwelling.                  </p> <p>During that period, taxation was aimed at raising revenue for the administrative structure imposed by the colonial government but also as a means of encouraging monetary/economic activities. It was the Local Authority Ordinance of 1991 that governed the collection of taxes. In September 1991, after a period of review the Rural Revenue Authority (URA) was established. All taxes including income tax came under the umbrella of the URA. From 1992, URA has been organizing and strengthening the administrative procedures and in 1993 this process assisted by a grant from the British government of approximately US$ 10million.</p> <p>At least 50 small scale business enterprises were selected in illorin, almost all of them employ 2-4 people. These small scale businesses are locally owned and managed by private individuals who sometimes employ their family members. These small and medium scale businesses bear a wide tax burden which has led to poor performance. Therefore, it was against this background that the researcher undertook the study to investigate more about the problem using Nigeria as a case study to evaluate the impact of taxes on small and medium scale business enterprises.</p> <p> <strong>1.2 Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Taxes are raised by the government to generate revenue used to provide services to the public such as; Health centers, telecommunication, roads, schools and electricity and this have helped to improve the performance of small and medium scale business enterprises. Despite the services provided, small and medium scale business enterprises performance in Nigeria is still poor. This could be due to the increasing tax burden brought about by tax rates which are revised annually. These rates seem to be taking an upward trend (Gordon and Dawson, 1987) which has led to winding up of some small scale business enterprises.

In order to achieve the objective of making useful suggestions that would improve the agricultural sector, a number of hypotheses were made and tested. Samples of one hundred and eighty responses were collected and analyzed using the chi-square (×²).It was discovered that bank credit loan scheme is making some impacts in lending loans to farmers. The result also showed that farmers prefer informal to the formal sources of finance mostly because of the demand of formal institutions that farmers most present collateral security. Finally, the study also indicated that the problems facing agricultural financing</em>.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1<strong>.1       Background to the study.</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is endowed with natural resources, large fertile arable land, wide range of crops, and abundant water resources amongst others. Despite its abundant natural resources it is faced with a poor food situation. The poor food situation is traceable to the decline in the agricultural sector. The problem of feeding is increasing by the day. However, several efforts are being made to improve the standard of living.</p> <p>Prior to the discovery of petroleum in Nigeria agriculture used to be the highest foreign exchange resource earner and its contribution to gross domestic product GDP has been estimated to about 62.63% in 1960, 48.08% in 1970, and 20.63% in 1980. Recently due to the growing awareness of the role of agriculture, the various governments have intensified efforts aimed at transforming from its present subsistence level to a market oriented production. One of those efforts was the ban made on importation of agricultural products like palm oil, maize and rice. This was done to encourage improvements on our production standard. Due to the fall in the level of production from decade to decade, the country could no longer feed the large population, provide raw material for domestic industries, engage in export of agricultural produce and employ the labor force of the country despite the abundance of human and material resources.</p> <p>the population is dependent directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihood. Though, the Nigerian agriculture is characterized by low farm income, low level capacity to satisfy the food In spite of growing urbanization, Nigeria is known to be predominantly rural in nature and majority of needs of the country, due to the outdated and primitive techniques of production, it is still the mainstay of the nation’s economy.</p> <p>Measures and program setup to upgrade the Agricultural sector involve the construction and reformation of the whole structure of the agricultural sector by the creation of appropriate institutions and public services. This would help strengthen the economic position of the dependent farmers. Examples of such measures are National Accelerated Food Production Project (NAFPP), Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), Nigeria Agricultural Cooperation and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB).</p> <p>1<strong>.2 Statement of Research Problem.</strong></p> <p>According to Anyanwu et al (1997) the agricultural sector has been recognized for a long time as an important sector to Nigerian economy and development is one of the crucial requirements for the overall economic growth. He noted further that the decline in agricultural activities might appear natural in any development process; it is obvious that in Nigeria, agricultural activities would remain the most important single sector for some time to come. He emphasized that in the past, development planners have introduced programs such as National Accelerated Food Production Project (NAFPP), Green Revolution Programs (GRP), in search for all appropriate technique in order to increase farm output and productivity and such program have at one time been implemented.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>In recognition of the aforementioned the attempt is made in this study to provide answers or</p> <p>solution to the research questions below</p> <p>1. What are the reasons for continuous fall or decline in the production level of the agricultural sectors of the Nigerian economy?2. What actions can be taken to upgrade the current production level of the agricultural sector?</p> <p>3. What effect does the decline in agricultural sector have on the human resources of the economy?</p> <p>4 What measures have been taken in the past to redress the perceived slow growth rate of the agricultural sector?</p> <p>5 How and to what extent does the performance and commitment exhibited by financial institution in general, Nigeria agricultural cooperation and rural development bank (NACRDB) in particular in terms of providing financial support influenced the activities of agricultural sector?</p> <p><strong>1.4 Objectives of A Study</strong>.</p> <p>The general objective of the study is to determine the role of financial institution in      agricultural development in Nigeria. The specific objectives include</p> <p>1. To examine and evaluate the agricultural credit it granted the farmers in recent years.</p> <p>2. To ascertain the effectiveness of credit granted by Nigeria agricultural cooperation and rural deve3lopment bank (NACRDB) in the achievements of the pre-planned objectives of the agricultural sector.</p> <p>3. To analyze the measures and programs set by the government in a bid to enhancing the agricultural sector.</p> <p>4. To determine the influence of these measures in accelerating the growth rate of the agricultural sector.</p> <p>5. To establish and verify ways by which the agricultural sector can be improved in the future.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Statement of the Research Hypothesis.</strong></p> <p>This study would be guided by the following hypothesis;</p> <p>i. Ho: the agricultural down drain cannot be curbed through effective bank credit.</p> <p>Hi : the agricultural down drain can be curbed through effective bank credit.</p> <p>ii. Ho: bank credit and financial facilities are not made available by development bank to farmer.</p> <p>Hi: bank credit and finance facilities are made available by development bank to farmers.</p> <p>iii. Ho: bank credit facilities have been ineffective due to their policies formulated and not their implementations and utilization.</p> <p>Hi: bank credit facilities have been ineffective due to their improper implementations and utilization and not due to the policies formulated</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope of A Study.</strong></p> <p>With the aim of examining how the financial institutions influence the activities of agricultural sector, through their credit policies and farm credit system, programs that have been established to review the agricultural sector would be analyzed. A lot of sources for farm credit have been and a number of them have failed to perform their pre-planned functions. An example of such scheme is the Nigeria local development board (NLDB).</p> <p>Our point of focus in examining institution program and scheme setup to upgrade the agricultural sector would be on Nigeria agricultural co-operative and rural development bank (NACRCD).</p> <p><strong>1.7 Significance of A Study</strong>.</p> <p>The agricultural sector of the Nigeria economy like any other sector of the economy cannot function without fund. Unlike the other sectors of the economy, agricultural sector can guarantee repayment of loan borrowed or collected only after a long period of time. This is because of the slow nature of the production process. However, this has acted as a hindering factor to giving out loan to the agricultural sector by financial institutions. If this continues in its current path, the continuous lack of fund would lead to the eventual collapse of agricultural activities.</p> <p>The problem of lack of fund and credit facilities in the agricultural sector has been chosen because the persistent shortage of fund would lead to a fall in the production level of the agricultural sector, whose importance cannot be over-stated.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there would be some beneficiaries in this study which will include the government, financial institutions, large and small scale farmers as well as the general public.</p> <p> 1<strong>.8 Limitation of the Study.</strong></p> <p>Some factors may limit the level of accuracy and reliability of this study. Such factors include.</p> <p>i. Difficulty in obtaining data.</p> <p>ii. Low response rate from involved parties.</p> <p>In the absence of the above mentioned limitations, all other errors and omissions are entirely those of the researcher.</p> <p><strong>1.9 Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>i. Agriculture: This can be defined as the growing of crops and rearing of animals for human consumption. Agriculture involves live stock, forestry, wide life and fisheries as well as the production of crops like cocoa, palm product, groundnut, cotton and rubber. Historically, the Nigerian agriculture can be categorized into three. They are: Subsistence type, diversified type, plantation type.</p> <p>The subsistence type is the production done mainly for human consumption with little or no surface.</p> <p>The diversified type is the production type that is done beyond individual consumption or domestic level.</p> <p>The plantation type although have not made any impact in the Nigeria agriculture, it accounts for a small amount of total Nigeria agricultural output. It involves the use of improved modern techniques and it is run in the state by their development cooperation.</p> <p>ii. Agricultural Sector: The agricultural sector is one of the sectors of Nigeria economy. it is the sector responsible for the provision of food supply and raw materials for domestic and foreign industries.</p> <p>iii. Financial Institution: These are organization owned either by individual, group or persons, state or country as a whole. Financial institutions are established mainly for saving money (deposit) for their customers and providing for such deposit and when needed and also the granting of credit facilities to their customers based on the credit worthiness of such customers.</p> <p>iv. Nigeria Agricultural Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB): It is a body charged with the duty of granting credit facilities to individual farmers as well as the group farmers for the purpose of fueling their farming activities. It was previously known as Nigeria agricultural cooperative bank (NACB) and became Nigeria agricultural cooperative and rural development bank (NACRDB)</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT (1990-2015)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT (1990-2015)", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE:</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION.      </strong></p> <p>      Small-scale industries play a vital role in the Material welfare of many nations today’s especially the developing nations.</p> <p>They makes specific contributions depending on the form and objectives. Some produces raw materials, distribute products or provide services while others them the  raw materials into finished goods or products. The need of most developing countries is to attain self-reliance and resilient economic status capable of generating an internally sustaining growth. Small-scale industries are the roots and pillars upon which h this can be achieved. The activities of any small-scale industry in any give economy cannot be over emphasized especially mow the country is in political disarray and needs be called to orderliness.</p> <p>Moreover, they provide avenues for the development of entrepreneurial capabilities and managerial skills.</p> <p>As the business requires low capital for setting it-up, such industries spring up in different parts of the country making maximum use of local raw materials.</p> <p>      Despite the large number of small-scale industries in the country, Common Nigerians, While urban concentration, unemployment and other vices which these industries were meant to eliminate persist.</p> <p>It is as a result of negative effect in our economy that need for the diversification of economic activities through several ways of reviving the Nigerian economy become comparative one, of which is an effective and efficient role played by small- scale industries in economic development ofNigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.1            </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>In the earning of industries,Nigeriaand other countries were merely producers of raw materials for use in European industries.</p> <p>While the raw materials which have been turn into the finished goods were more concerned with the maintenance of  law and order, and putting in structures for easy evaluation of raw materials than industrizing the colonies</p> <p>SinceNigerialacked the necessary tools for  capital investment, technical and managerial skilled necessary to promote and operate viable enterprises, foreign investors in a bi d to tap the abundant  resources in the country took the initiative of establishing small-scale  industries.</p> <p>Stales morse, in his book modern small-scale industries for developing countries page 1-10 wrote, at the end of the second world war in 1945, the parliament of the united kind of autho- rised  the appropriation of the sum of $ $200 Million for the promotion and advancement of British colonies and other dependent territories.  In  order to determine how the and was to be allocated and for what scheme the Nigerian government  prepared, “A Nigeria”. This plan made provision for the capital expenditures of $ 55 million.</p> <p>Department of scheme were called for by the government, greater emphasis was placed on the provision of social Amenities a stepping stone for industrial development. Only 0.4 percent was embarked for industrial development. The department for commerce and industry was later established for the development and improvement of  marketing products for export .</p> <p>In 1954, Economic programmes ofNigeriaemphasis  was shifted from expan sion to social services to gearing the economy towards to the building of infrastructures . industrial expansion get more attention than in earlier plans accounting for two percent of the cost of the plan. After independence,Nigeriapursued a policy of attracting foreign investment simultaneous with the policy of increasingNigeria’s participation in small-scale industries, as a foundation towards a larger scale production. Recognizing then significance of these small-scale industries, the Nigerian government instituted various prog ammes to encourage enterprises in this sector. Such incentives were credit scheme, f inaccia and managerial assistance programmes, industrialist promotion act and various. Kinds of tax relief were made available to small-scale industrialist indeginisation of industries was introduced in 1972 in t he economic sector of the country. It  was also meant  among other things to protect infant industries.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:</strong></p> <p>The establishment, management and running of small-scale industries inNigeriahave produced a less diminishing effort compared to the increasing allocation made in this sector.</p> <p>The problems ulitating against successful investment in small-scale industries could be traced to the following factors, lack of raw materials input s, sharp fluctuations in the rate of interest, exchange rate of the local currencies, malpractice’s in the form of barbering and corruption as well as “419” or obtain of  the country’s geographical and political environment and finally lack of infrastructure facilities and skilled manpower inclusive.</p> <p>        To eliminate these problems government should ensure that  the rate of interest and exchange rate are stable.  There   fore government should not spare corrupt businessmen who engaged in  illegql dealing.

Agbo he defined strategy as a general programme of nation and a deployment of emphasis and resources towards the attainment of the overall objectives. It is defined by Kenneth and Hatter as a process by which an organisation formulates objective and is managed to achieve them .strategy is seen by another author as the pattern of objectives purposes or goal and major policies and plans for achieving these goals state in such a way as to define what business a company is in or to be in and the kind of company it is or to be (christerst Andrews and Bower). However, strategy is seen to be a planned skill in managing any affair or achieving any objective and this make small scale to be seen as a strategy for practical entrepreneur development. However many developing countries have failed to adopt this strategy owing to their belief that it is slow process of industrialization which may not be very computable with their desire to catch up with the industrialized countries. Many countries of the world that are advance in their industrial development consigning practical entrepreneur practice. Started with small scale business.</p> <p>          InNigeria, both federal and state government are now placing much emphasis on the promotion of indigenous small scale business enterprises with a review to encouraging entrepreneurship.</p> <p>          A business is defined as a human organisation which produces and market product (target market) it aims to serve. It can take place anywhere and involve receiving and giving process. (Odo P.C.).</p> <p>          Monughton Etal in his introduction to business enterprises defined it as the sum total of those activities that have their main purpose of creating, maintaining and extension of a concern continue to exist because it earns profit or other benefit for it’s owner.</p> <p>Defining what constitutes small scale business entrepreneurship bring out a lot of entrepreneur which varies from country to country, from institution to another but generally speaking a small scale business entrepreneur is independently owned and managed but is not dominant in it’s field of operation.</p> <p>          It is independently because it is wholly owned by an individual or party and managed by them without outside supervision on it’s management and extra case is taken in it’s management and this help in developing the economy of state and nation as a whole.</p> <p> <strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY.</strong></p> <p>          Entrepreneurship started when people produces more products than they needed, as such they had to exchange these surpluses with others who wanted to dispose of their surpluses. For instance, if ca blacksmith produced more hoes that he had not but needed. May be needed some yams or goat etc, he would look for some one who needed his products to exchange with. By this way producers came to realise that they concentrate in their areas of production to produces more and then exchange with what they needed. So through this exchange of products, entrepreneurship started.</p> <p>A typical Nigerian entrepreneur is a set made man who might he said have strong wholly to succeed, he might engage the services of other like friends, mates, in-laws etc to help him in his work or production. Through this way,Nigeriais in the olden days were engaged in entrepreneurship. Early entrepreneurship is characterized with production or manufacturing in which case, the producer most often started with a small capital, most of it from his own savings. Early entrepreneurship started with trade by barter even before the advent any form of money.</p> <p>          Modern entrepreneurship inNigeriastarted with coming of the colonial masters, who brought in their wears and made Nigerians their middlemen. In this way, modern entrepreneurship was conceived.</p> <p>          One of the major factors that has in many was discover aged the flow of entrepreneurship development inNigeriais the value system brought about by Forman education. For many decades formal education has been thee presence of the priviledge. With formal education, people had the opportunity of bring employed in the civil services.</p> <p>The value system discouraged entrepreneurship inNigeriafor colonial masters to sale their goods because if Nigerians continue to be enterprising, they would not have had market for their goods. As such, the system made Nigerians to be dependent on the colonial masters to supply her with the needed products.</p> <p>            Again the contract between Nigerian entrepreneurs and foreign entrepreneurs during the colonial era was very detrimental and the competitive business strategy of the foreign entrepreneurs was ruinous and also against moral standards established by society. They did not adhere to the theory of live and lets live. For instance, the united Africans company (UAC) that was responsible for a substantial percentage of the import and export trade ofNigeria, had the policy of dealing directly with producers and refused to make use of  the services ofNigeriaentrepreneurs. The refusal of the expatriate to utilize the services of local businessmen inhibited their expansion and acquisition of necessary skills and attitude. Because of this, many eventually folded up. Those that folded built up a resentment against business which became very demoralizing to other prospective entrepreneurs.</p> <p>          But with more people being educated and the fact that government could no longer employ most school leavers, economic programmes to encourage individuals to go into private business and be self eliant were initiated (theodore Gieger etal in Nwalnnkwv u) (mrs. Ani, Nnenna B.).</p> <p> <strong>1.2   </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There have been concerted effort by the federal and state government to encourage young school leavers to enter into small scale business entrepreneurship development in Nigeria by establishing some banks, bodies and lending institutions who will be lending funds to young school leavers, consulting them on how to choose a particular business that will yield them much profit, and thereby bring an increase in our gross national product and creating self employment opportunity for themselves, in order to reduce crime growth rate in our country.</p> <p>Apart from employment opportunity problem and the increase in our gross national product (GNP), it also accelerate the development of both the urban and rural areas. With more enterprises in the community mere infrastructural facilities are attracted, like good roads, electricity, they are able to better their standard of living and save for investment. All these, accelerate development both the urban and rural arena.</p> <p>          Without government encouraging practical entrepreneurship development inNigeriaeconomy, instead there will be violent occurrences here and there such stealing 419 and son on.</p> <p>          This study also intended to examine constraints encountered by small industries by small industries and affect of government policies on them.</p> <p> <strong>1.3     </strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY.</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this project is to renew in a critical prospective, the characteristics of small scale practical entrepreneurship business, the causes of their failure, their importance, factors needed to establish and run a small business entrepreneurship.

As the nation is presently experiencing challenges of unemployment, insecurity, and high rate of poverty, the study observed that one of the most efficient ways to empower the youth is through N-power programme. The study took a critical look at the benefits of N-power programme such as provision of individual with adequate training that will enable creativity and innovative relevance to skill acquisition which encourages self-employment and self-reliant. The programme reviewed some techniques of acquiring skills which includes industrial training exercise, workshop/seminar, excursion and this aid in the empowerment of youth and consequently eradication of poverty and extreme hunger. The study identified challenges facing N-power programme such as inadequate funding, lack of trained teachers, and non- availability of equipment.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background of the study</p> <p>N-Power is a youth empowerment scheme sponsored by the Federal Government of Nigeria. N-Power addresses the challenge of youth unemployment by providing a structure for large-scale and relevant work skills acquisition and development while linking its core and outcomes to fixing inadequate public services and stimulating the larger economy. N-Power aspires to provide a platform where most Nigerians can access skills acquisition and development. N-Power is designed for Nigerian citizens between the ages of 18 and 35. The modular programmes under N-Power will ensure that each participant will learn and practice most of what is necessary to find or create work.</p> <p>However, Nigeria, a country with an estimated population of 170 million people (NBS, 2013) is well endowed with abundant human and natural resources and a favorable geographical location in the world map. The current global financial crisis has impacted negatively on the macro and micro levels of the economy of Nigeria. As at present, the situation has poses serious threats and challenges to both government and well meaning citizens. Nigeria like most developing nations of the world is faced with myriad of problems which include youth and graduate unemployment, high rate of poverty, conflict and diseases, insincerity, over-depending in foreign goods, low economic growth and development, lack of capacity and skills needed to move the economy forward and urbanization. Unemployment has become a major problem bedeviling the lives of Nigerian Youth causing frustration, dejection and depending on family members and friends. The high rate of unemployment among the youths in Nigeria has contributed to the high rate of poverty and insecurity in the country (Ajufo, 2013). More than half of the Nigerian population is under the age of 30 according to the National Population Commission (2013). Awogbenle and Iwuamad(2010) observed from the excepts of statistics obtained from the National Manpower Board and Federal Bureau of statistics that Nigeria has a youth population of eighty (80) Million representing 60 percent of the total population of the country. Sixty four (64) Million of them are unemployed while one million six hundred thousand (1.6 million) are underemployed. According to Ossal and Nwalado (2012) the need for empowerment programmes started emerging in the mid-1980s, when there were political instability and inconsistencies in the socio-economic policies of successive government, high level of unemployment, large scale lay off of workers and early retirements as a result of structural adjusted policies and bad economic trends. In the face of these challenges there was no encouragement from the federal government for public and private investors to embark on empowerment activities. These situations pose great challenges to the very existence of individuals and the national development. To salvage these situations there is need for the training of educated man and woman who can function effectively in their society in which they live in terms of self-employment and self-reliant which N-Power programme can provide. Based upon this premise, the study examined N-Power programme as a veritable tool for youth empowerment in Nigeria.</p> <p>Nigeria faces a number of challenges that can only be met if she has innovative, well-educated, and willing to be trained citizens who, whatever their walks of life, have the spirit and inquisitiveness to think in new ways, and the courage to meet and adapt to the challenges facing them. At same time, given the current socio-economic and political stance of the country, a thriving economy would require a greater number of young people who are willing and able to be trained; who can launch and successfully develop their own commercial or social ventures, and who will become innovators in the wider organisations in which they work. European Scientific Journal October 2013 edition vol.9, No.28 ISSN: 1857 – 7881 (Print) e – ISSN 1857- 7431 114 It is a common experience that many graduates from the Nigerian universities find it difficult to get employment every year. This is partly due to the curricula of the universities and other tertiary institutions which lay emphasis on training for white-collar jobs (Osibanjo, 2006). The socioeconomic situation in Nigeria poses serious threats and challenges to both government and wellbeing of citizens of the nation as a whole. The unemployment problems further call for different strategies and actions for it to be ameliorated. N-Power programme has been embraced by almost all the Nigerian youths and its capabilities and efficacy in springing up economies is not in doubt. It is believed that refocusing N-Power programme will immensely contribute in developing the spirit and culture of empowerment in country N-Power programme is essential not only to shape the mindsets of young people but also to provide the skills and knowledge that are central to developing an empowerment culture. N-Power programme provides unemployed youths motivation, knowledge, and skills essential for launching a successful venture company (Cho, 2017). Developing mindsets, generic attributes and skills that are the foundations of N-Power can be achieved through indoctrination from an early stage; that is, if it is incorporated into the national  system with the seriousness it deserves. Because employment is key to shaping young people’s attitudes, skills and culture, it is vital that N-Power programme is addressed from an early stage and up into  level of sustainability. N-Power programme should be available to all unemployed regardless of major courses and choice of studies to enhance competitive advantage, not only for students but the societies and nations where they are involved. The relationship between empowerment and development has been established, such that empowerment is now internationally accepted as a key development index. The importance of empowerment cannot be overemphasized; it is a fundamental human right, hence, the need for incorporating N-Power programme in the unemployment alleviated system. In line with the above, this study is discussed under the following heading: conceptual framework, importance of N-Power programme, need for N-Power programme , rationale for fostering N-Power programme and its achievements as well as problems for effective implementation of N-Power programme in Nigeria. Finally, the way forward will be highlighted.</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Analysis of youth unemployment by geographical/settlement location (rural and urban areas) indicates that youth unemployment is mostly in rural areas and rapidly growing: From 2011 to 2017, the share of unemployed youth in rural areas increased from 47.59 percent to 59.95 percent. The population of unemployed youth in rural areas rose from 2.9 million in 2010 to about 5.9 million in 2016. Public policies directed at addressing youth unemployment have faced different challenges including finance, the absence of good administration and implementation, inconsistent policies, unimpressive responses from would-be trainees, and unqualified resource personnel handling the training programs. Programs that were expected to be successful but did not meet those expectations were those created in the 1980s and have not drastically improved in spite of modifications over the years. For example, the National Accelerated Poverty Reduction Program (NAPEP) was too big for its meager budgetary allocation over the years. Many of the available funds for the program went to overhead and administrative costs in offices spread over the entire country, limiting its impact. Similarly, the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) had no openings of its own to engage unemployed youth, providing only vocational training to young school leavers. There have been insufficient funds to provide start-off capital for the youth who complete their training. It against this background that this study intends to examine the impact and possibility of N-Power programme not being unsuccessful.</p> <p>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of N-Power programme in youth empowerment in Nigeria.</p> <p>Specific objectives of this study are to:</p> <p>Evaluate the value of N-Power programme amongst youth in Nigeria</p> <p>To ascertain how well N-Power programme as enhance youth empowerment</p> <p>To ascertain the upshot of N-Power programme on the productivity of the youth</p> <p>To evaluate how well is N-Power programme implemented in organizations.</p> <p>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>The following research question was postulated for the successful completion of the studies</p> <p>What is the plus point of N-Power programme among youths in Nigeria?</p> <p>How does N-Power programme enhance economic growth?</p> <p>What is the upshot of N-Power programme on youth productivity?</p> <p>How has N-Power programme enhance youth empowerment?</p> <p>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>It is imperative to know that at the completion of this study the findings will be beneficial to the government (ministry of youth and sport), the potential social welfare in human capital development, and skill acquisition, the academia, youths and the general public.</p> <p>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The scope of this study covers N-Power programme on youth empowerment in Nigeria. However, this study has some limitations, which are:</p> <p>Finance: finance is a major limitation to the study as resources allocated to the study is limited</p> <p>Time: time is a major constrain to the research as time allocated to the study is very limited.</p> <p>Research material: availability of research material is a major setback to the scope of the study.</p>                                                            \n\nIMPACT OF N-POWER PROGRAMME ON YOUTH EMPOWERMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF N-POWER PROGRAMME ON YOUTH EMPOWERMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 73}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1     Background to Study</p> <p>There is no country in the modern world where an improvement in the material level of living is not regarded as a desirable goal by rulers and citizens alike. The growing acceptance of the need to do something for the poor, can be noticed in the numerous poverty alleviation programmes in Nigeria, the average Nigerian still lives subsist below the absolute poverty line. Amongst the challenges that confront Nigeria, a major contributory factor was the style and expectations of the development strategy that was pursued and faced with this failure; the need for a meaningful national development is not only necessary but also imperative. To this end, a lot of economic reform programmes or strategies have evolved but recently special emphasis is being made on self-reliance via entrepreneur and its numerous small and medium enterprises. The economic success of the countries of south east, Asia, and America is traceable to the contributions made by self-reliant individuals (entrepreneurs), through their numerous small medium development depend on the entrepreneur who makes a living by creating new business new jobs and new ideas.</p> <p>Entrepreneur means different things to different people. In other to appreciate this study more, some concepts that are associated with this study will be explained.According to Oxford advanced Learner’s dictionary it defines entrepreneur as a person who starts or organizes a commercial enterprises, especially one involving financial risk. To an economist, entrepreneur is one who brings resources, labour, materials and other assets into combination that make their value greater than before and who introduce changes, innovations and a new order. Entrepreneurs are the risk takers who create businesses; they assemble all the factors of production in an effort to start and operate a business and to make a profit. For Schumpeter “the whole process of economic change hung ultimately on the person who makes it happen–the entrepreneurs”. Entrepreneurship involves combining to initiate changes in production hence it is essentially the promotion of economic change, it is a process involving the entrepreneur and an entrepreneurial career. Hirsch and Peters in their text entitled entrepreneurship: describes this process as one of creating something difficult with value by devoting the necessary time and assuming the accompanying financial, psychic and social risks and receiving the resulting, the rewards of monetary and personal satisfaction.</p> <p>In Nigeria, many policies are constantly being implemented to ensure their survival which will in turn enable them contribute maximally to economic development but there challenges were intensified more by the perennial energy crisis, weak infrastructure, poor import and export policies, tariff structure among others, which have prevailed in the country for some time now. These have, inevitably led to the near collapse and failure of the small scale enterprises. The government of this country should look into the modalities of solving these challenges. It is therefore against this background that this work sets out to evaluate entrepreneurship development in Lafia Metropolis, NassarawaState, considering some small scale enterprises.</p> <p>1.2     Statement of the Problem</p> <p>It has been observed that some of the problems associated with entrepreneurship development and job creation in Nassarawa state include but not limited to:</p> <p>Incompetence of Management: The major hazard of an entrepreneurshipbusiness is the incompetence of management. A small business owner may know all the management principles and theories; his management practice may jeopardize his business. He may not possess the leadership qualities, be unwilling to delegate authority, lack of appropriate human relations ability and may not possess the appropriate skills of management; such a business operated by this business owner is likely to fail.</p> <p>Inadequacy of Infrastructural Facilities: Water, electricity, accessible roads, and other means of communication are sine quanon to the efficient performance of entrepreneurship enterprise. Their absence or inadequacy affects negatively the efficient performance of entrepreneurial businesses.</p> <p>Disaster: There are certain circumstances over which small scale business owner may have little or no control. Natural disaster such as thunder, product or accident or sudden death of the owner may adversely affect the operation of the small scale business enterprise.</p> <p>High Rate of Loan Diversion and Defaults: Loans obtained from government, banks and individual persons are used to promote personal aggrandizement instead of the corporate objective of the business and hence failure to repay the loan plus interest affects the business.</p> <p>Inadequate Credit Control: A common problem facing entrepreneurial business owner is whether or not to extend credit. Some small scale business enterprise possesses credit granting practices, credits extended to friends and relations are often times too hard to collect in times of need. This therefore, increases the financial predicament of the business owner.</p> <p>Inadequate Planning: Planning a business begins with gathering and evaluating data on resources requirements, operating costs, potentialmarkets and sales, competition, supplies, relevant government regulations, etc. Unfortunately, however, many eager business owners push ahead impulsively, without paining attention to planning, and thus business failure sets in. Lack of the use of modern method of gathering and analysing data constituted a weak point in the small business strategies planning effort.</p> <p>Poor Business Accountability: The financial problem of small scale enterprises is rarely only financial. Often it is only a symptom, the diagnosis of which reveals other weaknesses. Business finance and stress are mixed up with personal finance and stacks required for personal needs cash and slacks are taken at will for personal use whenever the need arises without accounting for such withdrawals. This makes is difficult to assess the operating results of the business and at times starves the forms of its liquid resources.</p> <p>Hence, the need for this study on the effect of entrepreneurship development on employment generation in Lafia Metropolis, Nassarawa State.</p> <p>1.3     Objectives of the Study</p> <p>The aim of this topic is to recall the pivotal role, which entrepreneurs and the small medium enterprises are expected to play in modern economics. Therefore the study will make every effort to reveal the various ways to encourage entrepreneurship development geared towards employment generation in Lafia Metropolis, Nassarawa State. The specific objectives of this study are as follows;</p> <p>(1)     To identify the constraints encountered by entrepreneurs as a sole operator or as a bigger organization and how their challenges can be overcome.</p> <p>(2)     To determine the level of awareness of people towards entrepreneurship development as a tool for employment generation in Lafia Metropolis.</p> <p>(3)     To examine various ways that will be employed to develop entrepreneurship in order to get the desired result of employment creation and development.</p> <p>(4)     By extension and implication, the study shall provide how the government both state and national and also the society will influence positively on entrepreneurship and its development.</p> <p>1.4     Research Questions</p> <p>The questions guiding this research work are stated below;</p> <p>1)      What are the major constraints inhibiting entrepreneurs in Lafia Metropolis from carrying out their roles as catalysts of economic growth via employment generation and how these challenges can be overcome?</p> <p>2)      What is the level of awareness of people concerning entrepreneurial development as a tool employment generation?</p> <p>3)      What identifiable and specific roles (Financial, economic, social, motivational, and psychological) do entrepreneurs in Lafia Metropolisplay in order to get the desired result (employment creation and development).</p> <p>4)      In what ways can both the government and also society influence entrepreneurship development?</p> <p>1.5     Significance of the Study</p> <p>The research work will be of great significance to students, prospective and practicing entrepreneurs, co-operators, chief executives and other practicing managers of business and non–business organizations. The research work will serve as a background and catalyst to any future researchers and scholars who may wish to venture into the areas of promoting employment creation and entrepreneurship development in Lafia Metropolis. Again the outcome of the research could be significance to the people with different occupations and professions. The conclusion which this research may expose, could lead to improvement and efficiency in Lafia Metropolis, Nassarawa as regard to entrepreneurship. The confidence level on embarking on entrepreneurship development in Nigeria will improve, and more people or the general public will agree to venture in that business.</p> <p>1.6     Scope of the Study</p> <p>The study focuses on the effects of entrepreneurship development on employment generation in Lafia Metropolis; a case study of small scale enterprises.</p> <p>1.7     Limitations of the Study</p> <p>The researcher however, encountered series of challenges in the course of carrying out this study, such challenges include:</p> <p>Time constraints: The research was faced with time intensive activities which were unable to undertake in combination with academic course works. Accessibility to adequate and reliable data for analysis was one of the limitations of this study. An-in depth study and analysis of the subject would not be possible since the study was restricted to just one state (Lafia Metropolis). Lastly, some of the materials (literature) required for the sourcing of secondary data relevant to the study were not handy even though a concerted effort was made to secure from a valuable sources.</p> <p>1.8     Definitions of Terms</p> <p>Entrepreneur: Stone and freeman (1992:156) defined it as either the originator of a new business venture or a manager who tries to improve an organizational unit by initiating productive changes. In other words, it is an individual or group of individuals, who sees environmental change as an opportunity and uses the factors of production to produce new goods and service.</p> <p>Entrepreneurship:Hisrich, (1995:17) Defines Entrepreneurship as a process of creating something different with the value by devoting the necessary time and effort assuming the accompanying financial, psychic and social risks and receiving the resulting rewards of monetary and personal satisfaction.</p> <p>Small Scale Enterprise: Onuoha (1994:322), citing Osaze (1996), sees small business as one which is owned, managed and controlled by one or two persons, is family influenced in decision makings, has a differentiated organizational structure has a relatively small share of the market and employs less than 50 people.</p> <p>Entrepreneurship Development: This is the coming into existence in society of the class of individuals, who are not limited to pace odds.</p> <p>Employment Generation: this refers simply to creation of job opportunities either through entrepreneurial ventures or government empowerment schemes etc.</p>                                                          \n\nEFFECTS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT ON EMPLOYMENT GENERATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT ON EMPLOYMENT GENERATION", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>                                             INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1              Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Understanding the role played by the social, cultural and economic factors in entrepreneurship is the key to comprehend how to encourage culture and entrepreneurial behavior. A first explanation for this stems from Sociology. From this perspective, it is stated that women are less entrepreneurial than men due to stereotypes and roles that are attributed according to their gender and move away from attitudes of domain or achievement, placing them in roles near housework, childcare and their elders (Eagly, 1987). Also, within this perspective other researchers say how men are positioned in society today, through certain patterns, ideologies and speeches reinforce its dominant position in the labor market and relegate women to the background (Connell, 1990). Secondly and closely related to the above, understanding the national culture is essential to analyze how each country values and rewards the behaviors that promote entrepreneurial behavior. In this sense, in those countries where social roles are closer to competitiveness, ambition and achievement, that is to say, where highlight the roles attributed to the male group would be expected lower rates of female entrepreneurship (McGrath, Macmillan &amp; Scheinberg, 1992, Shane, 1992, 1991).</p> <p>The influence of culture on economic growth and entrepreneurship was first recognized by Max Weber at the beginning of this century. Marx Weber posited that Protestantism encouraged a culture that emphasized individualism, achievement motivation; legitimating entrepreneurial vocations, rationality, asceticism, and self-reliance. Thus, it has been shown that the Protestant ethic was a fundamental drive for the spirit of entrepreneurship, modern capitalism and growth of western economies (Kayed and Hassan, 2011).</p> <p>People have different motives and intentions of going into entrepreneurship. The economic reform introduced by the various government in the developing countries that begins in the 1980s leading to loss of employment and reduction in income pushed many people to become entrepreneurs in developing countries. Eijdenberg and Masurel (2013) opined that people in developing countries are more driven by poverty and lack job to become an self reliant while in the developed countries, entrepreneurial activities springs up of desire to seize an opportunity and innovation to start a business. The harsh environmental factors together with high rate of poverty and unemployment bring about a high rate of entrepreneurial activities in developing countries. Gender and cultural beliefs have indeed continued to hamper development and growth of women entrepreneurs in developing nation. Halkias, Nwajiuba, Harkiolakis and Caracatsanis (2011) in their work also posited that gender and cultural belief usually block the economic capacity of women as entrepreneurs and affects negatively on enterprise development, productivity, competitiveness and reduce the growth of the economy. This study seeks to address the challenge of gender and cultural beliefs by examining how they block the growth of women entrepreneurs in developing countries and suggestions are made on how to overcome the problems.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>A consistent empirical result emerging in the literature on female entrepreneurship is that gender matters. In particular, women exhibit a consistently lower likelihood of becoming an entrepreneur than their male counterparts. With African nations being dominantly patriarchal, the extent to which women are able to freely participate in entrepreneurship activities will largely be determined by the existing cultural atmosphere. Considering the various cultural and structural challenges and obstacles facing women, someone may quickly conclude that women are usually discouraged from venturing into enterprise development. First, early socialisation practices emphasise the primary role of women as mothers and wives, influencing girls’ total expectations for future participation in the labour force and the choice of career paths. Second, an African culture is mainly seen as a barrier to development because it perpetuates culturally sanctioned biases against women and provides excuses for men. This has resulted in lower participation of women in business activities.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following are some of the questions which this study intends to answer:</p> <p>i)                   what is the prevalence of gender culture and entrepreneurship development?</p> <p>ii)                 what are the factors responsible for gender culture and entrepreneurship development?</p> <p>iii)               what the effects of gender culture and entrepreneurship development on the economy of Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.4       Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study was to investigate gender culture and entrepreneurship development on the economy of Nigeria. However, the specific objectives were:</p> <p>i)                   to examine the prevalence of gender culture and entrepreneurship development</p> <p>ii)                 to determine the factors responsible for gender culture and entrepreneurship development</p> <p>iii)               to inquire the effects of gender culture and entrepreneurship development on the economy of Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.5       Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study was to investigate gender culture and entrepreneurship development on the Nigerian economy.

The forces of entrepreneur are strong in Nigeria because most people see entrepreneurial activities as what is primarily based on essential due to the poor economic situation. We do not seem to realise the fact that entrepreneurship development is the base of all economic evolution of any nation. The current Nigerian economy is largely dominated by the oil industry. The labour force is radically growing, as is the unemployment rate currently at 20%, with millions of workers underemployed. Nigeria is endowed with the largest domestic market in Africa a wide range of natural resources coupled with a diversely skilled labour pool. Given these economic realities, the country must constantly create new jobs, and diversify the industrial and commercial sector to take advantage of human and natural resources.</p> <p>The activities of entrepreneurs have been found to be capable of making impact on the economy of a nation and quality of life of the people through economic growth; employment generation and empowerment of the disadvantaged segment of the population, which include women and the poor. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is perceived as a pride of basically every country or state. Because of SMEs’ significant roles in the development and growth of various economies, they have appropriately been termed as the engine of growth and catalysts for socio-economic transformation of any country. SMEs are perceived as a real instrument for the achievement of national economic objectives of employment generation and poverty reduction at low investment cost. Other central benefits of vibrant SMEs are the  access to the infrastructural facilities the stimulation of economic activities such as providers of various items and distributive trades for items produced and needed by the SMEs, stemming from rural urban migration, enhancement of standard of living of the employees of the SMEs and their dependents as well as those who are directly or indirectly associated with them.</p> <p>Various government of the nation have begun to find solutions on how to involve the private sector in the developmental process of their country’s economy which is one of the responses to the challenges of development of entrepreneurial in developing countries. Nigeria had even taken a bold step by including entrepreneurial studies in the academic curriculum of her education system and with the introduction of National Directorate of Employment (NDE) scheme. The belief of such policy makers is that such decision will inculcate entrepreneurial spirit in the mind of people so as to prepare them for wealth creation through entrepreneurship (Fasua, 2006). Entrepreneurship is very crucial to the development of a country’s economy, especially countries like Nigeria. Entrepreneurship is sine qua non to national development poverty eradication and employment generation it is the bed rock of any nation’s industrialization.</p> <p>The essential of entrepreneurship for productivity was originally credited to Alfred Marshall in 1990. In his famous book; Practice Principle of Economics, Marshall ascertained that there are four factors of production; Land, Labour Capital and organization. These factors are properly utilized by an entrepreneur. Thus entrepreneur creates new commodities or improves the plan of producing an old commodity. (Marshall, 1994). Therefore, early entrepreneurs were characterized with production and manufacturing. In a situation like this, the producers often started with small capital. Early entrepreneurship began with trade by barter even before the advent of money. Therefore most of the modern entrepreneurs were engaged in retail trade and also sole proprietorship.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>With current challenges in the global economy, new and innovative strategies are emerging in the bid to stimulate and sustain growth in national economies. Entrepreneurship is one model that is deemed critical to the formulation and implementation of these strategies. According to a research by The Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute, it was found that USA is a world leader when it comes to supporting its entrepreneurs in respect to business formation, expansion, and growth. They also finance new businesses through venture capital. This type of financial capital is provided to early-stage, high-potential and riskier start-up companies. Countries like Australia and Sweden came second and third respectively according to the 2014 statistics. Some of these countries’ economies are ranking very high because they understand the effects entrepreneurs play in the growth of their economy. Their GDP are always on the increase thereby increase in their economy.</p> <p>In spite of this, little is known about the profile of the Nigerian entrepreneur and how they engage with the constantly evolving policy context. This study therefore aimed at better understanding their characteristics the impact and role of entrepreneurship on the Nigeria economic growth.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following are some of the questions which this study intends to answer:</p> <p>i)                   what is the prevalence of entrepreneurship on the Nigeria economic growth?</p> <p>ii)                 what are the contributions of entrepreneurs to the economic development in Nigeria?</p> <p>iii)               what are the factors that influence entrepreneurs to economic development the Nigerian economic development?</p> <p><strong>1.4       Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The objective of the study is critically study the role and impact of entrepreneurship on the development of the Nigerian economy. However, the specific objectives are to:</p> <p>i)                   to investigate the prevalence of entrepreneurship on the Nigeria economic growth</p> <p>ii)                 to assess out the contributions of entrepreneurs to the economic development in Nigeria</p> <p>iii)               to inquire are the factors that influence entrepreneurs to economic development the Nigerian economic development</p> <p><strong>1.5       Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>The research hypotheses to be tested include:</p> <p>i)                   there is a significant relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth  of Nigeria</p> <p>ii)                 Low entrepreneurial activities does not have any significant correlation with economic growth in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.6       Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Findings from the study will be of immeasurable importance to the Nigerian government all and aspiring entrepreneurs in Nigeria. It will serve as a manual that will guide them on how to about using entrepreneurship to economically develop the country and raise their standard of living. It will as well help to bridge the gap that might have existed in the entrepreneurial activities.</p> <p><strong>1.7       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study investigated the roles and impacts entrepreneurship has on the economic growth and how economic growth will be improved through entrepreneurship. Evaluating entrepreneurship as a tool in the growth and development of Nigerian economy seems too broad for the time frame of this research work therefore, the scope of this work was confined towards the contribution of small and medium scale enterprise to the development of Nigerian economy.</p> <p><strong>1.8       Limitation of the study</strong></p> <p>This research worked on the impact and role of entrepreneurship on the Nigeria economic growth was not an exception to the usual problems associated with research in Nigeria. The researcher was faced with the problem of finance as the researcher did not have enough funds to get the required stationery for the work. Also, the timeframe for the work to be carried out was too short.</p> <p><strong>1.9       Definitions of Terms</strong></p> <p>The following terms were used in the course of this study:</p> <p><strong>Economy Growth: </strong>This is when the real per capital income of a country increases over time.</p> <p><strong>Entrepreneur:</strong> This is a person who starts or organizes a business that has a financial risk.</p> <p><strong>N.D.E.</strong>  National Directorate of Employment</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT AND ROLE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT AND ROLE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF NIGERIA", "id": 76}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1  Background To The Study</p> <p>In the 20th century, the subject of strategic planning has been particularly applied to Organizations.

Globally, it is a money spinning industry with billions of dollars to its credit even though in this part of the world, we are still grappling with putting the industry on the right pedestal so as to wholly benefit like other countries. Just like any other business running in Nigeria, there are areas of concentration, accommodation and restaurants which seemingly, is the ‘honey pot’ for practitioners in Nigeria. </p> <p>In recent times, the Nigerian economy has witnessed tremendous ‘growth’ in the hospitality industry leading to the emergence of hotels, fast food restaurant chains, and night clubs and cruise lines. These positive trends in no small measure are clearly helping to re-define the face of the hospitality industry in Nigeria. Information on the street shows that the industry is booming. Nonetheless, the writer believes every Tom, Dick and Harry with adequate funds, is investing into the business with limited knowledge of the expertise required to run such business. Most of them forget that the industry requires investors that are aware of the fact that investment in this area requires long term commitment. Hence, they expect returns as soon as possible at the peril of their poorly remunerated staff.</p> <p>The hospitality industry in Nigeria is variegated depending on the location. Some of the outfits found in big cities boast of ‘reasonably’ high quality of service like Dansaky Hotel and Suites, Ifako Ijaye, Lagos State while those in the outskirts offer a lower standard. It is therefore not surprising that since the industry has become an ‘all comers affair’, there is in reality, no true classification of restaurants and hotels as obtainable in other countries. Consequently, most hotels have taken a bold step of prescribing their own grading leading to confusion amongst their clientele.</p> <p>The Nigerian hospitality industry is faced with a myriad of challenges ranging from poor energy supply and insecurity to misconstrued internal perception, cynical global perspicacity, flawed hotel classification, poor customer service, little or no standardisation in operations, inconsistent regulatory environment and skilled labour shortages caused by a few entrepreneurs with little knowledge of the workings of the industry who hijack the process to perpetuate plans for their own personal aggrandisement Chukwudi Njoku (2015).</p> <p>Indeed, the industry operates in a country whose growth rate is estimated at about 7.4% per annum. The challenges cascades from the ineffective top echelon in government down to the least of employees in the industry. Arguably, the industry has not recorded much progress in terms of achievements from its past precedence. Notwithstanding, more than ever before, it has become more lucrative depending on which side of the divide you find yourself i.e. employer or employee.</p> <p>The world over, the hospitality industry has provided high yield in returns on investments. Whether or not this has trickled down to the employees is a story for another day. Not long ago staff of about three ‘self-acclaimed’ international hotels embarked on a strike in Lagos State which disrupted the operations of the hotels. According to them, this was owing to the poor working environment and employee packages of these organisations, although their employers were not in agreement with these claims.</p> <p>The Nigerian market has seen an influx of international brands. However, this is still not reflected in the quality of services rendered. They seem to have fallen into the abyss of ideological quagmire by forgetting to recognise the fact that the industry thrives on service. Take away the services from the hospitality industry then there is nothing to build on. Even in Japan, where plans are ongoing to replace humans with robots. Practitioners have asked if robots will be as intelligent as humans. Others have tagged it as klutzy according to the Guardian UK particularly because humans still outperform robots in terms of dexterity on the job and balance. Although the hotels in Nigeria offer different services to all classes of customers yet they suffer from a culture that is alien to supporting good customer service. Indeed, it is a difficult time to be a stakeholder in the industry but in all, there is always light at the end of the tunnel. It is against this background that the study seeks to examine the challenges of hotel business in Lagos State by using Dansaky Hotel and Suites, Ifako Ijaye, Lagos State as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem </strong></p> <p>The businessman who fails does not know himself, does not know his market, does not know his business and does not know what is going on around him. Conceivable, everyone wants to succeed in his personal, his social and his economic goals but very few do. The key to success is not the wish for the desire to be successful. It is easy for anyone to wish for a million dollars in business, but to succeed, the individual needs many things. Above all, for the need to be a definite goal there must be energy, drive, and the plan to work for it and the recruitment of people dedicated to the same goals. Many people of course settle for less (Campbell, 1993).</p> <p>        Anything can indicate an economic need. The need may be for better or different food, faster service, new convenience, increased status, or a new product. The only way to prosper is to think, not only to see the various facts, but to understand each fact independently to understand the significance when the facts are put together, and to understand the significance, scope, magnitude, complexity, and completeness of this relationship. Disregard an individual’s potential ability in resolving complex problems of food quality, service, atmosphere, price and competition and look only at this dynamic relationship between emotion and success. However, can anyone succeed who is bored, indifferent, lazy, stubborn, and in-service? How far can the aggressive, crude, tasteless, impulsive, arrogant, and hostile individual climb?</p> <p>        Another major cause for business failure is the lack of detailed understanding and knowledge of the product. Although the inability to plan, direct, and control the various functional areas associated with food is an extremely serious management deficiency. Also, the failure to really understand the nature of the product sold can be equally catastrophic. The potential restaurant operator is exposed to two major problems that he definitely will not encounter if he elects to enter any other field of endeavour. The two specific problems he must resolve are the perish ability of food and the control of inventory.</p> <p>        Most people are aware that food spoils. However, they don’t understand how serious this fact can be. Spoilage begins from the moment a food item is ordered and continues through receiving, dry and refrigerated storage, preparation, production and service, on the delivery truck, food items are thawed, bumped, mishandled, bruised, or robbed off their freshness. In other functional areas, frozen food spoils because it is not stored immediately. Milk source, banana over-ripen, lobsters die, fish rotten, meat dehydrates, lettuce wits, oil becomes rancid, food is cooked too long, high temperature, too early , and the list is endless (Mintzberg, 1975). Therefore, this study will examine the challenges of hotel business in Lagos State by using Dansaky Hotel and Suites, Ifako Ijaye, Lagos State as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Research Objectives </strong></p> <p>The study has both general objective and specific objectives.

This will enhance the development of hotels since they act as tourist attraction centres. The overall consideration of the significance of the study will be summarized in the following statements. It will also help to fill the gap in the literature in the areas of hospitality and tourism. It become not a primary but a secondary source of information for researchers, academicians and practitioners, It as well serve as guiding documents for policy makers for the adaption, formulation and implementation of a genuine urban development strategies, efficient urban management, migration policy, through hotel establishment and so on. Lastly, it will give insight for the town administrators about the existing and emerging socio-economic challenge of the migrants in relation with the socioeconomic services provided by the town administration</p> <p><strong>1.7      Scope of the Study </strong></p> <p>This project is designed to target waiters, reception staff, and room maids in small scale Hotel in Adamawa State. However, Dansaky Hotel and Suites, Ifako Ijaye, Lagos State will be our focus as case study. Also the study will be limited to the personnel in the food and beverage service, reception and housekeeping departments.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong>   <strong>Limitation of the Study </strong></p> <p><strong>This research was faced by limited research materials as</strong> the research material available to the researcher was insufficient, thereby limiting the study. Also, time was another limitation for this study as the time frame allocated to the study did not enhance wider coverage as the researcher had to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study. <strong>Organizational privacy</strong> also limited this study because there was limited access to the selected auditing firm makes it difficult to get all the necessary and required information concerning the activities  </p> <p><strong>1.9   Definition of Terms </strong></p> <p>The following terms were used in the course of this study:</p> <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The situation of being faced with something that needs great mental or physical effort in order to be done successfully and therefore tests a person's ability.<br/></p> <p><strong>Hospitality: </strong>the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers.</p> <p><strong>Tourism: </strong>is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining <em>tourists</em>, and the business of operating tours.</p>\n\nTHE CHALLENGES OF HOTEL BUSINESS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CHALLENGES OF HOTEL BUSINESS", "id": 78}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Education is the process of learning and training; it is an instrument for change and development. Education is the springboard to socio-economic growth and development of every nation. It prepares an individual to live in a dynamic or constantly changing society and contribute to such changes and constantly advance the survival, growth and development of the society (Nwaham, 2010). Education generally, is a social process that helps to maintain a dynamic society since the creation of human beings. Observing this, Onyeachu (2006) noted that it is through education that the cultural heritages are transferred from generation to generation. Education is the most powerful instrument in the world because no nation has ever attained fame or a particular height in terms of development without education as its bedrock, which is engendered by sound educational ideals. Thus Onwumere (2006) saw education as the springboard for socio-political, economic and cultural development that enhances the production of skilled manpower for national development. There are informal and formal system of education, the formal structure of education should be encouraged. On the other hand, obtaining certificate alone without a corresponding creative and mental power have no serious bearing on the purpose of education (Uloko, 2010). Education as parameter, registers the tempo of change and as well the rapid transformation of any society (Akpojena, 2010). There is high increase in the demand for education at all levels in Nigeria that promotes skills acquisition for survival in the society; by the same token, it is through such education that the acquired skills can be transferred into business development, which will in turn contribute to economic growth and development in Nigeria. And such education is entrepreneurship education.</p> <p>However, despite the recognition of entrepreneurship as having the potential to curb unemployment among Nigerian youth and the introduction of entrepreneurship education in Nigerian universities, about 80% of the Nigerian youth are unemployed and about 10% are under employed with 7 out of 10 graduates remaining unemployed or underemployed (Dike, 2009). As the former minister of labour and productivity Adelokunbo Kayode has asserted, “the greatest challenge confronting government today remains massive unemployment which has served as a breeding ground for anti-social vices” in Nigeria (Olayinka, 2010).</p> <p>In today’s competitive and challenging global world with diverse demands, many countries are facing serious problems of graduate unemployment (Adesina, 2013). As a result, the higher education sectors are under immense pressure from governments, employers and parents to produce quality graduates that can be economically engaged at the individual, national and global level (Teichler, 2007). Such graduates should possess a combination of attributes that will enable them to take an adaptive and proactive approach to their careers (Bezuidenhout, 2011). While there is consensus worldwide on the importance of addressing employability within higher education, there remains some debate on how best this can be achieved (Harvey, and Morey, 2002). This paper will suggest initiatives to be taken by the to make sure that every stakeholder (including the government, higher education institutions, industry and commerce, employers, professional bodies, parents and the students) play its part in ensuring that graduates are able to find or create employment sustainably.</p> <p>Although many countries are faced with problems of unemployment in general (Adesina, 2013), the scope of this paper is limited to graduate employability. A graduate here refers to someone who has a bachelor’s or higher degree from a higher education institution (HEI). The rationale for focusing on graduate employability arises from the realisation that governments, employers and communities are increasingly interested in what HEIs have to offer as a source of recruitment and for the development of existing employees (Keech, 2006). In part, this has been driven by a growing awareness of the potential of HEIs in the development of knowledge based economies and driving innovation and national development (Escrigas 2008).</p> <p>Ayodele, 2006 Unachukwu (2009) identifies the challenges to entrepreneurship education in Nigeria to include: finance, manpower and education, data, inadequate infrastructures and entrepreneurial attitude. She advocates the need for entrepreneurial education for the youth. The government at all tiers; the Nigerian Universities Commission (NUC), professional bodies like Institute of Chartered Accountant of Nigeria and the academia have been attracted to it. In particular, some universities are redesigning their curricula and the ways they operate to create opportunities for the training of their students in practical entrepreneurial skills. The Federal Government of Nigeria issues directive through the Nigerian Universities Commission (NUC) to all Universities in the country to establish Centres for Entrepreneurship Development to coordinate the offering of a benchmark entrepreneurship course to all students in Nigerian universities.</p> <p>Therefore, the NUC has made course on entrepreneurship development (CED) to be mandatory for all Nigerian graduates irrespective of their disciplines since year 2000.The strategic objectives of the national policy are to: (1) improve the capacity of youths to develop positive independent and innovative thought process and overall entrepreneurial mind-set and (2) the development of vocational skills to stimulate future graduates towards venture and wealth creation. A recent survey of university undergraduates on their perception of CED by one of the authors reveals these objectives might be far from being achieved given the present traditional model. However, due to the way entrepreneurial programmes have assumed a global proliferation and dimension, it was suggested by Volkmann (2004) that entrepreneurship will become “the major academic discipline for business education in the 21st century”.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Nigerian tertiary institutions produce millions of graduates annually into an economy which is already overpopulated, thereby raising the level of unemployment. It is on this note that the government in conjunction with its agencies tends to introduce skills acquisition programme in order to correct this anomaly and also ensure that these newly graduated students become self-reliant and prepare for them a future which will in turn devoid the economy of miscreants.</p> <p>Experience over the years has revealed that seventy percent of these graduates end up roaming about the streets as a result of lack of job opportunities. The unemployment rate in the country (Nigeria) keeps escalating as each year comes by as a result of continuous injection of graduates who have no jobs to do at the end of the day. This situation has become so pathetic because job seekers/applicants end up going back to their aged parents who have invested in them, hoping that someday, they will get back the dividends of their investments but all to no avail. This cankerworm (unemployment) which has eaten deep into the fabric of the society must be reversed to avoid national crisis. Entrepreneurship education is just becoming a popular course in most of the Nigerian higher institutions as it was introduced in 2006 effective from 2007/2008 academic sessions and this has made the acquisition of relevant skills for employment and self-employability more theoretical than practical. This calls for critical survey of entrepreneurship education as the key to solving graduate unemployment (Oyebola, 2010). Entrepreneurship skill acquisition programme initiated by the National Youth Service Corps in its activities as also avail the newly admitted youth Corpers the opportunity to partake in diverse entrepreneurial skill acquisition programmes during their first three weeks at the camp. This study will empirically examine the effect of skill acquisition on entrepreneurship development among Nasarawa State University, Nigeria with a view to providing recommendations that will improve graduate entrepreneurship and hence reduce the level of graduate unemployment rate in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The study has both general objective and specific objectives.

Four research questions were posed to guide the study. Survey research design was used for the study. The population for this study consisted of 151 (one hundred and fifty-one) students of Social Studies Unit of the Department of Arts and Social Science Education, Ebonyi State University. There was no sampling since the population was sizeable enough to be surveyed. Based on the analysis of the data collected for the study, results showed amongst others that; Environmental factors, such as Favourable government policy, rules and regulations influence students attitude towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki. Based on the findings, recommendations were made that: Lecturers teaching entrepreneurship education need to be more specific on the sources of finance available to students and how exactly they can access these funds.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Background to the Study</p> <p>In every society, whether developed, developing or underdeveloped, education has been considered as a viable tool for the preservation of culture and a means for achieving personal and national emancipation. Every society has a goal that it pursues and the need of a society or nation at one point or the other determines the type of education it adopts. In this light, Okoli (2011) stated that every society whether civilized or primitive, evolves means of satisfying its needs and transmitting its culture to the younger ones. Okoli (2011) further stated that every society evolves its own education necessary at a particular point in time. The primary goal of any nation is the economic empowerment of its citizens. Education must then be tailored according to the need of the nation/society and not according to some international prescription. </p> <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning. Knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits of a group of people are transferred to other people, through storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, or research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators. According to Hub (2012), education in the largest sense is any act or experience that has a formative effect on the mind, character or physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated knowledge, skills and values from one generation to another (Hub, 2012).</p> <p>The term Education has been derived from two Latin words Educare (Educere) and Educatum. Educare means to train or mould. It again means to bring up or to lead out or to draw out, propulsion from inward to outward. The term Educatum denotes the act of teaching. It throws light on the principles and practice of teaching. The term Educare or Educere mainly indicates development of the latent faculties of the child. But child does not know these possibilities. It is the educator or the teacher who can know these and take appropriate methods to develop those powers. </p> <p>Shane (2003) described entrepreneurship as the act of being an entrepreneur. According to Shane, the word entrepreneur can be taken to mean an individual who undertakes innovations, finance and business acumen in an effort to transform innovations into economic goods and the result of one effort in entrepreneurship may be the creation of a new organisation or revitalising an existing organisation in response to a perceived opportunity. Also Isaacs, Visser, Friedrich and Brijal (2007) defined entrepreneurship education as the purposeful intervention by an instructor in the life of a learner, to impart entrepreneurial qualities and skills to enable the learner to survive in the business world. Alberti, Sciascia and Poli (2004) defined entrepreneurship education as the structured and formal transmission of entrepreneurial competencies, which in other words, refers to the skills, concepts and mental awareness used by individuals during the process of starting and developing developing their growth oriented ventures.</p> <p>Entrepreneurship education at the tertiary level can play a significant role in changing views of students towards self-employment and acquire necessary skills to manage a business, thus preparing them for self-employment in the labour market (Saeid, Mohammad, Harm, and Martin, 2010). Entrepreneurship education tries to prepare people, particularly youth, to be responsible, take risks, manage the business and learn from the outcomes by immersing them in real life learning experiences.</p> <p>Attitudes play a vital role in the life of a successful entrepreneur. As they build their new ventures, they are bound to overcome hurdles, solve problems, and complete the job. They are disciplined, tenacious, and persistent, they are able to commit and recommit quickly, and they are not intimidated by challenges (Timmons and Spinelli, 2009). Therefore, students may form and implement an Entrepreneurial action in anticipation of outcome. When the perceived outcome is poor or pessimistic, they tend to develop negative attitude. Reverse is the case when they perceived the outcome to be positive or optimistic, they tend to develop and retain positive attitude towards the attitude Entrepreneurship Education.</p> <p>Students will have a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship education if they perceive that there are environmental possibilities (Kirby, 2006). This means that the entrepreneurial intention of a student can be affected by perceived environmental factors. Accordingly, if the perceived environment is favorable to development of entrepreneurship; entrepreneurial intention of students will be enhanced, and conversely, if the perceived environment is not favorable to the development of entrepreneurship, the students attitude towards entrepreneurship education will be reduced. According to Thurik and Uhlaner (2002), there are several environmental factors that can influence potential entrepreneurship. Among these factors are: the influence of government policy, social norm and Access to Finance on the entrepreneurial intention.</p> <p>Demographic characteristics also influence students attitude towards entrepreneurship education. A student is most likely to be influenced by a particular group of individuals such as family members, friends, peers, and others close ones in ones life. For example, people who grow up around a society or family that runs business or where family business is practiced are likely to learn and model entrepreneurial tendency, perceiving it to be feasible, more socially desirable and rewarding than formal employment in an established organization (Guyo,  2013). Thus, this will increase their interest on entrepreneurship education. Family background is important variable that has been considered to contribute to the attitude of students towards entrepreneurship education. Generally, individuals who have families with business tend to show higher attitude towards entrepreneurship education than those families that dont have business undertakings (Guyo, 2013).</p> <p>A student may have a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship education because of own competency and self-efficacy but may not make the transition into entrepreneurship because of a lack of intention (Krueger, 2000). Entrepreneurial self-efficacy refers to the strength of a students  belief that he or she will or will not be capable of successfully performing the roles and tasks of an entrepreneur (Chen etal.,2008). This influences their attitude towards entrepreneurship education. According to RauchandFrese (2007), entrepreneurial self-efficacy for starting a new business is a crucial factor in increasing the likelihood of business start-up activity. Every individual who has a high interest in entrepreneurship will be able to stand alone, dare to take decisions and implement the goals to be achieved in its sole discretion. It is said that the higher the self-efficacy, the higher the interest in entrepreneurship education (Bryant, 2006). According to Edelman and Manolova (2008), a variety of learning experiences can be used to expose students to real-world situations. By doing so, it is expected that the students self-efficacy can gradually increase, which is possible as students gain experience by developing complex skills (Iro-Idoro and Iro-Idoro,  2015). A persons self-efficacy towards a task would influence the decisions to take on that task, the amount of effort used on the task and the persistence in accomplishing that task.</p> <p>The environment a student finds himself/herself has influence on their attitude towards entrepreneurship education. According to Arenuis and Minnit (2005), new pursuit creation and entrepreneurial choice never happen in a vacuum, yet they are influenced by environment in which they were occurred (Chell and Baines, 2000). Students  will have positive attitude towards entrepreneurship education in the event that they see that there are natural potential outcomes (Kirby, 2006). This implies the entrepreneurial aim of a student can be influenced by perceived environmental factors. Likewise, if the apparent environment is great to improvement of business enterprise; entrepreneurial aim of students will be increased, and on the other hand, if the apparent environment is not ideal to the advancement of business, the students state of mind towards entrepreneurship education will be reduced. As indicated by Thurik and Uhlaner (2002), there are a few natural variables that can impact potential entrepreneurship. Among these variables are: the influence of government policy, social norm and Access to Finance on the entrepreneurial intention.</p> <p>Statement of the Problem</p> <p>The number of undergraduate students graduating from Public and Private Higher Education institutions in Nigeria is increasing from time to time, and the trend will continue as per the vision of higher education institutions of the country. This number is also swelling with the expansion of new universities and development of intake capacity of the older universities in the country. In due time, educated human resource supply would be in excess of demand of the public and private organizations. Undoubtedly, this would result in unemployment problem among students unless they seriously consider self employment as their career option. Therefore, entrepreneurship is the promising career option for students.</p> <p>That is why the Nigerian government through the National Universities Commission made it compulsory on every undergraduate student to offer entrepreneurship education course as a step towards stimulating active and productive entrepreneurial activities in the country. It is believed, would help in developing students attitude and interest in entrepreneurship. This effort however is being seriously threatened as some students are still not having favourable attitude and keen interest towards entrepreneurship education. This leads to situation where students are not equipped with the desirable skills and competencies required for job creation and becoming entrepreneurs (Ekpoh and Edet, 2011). This study filled this gap in the literature by investigating attitudes of undergraduates of Social Studies Unit towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki</p> <p>Purpose of the Study</p> <p>        The general purpose of the study focused on attitudes of undergraduates of Social Studies Unit towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki. Specifically, the study designed to:</p> <p>1.   Find out how self-efficacy influences students attitude towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki.</p> <p>2.   Ascertain how school environment influences students attitude towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki.</p> <p>3.   Examine how demographic characteristics of students influence students attitude towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki.</p> <p>4.   Determine how the teaching of entrepreneurship curriculum influence students attitude towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki.</p> <p>Significance of the Study</p> <p>This study would have the potential to contribute to at least the following aspects. First and foremost, this study will contribute a lot to the university in order to thoroughly understand its students towards self employment intension and take a remedy/action in creating entrepreneurial environment which stimulate students to become self employed/entrepreneurs since universities are expected to incubate entrepreneurs rather than institutions to produce those who are waiting jobs/employment opportunities from government, non government organizations. Consequently, the university has to play its role in the fulfillment of the countrys Millennium Development Goal (MDG). </p> <p>Also, the university undergraduates will be benefited from the study by getting some insights regarding the importance of self-employment/entrepreneurship.</p> <p>        Parents will also benefit from the findings of this study, in the sense that they will be better informed on the importance of being entrepreneurial role model to their wards in order to encourage them to have positive attitude towards entrepreneurship education.</p> <p>Scope of the Study</p> <p>This study aims at assessing attitudes of potential university graduates to entrepreneurship education. in addition, the study seeks to explore how environment influences students attitude towards entrepreneurship education; how students self-efficacy influence their attitude towards entrepreneurship education; how demographic characteristics of students influence students attitude towards entrepreneurship education and influence of entrepreneurship curriculum at the university influence students attitude towards entrepreneurship education.</p> <p>Research Questions</p> <p>        The following research questions were formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>1.   How would self-efficacy influences students attitude towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki?</p> <p>2.   How would school environment influence students attitude towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki?</p> <p>3.   How would demographic characteristics of students influence students attitude towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki?</p> <p>4.   How would the teaching of entrepreneurship curriculum influence students attitude towards entrepreneurship education in Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki.</p>\n\nATTITUDES OF UNDERGRADUATES OF SOCIAL STUDIES UNIT TOWARDS ENTREPRENEURSHIP<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ATTITUDES OF UNDERGRADUATES OF SOCIAL STUDIES UNIT TOWARDS ENTREPRENEURSHIP", "id": 80}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Unemployment has been a major issue in the Nigerian economy since the mid-1980s. Consequently, the Federal government adopted several strategies and policies towards entrepreneurial development in Nigeria to combat the unemployment problem. All over the world, entrepreneurship has been adjudged to have the capacity to generate employment. Indeed, extant literature discloses that entrepreneurship has been linked with the creation of self-employment. This notwithstanding, literature reveal that only limited studies have been conducted on entrepreneurship in developing economies, especially Nigeria, hence the need for further research. Hence, this study investigated entrepreneurial development and employment creation in Oyo State, Nigeria. The study sought specifically to assess the capacity of small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) to generate employment in Oyo State.</p> <p>The study adopted a survey research design. The population of the study was all the 4,000 registered SMEs in Oyo State, provided by the National Association of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises. Stratified random sampling technique was utilised to select sixteen out of thirty-three local government areas in Oyo State as well as the sample size of 400 SMEs. The choice of the study area was based on size and concentration of SMEs. The research instrument was a self-developed and validated questionnaire. The reliability test of the major variables in the questionnaire yielded the following Cronbach’s alpha coefficients: Self Employment=0.86, Business Partnership=0.68, Business Inheritance=0.74, Government Employment Training Programme=0.67 and Entrepreneurship Development=0.93. A total of 455 copies of the questionnaire were administered with a response rate of 87.9%. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential (multiple regression) statistics.</p> <p>Findings revealed that there was a significant relationship between self-employment and acquisition of vocational skills (R2 =0.763; p=0.000). There was also a significant relationship between business partnership formation and acquisition of managerial skills (R2=0.754; p=0.001).Similarly, there was a significant relationship between family business formation and acquisition of technical skills through inheriting enterprises (R2=0.713; p=0.002). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between government employment training programme and self-employment (R2=0.693; p=0.000). In addition, among the SMEs in Oyo State, bakery (125) business center (76), petty trading (63) and barbing (61) generated more employment opportunities than others.</p> <p>The study concluded that vocational skills and government training created employment opportunities through the SMEs in Oyo State, Nigeria. Also, formation of business organizations enhanced the acquisition of managerial and technical skills. The study recommended that government and SMEs should focus on the establishment of enterprises that generate employment most. In addition, government should provide adequate training for entrepreneurs while entrepreneurs in turn should provide adequate and continuous training for employees to enhance their technical skills.</p>\n\nENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT CREATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT CREATION", "id": 81}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Transforming enormous ideas into economic opportunities is the decisive issue of entrepreneurship. History shows that economic progress has been significantly advanced by pragmatic people who are entrepreneurial and innovative, able to exploit opportunities and willing to take risks. The role of entrepreneurship and an entrepreneurial culture in economic and social development has often been underestimated. Over the years, however, it has become increasingly apparent that entrepreneurship indeed contributes to economic development. Nevertheless, the significant numbers of enterprises were owned by men. In other words, it was not common to see womenowned businesses worldwide especially in developing countries like India. The idea and practice of women entrepreneurship is a recent phenomenon. Until the 1980’s little was known about women entrepreneurship both in practice and research, which made its focus entirely on men. Scientific discourse about women’s entrepreneurship and women owned and run organizations is just the development of 1980s. Even though we observe a number of women entrepreneurs in the business, recent studies show that most of them are found in Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs).</p> <p>Nigerian Women have been engaged in entrepreneurial activities for many centuries (Abiona; 2011), however their contributions have consistently gone unacknowledged. They have produced and bartered goods and exchanged services both in their local communities and surrounding markets (Abiona; 2011). And more often than not, family survival has often depended on women’s enterprising spirit. Women entrepreneurs have an important and increasing contribution to make to their immediate family budget and to the prosperity of the community. This study identifies a number of serious issues and implications for women entrepreneurs’ in both the rural and urban regions of Nigeria. This definition will hence be utilized in relation to the role played by Nigerian women as entrepreneurs’ and how these entrepreneurial skills have played out towards the move from oil dependency in the Nigerian region.</p> <p>Also, women have been found to generate less sales turnover relative to men, even in same industry comparisons (Loscocco and Robinson 1991). For example in Nigeria in spite of the support and incentive programs to micro business, Akabueze, (2002) briefly stated that it would seem reasonable to suppose that small businesses would grow and boom, but the speed of business breakdown continues to raise because of the shortcomings influencing business performance which are: inadequate financial resources, poor location, insufficient management experience, poor laws and regulations, general economic situation, together with critical factors such as poor infrastructure, little demand for products and services, corruption, and poverty. 2 Others include: shortage of raw materials, handicap in obtaining finance, inadequate competent and motivated personnel, lack of ability to control costs and cheap foreign products dumped in the market Notwithstanding the intrinsic problems related to the growth of micro - scale businesses, women entrepreneurs are increasingly venturing into ownership of small-scale enterprises either on their own or in partnership with male entrepreneurs (ILO 2005). This has been made possible primarily because of ease of entry, limited access to other enterprises and lack of employment opportunities in formal sector of the economy. In addition, given the expansion of entrepreneurship amongst women, understanding the social, cultural and economic factors influencing their success is of vital importance.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In the mid-80s, the ‘Nigerian’ Structural Adjustment Program was initiated, and the consequences of this policy affected men and women differently. It changed access to specific forms and categories of work, it reduced government services; devaluation, loss of jobs, loss of purchasing power, and threats to not only livelihood but also life (Mustapha; 2016). As a result Women in Nigeria began working towards addressing their own needs, priorities; and also making their own economic decisions (Mrs. Nkechi Florence Okpara, Development Education Centre: 1995) with the hope of reflecting their economic and social importance.</p> <p>Whilst without a doubt the economic impact of women is substantial, we still lack a reliable picture, describing in detail that specific impact. Recent efforts initiated by the OECD (1997, 2000) are responses to this lack of knowledge and have focused the attention of policy makers and researchers on this important topic. In order to effectively and efficiently address this topic, policy makers need more knowledge about women entrepreneurs. The aim of this study is to enhance knowledge about the causes of poor performance among women entrepreneurs. In addition, women in entrepreneurship has been largely neglected both in society in general and in the social sciences (Brush &amp; Hisrich, 1999). Not only have women lower participation rate in entrepreneurship than men but they also generally choose to start and manage firms in different industries than men tend to do (Franco &amp; Winqvist, 2002; Reynolds &amp; White, 1997).</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to find out the factors affecting performance of women entrepreneur in Nigeria, specifically the study intends to:</p> <p>1.     Find out the factors affecting the performance of women entrepreneurs in Nigeria</p> <p>2.     Analyze the effect of women entrepreneurs on the growth of Nigeria economy</p> <p>3.     Examines way of empowering women to become entrepreneur</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.     Are there factors affecting the performance of women entrepreneurs in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.     Is there any effect of women entrepreneurs on the growth of Nigeria economy?</p> <p>3.     What are the ways of empowering women to become entrepreneur?</p> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho: </strong>there is no effect of women entrepreneurs on the growth of Nigeria economy</p> <p><strong>Hi:</strong> there is no effect of women entrepreneurs on the growth of Nigeria economy</p> <p><strong>1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is of immense significance to women entrepreneurs as it has outline factors influencing the performance women entrepreneurial ventures. The study will be useful to alleviate the problems that women entrepreneurs face in Nigeria and other parts of world. To researchers and academicians, the study will be a supply reference material for future researchers on other related topics. In addition it will help other academicians who undertake research on related topics. The study covers a very essential area in economic development and hence it will be of importance since it will provide information that can be used to formulate policy. The financial institutions will come up with products which are tailor made to fit into woman financial needs. In addition through the financial institutions corporate social responsibilities they will factor in woman groups.</p> <p><strong>1.7     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will covered women entrepreneur in Lagos state. There are different issues that will be researched in relation to women entrepreneurs. But, this study will be delimited to the key socio-cultural, financial accessibility, level of entrepreneurial training and domestic commitment on the performance of women entrepreneurs in SMEs. In addition, the study focuses only on assessing the major personal and organizational characteristics of women entrepreneurs in MSEs to check whether these characteristics affect their performance.</p> <p><strong>1.8     DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Finance for the general research work will be a challenge during the course of study. Correspondents also might not be able to complete or willing to submit the questionnaires given to them. </p> <p>However, it is believed that these constraints will be worked on by making the best use of the available materials and spending more than the necessary time in the research work. Therefore, it is strongly believed that despite these constraint, its effect on this research report will be minimal, thus, making the objective and significance of the study achievable.</p> <p><strong>1.9     DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Women entrepreneur: women entrepreneurs are those women who think of a business enterprise, initiate it, organize and combine the factors of production, operate the enterprise and undertake risks and handle economic uncertainty involved in running a business enterprise.</p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF FACTORS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF FACTORS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN NIGERIA", "id": 82}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1         BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the contemporary economic development due to the significant role they play in the sustainability of the world economic development (Carter and Tamayo, 2017; Wattana pruttipaisan, 2002). SMEs account for more than 90 percent of businesses, contribute to more than 50 percent of employment and over 50 percent of gross domestic products (GDP) in the world (Kessey, 2014). In Africa, the commonest business entities are SMEs. The enterprises contribute significantly to the provision of employment, the formation of capital, economic viability and poverty alleviation among others (Ganyaupfu, 2013). Today, Africa’s growing economy sees SMEs as the mechanism for achieving growth and excellence (Roldan, 2015). The sector provides substantial employment and stimulates economic growth. For example, in Ghana, the sector constitutes 92 percent of businesses in the country (Steel and Webster, 1991). In South Africa, Ganyaupfu, (2013) confirmed that 91 percent of all the registered business entities fall under SMEs and constituting about 52 to 57 percent of the country‟s GDP. However, in Nigeria, a number challenges overwhelmed the country‟s business milieu, which renders the environment not only difficult for business but resulting to the increasing failure of SMEs in the country. Studies established that 85 percent of businesses in the country do not survive beyond the first five years of their establishment (Ogboru, 2005; Olu and Haynes, 2006; Ariyo, 2008). Moreover, even the little percentage that manages to sustain beyond five years, collapse between sixth to tenth years of their existence which leaves only around 5 to 10 percent of the SMEs in business (Onugu, 2005). Despite the effort and contribution of the Nigerian government to the development of SMEs, yet the input of the enterprises including micro businesses to the country‟s exportation is as low as 7.27 percent (SMEDAN, 2013). The lack of entrepreneurial competencies has been identified as the leading cause of business failure in the country (Inyang and Enuoh, 2009). Therefore, the need for entrepreneurial competency become necessary as it provides practical solutions to the mystery of business downfall (Sánchez, 2013).</p> <p>Competency of the entrepreneurs is one of the significant determining factors for success, performance and growth or failure of business operation (Kiggundu, 2002; Brinckmann, 2008; Mitchelmore and Rowley, 2013). Furthermore, female Entrepreneurs mostly operate small-scaled type of businesses which requires the businesses to depend mainly on the competencies of the owner. Thus, understanding the nature of such competencies in the context of female Entrepreneurs is very important (Mitchelmore and Rowley, 2010; Mitchelmore et al. 2008).</p> <p>Competencies as the characteristics of entrepreneurs that differentiate excellent from average or poor entrepreneurial performance are a cluster of knowledge, behaviours, skills and abilities (Wu, 2011; Athey and Orth, 1999). Similarly, Man, Lau, and Chan, (2002) view entrepreneurial competencies as nothing but a bunch of high-level characteristics which includes knowledge, skills and personality traits. Entrepreneurial competencies lead enterprises to achieve sustainable competitive advantage and eventually result in the achievement of business success and growth (Man et al., 2002). Tehseen and Ramayah, (2015) stressed the need for the understanding of the significance of entrepreneurial competencies more especially in the developing economies because entrepreneurs‟ competencies are vital for business survival, performance and success. However, the measurement of entrepreneurial competencies varies depending on the context, prediction and assumption (Mitchelmore and Rowley, 2010). Therefore, in the Nigerian business milieu, as established by numerous scholars, the leading competencies related obstacles that result in poor performance and failure of businesses in the country are; lack or ineffective innovation, unfavourable marketing strategies, lack of distinctive entrepreneurial traits (Duru, 2011; Eneh, 2010; Onugu, 2005; Adeoti, and Adeoti, 2005; Siyanbola et al., 2012).</p> <p>The principal aim of the study is therefore to examine the relationship between the entrepreneurial competencies and business success in SME’s in different settings within the same country.</p> <p><strong>1.2           STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Even with the fact that SME’s in all sectors of the economy; they are dominant in trade (54%) followed by services (34%). Micro and small enterprises are critical for supporting livelihoods as well as overall prosperity and progress. They create employment at relatively low levels of investment per job; utilize and add value to local resources; foster equitable income distribution; and are better positioned to meet local needs in small markets. The technologies used by them are easier to acquire, transfer and adopt even for people with little education and training. They have the potential to compliment large enterprises through partnerships and subcontracting relationships. Micro and small enterprises also serve as training ground for entrepreneurship managerial development (Olomi, 2006).</p> <p>Lots of problems makes it very difficult for SME’s to exploit the existing potentials for further employment and wealth creation. One of the most serious impediments is the competency of the entrepreneur, in terms of the attitudes, motivation, exposure, skills and experiences. This capacity limitation is exacerbated by the effects of other problems including a cumbersome regulatory framework, limited access to finance and working premises. At the same time, entrepreneurship development are underdeveloped and not readily available or affordable to SME’s.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to find out the role of entrepreneurial competencies on the success of SME in Nigeria, specifically the study intends to;</p> <p>1.     Find out how competence entrepreneurs are in terms of skills and experience</p> <p>2.     Analyze the effect of entrepreneurial competencies on the success of SMEs in Nigeria</p> <p>3.     Examine the challenges of SMEs in Nigeria </p> <p><strong>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.     How competence are entrepreneurs in Nigeria in terms of skills and experience?</p> <p>2.     Is there any significant effect of entrepreneurial competencies on the success of SMEs in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.     What are the challenges of SMEs in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho: </strong>there is no significant effect of entrepreneurial competencies on the success of SMEs in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>Hi:</strong> there is a significant effect of entrepreneurial competencies on the success of SMEs in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study aims to address the extent to which entrepreneurial attributes lead to business success.

In recent years, increased unemployment rate has affected many young school leavers who fall within the working age but have been denied job opportunities. Graduate unemployment in the words of Dabalen et al (2000), accounted for about 32% of the unemployed labor force between 1992 and 1997. This has compelled the Nigerian government as far back as the 1960s to start implementing programmes aimed at tackling the unemployment situation in the country. Providing employment was made one of the cardinal objectives of the first developmental plan; an objective aimed at not just creating employment but to also to train people in skills that will meet the challenges of an ever dynamic economy. The above was indeed the catalyst for the establishment of a number of employment programmes such as the National Directorate of Employment (NDE), Family Economic and Advancement Programme (FEAP), Poverty Alleviation Programme (PAP), National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP), National Economic Empowerment and Development Scheme (NEEDS) and many other similar programmes funded by various stakeholders like state governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international organizations like the World Bank and the United Nations.</p> <p>Unemployment is one the developmental problems facing every developing economy in the 21st century. Agu (2008) pointed out that there has been an exponential increase in youth unemployment in the country. In his words, youth unemployment in the country has caused serious problems that past and successive administrations have not been able to find a lasting solution. Although successive governments in Nigeria since independence have implemented several programmes to address the problem of youth unemployment and poverty, the assessment of the various contributions of such programmes remains scanty compared to the huge amount of resources committed to them (Egware, 1997). In the words of Yakubu (2010), youth employment and poverty alleviation programmes implemented in the last few decades have failed to confront the multidimensionality of poverty as most of these programmes were unable to respond to the exact needs of the poor. Programmes such as the NDE, FEAP, Better Life Programme, NAPEP, NEEDS have all been affected by common problems; such as: inadequate funding, project duplication, gross inefficiency, poor coordination of programmes, corruption, lack of transparency </p> <p>Nigeria’s current unemployment situation is erratic and falls short of expectations, such that a large percentage of educated, able and qualified citizens cannot secure paid employment (Omotosho, 2009). This indicates that Nigeria over the years has steadily crumbled from its extremely resilient and esteemed position among developing nations (Ipaye, 2008). One of the major concerns of various administrations in Nigeria is the growing rate unemployment in the country and it has consistently formed part of the macroeconomic objectives of the government for the past decades (Omotosho, 2009). According to the World Bank Report (2003), the growing trend of employment and productivity of the Asian Tigers and Japan is responsible for their enviable and brilliant economic performance. Evidently, the absence of the necessary framework to enhance employment and productivity level in Nigeria is the sole cause of the retarded nature of Nigeria, the acclaimed giant of Africa. The trend and problem of unemployment in Nigeria remain obstinate with a tendency of growing geometrically to the alarming rate of 3 million unemployed youth annually (Adelodun, 2006). The trend of unemployment in Nigeria has a devastating effect on the youths from an extensive gamut of socioeconomic clusters, both the high and less educated, even though it has mainly troubled a sizeable portion of youths from less privilege backgrounds (Ipaye, 2008). According to Adebayo and Ogunrinola, (2006), unemployment trend in Nigeria touches the job seekers within the ages of 20 – 24 and 25 – 44 years more while there is fewer prevalence of unemployment within the ages of 15 – 19, 55 – 59 and 65 years and above. The rate of open unemployment was 12% in March 2005; it rose to 19.7% in March 2009 while the rate of underemployment hovered around 19% in 1998 (National Bureau of Statistics, 2010). From this point of view, it is apparent that unemployment, particularly the unemployment of young graduates, hinders Nigeria’s progress in so many ways. Aside from economic issue, it also creates eminent danger for political stability of our dear country (Ipaye, 2008). Consequently, massive youth unemployment as it is presently recorded in Nigeria portend a serious multifaceted problems and the threat of unemployment has gradually been acknowledged as a pressing challenges facing Nigeria (Ipaye, 2008, Udu &amp; Ugu, 2005). According to Umaru and Zubairu (2011), unemployment has been recognized as one of the major impediments to social-economic growth in most developing countries. It reduces the aggregate output of the economy and results in underutilization of human resources. The need to avert the negative effects of unemployment has made the tackling of unemployment problems of feature very prominently in the development objective of developing countries (Omotor &amp; Gbosi 2006). The issue of real output and employment growth in developing nations is a sine qua non for poverty reduction and a more equitable income distribution (Fofana, 2001). Omotor and Gbosi (2006) noted that the seriousness and nature of unemployment in Nigeria is relatively high when placed on the same pedestal with those of other African countries. According to them, in absolute terms; it is estimated that there are presently about 22 million youths unemployed in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Unemployment is one of the serious socio-economic problem in Nigeria and is really a tragic condition that requires urgent and proactive attention. Indeed, it is alarming and worrisome to observe that Nigeria’s graduates who are educated, able and willing to work cannot find a job. The situation is becoming hopeless, as the rate of unemployment keeps rising without any proactive attempt to curb the menace (Kayode, Samuel &amp; Silas, 2014). A cursory look at the state of the nation, portend more danger with declining likelihoods of young graduates become gainfully employed; going with the trend of events in the country, most especially, the falling oil prices, economic recession, insurgency in the Northern parts of the country among other factors. As a matter of fact, unemployment is one of the major developmental challenges facing Nigeria at the moment. (Obadan and Odusola (2010) have found that the prevalence of unemployment in Nigeria, especially in this 21st century, is getting deeper and more pathetic, spiteful through all faces of age groups, educational level, and geographical spread. The challenges of lingering youth unemployment are very obvious in Nigeria because every year thousands of graduates are turnout for whom there are no jobs opportunity (Emeka, 2011). Nigerian labor markets are beleaguered with youth hawkers who typically would have found beneficial employment in some organizations (Echebiri, 2005; Uwoma, 2006). Given the large percentage of unemployed youths, the trend of unemployment is capable of destabilizing peace as they portend a serious threat in view of nascent democracy and blatant disregard for party politics (Adepegba, 2011).</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to find out the perspectives of youth on way out of unemployment issue in Nigeria, specifically the study intends to:</p> <p>1.     Find out the causes of unemployment in Nigeria</p> <p>2.     Analyze the effects of youth unemployment on Nigeria</p> <p>3.     Find out the perspective of youths on way out on unemployment in Nigeria</p> <p>4.     Proffer solution to the problem of youth unemployment in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.     What are the causes of unemployment in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.     Is there any significant effects of youth unemployment on Nigeria?</p> <p>3.     What is the perspective of youths on way out on unemployment in Nigeria?</p> <p>4.     What is the solution to the problem of youth unemployment in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho: </strong>there is no significant effects of youth unemployment on Nigeria</p> <p><strong>Hi:</strong> there is no significant effects of youth unemployment on Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Unemployment in Nigeria has been an issue of interest.

Understanding of consumers is the consumption process provides a number of benefits. These benefits include assisting the manager in decision making and providing the marketing research with a theoretical base from which to analyses consumers in making better purchase decision.</p> <p>The study of consumer can help to understand more about psychological, sociological and economics factors that influence human behavior. A general knowledge of consumer behaviors also has personal value. It can help people to become better consumers by informing them of the way in which they and others go about their consumption activities. In addition it can assist consumers in the buying process by informing them about some of the strategies used by companies to market their products (Foxall &amp; Goldsmith, 1994).</p> <p>The field of consumer behavior explores why people make certain purchasing decisions, what products and services they buy, where they buy them, how they use them, the frequency with which they purchase them, and the consumer decision process in action. In this context, consumer behavior has been defined as the activities of people engaged in actual or potential use of market items-whether products, services, retail environment, or ideas (Berkman &amp; Gilson, 1978).</p> <p>One of the important means of dissemination for information is word of mouth. Word of mouth both negative and positive can have a profound impact on consumer behavior. If utilized correctly, it can go a long way to promote products or service and build a perception created through this method can persist for a long time and adversely effect to the marketing. Therefore the effect of word of mouth can be harsh as well as beneficial (Solomon, 1996). Word-of-Mouth Marketing progress align advertising campaign messaging and product releases with local market influencers, Trendsetters, and Tastemakers to craft mass opinion and purchase behavior.</p> <p>Effective word of mouth marketing campaign connects with Influencers and Trendsetters who initiate consumer trends (e.g. Fashion trend, automobile purchase trends, consumer product trends, entertainment trends, and beverage consumption trends) that are followed by mainstream consumption trends) that are followed by mainstream consumers. Consumers value word-of-mouth twice as much as they value advertising. In a world in which we all are bombarded with advertising all day (and all night), what is the first thing we usually do to learn more about a business, a restaurant for example? We try to find someone we know who has been there, or someone who knows someone who’s been there. It’s true. Word of mouth does have more credibility than advertisers can even imagine, much less conjure up. And yet word of mouth suffers from the same virtue that makes it so strong. It is personal and therefore, limited in its reach (Pusateri, 1999).</p> <p>For companies to attain commercial success, it is im­portant that managers understand consumer behav­iour. The relationship between consumer behaviour and marketing strategy is emphasised because the suc­cess of companies’ marketing strategies depends upon managers’ understandings of consumer behaviour (understanding of consumer behaviour is especially important during a recession – see Kotler and Caslione (2009). Consumer buying decisions indicate how well the company’s marketing strategy fits market demand. Thus, marketing begins and ends with the consumer.</p> <p>The study of customer behaviour is based on con­sumer buying behaviour, with the customer playing three distinct roles: user, payer and buyer. Research has shown that consumer behaviour is difficult to predict, even for experts in the field (Armstrong &amp; Scott, 1991). Con­sumer behaviour involves the psychological processes that consumers go through in recognising their needs, finding ways to solve these needs, making purchase de­cisions (e.g., whether to purchase a product and, if so, which brand and where), interpret information, make plans, and implement these plans (e.g., by engaging in comparison shopping or actually purchasing a product).</p> <p>Consumer buying behavior refers to the selection, purchase and consumption of goods and services for the satisfaction of their wants. There are different processes involved in the consumer behavior. Many factors, specificities and characteristics influence the individual in what he is and the consumer in his decision making process, shopping habits, purchasing behavior, the brands he buys or the retailers he goes. A purchase decision is the result of each and every one of these factors. Initially the consumer tries to find what commodities he would like to consume, then he selects only those commodities that promise greater utility. </p> <p>After selecting the commodities, the consumer makes an estimate of the available money which he can spend. Lastly, the consumer analyzes the prevailing prices of commodities and takes the decision about the commodities he should consume. Meanwhile, there are various other factors influencing the purchases of consumer such as social, cultural, economic, personal and psychological. </p> <p>Consumer behaviour research attempts to understand the buyer decision-making process, both individually and collectively. It studies individual consumer characteristics such as demographics and behavioural variables in an attempt to understand people’s wants. Consumer behaviour research allows for improved understanding and forecasting concerning not only the subject of purchases but also purchasing motives and purchasing frequency (Schiffman &amp; Kanuk, 2007).</p> <p>One of the current fundamental assumptions in consumer behaviour research is that individuals often purchase products for their subjectively perceived values rather than their primary functions (Stávková, Stejskal &amp; Toufarova, 2008). This does not mean that the products’ basic functions are not important, but that the contemporary role of a product is more than its basic use-value (Solomon, 2004). Frequently, consumers do not rate products according to their core attributes (i.e., the primary utility they provide) but, above all, according to the so-called real product (i.e., a particular products’ qualities) and the extended product, which represents the set of intangible factors that confer a desired perceived advantage on the consumer – including image, consultancy, and after-sale service (Foret &amp; Procházka, 2007).</p> <p>The majority of developed countries have attained their objectives by relying on domestic production and also through government campaigns in support of the utilization of local goods. The intensity of dedication to the consumption of local products depends greatly the extent on ethnocentrism (Sciffman &amp; Kanuk 2007). Therefore, this study focuses on the factors influencing consumer buying behavior on household products in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The research problem can be stated as finding out the right and suitable marketing strategy to be adopted by organization producing households products to increase the local consumption of their locally made products.</p> <p>In Africa, Nigeria is one of the developing countries where large amounts of products from other countries are imported each year and alcoholic beverages are not an exception. This has exposed many Nigerian to alternative preference for domestic made products and foreign products. The great variety of goods and services from other countries has made many consumers to patronize imported products. However, many of the local industry are thriving hard to survive in today’s turbulent Nigerian market.</p> <p>As more companies consider the value of expansion in Africa, the need to understand the African consumer is becoming a priority (Hatch, Becker &amp; van Zyl, 2011). However, there is currently very little research that has been conducted regarding the factors that impact the consumer decision-making process in Africa. </p> <p>It has been assumed that African companies are not as mature in their analysis and assessment of their consumer base, when compared to companies in developed countries. Maturity in this context can be defined as having progressed to a state of understanding the required consumer and consumer base. Companies are not mature largely due to their inherent composition, and also because of the consumers that they serve. Much of Africa’s markets are also immature, with a large portion of purchasing happening in open markets. It is estimated that approximately 80% of total consumer purchasing happens in open markets in Nigeria, which is one of Africa’s largest economies (CNBC Africa, 2014). These problems make it glaring that there is a need to carry out a study on the factors influencing consumer buying behavior on household products in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY   </strong></p> <p>The general objective of this study is to examine the factors influencing consumer buying behavior on household products in Nigeria.
