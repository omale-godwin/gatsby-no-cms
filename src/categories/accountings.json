The study employed the survey design and the purposive sampling technique to select 450 manufacturing companies staffs. A well-constructed questionnaire, which was adjudged valid and reliable, was used for collection of data from the respondents. The data obtained through the administration of the questionnaires was analyzed using the Pearson correlation analysis.\n\nThe study revealed that: Budgeting has significant effect on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria. Cost control has significant impact on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria. Capacity utilization has significant effect on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria. Brand Awareness has significant impact on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria. Labor Turnover Rate has significant effect on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe study concluded that strategic planning has significant effect on performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria. The study further recommends that; Manufacturing companies should budget on what matters to enable on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria. Cost Control should always be utilized to initiate performance in manufacturing companies. Investment Appraisal should be seen as necessity. Manufacturing companies should always see a to have continuous sales. Tangible Assets of Manufacturing companies should always be put in proper records historically. Manufacturing companies in Nigeria needs an urgent reappraisal. Manufacturing companies must become contextually relevant to consumers, government and communities. The Manufacturing companies needs to develop good operational principles.  The Manufacturing companies needs to develop holistically.\n\n \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1.         Background to the study\n\nWorld Bank’s latest edition of the “Global Economic Prospects”, (2019) assessed that global growth is expected to rise by 2.7% if we pick up in the manufacturing and trade sector. Developed nations such as Switzerland, China, and Hong-Kong as unbelieving as it may sound still strive for growth, and this growth can be seen in their performance either financially, physically or socially, the point is they perform. These developed countries continually maintain economic diversification as well as social inclusion as they rely on little or no foreign exchange this can be regarded as good overall performance of their economy.\n\n The Chinese Revolution that took place in 1949 made China one of the world’s most powerful nations.  It had to do with a total restructuring of the whole nation it caused and led to loss of lives and property, but it was for only but a time. Today, China has a prestigious population of over a billion people and a massive economy in excess of $US8 trillion per annum taking into consideration, its technological and innovate prowess( alpha story,2016) Thus it can be derived that china is of good performance. China is just a point of contact to Switzerland, Hong Kong Britain America and all those developed nations proved to have better performance\n\nIn March 2013,International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Africa as the world’s poorest continent due to the fact that it’s entire combined GDP was not up to one-third (1/3) of the GDP of the United States only. Many Researchers have coined that the economy of Africa is based on trade, Manufacturing and agriculture. Hence it is easily susceptible to the trade blocks and issues encountered at the borders. A perfect example is the closure of the Nigeria Borders to the importation of agro-based produce. This will greatly improve the performance of the Nigerian economy as a whole. Africa is ridiculed with bribery, corruption, Lack of cutting-edge infrastructure and resources hence the rise of political instability as well as economic dwindle. Thus, the country is at risk.\n\nThe Nigerian Country Risk has crippled the performance of the Nigerian economy to nothing such that our currency is so devalued and our manufacturing sector which is supposed to be our pride has proved to have poor performance. Over emphasis cannot be laid on the fact that this poor performance can be traced back to our lack or access to the right and cutting-edge equipment needed for the production of Consumer goods and raw materials or due to the backward thinking of most Nigerian in the manufacturing sector.\n\nWarner (1977) said that in order to guarantee sustainable economic growth it is essential to control the number of firms fail.  The Manufacturing sector in Nigeria has gone through a series of shocks and distress in the recent years. It has experienced some decline but it appears to be worse in the banking sector. However more manufacturing companies have actually failed than the banking institutions of recent. In relation to poor performance, Haider et al., 2014 argued that the whole performance assessment process ought to be simple, well defined and comprehensive in all levels. Poor performance in the Nigerian economy has proved to cause overall decay in the various sectors of the economy especially the Manufacturing sector which is the basis of this research work.\n\nIn 2017 The Nigerian government has decided to put in place different reforms such as its four-year Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP). They did so to try to improve the performance via stabilization of the macroeconomic environment energy sufficiency and most of all achievement of food security.  In the Manufacturing sector, phase one of the ERGP focus plan desired to tap into investments commitments in the food manufacturing as well as textile and garments and overall manufacturing. These reforms put in place help sometimes assist to get funding from World Bank.\n\nThe effect of these reforms so far, have an inelastic relationship to the current performance of the manufacturing companies, hence more needs to be done to solve this prevailing issue once and for all\n\nStrategic Planning has been identified as an explanatory variable that can help mitigate poor performance. Bryson (2011, 7-9) defined strategic planning as a deliberative, disciplined effort to produce fundamental decisions and actions that shape and guide what an organization is. Strategic Planning applies everywhere and in all types of organizations (Bryson 2011; Albrechts, Balducci, and Hillier, 2016). Furthermore, Strategic Planning is part of a way broader practice of strategic management that links up with planning.\n\nFreedman (2013) argued that strategic planning came from the military hence it’s defined as the art of managing government affairs which involves the use of state power. In order to lay due emphasis, the continued importance of planning, not just plainly but strategically planning cannot be merely overlooked or tossed aside, as it stands as the bedrock for companies to forecast clearly how they want their organizations to look in the next years to come. The employment of strategic planning as the solution to poor performance keeps the manufacturing sector re-assuring and professional as having a long term plan before the execution of  a project or working to achieve one’s goals.\n\nDue to certain reasons, strategic planning is increasingly becoming the standard practice as it gives room for accountability as well as compliance. In the global world, the US federal authorities engage in strategic Planning via Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRMA) (Radin 2006; Tama 2015).\n\nNevertheless it is important that strategic planning is measured correctly and accurately so as to solve the problem of poor performance in the listed manufacturing companies. These variables include Budgeting, Cost Control, Investment Appraisal, Sales Growth and Tangible assets. These variables have been carefully selected and actions will be taken to fully measure them against non-financial performance in order to evaluate its impact, thus, solving the problem at hand.\n\n \n\n \n\n1.2.         Statement of the problem\n\nThe slow but failing rate in the Manufacturing Company is getting more prevalent by the day. This failure can be traced to the decline in their performance; poor performance. The compelling desire to utilize strategic planning as the approach to proffer solutions to this prominent issue cannot be overemphasized. Drawing from the facts, the researcher has carried out numerous studies in relation to solving this problem but no absolute solution was found.  It is not news that the manufacturing sector in the Nigerian economy faces so many challenges such as power generation, regulatory issues as well as infrastructural deficiencies such as lack or no access to cutting edge equipment. In collaboration all these challenges slow down work output, hence leading to a decline in performance.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of strategic planning of the performance of listed manufacturing companies.\n\nParaphrasing the words of the president of the Manufacturer’s Association of Nigeria, Frank Jacobs (2018), a situation where we generate our power used for production does not make us competitive , due to the fact that whatever has be manufactured here(Nigeria) has been produced at a higher cost in comparison to other parts of the world. Futhermore, in addition to the above listed challenges leading to poor performance, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) (2014) also spoke about them as such\n\nInadequate and epileptic Power supply\n\nPoor infrastructure\n\nSupply variability of rain dependent agricultural products\n\nSome reforms were put in place by the government such as the ERGP initiative.  This reform highlights the policies fit to boost manufacturing, aiming to give incentives to support hubs and agricultural hubs. Rafiq Raji (2018) assessed that the lekki free Trade Zone has in its three (3) years of existences have led to the exportation of over US$700 finished goods worth of.  Strategic Planning through the use of its measurable variables; Budgeting, Cost Control, Investment Appraisal, sales growth as well as its tangible assets will proffer rationale solutions to these prominent issues of poor performance in these listed manufacturing companies.\n\nIn conclusion, the pointer of this work as earlier stated, is to evaluate the impact of strategic planning on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria\n\n \n\n1.3.         Objective of the study\n\nThe main objective of this study is to assess the effect of strategic planning on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria\n\nThe specific objectives are stated as to:\n\n      i.         Identify the effect of Budgeting on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\n    ii.         Establish the impact of Cost Control on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\n   iii.         Fully examine the extent Investment Appraisal on performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\n   iv.         Determine the impact of Sales Growth on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\n     v.          Critically evaluate Tangible Assets and its effect on performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\n1.4.         Research Questions\n\nThis research work seeks to provide solutions to the statement of problem at hand. But before that can be done effectively, certain questions need to be asked:\n\n      i.         In what way does Budgeting affect the performance of Listed Manufacturing Companies in Nigeria?\n\n    ii.         What impact does Cost Control have on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria?\n\n   iii.         To what extent does Investment Appraisal impact on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria?\n\n   iv.         How does Sales Growth affect the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria?\n\n     v.         To what degree can Tangible Assets affect the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria?\n\n1.5.         Research Hypothesis\n\nH0 (1): Budgeting has no significant relationship on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\nH0 (2): Cost Control has no significant relationship on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\nH0 (3): Capacity Utilization has no significant relationship on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\nH0 (4): Brand Awareness has no significant relationship on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\nH0 (5): Labor Turnover Rate has no significant relationship on the performance of listed manufacturing companies in Nigeria.\n\n \n\n1.6.         Justification of the study\n\nThe impetus of this study was brought to life when the researcher read multiple articles in relation to measurement of performance in Nigerian Manufacturing companies and realized that there is little or no studies or research work on strategic planning as a factor to influence performance in the manufacturing sector.\n\n The essence of this work is to evaluate the impact of Strategic Planning on the performance of Listed Manufacturing Companies. In other scholarly articles, the effect of management as a whole on performance has been studied. The use of financial analysis was employed to get result for the study.  However in this study, the researcher hopes to make use non-financial measure to see the effect of Strategic planning, also breakdown management as a whole a selected one of its core; Strategic Planning.\n\n Thus, this research work is justified as it seeks to provide evidence for the users of information as well as the future generation of researches to come.\n\n1.7.         Significance of study\n\n The essence of the research study cannot be overemphasized, hence its significance. This study would contribute to the knowledge bank of the national corporate world as a whole in relation to corporate strategy.\n\nPotential and existing stakeholders: the information gained from this study will enable to make appropriate decisions as they are fully aware that there are problems or consequences that may affect the firm performance if not adequately informed.\n\nEmployees and members of staff: The result of this study could also bring to light employees and members of staff who are unaware about the positive effects on the performance of the organization as a whole.\n\nInvestors, financial management experts: Furthermore, this study seeks to contribute immensely to those who need to be assured that business activities are carried out effectively and efficiently, thus show full understanding of the working of these manufacturing companies as a whole.\n\nGovernment, its parastatals and accounting/ sub-accounting officers: they will benefit from this study as it value to them entails appropriate and detailed presentation of its budget and all other related statement of accounts duly prepared as of the basis of strategic planning\n\nThe manufacturing sector: as a whole shall find the result of this study beneficial as it will enable them use and plan for organizational resources more effectively and efficiently\n\nStudents, fellow researchers and other scholars: those who may want to undergo further studies and research based on this or in relation to the strategic planning and its performance on these manufacturing companies, will have detailed literature pertaining to it.\n\n1.8.         Scope of the study\n\nThis study examined the extent in which Strategic planning has impacted on the performance of listed manufacturing companies. For the purpose of this study, 5 listed manufacturing companies out of a population of 10 listed Manufacturing Companies.\n\nThe Geographical Location for this Study is Nigeria thus, the sample has been drawn thereof. The Independent Variable employed is Strategic Planning which entails sub variables which are quantitative in nature they include; Budgeting(BGTN), Cost Control(CCTR), Investment Appraisal(INTA), Sales Growth (SGWT), Tangible Assets(TNAS).\n\nPurposive sampling technique was employed for this study. This simply means that the researcher purposively selected relevant manufacturing companies. The researcher also made sure to take all other factors into through consideration before selection was finally made.\n\n1.9.         Limitations of the study\n\nThis research work has been faced with certain challenges which have proved to limit the researcher and its study. Strategic Planning and Performance for the purpose of this research is quantitative in nature hence, it proved tough to collect accurate data on the performance from respondents.\n\nFurthermore, time proved to be a major constraint as the deadline for the submission was at hand, more extensive analysis could not have been carried out.\n\nLack of access to the, much needed materials, as the materials and articles found on the internet went not recent (1998-2002)\n\nIn order to mitigate this limitations, 1the Population was purposively selected ranging from 5 out of 10 listed manufacturing companies 2 Adoption of stringent efficiency measures 3 the data used was carefully collected and collated via the questionaries’ which were given to the corporate planning departments in the selected listed manufacturing companies.\n\n1.10.      Operationalization of Variables\n\nThe Primary Objective of this research is to ascertain the impact of Strategic Planning on performance of Listed Manufacturing Companies. To facilitate this, both an endogenous and exogenous variable will be employed. The endogenous variable connotes Performance and the exogenous variable connotes Strategic Planning.\n\nFunctional Relationship is as follows:\n\n   Y=f(X)\n\nY=Dependent Variable\n\nX=Independent Variable\n\nY will represent Performance (PER) which is the dependent Variable\n\nX will represent Strategic Planning (SP) which is the Independent Variable\n\nThis means PER is a function of SP\n\nWe represent it mathematically as:\n\nY=y1, y2, y3, y4. y5\n\nX=x1,x2 ,x 3,x4 ,x5\n\nThese sub-variables can be written as:\n\nY                                                                     X\n\ny1= PRQT=Product Quality                            x1= BGTN=Budgeting\n\ny2= CTSF=Customer Satisfaction                  x2= CCRT=Cost Control\n\ny3=BRAW=Brand Awareness                         x3= INTA=Investment Appraisal\n\ny4= CAPUT=Capacity Utilization                  x4= SGWT= Sales Growth\n\ny5=LBTR=Labor Turnover Rate                     x5= TNAS=Tangible Assets           \n\nFunction Relationship\n\ny1 (PRQT) =f (BGTN, CCRT, INTA, SGWT, TNAS) ……………………………..equation 1\n\ny2 (CTSF) =f (BGTN, CCRT, INTA, SGWT, TNAS)……………………………… equation 2\n\ny3 (BRAW) =f (BGTN, CCRT, INTA, SGWT, TNAS)……………………………… equation 3\n\ny4 (CAPUT) =f (BGTN, CCRT, INTA, SGWT, TNAS)……………………………… equation 4\n\ny5 (LBTR) =f (BGTN, CCRT, INTA, SGWT, TNAS)……………………………… equation 5\n\nMODEL 1\n\nPRQT = β0+ β1 BGTN+ β2CCRT+β3INTA +β4SGWT+β5TNAS+µ\n\nMODEL 2\n\nCTSF = β0+ β1 BGTN+ β2CCRT+β3INTA +β4SGWT+β5TNAS+µ\n\nMODEL 3\n\nBRAW = β0+ β1 BGTN+ β2CCRT+β3INTA +β4SGWT+β5TNAS+µ\n\nMODEL 4\n\nCAPUT = β0+ β1 BGTN+ β2CCRT+β3INTA +β4SGWT+β5TNAS+µ",

        "content": "CHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1  Background to The Study\n\nLiquidity is a financial institution’s capacity to meet it cash and collateral responsibilities without incurring unacceptable losses. Adequate liquidity is reliant upon the institution’s capacity to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs without negatively affecting either day to day operations or the financial state of the institution. So, liquidity management entails the supply/withdrawal from the market the amount of liquidity consistent with the desired level of short-term interest rates or reserve money. It is the capacity of an organization to meet demands for funds thereby ensuring that such organization maintain adequate cash and liquid assets to satisfy the demand of client for loans and savings withdrawals and then meet its expected expenses, (Owolabi, & Obida, 2012).\n\nAccording to Panigrahi (2013), it is frequently observed that on every occasion a financial analysis of firms is done; more emphasis is given on the financial performance (profitability) of the business rather than on its liquidity. This is quite evident, as the most important financial aim of any business entity is to earn profit. Therefore, the managers lay more emphasis towards financial performance of the business. However, another significant variable is liquidity which means the ability of an organization to honor its short term financial obligations. If the organization isn’t able to honor its short-term financial obligations, it moves a step forward towards its bankruptcy. Liquidity management, therefore, entails the amount of investments in liquid assets to meet the short-term maturing obligation of creditors and others.\n\nBasically, the liquidity management role is to prospectively evaluate the needs for funds to meet obligation and ensure the availability of cash or collateral to fulfill those need at the right time by coordinating the different sources of funds accessible to the organization under normal and stressed conditions. It depends on the day to day assessment of the liquidity conditions in the insurance companies, so as to measure its liquidity needs and thus the volume of liquidity to allot or withdraw from the market. Management of liquidity involves a day to day evaluation and detailed estimation of the size and timing of cash inflows and outflows over the coming days and weeks to lessen the risk that savers will be unable to access their deposits in the moment they demand them. Thus, liquidity is lifeblood of a business organization. Ebhodaghe (2002), Biety (2003), and Anyanwu (1993), assert that the objective of liquidity management is to gear organizations towards a financial position that enables them meet their financial obligations as they occur.\n\nShortage of adequate liquidity in a business organization is often characterized by the inability to meet day to day financial obligations. At times it may have the risk of losing clients which erodes its supply of cash and thus forces the institution into disposal of its more liquid assets. As opined by (Pandy, 2005), managing monies of a business organization in order to maximized cash availability and interest income on any idle cash is a function of liquidity management.\n\nCurrent assets are liquid so holding more current assets refers to high liquidity however on the other hand; current assets include such items which reduce firm’s financial performance. It must be remembered that different items of current assets have different degree of liquidity. Cash is the most liquid asset. For another types of current assets, liquidity concept has two dimensions of time and risk. The speed with which current assets other than cash can be converted into cash is regarded as time dimension of liquidity consideration, (Falope & Ajilore, 2009). More quickly and rapidly current assets are converted into cash, more liquid those current assets shall be. The greater the relative proportion of liquid assets, the lesser the risk of running out of cash, all other things being equal. All individual components of working capital including cash, marketable securities, account receivables and inventory management play a significant role in the financial performance of any organization.\n\nFor owners of business, one of the most vital tasks is to estimate and assess cash flows of the business, to well identify the long-run and short-run cash inflows and outflows to timely sort out the cash shortages and excess to formulate financing and investing strategies respectively. It also helps in planning the payments to creditors on time to avoid losing reputation and trust of the customers and to avoid potential bankruptcy, (Bardia, 2004).\n\nIf all the current responsibilities are met without any delay as and when these become due, creditors or clients and all others will have a feeling of confidence in the financial strength of the organization and this will sustain the credit standing of the organization, (Chen & Wong, 2004). However, failure to meet such responsibilities on regular basis would cause a negative effect on the credit standing and market reputation resulting in more difficult to finance the level of current assets from the short-term sources. Keeping liquidity is usually costly, although helps avert negative effects of unexpected cash-flow shocks.\n\nAccording to Bhunia (2010), liquidity plays a crucial role in the successful functioning of an organization. A company should ensure that it doesn’t suffer from lack-of or excess liquidity to meet its short-term obligations. A study of liquidity is of major significance to both the internal and the external analysts simply because of its close relationship with daily operations of a business. Liquidity requirement of an organization relies on the peculiar nature of the organization and there is no particular rule on measuring the optimal level of liquidity that an organization can maintain so as to ensure positive impact on its profitability, (ibid).\n\nHowever, one should try neither to maximize nor minimize the liquidity ratios; one should try to optimize them in relation to the objective, which in case of a commercial company is probably the maximization of profit on capital employed. The lower the liquidity ratios are, the more vulnerable the company is to pressure from creditors or clients which it unable to meet and vice versa. So, one should seek to have as little working capital as is consistent with not being unduly vulnerable to pressure from creditors.\n\nAccording to Brealey (2012), liquidity is expressed in terms of liquidity ratios such as current ratio, quick (acid test) ratio and cash ratio. Current ratio is the ratio of the current assets to the current liabilities and it measures the margin of liquidity. Rapid fall in the current ratio sometimes signify trouble. But, they can also be misleading. For instance, suppose that a firm borrows a huge sum from the bank and invests it in short-term securities. If nothing else happens, net working capital is unaffected, but the current ratio changes. For this reason, it might be preferable to net off the short-term investments and the short-term debt when calculating the current ratio.\n\nAccording to Brealey (2012), quick (acid test) is a sign of firm’s short term liquidity and is calculated as current assets net of inventories divided by current liabilities. It measures a firm’s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets thereby excluding inventories. The quick ratio measures the naira amount of liquid assets available for each naira of current liabilities. Thus, a quick ratio of 1.5 implies that a company has N1.50 of liquid assets available to cover each N1 of current liabilities. The higher the quick ratio the better the firm’s liquidity position and vice versa.\n\nAccording to Brealey (2012), cash ratio is the ratio of a firm's total cash and cash equivalents to its current liabilities. The cash ratio is most generally used as a measure of firm liquidity. A firm’s most liquid assets are its holdings of cash and marketable securities and that is why analysts also look at the cash ratio. It can therefore determine if, and how quickly, the company can repay its short-term debt. A strong cash ratio is useful to creditors when deciding how much debt, if any, they would be willing to extend to the asking party.\n\nOne of the most severe liquidity stress scenarios faced by an insurer is a mass surrender of policies owing to a loss of confidence in its financial strength. This happened to Equitable Life following the House of Lords ruling on its guaranteed annuity liabilities in 2000. Risk is a natural element of business and community life. It is a condition that raises the chance of losses/gains and the uncertain potential events which could manipulate the success of financial institutions (Crowe, 2009). As a result, well establish risk management practices (RMPs) can assist insurance to reduce their exposure to risks. Effective risk management is accepted as a major cornerstone of insurance firm’s management by academics, practitioners and regulators and acknowledging this reality and the need for a comprehensive approach to deal with insurance risk management (Sensarma & Jayadev, 2009).\n\nMoreover, liquidity management is found to be one of the determinants of returns of insurance s’ stocks. Indeed, as Holland (2010) observed, liquidity management failure is considered one of the main causes of the crisis. The inability of insurance firms to raise liquidity can be attributed to a funding liquidity risk that is caused either by the maturity mismatch between inflows and outflows and/or the sudden and unexpected liquidity needs arising from contingency conditions (Duttweiler, 2009). Insurers will typically hold cash in the form of bank deposits, Treasury Bills, commercial paper, and other money market instruments to meet outflows. Liquidity losses on realizing listed securities depend not only on the amount sold, but also on quoted maximum deal sizes and spreads, which are in turn affected by market conditions (Kumar, 2015).\n\nLiquidity Risk is a risk of insufficient liquid assets to meet payouts from policies (surrender, expenses, maturities, etc.), forcing the sale of assets at lower prices, leading to losses, despite company being solvent. Loss from meeting liquidity comes either from fire sale or by paying interest on borrowing to meet payouts. Liquidity risk arises due to two reasons, one on the liability side and other on the asset side (Sonjai, 2008). Hence, insurance companies in Nigeria are statutorily required to increase their Statutory Deposit with the Central Bank of Nigeria to an amount equal to 10% of the New Minimum Capital Requirement for their respective classes of insurance operations.\n\n \n\n1.2  Statement of The Problem\n\nThe problem of insufficient studies of the assessment of the relationship between liquidity management and the performance of Insurance companies in Nigeria calls for more work under the subject matter. The assessment of liquidity management in relation to performance becomes imperative as a result of Insurance Market Review in 2009. The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) makes it important to examine the management of liquidity in Insurance companies in Nigeria. Theoretical studies and empirical evidence have shown that countries with better developed financial system enjoy faster and more stable long-run growth of which insurance companies contribute to. Well-developed financial markets have a significant positive impact on total factor productivity, which translates into higher long-run development. Based on Solow’s (1956) work, Merton (2004) noted that due to the absence of a financial system that can provide the means of transforming technical innovation into broad implementation, technological progress will not have significant and substantial impact on the economic development and growth.\n\nLiquidity risk in an insurance company is considered as less threatening than in bank because of higher frequency of money exchange takes place in banking industry compared to insurance industry. However, liquidity risk management is equally important in insurance as in banking sector because of interconnection of financial system leading to cash crisis and secondly liquidity risk may prove very expensive to insurer due to meeting the cost of liquidity and also impacting the Assets and Liability mismatch.\n\nThere is a trade-off between liquidity and financial performance; gaining more of one ordinarily means giving up some of the other, (Eljelly, 2004). For instance, if a company’s balance sheet is listed in order of liquidity with five items namely cash, marketable securities, accounts receivables, inventory and fixed assets it can be observed that moving from cash to fixed assets decreases liquidity. However, as you move from fixed assets to cash financial performance increase. In other words, profitable investment for a company is normally its fixed assets and the least profitable investment is cash, (Boadi, Antwi, & Lartey, 2013).\n\nMathuva (2009) found a highly significant positive relationship between the time it takes the firm to pay its creditors (average payment period) and financial performance. Maina (2011) found the relationship between liquidity and financial performance was weak and also that all the independent variables had a significant relationship with Return on assets except the quick ratio and cash conversion cycle. The results further revealed that, there was a strong negative relationship between a firm’s leverage and quick ratio with its Return on assets. Owolabi & Obida (2012) found causative relationships between financial performance expressed in terms return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and return on investment (ROI) and liquidity management of companies was measured in terms of its Debtors Collection Period (DCP), Creditors Payment Period (CPP) and Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC).\n\nWambu (2013) found out that there was a positive relationship between profitability and liquidity however, the coefficients from the study were not significant. Lartey, Antwi & Boadi (2013) found that there was a very weak positive relationship between the liquidity and the financial performance of the listed banks in Ghana.\n\nBased on earlier researches, the studies did not center on the liquidity management especially in the insurance industry, also the empirical evidence revealed mixed results with some showing negative relationship and others showing positive or no relationship, finally, from the above reviews, it was found that out that, most of the studies were not conducted in Nigeria. Therefore, there was a yawning gap in existence since there was no comprehensive study on the effect of liquidity management on financial performance of insurance companies listed at the Nigeria Securities Exchange. Earlier studies broadly concentrated on effect of liquidity and relationship of liquidity and profitability of commercial banks. This study therefore concentrated on what effect liquidity management has on financial performance of insurance companies in Nigeria.\n\n \n\n1.3  Objectives of The Study\n\nThe main objective of the study is to examine liquidity management and financial performance of listed insurance companies in Nigeria with a view to providing solutions to the problem.\n\nThe specific objectives to:\n\nIdentify the extent to which liquidity management affects revenue per policyholder of listed insurance companies in Nigeria\nExamine the use of liquidity management an average cost per claim of listed insurance companies in Nigeria\nDetermine the application of liquidity management on return on surplus of listed insurance companies in Nigeria.\nEstablish the impact of liquidity management on policy sales growth of listed insurance companies in Nigeria.\n \n\n1.4  Research Question\n\nTo what extent ca liquidity management affect revenue per policyholder of listed insurance companies in Nigeria?\nHow can the use of liquidity management be applied to average cost per claim of listed insurance companies in Nigeria?\nTo what extent does the application of liquidity management affect return on surplus of listed insurance companies in Nigeria?\nHow can use of liquidity management affect policy sales growth of listed insurance companies in Nigeria?\n \n\n1.5  Research Hypothesis\n\nH0 There is no relationship between liquidity management and revenue per policyholder\nH1 There is a relationship between liquidity management and revenue per policyholder\n\nH0 There is no relationship between liquidity management and average cost per claim.\nH1 There is a relationship between liquidity management and average cost per claim.\n\nH0 There is no relationship between liquidity management and return on surplus\nH1 There is a relationship between liquidity management and return on surplus\n\nH0 There is no relationship between liquidity management and policy sales growth\nH1 There is a relationship between liquidity management and policy sales growth\n\n \n\n \n\n1.6  Justification of The Study\n\nThe motivation behind the research was brought about when the researcher came across an article titled ‘liquidity risk and profitability of Nigerian banks’ where the researcher analyzed Nigerian banks and their liquidity risk, liquidity management and the processes used to maintain an adequate level of liquidity and also performing well financially. It was on this premise that the researcher decides to also research into liquidity but of a different financial institution, the researcher picked the insurance sector as it is similar to the banking sector in that liquidity is very essential to their operations. This made the researcher to investigate liquidity management and financial performance of listed insurance companies in Nigeria.\n\n \n\n1.7  Significance of The Study\n\nThe study would contribute immensely to knowledge and total understanding of liquidity management in insurance companies especially in Nigeria where insurance is not considered as Important to success of businesses as it is in Europe and USA This study will also provide future insurance seekers the information needed to make a good decision about what insurance company to use.\n\nThe results of this study could also help in insurance managers know the adequate liquidity needed to more effectively run an insurance company and keep its long term stability.\n\nRegulators in Nigeria would also benefit from findings of this study by recognizing important liquidity management measures that promote financial stability.\n\nStudents, researchers and other scholars who wish to undertake further research on liquidity management and financial performance would find the literature arising from this study to be of great value, as it would be added to existing literature and also widen the scope\n\n \n\n \n\n1.8  Scope of The Study\n\nThe study examined the extent to which liquidity management has impacted on the financial performance of listed insurance companies; using the financial performance indicators such as revenue per policyholder, average cost per claim, return on surplus and policy sales growth. This study is however, delimited to selected insurance companies that are listed on the Nigerian stock exchange. The geographical location for this study is Nigeria.

Nigeria banks should be law abiding on there Financial reporting to avoid suspension, penalties and fine against them, to customers.\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       Background of the Study\n\nThe Nigerian banking sector is part of Nigerian financial system which refers to the totality of the regulatory and participating institutions, including financial markets and instruments, involved in the process of financial intermediation. The major objectives of investing in the banking sector are to provide financial services to the economy and earn compensatory returns on capital employed. The evolution of banking in Nigeria has been brought to fore in order to study deep into the history of banking and bring out the challenges that led to the various crisis the industry has been passing through within the past few years. In some times past, the banking industry was affected as a result of the belief of shareholders, stakeholders, managers and others where unethical practices were portrayed (Adekunle and Asaolu, 2013).\n\nBanks are established for the purpose of provided various financial services to the general public. Their intermediation role through financial reporting, credit facility and information is a catalyst for business activities in an economy. Consequently, banks credit for productive endeavours provides the public and real sector with necessary financial resources needed to accelerate the nation’s growth and economic sustainability. Their credit function enhances the ability of investors to exploit desired profitable ventures (Kargi, 2011).\n\nThe main drive of ethical practice and ethical values is the upholding of professionalism and good practice. Ethical practice in the business world according to Micewski and Troy (2006) is not holistic, but is a context that considers any phenomenon that influences ones behaviour. In most organisations in the world, the largest ethical practice in the accounting process is accountability, integrity and how an employee can abide to existing rules and regulation in the organisation (Gomez, 2002). The breach of ethical rules in the practice of corporate financial reporting is not fair to users and such action can jeopardize the main objective of the financial reports (Gowthorpe and Amat, 2005). Brinkmann (2002) defined ethics as a discipline in which matter of right and wrong, good and evil, virtue and vice are methodically examined. Ethics looks at human behaviour, moral principles and the attempt to distinguish good from bad. When trying to identify common issues being dealt with within the business environment, professional bodies’ codes of ethics is the right place to look. These codes represent what one considers as reflection of business ethics. Codes of ethics should mainly address the particularities of high risk activities and are built on the collective conscience of a profession as a proof for the group’s acknowledgment of the moral dimension. According to Smith and Smith (2003), ethical practice provide the foundation on which a civilized society exists. For the financial institutions, the retention of public confidence through the enthronement of good corporate governance remains of almost importance given the role of the industry in the mobilization of fund, the allocation of credit to the deficit sectors of the economy, the payment and settlement system and the implementation of monetary policy.\n\n1.2       Statement of the Problem\n\nThere is no gainsaying that the present economy deserves a sound, stable and better banking performance following the causative factors, such as unethical and unprofessional practices, poor management quality among others which contributed to low level of bank performance and sometimes lead to failure of bank. Banks and other financial intermediaries play the important role of channeling funds from savers to borrowers. The traditional role of a bank is lending and loans make up the bulk of their assets.  Bank failures in Nigeria and other emerging economies have been attributed to different practices on the ethical ground. Ethical practices are rules of behaviour exhibited by managers, shareholders, workers and stakeholders to decide what is right and wrong in the normal course of business to the growth and financial stability of an organisation and to promote the financial markets integrity and economic efficiency of the business (Ogbona and Ebimobowei, 2012). This practice is important for producing quality and reliable financial reports to investors, potential investors and all stakeholders. An ethical dilemma has, overtime bedeviled the Nigerian banking industry couple with poor system in the organisation. Inaccurate/poor reporting of financial performance to shareholders, the government and the public have eroded the level of confidence of these stakeholders (Chen and Pan, 2012). The lack of proper accountability and transparency in the production of financial returns has also eroded the confidence of investors and the public - leading to lack of accountability, independence, fairness and transparency. There is sufficient empirical evidence that poor financial reporting manifested in banks is as a result of neglect of good ethical considerations which led to lack of transparency, poor accountability, fraud, insider abuse, high levels of credit risk, poor quality loans, limited and or inadequate capitalization, operational inefficiencies, higher incidences of non-performing loans, higher levels of liquidity risk, and so on which in the overall affected financial reporting system (Kargi, 2011).  Although, these are mentioned as constraints affecting banks’ financial statement, they are based on a few studies and non-elaborate methods to generate sufficient and valid conclusions. This study therefore becomes an extension of the few studies undertaken with a view to generating more and further information based on empirical evidence on deposit money banks, however, this study sought to examine the effect of ethical practices on the financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria.\n\n1.3       Objectives of the Study\n\nThe general objective of this study is to examine the effect of ethical practices on the financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria.\n\nThe specific objectives are to;\n\nexamine the effect of integrity and reputation on the financial reporting of deposit money banks  in Nigeria.\nexamine the effect of accountability and honesty on the financial reporting of deposit money banks  in Nigeria.\nassess the effect of fairness on the financial reporting of deposit money banks  in Nigeria.\ndetermine the effect of Law abiding on the Financial reporting of deposit money banks  in Nigeria.\nestablish the effect of loyalty on the financial reporting of deposit money banks  in Nigeria.\n1.4       Research Questions\n\nWhat is the effect of integrity and reputation on financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria?\nHow do accountability and honesty affect the financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria?\nDoes fairness have effect on financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria?\nHow does law abiding affects the financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria?\nWhat is the effect staff loyalty on financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria?\n1.6       Significance of the Study\n\nGood ethical practice provides fundamental information of financial statement to a wide range of use to policy makers in both public and private sectors of the economy banks inclusive – shareholders, management, government, creditors and society at large. This study would be vital input to the effectiveness and efficiency of managers towards their required attention to ethical practices. More specifically, a dynamic and competing financial institution environment calls for improved observations, measurement and transparent disclosure of operations, this study help reduce expected consequences that would lead to institutional failure when considering the multiplier effect of financial institutional failure on the real sector of the economy. This would be beneficial to developing country like Nigeria. Thus, the study would create a governance system that will promote ethical value, professionalism and transparent application of best practices desirable in the financial institutions. This empirical study is also germane to the researcher since it is a partial requirement for the award of an academic certificate which would enable the researcher contributes his or her quota into the academic world.\n\n1.7       Scope of the Study\n\nThis study centers on the effect of ethical practices on the financial reporting of deposit money banks in Nigeria.
