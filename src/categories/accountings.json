mal-practices, especially in the public sector, they have begun to lose credibility, which would be misleading to investors and other users. It therefore led to the introduction of external auditor, to serve as a check on these activities, expressed in financial statements. This study examined the relationship between the external auditor and the financial statements of public sector in Nigeria. The study adopted a cross-sectional survey design with a total population of 250 senior staffs, out of which 100 were auditors (internal). A sample of 154 staffs was taken from both senior staffs and internal auditors. The primary source of data collection was used to collect data from respondents using a well-structured and tested questionnaire, which was presented using frequency tables and simple percentages. Data was analyzed using Regression Analysis through the SPSS version 21. The study revealed a significant relationship between the quality of financial statement and the illiteracy of government official with (p=0.00 i.e. p< 0.05), and auditor’s engagement, with (p=0.00 i.e. p<0.05), but revealed an insignificant but positive relationship with auditor’s independence, with (p=0.664 i.e. p>0.05). This study concluded that there is a significant and positive relationship between the quality of financial statements and the illiteracy of government officials, auditor’s engagement, and auditor’s independence. The study recommends proper training and education of both external auditors and the public sector officials on the importance of independence in their work, and the effect of corruption on the Nation, respectively. It also recommends that there should be another system of checks on the public sector activities asides from the external auditors. ",

However, it is set to achieve the following specific objectives: to know if there is any positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and return on asset of Nigerian firms, to examine the positive impact of corporate social responsibility on return on equity of Nigerian firms, to ascertain the improvement of corporate social responsibility on earning per share of shareholders, to evaluate the relationship between size of firm and corporate social responsibility, to examine the impact of industry type on corporate social responsibility\nThe secondary source of data collection w as adopted in this work ranging from the period of 2009 to 2013. Data are analyzed using tables and simple percentages. The statistical tool employed is the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression.\nThis research find out that the model suggest that type of industry that a firm operates in has a significant relationship with it’s corporate social responsibility. In this case, we reject the null hypothesis  and accept  the alternative. The coefficient   of earnings per share has a positive significance impact return on asset implying that a significant relationship exist between earnings per share (EPS) and a corporate social responsibility.  The research findings equally suggest that a firms profitability does not have a significant relationship with it’s corporate social responsibility. The model also reveal that that firms size has a significant relation with the corporate social responsibility.\nCHAPTER ONE       \nINTRODUCTION\n1.1     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\nThe concept of corporate social responsibility was presented in 1910, perceived in 1950, and was formalized in 1960. The first book of corporate social responsibility was published by Howard Bowen in 1953. Before the development of the concept, the basic aim of firms was to make maximum profit for the shareholders not taking consideration how their operations affect the society at large. The issue of firms carrying out social responsibility has generated mixed reactions, argument and thought by diverse groups of the corporate world and the academia. The proponents argue that “it fosters and promotes ethical behaviour by managers, and this has a positive impact on firm reputation”. On the other hand, the burden of social responsibilities is detrimental to corporate reputation.\nHowever, critique of CSR “claim that it is expensive and inconsistent with the absolute goal of maximizing shareholder wealth.” To these opponents this paper express the case of the festering wound of Nigeria’s Niger Delta region in order for them to judge lucidly: to be committed to the environment and still achieve a high shareholders’ value or to neglect the society and risk public odium and the likelihood that shareholders would either risk their stake in the organization or engage perpetually in damage control activities while also remaining in the negative spotlight which is dangerous to the firm.\nThe concept of CSR has tremendously increased and has given much importance to analyze the effect on shareholders’ wealth and firm’s financial performance. Firm’s now pays much attention to show their commitment to CSR by including it in their information provided to their stakeholder (Kotonen2009). In today’s competitive environment between successful firms, CSR is a basic part of every corporate strategy. Many firms have integrated CSR in all aspect of their operations. The concept has forced firms to not only focus on financial growth but to concentrate on the importance of working for the welfare of the society and also in employees’ satisfaction. Given their over-riding priority compared with other stakeholders, the consumer has assumed a focal role, which has led firms to act ethically on their behalf as part of a new ‘social consciousness’. Albuquerque (2013) expresses that CSR can be used to maximize firms value by minimizing the systematic risk, and can be considered as the investment in maintaining customer’s loyalty.  We can see that once the ‘primary needs’ of firms have been meet, advanced firms increasingly want to meet ethical values.\nAs often happens when new terms are coined, they tend to lose their conceptual precision, leaving their evocative value which is however watered down by the multitude of different meanings and contexts in which it is used. The concept of CSR indeed, takes on different meanings depending on the organization or group that uses it. Some tend to emphasize individual aspects that they believe to be more important than others e.g., the environment, safety, education, ethics or human rights. Definitions often vary as they represent historical and social differences between countries. Indeed, certain definitions underline a particular theme because it is more relevant in that particular state. At other times the concept of CSR reflects the level of economic and therefore social development of a country, (Poddi and Sergio, 2009). Due to the different weight given to the term by different countries, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD5) has given the following definition: “CSR is the task of a business to tremendously contribute to sustainable economic development, working together with workers, the local community and society in general to improve quality of life.”\nCorporate Social Responsibility has begun to be discussed in Italy only recently and in particular since the European Council of Lisbon (2000) included it as a fixed strategy. In 2001, the European Commission published a Green Paper that contained its guidelines. In the United States, the topic  has been of interest for longer. Already in the mid 70’s the American Securities and Exchange Commission requested by the Natural Resources Defence Council – introduced certain social variables in the information that a publicly quoted company should give to its investors and the general public. So, business ethics and corporate responsibility began to spread among economically developed countries, (Hall and Rieck,1998). It is obvious that this transformation caused a shake-up in the accepted aspect of firms as they introduced the perception that the source could not ignore respect for working conditions or other social implications. Recently, we have seen a growing, ‘race’ for social certification as a response to the changed relation between firm and consumers as witnessed by the growing number of CSR firms in particular in some countries.\nThanks to the response to the interrelationship between strategic corporate aims and respect for all players involved in a company, at a theoretical level the stakeholder theory seems to be useful to measure the social responsibility of a firm by means of social accountability.  This theory underlines the fact that relations are fundamental for the existence of a firm and therefore should be looked at in more detail as they could open up new opportunities for a firm. The subjects that established this network mainly include the community where the firm is situated, workers and customers, (Ngwakwe, 2009).\nIn response to consumer satisfaction and the reaction that CSR companies have had in developed countries we can realize that CSR certification is an evolutionary phase of growth and therefore needs structural and linking elements. One of the main aims of this work is to evaluate this concept by using econometric models. However, if we are to say that CSR is necessary for corporate strategy, given the recentness of the phenomena and absence of a well defined and universally accepted certification method, at present CSR has certain major limitations which we would like to rectify: i.e., 1) certification, that is an objective benchmark rather than a mere marketing tool for the public, 2) the principal motivation and elements that push firms into ethical behavior and suitable certification. It is actually this second point that has given rise to a proliferation of articles concerning social certification (Matthew, 2008) that have still not shed light on the motivation that entices firms to bear the cost of certification or looked at the experimental performance of CSR firms. As a result, various performance measures have been adopted both on the market and in accountability that all give rather discordant results.\n1.2.1    STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM\nThis issues of corporate social responsibility has generated a lot of debates, school of thought pioneered by Andrew Carnegie (in his book” the Gospel of Wealth”) has argued for CSR. Fasany & Onakokaya (2013) revealed that CSR is the basic tool to the financial development of the firm in terms of attaining higher profits by adopting the process of taking community and societal welfare into considerations by the firms. On the other hand, another school of thought led by Friedman has strongly opposed the principle of CSR. They argument that managers should make decisions that maximize the wealth of the firm’s shareholders (Friedman,1970). From Friedman’s perspective, the only social responsibility of a firm is t o increase the profit and wealth of shareholders, that any other activities disturbing the optimal allocation of scarce resources to alternative uses exert an adverse influence on firm performance.  Hence, does CSR affects firms financial performance and shareholders’ wealth?\nFrom the foregoing background, this study raises the following question.  \ni.    Is there any positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and return on asset of Nigerian firms?\nii.    Does corporate social responsibility has a positive impact on return on equity of Nigerian firms?\niii.    Is there any improvement of corporate social responsibility on earning per share of shareholders?\n1.3     RESEARCH OBJECTIVES\nGenerally, this study seeks to assess the impact of corporate social responsibility on financial performance and shareholders wealth in Nigerian firms. However, it is set to achieve the following specific objectives:\ni.    To know if there is any positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and return on asset of Nigerian firms.\nii.    To examine the positive impact of corporate social responsibility on return on equity of Nigerian firms.\niii.    To ascertain the improvement of corporate social responsibility on earning per share of shareholders.\niv.    To evaluate the relationship between size of firm and corporate social responsibility\nv.    To examine the impact of industry type on corporate social responsibility\n1.4    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS   \n    Hypothesis one\nH1 there is a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and return of asset of firms.\nH0: there is a negative relationship between corporate social responsibility and return of asset of firms.\nHypothesis two\nH1:     there is a positive impact of corporate social responsibility Return on Asset of firms.\nH0: there is negative impact of corporate social responsibility and Return on Asset of firms.\nHypothesis three\nH1:     corporate social responsibility has improved the earnings per share of shareholders.\nH0: corporate social responsibility has not improved the earnings per share of shareholders.\nHypothesis four\nH1: there is a positive  relationship between size of firm and corporate social responsibility\nH0: there is no positive  relationship between size of firm and corporate social responsibility\nHypothesis five\nH1: Industry type has a positive impact on corporate social responsibility\nH0: Industry type has no positive impact on corporate social responsibility\n1.5    SIGNIFICANCE  OF THE STUDY\nThe findings of the study will be of importance to difference stakeholders in many ways\n1.    It enables the management to assess the impact of corporate social responsibility of the company on its performance.\n2.    It increases the awareness of corporate social responsibility in Nigeria.\n3.     It will be of great benefit to government and regulations as its aid policy formulation and the extent of compliance by Nigerian companies on corporate social responsibility\n4.    It will enable managers to know the need for it’s wonderful responsibility  and its impact on the economy\n5.    It will make manager to assess their role and activities hence, score themselves\n6.    It will serve as a lead way for various Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in pursuit of increased corporate social responsibility.\n1.6         SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThis study focused on the impact of CSR on firm financial performance and shareholders wealth in Nigeria. A cross-sectional data of 20 firms covering a period of (2009-2013) is used for the study.\n1.7    LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\nThis study is primarily restricted to the impact of CSR on firm performance and shareholders’ wealth. But however, this research work is limited to the following:  \n1.    Statistical limitations: the study was based on statistical methods and techniques.\n2.

This, they assert, is achieved through consistent increases in the selected stock returns. It is therefore not an unusual occurrence that investors in financial markets do increase or decrease their stock holdings and profit level according to the impact of information on stock prices (Zeytinoglu, Aquarium & Celik, 2012). Perhaps, this may be the reason why Emamgholipour et al (2013) opine that in order to be able to achieve stock returns more efficiently and with less risk, an investor needs information about  that stock. Stock return, according to them is one of the most important factors in choosing a best investment option from amongst competing alternatives. To Zeytinoglu et al (2012), stocks are the most preferred investment instruments since they provide higher returns than numerous other possible investment outlets.\nAs noted by Zeytinoglu, Aquarium & Celik (2012), in an efficient market one cannot use the existing information in the market to make profit, information gathering from financial statements becomes the basic information which investors use in making stock investment decisions.\nEmamgholipour et al, (2013) pointed out that the information that exists about a company’s stock captures both internal and external circumstances of that company. The Internal circumstances of a company are reflected by the information in its financial statements. External information of a company also exists in the stock market. According to Moridi Pour and Mousavi (2009), the external and internal information have effect on invests’ stock decisions.\nAccording to Emamgholipour et al (2013), investors have to consider various factors during investments in stocks, because they intend to convert their liquid (cash) assets to stocks. Therefore, in any investment, with relevant financial ratios especially investment ratios, computed from the financial tables, rational investors seek the possible ways by which they can get abnormal returns. They also seek to get information from the future amount of stock returns of companies (Emamgholipour et al, 2013; Zeytinoglu et al, 2012).As pointed out earlier, one of the most common methods of analyzing financial information to facilitate stock investment decisions (among others) is to prepare financial ratios. Namazi and Roostami (2006) assert that financial ratios are a summary of financial reports of companies, which provide much information content from the internal situation of companies. This assertion seems to imply that investors can make and even reverse or adjust their investment decisions following the information portrayed by the financial ratios from a company’s financial statements.\nIrrespective of Namazi and Rostami’s assertion, and since Efficient Market Hypothesis holds that investors cannot obtain returns in excess of the normal returns, it is convincing to find out whether market-based ratio have any impact on the stock returns of investors in the food and beverages sub-sector of the Nigerian stock market. Thus, the question “are market-based ratios important predictors of stock returns?” remains unanswered. Whether they are or not, is an expected output of this study.\n1.2    STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEMS\nNumerous empirical studies have appeared in recent years concerning the behaviour of stock market returns and its determinants. While a few writers believe that certain price trends and patterns exists to enable the investor to make better predictions of the expected values of future stock market price changes, the majority of these studies conclude that past price data alone cannot form the basis for predicting the expected values of price movements in the stock market (Erika & Idolor, 2009).\nIndeed the prediction of stock returns due to changes in some other extraneous variables still continue to pose a major challenge in the literature to date. This has been as a result of a lack of appropriate data for statistical analysis, lack of technical skills to effectively utilize available statistical tools and a lack of in-depth research into that aspect of the capital market. Many futile attempts have been made to predict stock returns in the past. Analysts have used fundamental and technical approaches and more tools are being evolved in the literature to deal with this aspect of the stock market. All the attempts are to see if an investor can beat the market and reap a windfall. The success of such analytical tool would lead to an upward trend in the stock market and further lead to market vibrancy and economic growth and development.\nFurthermore, a great majority of such research studies have been conducted using aggregate data of the entire stock market, without any specific consideration of the impact on specific sub-sectors of the stock market. Moreover a great majority of previous research studies have been focused more on the developed capital markets leaving those centered on an emerging/frontier capital market like Nigeria, few and far in between. In this light the background to the study brings into lime light the curiosity of the researcher to examine the impact of a set of market-based financial ratios (or information) on the stock returns of companies listed the oil and gas sector of the Nigerian market.\n1.3    RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nThe following research questions emerged against the background of the statement of the research problem to guide the researcher in the study.\n1.    To what extent does earnings per share (EPS) determine equity return performance in Nigerian publicly quoted firms?\n2.    Is there a significant relationship between Price Earnings (P/E) ratio and equity returns of Nigerian publicly quoted companies?\n3.    To what extent does Market Value to Book Value (MBV) ratio determine equity returns of Nigerian publicly quoted firms Return?\n1.4    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\nThe broad objective of this study is to investigate the impact of a set of market-based financial ratios on Stock Returns of companies quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Directly derived from the broad objective are the following specific objectives:\n1.    Determine whether there is significant relationship between Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Stock Returns;\n2.    Ascertain if there is significant relationship between Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio and Stock Returns;\n3.    Determine if there is a significant relationship between the ratio of Market Value to Book Value (MBV) and Stock Returns.\n1.5    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n           In order to proffer answers to the research questions and achieve the objectives of the study, the following three hypotheses stated in their null form are posed.\n H01: There is no significant relationship between Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Stock Returns of Nigerian publicly quoted firms.\nH02:  There is no significant relationship between Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio and Stock Returns of Nigerian publicly quoted companies\nH03:    There is no significant relationship between the ratio of Market Value to Book Value (MBV) and Stock Returns of Nigerian publicly quoted firms.\n1.6    THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n        Geographically, our scope is limited to the food and beverages sub-sector of the Nigerian equity market (bourse). Temporarily, the scope is limited to a time frame that ranges from financial year ended 2008 to 2013. Our subject matter scope is on the impact of a set of market based financial ratios on stock market returns of some selected firms in the oil and gas sector of the stock market. The concept of Market-based Financial Ratios is loosely used in the study to refer to a set of financial information derived from financial statements; that can serve as a veritable tool for monitoring stock price trends and behaviour in the capital market. The time period covered by the study is considered long enough to assure the adequacy of data and reliability of results as the data was kept at both daily and weekly interval.\n1.7    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nAs noted by Shaibu (2012), the relevance of a study relates to whether the study contributes to knowledge or not, and its significance connotes the magnitude of its relevance or contribution to knowledge. Thus, the findings of this study will be important and useful in the formulation and implementation of stock investment policies and strategies, investment portfolios, and other investment decisions as well as a basis for further related studies. It will also contribute to the on-going debate on market efficiency and company fundamentals especially as it relates to the Nigeria Stock Exchange.\n1.8    LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\nIn general, the depth and thoroughness of this research was greatly constrained by some factors which were beyond the control of the researcher. The parameter values once incorporated within the regression model framework are assumed to be constant. This implies that the estimated coefficients are time-specific in nature and tend to be silent on breaks that may occur in the system. However, in reality financial markets are dynamic and market conditions change continuously with time. The regression model framework does not completely capture these shifts in market conditions; and this therefore forms a part of the limitations of the study.\nFurthermore, the sample size considered in this study is too small as its emphasis is on Nigeria alone as the focal point of the study; rather than on a larger sample consisting of many countries within and outside Africa. Besides, the fact that we resorted to the use of secondary data implies that we are faced with the biases and imperfections that often plague the use of secondary data worldwide. However these limitations do not significantly affect the quality of the findings and conclusion reached by the study.\n1.9    DEFINITION OF TERMS\nMarket-based Ratios:  These refer to investment ratios. They are tools derived from the financial statements of firms and could be used by investors to monitor stock returns trends and behaviour in the capital market.\nEPS: this refers to the distributable profit per unit of ordinary share\nP/E: this refers to the ratio of market price per ordinary share to the distributable profit per ordinary share\nMBV: this refers to the ratio of the current market value the public attach to an ordinary share, to the nominal value of the share.\nStock returns: this refers to the proceeds from investing in equities for the current and future period. It is the sum of capital gain and dividend received on investment in stock, usually expressed in percentage.\nFinancial market efficiency: a situation whereby a financial market is perfect and not being characterized by information asymmetry\nEMH:  Efficient Market Hypothesis is the theory that assumes financial markets are characterized by information symmetry and hence, investors cannot use the existing information to make abnormal profits.\nAbnormal returns: these are returns in excess of the average market returns on stock in the capital market.\nNSE: Nigerian Stock Exchange\nNPV: Net Present value\nSEC:  Securities and Exchange Commission\nCAPM: Capital Asset Pricing Model.\n\nTHE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RATIOS ON STOCK MARKET RETURNS OF SOME SELECTED NIGERIAN PETROLEUM FIRMS\n",

Today’s business environment is extremely dynamic and experience rapid changes as a result of technological improvement, increased awareness and demands banks to serve their customers electronically. Banks have traditionally in the forefront of harnessing technology to improve their products and services.\nThe banking industry of the 21st century operates in a complex and competitive environment characterized by these changing conditions and highly unpredictable economic climate. Information and communication technology (ICT) is at the centre of this global change curve of electronic banking system in Nigeria today (Steven’s 2002). Assets that they have over the time been using electronic and tele –communication networks for delivery a wide – range of value added products and service, managers in banking industry in Nigeria cannot ignore information systems because they play a very critical impact on current banking system, they point out that the entire cash flow of most fortune banks are linked to information system.\nThe application of information and communication technology concepts, techniques policies and implementation strategies to banking services has become as subject of fundamental important end concerns to all banks and indeed a pa-requisite for local and global competitiveness banking.\nThe advancement in technology has played an important role in improving service delivery standards in the banking industry. In its simplest form, Automated Teller – machines (ATM) and deposit machines now allow consumers carry out banking transactions beyond banking hours with online banking, individuals can check their account balances and make payments without having to go to the bank hall. This is gradually creating a cashless society where consumes no longer have to pay for all their purchases with hard cash. For example; bank customers can pay for airtime tickets and subscribe to initial public offerings by transferring the money directly from their accounts, or pay for various goods and services by electronic transfers of credit to the sellers account. As most people now own mobile phone, banks have also introduced mobile banking to cater for customers who are always on the move. Mobile banking allows individuals to check their account balances and make funds transfer using their mobile phones. This was popularized by First Atlantic Bank (now FinBank Plc) through its “flash me cash” products customers can also recharge their mobile phones Via SMS. Electronic Banking has made banking transactions easier around the world and it is fast gaining acceptance in Nigeria. The delivery channels today in Nigeria electronic banking are quite numerous has it is mentioned here ATM, Point of Sales (POS), Telephone Banking, Smart cards, Internet Banking etc. personal computers on the banking industry was first introduced into Nigeria by society Generale Bank as the popular PC easy access to the internet and world wide web (www) and internet is increasingly used by banks as a channel of delivering the products and services to the numerous customers. Virtually almost all banks in Nigeria have a web presence; this form of banking is referred to as Internet Banking which is generally part of Electronic Banking.\nThe delivery of products by banks on public domain is an indication of advertisement which is known as electronic commence. E-commence on the other hand is a general term for any type of business or commercial transaction, it involves the transfer of information across the internet. E- commence involves individuals and business organization exchanging business information and instructions over electronic media using computers, telephones and other communication equipments. This covers a range of different types of business from consumers to retails products. However, electronic banking as it as a product of E – commence in the field of banking and financial services. Its offers different online services like balance enquiry, request for cheque books, recording stop payment instructions, balance transfer instructions, account opening and other form of traditional banking services, the internet allows businesses to use information more effectively by allowing customers, suppliers, employees and partners to get access to the business information they need, when they need it. These internets enable services all translate to reduced cost. There are less overhead, greater economies of scale and increased efficiency.\nE-banking greatest promise is timeliness, more valuable information accessible to more people at reduced cost of information access, with the changes in business operations as a result of the internet era, security concerns move from computer labs to the front page of newspapers. The proms of E – banking is offset by the security challenges associated with the disintermediation of data access. One security challenges results from “cutting out the middleman”, that too often cuts out the information secure the middleman provides. Another is the expansion of the user community from a small group of know vetted users accessing data from the internet to thousands of users accessing data from the internet. Application service providers (ASP) and exchange offer especially stringent and sometimes contradictory requirements of per user and per customer security, while allowing secure data sharing among communities of interest.\nE –banking depends on providing customers, partners and employees with access to information, in a way that is controlled and secured.\nTechnology must provide security to meet the challenges encountered by E – banking. Virtually all software and hardware vendors claims to build  secured products, but what assurance does an  E- banking have of a product security? E – banking want a clear answer. To the conflicting security claims they hear from vendors, how can you be confident about the security? Built into a product? Independent security evaluations against internationally established security criteria provide assurance of vendors’ security claims. Customers expectation in terms of service delivery and other key factors have increased dramatically in recent years as a result of the promise and delivery of the internet. Even after the “dot – com crash”, these raised expectations linger. The growth in the applications and acceptance of the internet – driven technologies means that delivering an enhanced service is more achievable than ever before, however it is also more complex and fraught with potential cost and risk. The internet introduce customers to a new perception of business time as always “on available” 24/7, and demanding an urgent and rapid response. The challenge for managers is to reconcile their business and their own personal perceptions of time with the perceived reality of internet time. The internet has decisively shifted the balance of power to the customer. The internet is revolutionizing sales techniques and perceptions of leading brands and the internet is intensifying competition in all its forms. Banking are continuing to use the internet to add value for their customers’, but in order for this to work effectively – maximizing opportunities, reducing risks and overcoming problems. An E- banking strategy is required as an impact.\nThe growth of the web and internet as new channels, the growth in their use by customers, the growth in their use by employees and the floor of companies entering the market, present a series of key challenges to companies, it is easy and cheap to put up a website. But to create an environment delivery effective service on the web to a significant proportion of your customer requires an E- banking.\n1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n  In Nigeria, customers of banks today are no longer concerned about safety of their funds and increase returns on their investments only. Customers demand efficient, fast and convenient services. Customers want a bank that offer them services that will meet their particular needs (personalized banking) and support their business goals, for instance, a businessman want to travel without carrying out cash for security reasons. They want to be able to check their balance online, find out if a cheque is cleared, transfer funds among accounts and even want to download transaction records into their own computer at works or home. Customers want a preferential treatment and full attention by their choice bank. All these are only achievable through Electronic Banking.\n1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\nThe main objectives of this research work is to examine the impact of Electronic Banking in Nigerian Banking System, on how difference channels could enhance the delivery of customers and retails products and also how Banks chose to support their Electronic Banking component/services internally, such as Internet Service Provider (ISP), Bill payment providers, credit business and credit scoring company, E-banking system rely on a number of common components or process. Specifically the study objectives are:\n(i)    To evaluate the prospects of E –banking in Unity Bank Plc.\n(ii)    To evaluate the impacts of E – banking in Unity Bank Plc.\n(iii)    To examine whether E – banking has improved the fortune of banks.\n(iv)    To examine the effect of E – banking has it improve the fortune of the Banks.\n(v)    To examine whether the Bank Electronic Banking guide line comply with the CBN electronic Banking guideline policy.\n1.4    STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\nThe following hypothesis is formulated in Null form to guide the study.      \n1.    HO: Electronic Banking does has no prospects in the Nigeria Banking System.\nHI: Electronic Banking has prospects in the Nigeria Banking System.\n2.    HO:    Electronic Banking has no impact on the Nigerian Banking System.\nHI:    Electronic Banking has an impact on the Nigerian Banking System.\n3.    HO:    Electronic Banking has no significant impact on performance and risk profile of Banks.\nHI: Electronic Banking has significant impact on performance and risk profile of Banks.\n1.5    SIGNIFICANE OF THE STUDY\nThe study would enable the banks executive and indeed the policy makers of the banks and financial institutions to be aware of electronic banking as a product of electronic commence with a view to making strategic decisions. The research is equally significant because it would provide answers to factors militating against the implementation of electronic banking in the Unity Bank Plc; prove the success and growth associated with implementation of electronic banking highlight the areas of banking operations that can be enhance via electronic banking and also be an invaluable tool for students, Academican, institutions, corporate managers and individual that want to know more about Electronic Banking trends especially in Nigeria.\n1.6    SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY SCOPE\nIn pursuance of the objectives of the study; attention shall be focused on electronic banking among other electronic commence implementation. In order to conduct an empirical investigation into the adoption of electronic banking in Nigeria and will also examine the nature of electronic banking operations in Unity Bank Plc from 2003 to 2010.\nLIMITATIONS\n    Finance constraints on this study was also in fact the must and major limitations factor inspite of this students and researchers have to travel out to the sampled organization to inter – view some members of the organization in question. Time constraints is another major factor to the researcher of this kind, its required enough time in gathering of data, but it was not given to carry out the research, distribution, collection and analysis of questionnaire. Also the school system has made it difficult for student to go out in search for information by not granting exit for student, some banks withheld information from students / researchers who desires such information on other to protect the bank secrecy thereby making it difficult for students/researchers to gather information for their research.\n1.7    DEFINITION OF RELATED TERMS\nAccess Products: Products that allow customers to access traditional payment instrument electronically, generally from remote locations.\nATM Card: UB Debit card is a chip device consisting of circuit element on single silicon chip.

Research on value relevance of accounting information, its historical development and its comparison among different countries has increased since the 1990s. There has been concerns as to whether financial statements are losing their value relevance due to the shift from an industrialized economy to a high-tech, service oriented economy(Dontoh., Radhakrishman., & Ronen, 2012),and as to whether cross-country differences in disclosure and measurement practices cause differences in the quality of accounting information.\nHowever, value relevant, harmonious accounting standards alone are not sufficient to improve the financial reporting environment. Accounting standards should be of good quality, and be acceptable and enforceable. Value relevance is one of the basic attributes of accounting quality (Francis, LaFond, Olsson &Schipper 2004; &Beisland, 2009). The value relevance was weak in the periods of political crisis caused by military dictatorship (1992-1998) and global economic crisis (2005-2009), it was high in the other periods. Value relevance is defined as the ability of accounting numbers contained in the financial statements to explain the stock market measures (Beisland, 2009). Value relevance is being defined as the ability of information disclosed by financial statements to capture and summarize firm value.\nAccounting information is any data or information obtains from the accounting system of a firm whether contained in a financial statement, a special report, or verbal statement (William, 1968). However, for the purpose of this research, accounting information refers to written information contained in a complete or partial financial report –balance sheet or profit and loss account or fund flow statement. Accounting information must possess two qualitative features: relevance and reliability; to be acceptable and useful to investors. Thus, accounting information, derivable from the financial statements, will not be useful if either of the two prominent characteristics totally fades out. Barth, Beaver, and Landsman. (2001) stated that studying the relevance and reliability of accounting information separately is difficult because these criteria are conflicting parameters and the amount of them are not determined in theoretical concepts of financial reporting. Studies on value relevance of accounting information are motivated by the fact that listed companies use financial statements as one of the major media of communication with their equity shareholders and public at large (Vishnani,&Shah, 2008).  \nFor instance, in Nigeria, Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), (1990) and the subsequent amendments require. The Directors of all companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange to prepare and publish annually the financial statements. Beyond this, the Nigerian Stock Exchange mandates all companies listed on first tier market to submit quarterly, semi-annual and annual statements of their accounts to the Stock Exchange. Companies on second tier market are to submit their statements of accounts annually to Stock Exchange (Osaze, 2007). This study investigates whether these various items of financial statements are value relevant in the Nigerian Stock Exchange or not.  \n1.2        Statement of the Problem\nAccording to the previous studies many researchers used relationship between Market price per share as the dependent variable and a set of independent variables. Ball and Brown in 1968, highlighted the relationship between stock prices and the accounting information disclosed in the financial statements. Ball, and Brown. (1968) explained that the value of a firm can be expressed as a linear function of book value, earnings and other relevant information.There has also been considerable volatility (and uncertainty) in the past few years in mature and emerging financial markets worldwide (Alexander, 1999). It is also well established in the accounting literature that stock price volatility tends to increase around accounting information events (beaver, 1968).The value and the quality of accounting information are determined by how well it meets the needs of users (Khanagha, 2011).Negah, (2008) asserts that studies on the value relevance of accounting numbers in emerging markets are limited. He further claims that the scanty literature replicates works done in mature markets and that closer examination of these works reveals that they face both epistemological and empirical challenges.\nFurthermore, all the previous studies relate to a certain time frame and given the dynamic nature of accounting, there is therefore a continued need to fill the gaps of what is known about the effect of accounting information on stock volatility.\n1.3    Research Questions\n1.     What is the relationship between book value per share and stock volatility in the Nigerian Stock Market?\n2.    What is the relationship between dividend per share and stock volatility in the Nigerian Stock Market?\n3.    What is the relationship between earnings per share and stock volatility in the Nigerian Stock Market?\n1.4        Objectives of the Study\nThe objectives of the study are:\n1.    To determine the relationship between book value per share and stock volatility in the Nigerian Stock Market.\n2.    To examine the relationship between dividend per share and stock volatility in the Nigerian Stock Market.\n3.    To ascertain the relationship between earnings per share and stock volatility in the Nigerian Stock Market.\n1.5        ResearchHypotheses\nThe following hypotheses have been specified for the purpose of the study\nH01:     There is no significant relationship between book value per share and stock volatility in Nigeria.\nHo2:     There is no significant relationship between dividend per share and stock volatility in Nigeria.\nHo3:    There is no significant relationship between earnings per share and stock volatility in Nigeria.\n1.6     Scope of the Study\nThis study provides insight into value relevance of accounting information in the Nigerian stock market and it covers a period of 5years from 2011 to 2015. Data were collected through secondary sources.\n1.7Significance of the Study\nNigeria is the most populous country in Africa with a population of 146.3 million (Ibidapo-Obe, 2009), and its stock exchange. Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)) is the third largest in the continent with market capitalization of US $82 billion at end of 2007(Kumo, 2008).The relevance of any study stem from its importance to respective users or the beneficiaries of such research works. Government at all levels will find this work very interesting as it reveals the extent and the environment which is conducive enough that will propel investment climate.\nPolicy makers in the banking industry will benefit immensely from the study as it redirects and refocuses their attention to the significance of financial information in the financial service industry. To shareholders, this study will reposition the confidence of all the parties in the banking industry and the potential investors as regards their investment decisions in the banking industry. The study is hoped to add to the existing literature and knowledge in promoting investment decisions in Nigeria. The research work will also be a guide to students wishing to make further research in the field.\n1.8    Limitation to the Study\nThis research was hindered due to the following factors\n1.    Financial constraint: finance is the key to the success of everything research work and the said finance was readily unavailable as at the time of carrying out this research.\n2.    Time constraint: The time stipulated for the submission of this work was obviously too short and as such was unable to cover all the companies registered under the Nigeria stock market.\n1.9        Definition of Terms\n1.    Value relevance: Value relevance is being defined as the ability of information disclosed by financial statements to capture and summarize firm value.\n2.    Earnings per share: Earnings per share (EPS) is the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. Earnings per share serves as an indicator of a company's profitability.\n3.    Book Value per share: The book value per share formula is used to calculate the per share value of a company based on its equity available to common shareholders. Also known as net asset value per share.\n4.    Accounting information: An accounting information system (AIS) is a system of collecting, storing and processing financial and accounting data that are used by decision makers.\n5.    Dividends: This is cash dividends. Money paid to stockholders, normally out of the company's current earnings or accumulated profits.\n6.            Financial Statements: Statement of the accounting policies; the balance sheet as at the last day of the year; a profit and loss account or, in the case of a company not trading for profit, an income and expenditure account for the year; notes on the accounts;  the auditors reports; the directors’ report; a statement of the source and application of fund; a value added statement the year; a five – year financial summary; and in the case of a holding company, the group financial for statements as stipulated in CAMA, 1990\n7.    Market value: This is the current price at which securities are bought and sold in the market. It is the price the market assigns to the company’s share.\n8.    Stock Exchange: Stocks are listed and traded on stock exchange which is an entity a corporation or mutual organization that specializes in the business of bringing buyers and sellers of the organizations to a listing of stocks and securities together.\n9.

It is forward looking (futuristic) and not historical.\nManagement accounting has be defined by chartered institute of management accounting (CIMA) 0as the p0rocess of identification, measurement, analysis, accumulation, preparation, interpretation, and communication of information used by to plan, evaluate an control within an entity and to ensure appropriate use and accountability of it resources. Management accounting also comprises the preparation of financial report for non 1. management group such as shareholders, creditors, regulatory agencies and tax authorities. CIMA, (2001).\n  Management accounting as a practice extend to the following three areas;\n1.     Strategic management: Advancing the role of the management accountant as a strategic partner in organization.\n2.     Performance management: Developing the practice of business decision making and managing the performance of the organization.\n3.     Risk management: Contributing to the frame work and practices for identifying, measuring, managing and reporting risk to the achievement of the objective of the organization.\n The origin of management accounting which as a branch of accounting has been trace to the nineteenth century. The accounting practice that was in use in the mid 1980’S has  been developed in 1925.For the next 60yrs  there was a slow down in the development of accounting, these was attributed to the demand of product cost information for external report. The separation of ownership from manager gave rise to the requirement of financial report (an audited financial report which should be provided annually) and must be conform with the laid down rule of the Generally Accepted accounting principle.\n Some of the important or significance of management accounting are as followed:\n1.    It provides information for the control, planning, performance evaluation and continuous improvement.\n2.    Allocations of cost between cost of goods sold and inventory for internal and external profit reporting.\n3.    Provision of relevant information to help to help managers make relevant information.\nHOW MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING INFORMATION HELP THE MANAGEMENT\n1.    For effective planning: Budget(goals and desire of management in quantifiable term) and performance report (comparing budget information and actual information).\n2.    To direct operations: examine cost/price re0lationship0 to develop market/advertising strategies.\n3.    For prob0lem solving: Determination of appropriate re0lationship between cost and price for forecasting.\nTHE DIFFERENCE AND SIMILIARTIES OF MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING\nFinancial accounting report what happened in the past (historical data), it is for external use, it has very précised information that follows rules and it is mandatory for business.\n Management accounting on the other hand provides data that are used internally by managers for their day to day operations. It place emphasis on the future- production of cost and revenue of alternate course of action. It emphasize and flexibility of data – information must be relevant to the problem at hand rather than follow a set of rule. Management need to make a good estimate do not necessary need to follow a set of rule.\nIt place emphasis on non-monetary data and estimate with less emphasis precision. It also emphasize on segment or department of the organization rather than whole; for example department, division etc.\nManagement accounting is not mandatory, an organization is completely free to do as much as little management accounting as it wishes. The most important question is “is the information useful”. Marquise, (2010).\nSIMILIARITIES BETWEEN MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING                                         \n1. Management accounting relies on financial accounting information (unbiased support materials).\n2.     Both are concerns with responsibility on stewardship to organizations.\n3.

(G. Inthumati, 2011).\n    Mergers is statutorily defined as any amalgamation of undertakings of two or more companies or corporate bodies (section 509 of CAMA 1990).\n    The financial reporting standard (FRS) defines mergers as a business combination that results in the creation of a new reporting entity formed by the combining parties in which the shareholders of the combined business come together in a partnership for mutual sharing of risk and benefits of the combined entity and in which no party to the combination in substance obtains control over any other is seen to be dominant.\n    Merger is the combination of two or more companies, generally by offering the stockholders me company securities in the acquiring company for the surrender of their stock (Investopetia).\n    Merger also the combination of two or more companies into one with only retaining it identity. Typically the larger of the two companies is the company whose identity is maintained. If often involves an exchange of stock, called pooling interest, which avoids taxes. The purchase (accounting) method where good will is recorded can also be used. (John w. Hansen 2007).\n    In Nigeria and other emerging economics, mergers has been embraced as a panacea to the seemingly mutiny global economic recession.\n    According to Akamokhor (1989:2) gives the current economic crisis facing Algeria there is no doubt that the mergers will continue to be major avenue open to firms in the country trying to resolve the problem of youth and insolvency.\n    To this end there is a need for corporate management to be concern about the subject matter (mergers) either as a possible target for acquisition or seeking to require another firm.\n    One of the significant objectives of any economy is achieving high rate of economic growth.   In achieving this, corporate entities keep on improving its policies and explore various  available options both at micro and macro levels, and business combination is an external approach to this objective.\n1.1    STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM\n    In the recent past in Nigeria business environment mergers and other forms of business combination have become an imperative option for most business entities.\n    The question therefore is, to mergers and others forms of business combination health and ultimately improves the general performance of the business.\n    This study seeks to specially compare the pre and post mergers performance of merging companies (United Bank for Africa and Standard Trust Bank between year 2001 – 2005 and 2007 – 2010).\n1.2    STATEMENT OF RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n    This research seeks to provide answer to the following  questions;\n1)    Are there any financial, benefits of mergers?\n2)    What are the non financial benefits of mergers?\n3)    Does mergers give rise to  improve working conditions and motivate for employees?\n1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n    The study aims at finding out if there are different in the overall corporate performance of companies after mergers has taken place.\n    Other objectives of the study includes:\n1)    To ascertain the effect of mergers on employees.\n2)    To critically analyse the non-financial of mergers (if any)\n3)    To find out the success factors for mergers (if any)\n1.4    SCOPE OF STUDY\n    This study seeks to examine the effects (if any) of mergers in corporate performance. The examination will be carried out in the banking sector (Standard Trust Bank and United Bank for Africa 2002 – 2010).\n    The examination will be carried out by analyzing the financial statements of the banks before mergers are the mergers. The analysis will be done using the various accounting ratios (probability ratio, liquidity ratio, asset management ratio etc) and also the use of questionnaire.\n1.5    RESEARCH LIMITATION\n    Some possible limitation to this work indicate\n1.

It exists because it satisfies primarily a need for information. Consequently, for more than four decades of accounting research especially capital market based research, emphasis has been placed on market efficiency i.e. testing the information content of accounting numbers, in an attempt to determine whether or not accounting information is value relevant and useful for investment decision making. Researches in this field began from the seminal works of Ball and Brown (1968) and Beaver (1968) that examined empirically the value relevance of accounting earnings and its implications for users of such information. While accounting theorists and practitioners held a dim view of whether historical cost accounting numbers accurately reflected a firm’s financial health, scientific evidence on the issue did not exist. Providing empirical evidence to ascertain whether accounting numbers contained or conveyed information about a firm’s financial performance was the major motivation that led to the research of Ball and Brown (1968) and Beaver (1968). There were three major concurrent developments in finance and economics that forged the way for the seminal research by both Ball and Brown (1968) and Beaver (1968).The subject of value relevance has now been placed on the pedestal of accounting based capital market studies and is of a great interest to investors, managers, standard setters, and other market participants. The interest stems from the fact that security prices determine the allocation of wealth among firms and individuals. The security prices themselves are influenced by financial information, which explains academic and practicing accountants and standard setters’ interest in market efficiency research. \n\nThe term relevance as a quality of accounting information as used in accounting literature is defined by the American Accounting Association (1966:9),  “For information to meet the standard of relevance, it must bear on or be usefully associated with the action it is designed to facilitate or the result desired to produce. This requires that either the information or the act of the communicating exert influence on the designated action”. Relevance thus implies the ability of the information to influence decisions of both potential and existing investors whether by changing or confirming their expectations about the result or consequences of actions or events. Accounting value relevance is a concept that has admitted a number of definitions and measures.\n\nGordon and Gordon (2002) in their empirical explanation of “value relevance posit that Value relevance measures the joint response of earning or some other measure of the accounting and market returns to information arrival. Gordon et al (2002) further explain that value relevance represents the association between the information impounded in the accounts and the information impounded by the market.\n\nAccording to Beaver (1968), Value relevance is the explanatory power of accounting information with respect to security prices. In their empirical study, LO and Lys (2000) state that Value relevance of accounting information or number, is the examination of the association between market value and accounting summary measures such as earnings and book values. The usefulness of accounting information or value relevance in equity valuation has been a primary paradigm in financial accounting research.\n\nThe studies on value relevance are broad and diverse. It is important to define the structure of concept of value relevance for this study. Some researchers may regard ability of accounting information to summarize business transactions and other events(the measurement view of value relevance) as sufficient proof of value relevance of accounting data, others may place greater emphasis on earnings prediction (the prediction view of value relevance) or information content of accounting data(the information view of value relevance), and so on. Therefore, the approach used for this study to determine the value relevance of accounting data in Nigeria. This is ability of financial statement to capture or summarize information that affects equity value.\n\nAccording to Kothari (1999) a review of extant literature reveals that two approaches have often been employed to testing the value relevance of accounting information. They are; Events studies and Association studies. In an event study, one infers whether an event, such as an earnings announcement, conveys new information to market participants as reflected in changes in the level or variability of security prices or trading volume over a short time period around the event (Collins and Kothari, 1989, Watts and Zimmerman, 1986). If the level or variability of prices changes around the event date, then the conclusion is that the accounting event conveys new information about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows that revised the market’s previous expectations and thus value relevant. The maintained hypothesis in an event study is that accounting information is value relevant in the sense that security prices are quick to reflect the newly arrived information. Since event studies test for the arrival of information through an accounting event, they are also referred to as tests of information content in the capital markets literature in accounting. Besides Ball and Brown (1968) and Beaver (1968), other examples of event studies include Foster (1977), Wilson (1986), Ball and Kothari (1991), Amir and Lev (1996), and Vincent (1999). Problems associated to this method consist firstly, on the difficulty of choice of the adequate interval of measure, which must surround normally the event by some hours, days or weeks before and after the announcement and secondly, on the conclusion from results of those studies, which can question the truthfulness of hypothesis of market efficiency.\n\nOn the other hand, Association studies consist on estimating regression models of market performance of the company on its financial performance and allow us to measure the degree of correlation between prices movements and accounting information on a very definite interval of time. We use in general the adjusted coefficient R2 which informs us about the explanatory power of accounting information as regards its relevance to explain prices movements. Therefore, the response coefficient of explanatory variables is used as indicator of their information content and their value relevance.\n\nHowever, the empirical results on the subject of value relevance in contemporary researches especially across emerging stock markets tend to be inconclusive. Numerous literatures in the developed countries have created the impression that accounting information and numbers have lost their value relevance (Core,Guay & Buskirk, 2003; Dontoh, Radhakrishnan and Ronen 2001). The criticisms leveled are based on the following; the transformation in firm’s structure and activities, Fraud, window dressing of financial report and rapidly changing business environment. Although, other studies (Collins, Maydew and Weiss 1997, Balachandran and Moharan 2006), notes that the claims that accounting information has lost its value relevance may be quite premature.\n\nIn our perspective, the issues go beyond the fundamental analysis of the adequacy of accounting information with regards to its value relevance on one hand to issues of user trust and public confidence on the accounting information provided. Accounting informativeness becomes relevant to the extent that it forms the basis for investment decision and explains an appreciable level of investor behavior. Thus, in a situation of investor apathy resulting from distrust and declining user and public confidence on corporate claims as presented in public financials and other means of communicating to the market, the value relevance of accounting information would thus be unpredictable. This study attempts to examine the subject of value relevance of accounting information in the Nigerian capital market and consequently, boost the empirical evidence from emerging markets.\n\n1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nFundamental capital market analysis such as knowing the market position, amount and value of shares available for offer, when to buy or sell a particular stock, how much he should invest in such stocks, needs relevant accounting information in the form of financial statement, accounting numbers, figures and data.Therefore for such information to be valid, it must be accurate and give a true picture of the market situation of recent there has been criticism by capital market researchers in accounting with regards to the value relevance of accounting information. Numerous literatures in the developed countries have created the impression that accounting information and numbers have lost their value relevance (Dontoh, Radhakrishnan and Ronen 200, Core,Guay & Buskirk, 2003). The criticisms leveled are based on the following; the transformation in firm’s structure and activities, Fraud, window dressing of financial report and rapidly changing business environment.\n\nOn the contrary, studies (Collins, Maydew and Weiss 1997, Balachandran and Moharan 2006), notes that the claims that accounting information has lost its value relevance is premature. Balachandran and Moharan (2006) in a recent study of the value relevance of accounting information, concludes that there is no evidence that there is increasing decline in value relevance. Furthermore, Callao, Cuellar and Jarne (2006) perform a comparative analysis of the value relevance of reported earnings and their components. Their study gave evidence of value relevance of net earnings figure. Gjerde, Kaivsla and Saettem (2007) find that the time trend of overall value-relevance has not declined after controlling for changes in underlying economic variables.\n\nThis inconclusive evidence in literature has created a gap. Thus there is a need to examine the issue from different research context and data sets. It is against this background that this study attempts to examine the value relevance of accounting information in the Nigerian capital market and thus provide evidence from Nigeria.\n\nIn the light of this, the research questions are;\n\n1.           Is the informativeness of earnings per share value relevant in the Nigerian capital market?\n\n2.           Is the informativeness of Return on equity value relevant in the Nigerian capital market?\n\n3.           Is the informativeness of dividend per share is value relevant in the Nigerian capital market?\n\n4.           To examine if the informativeness of Earnings yield is value relevant in the Nigerian capital market.\n\n \n\n \n\n1.3       RESEARCH OBJECTIVES\n\nThe main objectives of the study are to examine the value relevance of accounting information in the Nigerian stock market and thus provide evidence from Nigeria.  The objectives are stated as follows;\n\n1.                  To examine if the informativeness of earnings per share is value relevant   in the Nigerian capital market.\n\n2.                  To evaluate whether the informativeness of Return on equity is value relevant   in the Nigerian capital market.\n\n3.                  To ascertain if the informativeness of dividends per share is value relevant in the Nigerian capital market.\n\n4.                  To examine if the informativeness of Earnings yield is value relevant in the Nigerian capital market.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\nThe following hypotheses were formulated for the purpose of the study. The hypothesis will test the value relevance of specific accounting numbers analyzed individually and jointly. The purpose is to examine the incremental value relevance effects of multiple accounting numbers.\n\n1.                   The informativeness of earnings per share is value relevant in the Nigerian capital market.\n\n2.                  The informativeness of Return on equity is value relevant in the Nigerian capital market.\n\n3.                  The informativeness of dividends per share and Return on equity considered jointly improves value relevance in the Nigerian capital market.\n\n4.                  To examine if the informativeness of Earnings yield is value relevant in the Nigerian capital market.\n\n1.4    SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of the study may be specified in terms of the boundaries of the subject matter, the number of companies and the time period respectively.\n\nThis study attempts to examine the value relevance of accounting information in Nigeria. Thus the study examines selected accounting numbers and examines their value relevance in the capital market with regards to share price behavior. The study examines twenty quoted companies for a four year period (2004-2008).\n\n 1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study will explore the value relevance of accounting numbers. It is hoped that the study will serve as an inspiration to other potential students, institutions, stock market researchers in accounting or individuals as well as contribute to the growth and development of the Nigerian stock market, serve as data bank for future research. Since no comprehensive study has explored this subject, therefore this study attempts to fill in the gap in literature and knowledge. Moreover, it is hoped that the study will assist in practice and standard setting, which in turn will increase investor’s confidence in the Nigerian stock market.\n\n \n\n \n\n1.6       LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nWhile there have been a number of studies on this topic in developed countries, as at when this research took place and based on existing knowledge no comprehensive study has explored the subject. This resulted in difficulties in the collation and assessing of numerous indigenous write-ups and opinions. We consider this a limitation to the study.\n\n \n\nREFERENCES\n\nAmerican Accounting Association (1996): “A statement of basic \n\n            accounting theory.”      \n\nAmir, E.

The threats are worsen by globalization and the advent of modern information technology that are combined to replace old business practices and advanced the pace electronically manipulated fraud on corporate financial mismanagement. The problem with the present companies is that they focus more on financial transactions than on the totality of the entities’ operation and often time neglect areas where there have been constant leakages of other original resources that are of financial consequences but which are not easily detected with a normal analysis of the financial statement.\nThis project is set out to analyze the appraisal of public awareness on forensic accounting in Nigeria. Forensic accounting professional is more of a private investigator with a financial sixth sense than the book keeper with a green eyeshade. Did you know that the first actor to play the world’s most famous detective Sherlock Holmes was on Accountant? It was only a matter of time, then before detective work and accounting came together to form the Super Sleuth Career now known as Forensic Accounting (Florida Atlantic University School of Accounting. February, 2008).\nIt is a thrill of hunt. Maurice E. Feloubet who coined the term forensic accounting in 1946 said that the Preparation of Financial Statements has some but not all the characteristics of forensic accounting.\nForensic accountant takes a more proactive, skeptical approach in examining the books of accounting. The word “Forensic means relating to the use of science or technology in the investigations and establishment of facts or evidences” (Wikipedia Encyclopedia, July 2011).\nAccording to the Dictionary by Farlex (2011) defined  forensic accounting as a branch of accounting that uses investigative skills to determine the accuracy of a company’s financial statements in legal disputes.\n(Webopedia, 2010), define accounting as the process of keeping track of users activities while accessing networks, resources including the amount of time spent in the network, the services accessed while there and the amount of data transferred during the session. Accounting data is used for trend analysis, capacity planning, billing, auditing and cost allocation.\nForensic accounting, sometimes referred to as investigative accounting, is a unique career field that combines accounting with information technology. A forensic accountant uses sophisticated computer programs to analyze financial data and find evidence that would be legally valid during a court proceeding. Objectives verification is the primary goal of forensic accounting. For this reason, many forensic accounting professionals are asked to testify in court cases as expert witnesses for either the prosecution or the defense. (www.wibegeek.com, June, 2011).\nA number of studies investigate the efficacy of forensic accounting utilizes accounting, auditing and investigative skills to conduct an examination into a company’s financial statement which is suitable for court. Forensic is sufficiently thorough and complete so that an accountant can deliver his findings in some adverbial legal proceeding or with some judicial or administrative review. The primary methodology employed by forensic accountant is objective verification. (site map/forensic accounting demystified 2010).\nForensic Accounting is the practices of utilizing accounting, auditing and investigative skills to assist in legal matters. It encompasses two main areas: Litigation support, investigation and dispute resolution.\nInvestigation is the act of determining whether criminal matter such as, employee theft, securities fraud, identity theft and insurance fraud have occurred. As part of the forensic accountants work, he or she may recommend actions that can be taken to minimize future risk of loss. Investigation may also occur in civil matters. For example the forensic accountant may search for hidden assets in divorce cases.\nAderibigbe (2000) sums up that the serious issues rendered by the forensic chartered accountants to include out of court settlement reviewing a large volume of documentation ranging from the more usual accounting records and management information system to memos, communicating complex theoretical ideas in a manner readily understood by the layman valuation of business, qualifying economic losses resulting from motor vehicle accidents etc.\nAccording to Stevenson Smith (2005) “Forensic Accounting is the study and interpretations of accounting evidence.\nThis research work (Forensic Accounting) is now becoming the chief cornerstone of accounting, Omoniyi (2004), opined that forensic accounting is fastly becoming one of the strongest growth areas in the accounting profession.\nAccording to Anao (2002), Okoye (2000) Ilaboya (2005), Izedonmi (2001) in financial institutions the position of the accountants is very vital such that he stands as the epitome of ethical reference.\nForensic Accounting makes do of indebt knowledge of psychological theories relating to criminal behaviour literally in the use of computers and information technology.\nOmoniyi (2004) also sees forensic accounting in the light of interpretation and analysis of complex financial data to give evidence that will be admissible in a court of competent jurisdiction from all that has been said in the above about what this entails, it would be seen that it could help bring about economic growth and development in the Nigeria economy.\nAbati (2003) observe that the problem in Nigeria is that the rules are never uniformly applied, some public office holder are just simply above the law. While some can be crucified for stealing a penny forensic accounting does not sleep and let perpetrators of fraud get away. It pierces through the veil of incorporation and brings perpetrators of fraud to justices.\nIn Nigeria, the demand forensic accounting is now on the rise, the EFCC is doing a good job in the application of the knowledge of forensic accounting in tracking down fraudsters. Money laundering in the Nigeria economy is a phenomenon little known to the ordinary Nigeria.\nAccording to Ribadu (2005) hundred money chases the same goods and services as hard earned income artificially pushing up the prices of goods and services beyond the buying power of the ordinary people.\nOne area forensic accounting has enjoyed application is the tracking down of politicians and their laundered funds, if the country called Nigeria has to move foreword it has to need forensic accounting.\nForensic accounting reasons and measures the awareness of this integral aspect of accounting amongst Nigerians. This is simply what this research work seeks to achieve.\n1.2    RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nThe study seeks to measure the awareness of forensic accounting in Nigeria which is not readily known at the moment.\n1.    Is forensic accounting of any importance to Nigeria’s economy?\n2.    What is the level of awareness among the Nigeria public?\n3.    Should forensic accounting be introduced into the curriculum of universities?\n4.    Will the study be of help to subsequent researchers in the new discipline where materials and text books exist?\n1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n1.    To examine the importance of forensic accounting Nigeri.\n2    To find out its level of awareness among the Nigeria public.\n3    To establish the introduction of forensic accounting into the curriculum of tertiary institution enjoys popular support.\n4    To establish ways by which the accountants can help close up the expectation gap.\n5    To establish if corrupt practices are set back for financial institutions and the country at large.\n6    To provide forensic accounting awareness that can develop the curriculum of tertiary institution.\n1.4    HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY\nHypothesis I\nHo:     forensic accounting is not important because it will not help reduce the ethical violations in the Nigeria banking sector.\nHi:     Forensic accounting is important because it help reduce the ethical violation in the Nigeria banking sector.\n Hypothesis II\nHo:     the awareness level of forensic accounting in Nigeria is not low\nHi:     the awareness level of forensic accounting in Nigeria is still very low.\nHypothesis III\nHo:     forensic accounting should not be introduced into the curriculum of universities because it does not help in building moral principles.\nHi:     forensic accounting should be introduced into the curriculum of universities because it helps in building moral principles in the students of accounting.\n1.5        SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThe focus is on the evidentiary nature of accounting data and topics including accounting fraud, forensic auditing, compliances due diligences and risks assessments, and detection of forensic statements, misinterpretation and tax evasion, bankruptcy valuation studies.\nThe study will focus on issues in forensic accounting, its importance curbing fraudulent practices mostly in the private sector. This study also talk about related areas of criminology, auditing and financial accounting. The subject of study in this research work includes the banking industry within Edo State and tertiary institutions across the state.\n1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n1.    The study will help expose unethical practices in the banking industry i.e. earning management creative accounting and how forensic accounting can help arrest the situation. This will make banks benefit greatly from this study.\n2.    Investors will also benefit from the study as it will help broaden their horizon about various unethical practice perpetuated in banks and how they stand to benefit from the services of the forensic chartered accountant in providing evidence admissible by the court during litigation.\n3.    It will not be out of order if a study is conducted on what is being referred to as the world fastest growing aspect of accounting.\n4.    The study will be of help to subsequent researchers in the new discipline where materials and text books exist.\n5.    The society will benefit as they can now know about the subject forensic accounting.\n6.    The study seeks to build moral principles that would control and influence the accountant’s behaviour.\n7.    This study is also important because it suggest the introduction of accounting ethics and forensic accounting as a course of study in higher institution, so as to develop the morals, integrity and honesty that the accounting profession requires.\nThe Nigerian government will benefit if put into practices, it will help reduce the rate of ethical violation in financial institution thus reducing the EFCC work load.\n1.7     LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\nSome of the limiting factors affecting the quality and quantity of data collected are:\n1.    Misrepresentation being given by students and lecturers.\n2.    The smallest of the sample size which consist institution of higher learning on Edo State only.\n3.    The inability to obtain a complete random sample\n4.    Imprecise measurement of variables.\n5.    Low response rate is also anticipated.\n 1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS OF STUDY\n1.    Accounting is the process of recording, analyzing, classifying summarizing a significant manner, reporting and communicating of financial information to user’s of such information.\n2.    Forensic is defined as the scientific tests or techniques used in the investigation of crimes of the use of science and technology to investigate and establish facts in criminal or civil court of law.\n3.    Forensic accounting is the application of accounting skills in exposing financial crimes and present to court admissible evidences.\n4.    Forensic accountants are professionals who use a unique blend of education and experiences to apply accounting, auditing and investigative skills to uncover truth, from legal opinions and assist in investigations.\n5.

Japan, Canada, the state of Michigan and many African countries.\n    According to the federal revenue service (FIRS), the idea of introducing VAT in Nigeria originated from the report of a study group set up by the federal government in 1991 to review the entire tax system. Subsequently, a committee as set up to carry out feasibility studies of its implementation. It should be noted that the committee was not requested to carry out any analysis of the impact of the tax, neither was there any active debate among the various interest group such as the organized private sector, labour unions and academic as well as other professionals, through which certain aspect of the impact might have been considered and taken into account in its design and implementation.\n    Eventually, government agreed to introduce VAT but the actual implementation did not commence until January 1994 after the promulgation of the value added tax decree No. 102 of 1993. According to the decree, a vatable organization is an existing manufacturer distributor, importer or supplier of goods and service.\n    Firstly, value added tax is a single rate (5%) tax which makes it easier to administer. Secondly it adopts the input – output tax mechanism, which makes itself policing specifically, although it is a multiple stage tax, it is expected to have a single stage tax on consumers price and should not add more than the specified rate to the consumers price no matter the number or stage at which the tax is paid. In essence, it is the official view that the VAT should not be cascading what so ever since the tax liability of on output and VAT on inputs. In other words, the credit method of connection should eliminate any cascading effects.\n    It should be clear that the Nigerian VAT is a replacement of the sale tax which had been in operation under the federal government legislated decree No. 7 of 1986 which had a narrow base and discriminated against locally produced goods and services as it exclude import. The sale tax revenue accrued exclusively to the state government, while the VAT revenue is now shared by all level of government. As such it can be assumed that the VAT revenue is not sterilized but injected through increased government finance consumption expenditure.\n    Moreover, VAT is paid on virtually all goods and services but the credit system implies that VAT revenue received by government should be devoid of any cascading.\n    Value Added Tax is a consumption tax levied in value of goods and services in value in the cause of their production or supply (Anyanaduba: 1999). Value Added Tax is tax on the supply of goods and services which government reasoned it will be virtually impossible to avoid tax (Ama, 2000).\n1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n    As a result of the uncommon nature of VAT system, there are some problems relating to Value Added Tax system. These problems could seen as follows.\n1.    What is the effectiveness of VAT administration?\n2.    What is the assessment of the public as to effectiveness of VAT.?\n3.    What is the degree of performance of VAT.?\n1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n1.    The objective of this research work is to find out the effectiveness of the administration of VAT improving government revenue.\n2.    To find out our conduct a public opinion on the performance of VAT.\n3.    To establish the degree of performance of VAT in comparison to other indirect tax administration FIRS.\n1.4    SCOPE OF THE STUDY                \n    The research covers and concentrates on the performance appraisal of value added tax in Nigeria’s economy (the federal, state and local government) of some selected tax payer companies. The time frame covered is from 2000 to 2011. This time frame is particularly important because much emphasis is been laid on improving on ways to generate revenue for the three tiers of government to provide service for the citizen of Nigeria.\n1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n    It is hoped that this research work will be fundamental significance to the government of Nigeria. It is important to Nigeria who are totally or partially ignorant of the concept of VAT as a source of taxation and its operational machinery. It is significant to the Nigeria businessmen because it will help non-VAtable item.\n    It will be of immense importance to federal Inland Revenue Services Officers who are daily on need of constructive criticism that will enhance their performance. To those categories of people mentioned above this research work will provide additional information on VAT and gear them into oriented behavior of intensive revenue drive.\n1.6    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n    The question is has value added tax in Nigeria actually achieved its predetermined objective of the generating revenue? Hence we should direct the thrust of this research work to answer this question in the number of hypothesis as follows:\n1.    H0:    The introduction of VAT to Nigeria economy is         not necessary and sound in principle  \n    H1:    The introduction of VAT in Nigerian economy is         necessary and sound in principle\n2.    H0:    VAT strategies implementation in Nigeria             should not be improved.\n    H1:    VAT strategies implementation in Nigeria             should be improved.\n3.    H0:    VAT has not had much significant impact on the         Nigerian economy.\n    H1:    VAT has had much significant impact on the             Nigerian economy.\n1.7    LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n    This analytical research work will be based on the assessment of the VAT by the respondent groups with a narrow segment of the Nigeria population business organization and civil servants difference.\n    This may be attributed to size of the population from which our sample was drawn. The research work is restricted to Benin City capital of Edo state.\nREFERENCES\nAma G.A.

In those adverse economic condition, organization big and small have to strive to effectively and efficiently maximize profit given limited resources and the efficient utilization available materials and labour.\nSince the advent and the industrial revolution in Europe, the Limited Liability Company as a major avenue of undertaking the production of good has gained province, basically because its suitability to large scale manufacturing then and indeed now, the objective of any manufacturing firm according to basic economic theory is to produce good at a cost below price so as to earn a residual otherwise known as profit. But profit has been reduced considerably as a result of new government policies and increased cost of imported raw material through the devolution of the currency this has now resulted in firms paying more affection to efficiency to increase profitability and to reduce cost with available resource which include element of cost.\nVarious concept cost accountings have evolved the year Okoy (1997) the rules include:\ni.    All cost should be charged to the functions, sections or products that caused them. For example the salary of a production of engineer should be charged to production department and not to marketing department.\nii.    No cost should be charged until it is incurred for example distribution cost should not be charged on products that are still in the store. It is only proper to charge such costs to the product when they have been transported to various warehouses of customers.\niii.    Cost or lease incurred in the past should not be charged to current or future operations. The exception to this rule is accepted where there is evidence that the present or future operations benefit from the post cost. For example, if the cost of advertising in the past was capitalized, a part of the cost may be charged to current or future marketing cost.\n1.2    HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF COST ACCOUNTING\nCost accounting was not developed until the nineteenth century. As far back as the fourteenth century, some records were found to be kept in Italy which indicates some form of cost record but they were mainly in crude form. However rapid development in this area was recorded in the twentieth century and it has been on the increase year after year.\nBefore the industrial revolution business venture were operated mainly on trading and that is purely buying and selling business, for this account such as trading profit and loss were prepared for the merchants to discover gross and net profit.\nWith the industrial revolution, industries were set up, machines to replace human labour were invented and thus manufacturing industries started springing up and that ushered in a new era. As a result and thus, it became evident that those account which were mainly prepared to discover the gross and net of the business concern consequently more detailed accounting analysis developed and this is the beginning of the development of cost accounting.\nFurthermore, as the days roll by so more complex machines and industries are being established and this must be accompanied  also with more complex accounting system to provide the informational needs of the management before business organization are established the need for adequate planning to ensure smooth and proper control of the operations are now evident throughout the world many organizations have closed down their business even before going into production because of improper planning and this also brought the need for feasibility studies such pre-planning has to be quantified in monetary terms and as a result the need for proper budgetary control now comes in to ensure that such plans are followed to the later.\nIt is on this basis that standard costing and budgetary control have been developed long range planning involves forecasting and the use of mathematical perfections to obtain, process and prepare information to guide managers in their day to day administration of providing information to management for decision making is know as management accounting.\n1.3    HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\nGuinness Nigeria Plc was incorporated  in Nigeria in the year 1962 at Ikeja Lagos State, it has a branch in Benin City, which was opened in 1972.\nThe original name when incorporated was Guinness Nigeria Limited. It was changed to Guinness Nigeria Plc due to government directive to distinguish public Limited Liability Companies  from other Limited Companies. Guiness Agbor Road on Oregbemi Housing Estate Ikpoba Hill Benin City. It is very close to Bendel  Brewery Limited. The objective of the company are:\ni.    To provide employment opportunities for members of the community.\nii.    To contribute to the general welfare of the community\niii.    To contribute to the economy development of the economy, of the nation.\niv.    To generate profit\nThe company has a total staff of two thousand and fifty full time and with an additional three hundred causal workers employed on daily pay basis. However, seventy-nine people are in the senior management level. It is not worthy to understand that expatriates from time to time come to the company to offer technical and management advice  particularly when a product is to be introduced into market. Sixteen members make up the board of directors.\n1.4    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\nThe growth of the business activities in production process and information precision to aid management in taking timely accurate and effective decision has brought out the need for an appropriate cost accounting system will meet the need of the organization entity, when an appropriate system is installed output is increased, efficiency and profit maximization is recorded.\nTherefore, the study aims to highlight the role of cost accounting system with particular reference to Guinness Nigeria Plc.\n1.5    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\ni.    To help management in improving and controlling of stock taking.\nii.    To aid management in decision making when planning\niii.    To reduce cost of production process\niv.    To help management in determining selling price in order to maximize profit.\nv.    To ensure production and marketing flow smoothly\n1.6    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\nThe hypothesis of the research is divided into two known as: Null (Ho) alternation and alternative (H1) the hypothesis which were null hypothesis were rejected then, the alternatives is accepted vise versa.   \nThe hypotheses to be tested are\n1.    H1: Cost accounting forms the basis for preparation of financial statement.\nH0: Cost accounting does not form the basis for preparation of financial statement.\n2.    H1: Cost accounting helps to increase earnings in the organization\nH0: Cost accounting does not help to increase earnings in the organization\n3.    H1: Cost accounting is relevant in management decision making\nH0: Cost accounting is not relevant in management decision making\n1.7    SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nDue to time constrain this study will be limited to those area that are necessary for the purpose of investigation. Hence, the role of cost accounting and cost system or techniques will be covered, this study focuses on the cost accounting department of Guinness Nigeria Plc Benin City.    \n1.8    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe significance of the study is to be able to ascertain the roles of costing system in an organization overall performance. Its specific contribution is to the efficiency in production processes. It will enable management to know the importance to costing system this will enable then to look at the purchase department with seriousness in nay organization in which it is found.\nThis project will also be important to the government to scarce resources and for the standard who are interested will be equipped now on the understanding of cost system.\n1.9    LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\nStudy of this nature requires consideration amount of time to explore all appellant of costing system in the organization, under study but time and company regulation were limiting factors to the area that could have been conveniently and consistently covered.\n1.10    DEFINITION OF TERMS\nCost: It is the value of economic resources used as a result of producing or doing things being coasted, it can also be defined as the unit of expense incurred on or attributed to specific thing or activity.\nCost unit: It is a unit of quantity of product service or time in relation to which cost may be ascertained or expressed.\nCost centre: according to W.M. HSRPER, any part of an enterprise to which cost may be changed is called cost centre.\nCost conversion: it is the term used to describe the cost of converter purchased material into finished or semi-finished product; it is thus total production cost minus initial material input cost.\nAdded value: is the increase in the market value of product excluding the cost of bought materials and services.  \nCost allocation: is the paid of cost attribution which shares cost among two or was cost centers or cost unit in proportion to the estimated benefit received using a proxy e.g square meter.\nREFERENCES\nOkoye A.E.

Environmental aspects of the disclosure are contained in the company’s annual report and aim to disclose information relating to the environment, In this way company can benefit from the positive attention, trust and support of the community, Based on this opinion environmental disclosure can help companies in getting support and capital issues from stakeholders and investors, In addition it can be to access the impact of risk that may be incurred by the company’s operations and reduce the effect of its activities on the environment, so that the company’s image and external legitimacy can be improved.(Deegan & Brown, 2008).  \n            Studies conducted to date on corporate governance and environmental disclosures have shown that corporate governance mechanism have influence on corporate environmental disclosure, However in Nigeria corporate environmental disclosure is still on voluntary basis (Onyali, Okafor & Egolum, 2014). Therefore it is inconclusive if such characteristics and voluntary initiation alone would also influence corporate environmental disclosure in Nigeria’s firms (Onyali et al., 2014).\n     Corporate Environmental disclosure (CED) entails the financial and non–financial disclosure of social and environmental aspects upon which firms activities have an impact on its environment. There is a dearth of literature on Corporate Environmental Disclosure in Nigeria.\n1.2   STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM\nThere is a large difference in the volume of corporate governance and environmental disclosure research in countries with developed capital markets when compared to countries with less developed capital markets. In countries with developed capital market and effective legal/regulatory frameworks, a significant amount of research on corporate governance and environmental disclosure has been executed (Marston & Shrives, 2016). Unfortunately, this is not the case with countries with less developed markets. In less developed countries, there is a scarcity of research on corporate governance and environmental disclosure; in all sincerity, this should not be so (Okpara, Bhasin & Oluwagbemiga, 2014). In comparison with corporate governance and environmental disclosure in developed countries; in developing countries, there are generally lower disclosure standards, weaker regulatory and legal systems as well as limited enforcement capacity (Okike, 2007). There is significant state ownership or holding of many private business corporations in developing countries.(Samaha, Dahawy, Hussainey &Stapleton, 2012).\n       The intention of this research is to examine if corporate governance mechanisms such as board size, board independence, gender diversity and frequency of board meetings influences the level of corporate environmental disclosure specifically in the firms in Nigeria. The increasing environmental issues of which companies tend to have a profound impact on the environment calls for examination of the quality of environmental disclosure voluntarily provided in the annual reports to creating awareness among the stakeholder. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between corporate governance and corporate environmental disclosure.\nFlowing from the above, this study is set to proffer solution to the following research questions.  \n1.     Is there a significant relationship between board size and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firm?\n2.    Is there a significant relationship between board independence and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firm?\n3.    Is there a significant relationship between gender diversity and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firm?\n4.    Is there a significant relationship between frequency of board meetings and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firm?\n1.3    STATEMENT OF RESEARCH OBJECTIVE\nThe main objective of this study is to ascertain the impact of corporate governance on corporate environmental disclosure in Nigeria. The specific objectives of this study are:   \n1.    To determine if there is a significant relationship between board size and environmental disclosure.\n2.    To ascertain if there is a significant relationship between board independence and environmental disclosure.\n3.    To examine if there is a significant relationship between board gender diversity and environmental disclosure.\n4.    To establish if there is a significant relationship between frequency of board meetings and environmental disclosures\n1.4    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\nIn line with the objectives of this study, the following hypotheses will be formulated in null form:\n1.    There is no significant relationship between board size and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firms.\n2.    There is no significant relationship between board independence and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firms.\n3.    There is no significant relationship between board gender diversity and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firms.\n4.    There is no significant relationship between frequency of board meetings and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firms.\n1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThis study basically investigates the effects of corporate governance variables on environmental disclosure. Some of the attributes of corporate governance variables used in this study include: board size, board independence, board gender diversity, frequency of board meetings.\nTo achieve this objective, the corporate annual reports in 15 companies ranging between the periods of four years (2012-2016) will be analyzed. The choice of these firms arises based on their direct or indirect contribution to the environmental.\n1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n    This study is expected to provide useful insight into improving environmental disclosure quality. The study contributes to the accounting literature as it provides additional empirical evidence on the impact corporate governance on environmental disclosure quality.The study also will be useful to stakeholders in Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) as it provides evidence on the relationship between corporate governance attributes andenvironmental disclosure quality and the reform instituted by them in formulating the code of corporate governance for listed companies in Nigeria.\n Other significance of the study are:\n•     It also provides an insight to organizations on how to satisfy the growing demands and continuous yearning for the voluntary disclosure of corporate environmental information in their annual reports.\n•    Financial institution: More so, it makes available for banks both within the financial institution on the need for environmental improvement and environmental performance. This in the long run, helps to visualize an image of the banks as having a moral obligation to account for its environmental activities.\n•    Policy-makers: Furthermore, this study will educate policy-makers on ways in which the environmental performance of companies can be measured and analyzed using ISO requirements.\n•    Researchers: it serves as a beacon for other researchers that are involved in carrying out studies that are inter-country based, especially within the context of developing economies. Finally, this study serves as a reference point for subsequent research on environmental disclosure practices in Nigerian banking sector.\n1.7    LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\nThe study identifies the following limitations:\nFirstly, there is the challenge of inappropriate measurement of variables such as those addressed in this study are examined. Thus in dealing with such issues, the potential for subjectivity is often inevitable.\n In addition, the smallness of the sample size is also considered a limitation. This occurs both in terms of the respondents for the study and in the geographical spread to be covered. It also suffices to note that a study of this nature is constrained by time and resources. This is because this research needs to be carried out simultaneously when the academic work is going on.\nAlso, the eventual analysis of the research findings is always subject to the assumption that the respondents have provided a true opinion to the questions and often times this cannot be ascertained by the researcher.\n\nIMPACT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE VARIABLES ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE IN NIGERIAN COMPANIES\n",

These resources are known as the four “Ms” in the vocabulary management. They are; man, materials, money and machines. Of these four, the most important element is unarguably the resources – man. The development of people in an organization will lead to improved performance.\nAlthough business executives believe that people are the most important asset, some of these executive fail to invest in people.\nPartial  evidence abounds as to the connection between people development and financial performance.  Companies that invest in the development of human capital seem to achieve better financial performance than those that do not. Training is one of the ways in which an organization can develop employees for improve performance. It helps to ensure that workers in an organization function effectively, through equipping them with required skills and knowledge and also up date their knowledge as condition changes. Many new employees come into the organization already equipped with skills and knowledge that will help them to start work. Others may require extensive training before they are ready to make such of a contribution to the organization. Majority, however, at one time or the other will require some type of training in order to maintain an effective level of job performance. While training may be accomplished on an informal basis, better results are usually attained through a well – organized formal training program. The question now is – does human capital development drive superior performance or does superior financial performance make it possible to take a more strategic approach to human capital development? The ability for profitable companies to provide better pay and better training opportunities than their competitors may lead employees to “blur engagement” which connotes involvement and superior contribution – with satisfaction, with pay.\nThe biggest challenge for managers is the ability to create a highly motivated human resource development unit. Modernization of human resource development and the transformation of human capital are efforts essential for the provision of excellent and high quality service to the stakeholders and client.\nFor years, companies have vigorously treasured key areas of their operations – from the success rates of new product introductions and productivity of manufacturing operations, to direct mail conversion rates and customer retention. The reason is obvious: brining desirable new products to market, squeezing the most from one’s most physical assets and gaining and keeping customers are all critical factors in a company’s success. Without concrete performance measures, effective e management of these areas would be impossible. However, while measurements of supply chain, research and development and sales activities has been common place, consistent and routine gauging of the performance  of the work force – as well as the impact of the human capital investments – has been virtually non existent. The fact is that successful organizations today and in the foreseeable future will be those that are able to measure the business impact of the investment  in people – whether that investment is employee recruiting, performance management, skills development or benefits administration.\nFor quite sometime now, attention ahs often been focused almost entirely on financial and physical assets, like cash, stocks, machines, equipment, land and building to mention but a few. However, the resulting human metrics can serve as a catalyst for change, providing a critical missing link for creating and sustaining competitive advantage for organization operating in an increasing knowledge intensive global economy.\nAlthough employees are always treated as both assets and cost for their employers, most organizations have proven to be much more capable at measuring the cost side of human capital than the asset side. At a minimum, this imbalance results in inefficiencies in human capital management. Analysis shows that, in many cases, the imbalance creates a chronic under investment in human capital elative to other forms of investment. The result is sub – optimal performance on the part of most organizations, often accompanied by a sacrifice of long term productivity and portability in exchange for short – lived gains.\nImproving the quality and the relevance of human capital measurement enables organizations to better understand their overall “people – related” strengths and weakness and identifying areas for improvement. It is essential to correct this situation. Any organization hoping to perform at highest level need to link investments in people to bottom – line business result.\nThe rise in human capital management in the 1990’s brought management scholars to debate on the linkage between the management of people and performance. A number of attempts were made to put empirical flesh on the theoretical bones of the resource based view and he specific human resources prescriptions. Some of these studies include;  (1) A cross sectional study of U.S owner firms by Huselid, M.A (1995), he was that high performance work systems have an economically and statically significant impact on both turnover productivity and performance.\nHuselid, M.A Jackson, S.E and Schuler, R.S (1997), did a cross sectional study on 293 publicly held U.S firms. They discovered that human resource   can perform by recruitment, selection, training, performance appraisal and compensational administration.\nThe system  of human resource practice can increase organization performance (Yeung and Ulrich, 1990).\nFor organizations given the present difficult business environment which is highly competitive, all organizations including banks have come to recognize the importance of having the best type of workers. The value that people can bring to services and products for customers depends on the competence and ownership toward work performance. Developing employees competence and commitment is an investment that would ensure organizations continued business success.  \nThis study is therefore undertaken to show the relationship between human capital development and corporate performance, that is how human capital development will bring about increase/improved performance.\n1.2    PROBLEM ANALYSIS\nA country’s overall economic development and growth can be assumed to be particularly related to how the available human resources are harnessed towards stated goals and objectives. There is no doubt that developing an organization human capital will lead to improved performance.\nA successful organization is one which has an effective human resources policy on ground. It is important to note that the task  of managing resources is not an easy one especially when it comes to the management of people as resources. Since it is not easy managing people upon whom the growth and efficiency of all organization depend, adequate plans and strategies needs to be put in place which are aimed at acquiring the right personnel, and also fine turning such personnel, so to speak, in order that they may function optimally the realization of organizational goals. The problem here is to determine the quality of human capital development that will lead to improved performance; that is, the human capital initiatives that will help to increase performance.\nThis research work is aimed at addressing performance management through human capital transformation and development. In the fight of this therefore, the following questions merits serious consideration.\n1.    What is the relationship between training and performance of workers in the organization?\n2.    What is the relationship between mentoring and performance of employees?\n3.    What is the relationship between internship (on – the – job training) and performance of employees?\nThe above questions are therefore issues which are at the heart of this study\n1.3    RESEARCH OBJECTIVES\nThe following are fundamental objectives of this research:\n1.    Ascertain the relationship between training and performance of workers in the organization.\n2.    Determine the relationship between mentoring and performance of employees.\n3.    Determine the relationship between internship ( on – the – job raining) and performance of employees.      \n1.4    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\nIn order to realize the objective of this study, the following null and alternative hypothesis have been formulated for testing:\n1.    HO:    There is nor relationship between training and performance of Workers in the organization.\nHI:    There is a relationship between training and performance of workers in the organization.\n2.    Ho: There is no relationship between mentoring and performance of employees.\nHI:     There no relationship between mentoring and performance of employees.\n3.    HO: There is no relationship between internship and performance of employees.\nHI: There is a relationship between internship and performance of employees.\n1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThe objectives of this study are stated above. It is important to point out here that this study is aimed at ascertaining performance of employees through human capital development.\nIt is important to understand the population; it may not be feasible to access the whole population, hence for convenience, a particular size or number is selected. This size is known as the sample size. In order to reduce the problem encounter in sampling organization as a whole; a sample of 30 companies and banks quoted in the Nigerian Stock Exchange were used for this study. These companies were used because of the ease and access to information on them.\nThis study centers on the development of human capital for improved performance, and it will cover such areas as: recruitment, supporting and investment in people using variety of means including, education, training, coaching, organizational development and human resource management as well as problems that may arise from the attempts at developing human resource in Nigeria organizations.\n1.6    RELEVANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nWhen completed, the findings from this study will apart from advancing academics on the subject of human capital development and corporate performance in Nigeria organizations, it will also be relevant to stakeholders, ultimately in arriving at an appropriate mix for decision to enhance their returns. It will also be useful in the following ways:\n1.    It will assist managers in the organization whose task is to sharpen the productive abilities and qualities of employees to achieve corporate goals.\n2.    This study will also be of immense importance to the employees in the organization, whose collective task will make or mar the organization.\n3.    This study will highlight the different aspects of human capital development and performance.\n4.    Researchers in the field human resource generally will also find the study quite useful when completed.\n5.    The findings from this study will highlight the problems of human capital development and how such problems can be tackled for sustained organizational achievement of stated goals.\n6.    Finally the findings from this study will be of immense benefit to the general public in various ways.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE PERFORMANCES ",

In this case, the profitability of this sector is inevitable in order to encourage economic activities. The sector has witnessed various economic reform measures right from colonial era till date in order to improve its performance. The importance of bank profitability can be appraised at the micro and macro levels of the economy. At the micro level, profit is the essential prerequisite of a competitive banking institution and the cheapest source of funds. It is not merely a result, but also as a necessity for successful banking in a period of growing competition in financial markets. Hence, the basic aim of a bank’s management is to achieve a profit as the essential requirement for conducting any business (Bobakova, 2003).\nAt the macro level, a sound and profitable banking sector is better able to withstand negative shocks and contribute to the stability of the financial system. The importance of bank profitability at both the micro and macro levels has made researchers, academics, bank managements and bank regulatory authorities to develop considerable interest in the factors that determine commercial bank profitability (Athanasoglou, Brissimis, and Delis, 2005).\nIt is a common knowledge that Nigerian banking sector performance has been improved since the consolidation exercise in the sector. But this cannot be accepted any more as eight (8) banks were found to be insolvent in 2009 by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) which made the public to lose confidence in the sector (International Corporate Research, 2009). The federal government of Nigeria and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has perennially sought permanent measures that would enhance the profitability and stability of banks operating in the Nigerian banking industry.\nUnfortunately, they have never completely succeeded in achieving this feat. For instance, from 1987–1991 financial sector reforms (intended to enhance competition in the sector, mobilize saving that would lead to a more efficient allocation of resources) were implemented, encompassing elements of liberalization such as the decontrolling of interest rates, and measures to enhance prudential regulation to tackle bank distress. Also, between 1990 and 2004 bank regulators increased the minimum share capital requirement for banks operating in Nigeria five times, namely in 1991, 1997, 2000 and 2004 (Aburime and Uche,2006). However, these measures were unsuccessful in curtailing the spate of bank distress and failures in the 1990s and beyond (Uche, 1998).\nCurrently a set of banking sector reforms have been introduced to ensure inter alia a strong and reliable banking sector (Okagbue and Aliko, 2005). Unfortunately, if the historical antecedents of financial sector reforms in Nigeria are anything to go by, the current reforms may also not help to improve bank profitability and stability in Nigeria. Against this backdrop, the broad aim of this work is to clearly identify on the basis of empirical evidence the significant determinants of commercial banks profitability in Nigeria.\n1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\nThe banking sector is one of the important sectors of an economy as it plays a major function of channeling funds from savers to investors. It has continued to attract greater attention of the government through the Central Bank of Nigeria. However, there have been different ways in which the federal government of Nigeria through the Central Bank of Nigeria has been trying to restore the confidence of the masses in the banking sector of the country such as the banking recapitalization exercise of 2005, and the Nationalization of some commercial banks (Afribank, Bank PHB and Spring Bank) in 2011. Despite all these effort the confidence of the masses is yet to be improved as the profitability of many commercial banks is nothing to write home about. This study therefore investigates the financial structure of bank and how it affects commercial banks profitability in Nigeria.\n1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\nThe broad objective of this study is to provide an understanding of the effect of financial structure on banks profitability in Nigeria. However, the specific objectives of the study are:\n1. To assess the impact of banks liquidity on bank profitability\n2. To examine the influence of shareholders fund on banks profitability\n3. To assess the impact of total assets on banks profitability\n 1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nThe study is undertaken to answer the following research questions:\n1. What is the impact of banks liquidity on commercial banks profitability?\n2. How does shareholders fund influence commercial banks profitability?\n3. What is the role of total assets on commercial banks profitability?\n1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nSince the banking sector is considered to be an important source of financing economic activities in every economy, it becomes necessary to device every means possible to identify what financial structure will have a greater impact on banks profitability. This study is significant to all stakeholders such as managers of banks, regulators of banks (monetary authorities), depositors–investors, researchers, and the government of the country. The significance of this study can be seen in the following ways:\n1.    This finding of this study is significant to managers of banks since the level of profitability of banks indicate the ability of banks to accommodate shock such as financial crisis. This profitability of banks can be compared to the overall banking situation because this serves as a good indicator to managers of banks to understand the strength of the banks against the overall banking industry. More so, banks that are unable to meet its customers’ demands leaves itself exposed to a systemic lack of confidence in the banking system.\n2.    This research is also significant to the monetary authorities since it is a major role of the Central Bank of Nigeria to improve liquidity and financial stability in the Nigerian banking system due to the fact that a well funded banking sector is essential in order to maintain financial system stability and confidence in the country. With the findings of this study the monetary authorities will be able to strengthen their policies and advisory services in order to stabilize the banking sector.\n3.    It is also significant to depositors/investors since bank performance (profitability) serves as an indicator whether to invest or withdraw their funds from the bank. They need past performance in terms profitability of the banks to know if it will be beneficial to deposits or invests to earn more returns that will enable them maximize their wealth. This study provides depositors as well as investors more and reliable information that will enable them to analyze the profitability of banks in order to know the strength of the commercial banks in Nigeria.\n4.    This study is significant as a reference material to further researchers who may wish to carry out further research in this area. This is due to the fact that interested researchers in this area can consult this study as guide to further research in this area of studies. Last but not the least, this study is also significant to the government of Nigeria. With this study the government may decide whether to adopt policies that will make the banking sector more investor friendly and profitable. As this will have multiple effects to the economy of Nigeria.\n1.6    SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF STUDY\nThe study covers a sample of 6 banks out of the 22 commercial banks in Nigeria for the periods of 2007 to 2011. The major limitations confronting this study are inaccessibility of relevant materials and non–availability of adequate data. However, measure such as subscribing to get journals on the internet has been used to curb the problems of relevant materials and inadequate data. Furthermore, the study used only two measures of profitability – Return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) which serves as a limitation this study finding, while there are numerous measures of profitability. In order to overcome this limitation, the study carefully used ROA and ROE as measures of commercial banks profitability because of its dominancy in finance studies as measures of commercial banks profitability or performance\n\nFINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND BANK PROFITABILITY\n",

In line with the objectives of this study, secondary data were obtained from central bank of Nigeria statistical bulletin and Federal Inland Revenue Service covering the period of 2000 to 2011. In concluding the analysis, multiple regressions and statistical package for social science were employed to analyze data on such variables; company income tax, petroleum profit tax, personal income tax and education tax. They were all found to have a significant relationship with total federally collected revenue with the Adjusted R2 of 99.1%. Following the outcome of this study, it is therefore concluded that income tax has been beneficial to the Nigerian economy and has contributed significantly to total revenue for the period of 2000 to 2011. Income tax has a positive influence on total revenue and hence economic growth and development. It is therefore recommended that concerted efforts should be made to improve on the effectiveness and efficiency of the administration and collection of taxes by government. It is believed by the researcher that tax revenues can only materialize its full potential on the economy if government can come up with fiscal laws and legislations and strengthen the existing ones in line with macro economic objectives, which will check-mate tax offenders in order to minimize corruption, evasion and tax avoidance. These will bring about improvement on the tax administration and accountability and transparency of government officials in the management of tax revenue. Above all, these will increase the tax revenue base with resultant increase in growth.\nTABLES OF CONTENTS\nCHAPTER ONE\n1.0     introduction                            \n1.1     Background to the study                    \n1.2     Statement of the research problem                \n1.3     Statement of the research objective                \n1.4     Research hypothesis                        \n1.5     Scope of the study                        \n1.6     Significance of the study                    \n1.7     Definition of terms                        \nCHAPTER TWO\n2.0     Introduction                            \n2.1     Review of literatures on variable                \n2.1.1 Government revenue                        \n2.1.2 Personal income tax                        \n2.1.3 Company income tax                        \n2.1.4 Education tax                            \n2.1.5 Petroleum profit tax                        \n2.2     Conceptual framework                    \n2.2.1 Canons of taxation                        \n2.2.2 Canon of ability                            \n2, 2, 3 Canon of certainty                        \n2.2.4 Canon of convenience                        \n2.2.5 Canon of economy                        \n2.3     Tax evasion and avoidance                    \n2.4     Classification of tax                        \n2.4.1 Regressive tax                            \n2.4.2 Progressive tax                            \n2.4.3 Proportional tax                            \n2.5     The PAYE system                        \n2.6     Self employment income                    \n2.7     Assessable income                        \n2.8     Income exempted from tax                    \n2.9     Review of previous study                    \n2.10   Theoretical framework                    \n2.10.1 Social political theory                    \n2.10.2 Expediency theory                        \n2.10.3 Benefit received theory                    \n2.10.4 Cost of service theory                        \n2.10.5 Ability to pay theory                        \nCHAPTER THREE\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n3.0     Introduction                            \n3.1     Research design                        \n3.2     Population and samples                    \n3.3     Sources of Data                            \n3.4     Model specification                        \n3.5     Data analysis technique                    \nCHAPTER FOUR\n4.0     Empirical result and analysis                    \n4.1     Data presentation                        \n4.2     Data interpretation                        \nCHAPTER FIVE\n5.0        SUMMARY CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION        \n5.0    summary                                \n5.1     Conclusion                            \n5.2     recommendation                        \n         Bibliography                            \n         Appendix                            \nCHAPTER ONE\n1.0     INTRODUCTION\n1.1     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n    Government undertakes huge public expenditure on behalf of its citizens such expenditures is undertaken to provide basic infrastructure such as roads, seaports, airports and bridges. It also provide social services such as public health, education, electricity, transport, poster services etc. it is also the government responsibility to protect the lives and properties of it citizens, maintain law and order and provide national security.\n    One of the recurrent problems of the three tier structure of government in Nigeria is dwindling revenue generation as characterized by yearly budget deficits and insufficient funds for economic growth and development. This economic reasoning emphasized the revenue need of government and indicates that apart from strengthening the existing sources of revenue, it is also necessary for government to diversify it revenue base in order to meet its constitutional responsibilities. Myles(2000) states that financial capacity to any government depends among other things on its revenue base, the fiscal resources available to it and the way these resources are generated and utilize. It is therefore, the duty of the government to adequately mobilize potential revenue across the country. This mobilization involve the adoption of economically and politically acceptable taxes that would ensure easy administration accounting, verification, auditing and investigation base on the equality, neutrality and other attribute of a good tax. In the words of Ogbonna (2012), the political, economical and social development of any country depends on the amount of revenue generated for the provision of infrastructure in that country. He concluded that one of means of generating the revenue for providing the needed infrastructure is through a well structured tax system. According to Azubike(2009), tax is a major player in every society of the world.\n    The tax system is an opportunity for government to collect additional revenue needed in discharging its pressing obligations. A tax system offers itself as one of the most effective means of mobilizing a nation’s internal resources and lends itself to creating an environment conducive to the promotion of economic growth.\n    Tax, in the words of (Appah, 2004; Appah and Oyandonghan, 2011) is a compulsory levy imposed on a subject or upon his property by the government to provide security, social amenities and create conditions for the economic well being of the society. While Oseni (2008) defines tax as a compulsory levy imposed by a public authority on the income, profit or wealth of an individual, family, community, corporate or unincorporated body etc for the public purpose. Ojo (2009) sees it as a compulsory levy imposed by the government on individuals and business firms and paid by them to the government. The process or system of raising income through the levying of various types of taxes is known as taxation. Taxes may be distinguished from other types of fees and charges imposed by government by virtue of the fact that they do not bestow on the taxpayer right to claim something equivalent to the tax paid from the government. Thus, the taxpayer is not entitled to any special service or benefit from government that excludes other members of the public on account of the tax he has paid. There are two elements in a tax; the bas and the rate. The tax base is the object which is taxed. They are usually income, profit, property etc. The tax rate is the amount of the tax base which is paid in tax. Taxes can be direct or indirect. The direct taxes take the form of personal income tax, petroleum profit tax, company income tax, educational tax, capital gain tax etc. While the indirect taxes take the form of value added tax, import duties, export duties, excise duties etc.\n    The history of taxation in Nigeria dates back to the era of the trade and the introduction of Islamic religion in Nigeria between 800AD and 1400AD. The rulers in the Northern Nigeria were known as “SAFAWA” kings who grew rich due to gifts and levis paid to them by their subordinates as taxes on cattle and agricultural crops. In the south, the Obas and Ezes relied on tributes, arbitrary levies, and special contributions at special festivals or events, collected through the head of the families, as its system of taxation. The first legal backing of taxation was in 1904 when Sir Fredrick Lugard introduced the Native Revenue proclamation. This proclamation was further enhanced in 1906. These enactments were followed by much other legislation which the colonial masters introduced during their era. After independence in 1960, the government enacted three major tax laws, namely; Federal Income Tax Act (FITA) 1961; Income Tax Management Act (ITMA) 1961; Companies Income Tax Act (CITA) 1961. These enactments form the bedrock of modern taxation in Nigeria. The Income Tax Management Act (ITMA) 1961, model for all the personal income tax laws operational in the regions, with enactments in some regions. However, in 1993 through Decree 104 the EGW enacted the personal income tax act 1993 to repeal all previous tax laws. The Companies Income Tax Act (CITA) 1961 was repeal and later replaced with the Companies Income Tax Act (CITA) in 1979 with amendments in 1993.\n1.2     STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM\n    The general public expects the government to provide them with basic amenities, and the government on the other hand can only implement this if there were enough revenue generated especially from taxation. The amount of revenue generated will however depend on the tax system and how effective it is. The Nigeria’s tax environment has been characterized by poor assessment and collection, multiple taxation, misappropriation of tax revenue and general inefficiency. In relative terms, the rich Nigerians pay far less tax in comparison with their poor counterparts. From the forgone, there is no doubt that the Nigeria’s tax system is froth with some problems. It is in the light of the above the researcher intends to formulate the following questions;\n1. Is there any significant relationship between income taxes and government generated revenue in Nigeria?\n2. What is the impact of income taxes on government generated revenue in Nigeria?\n3. What are the contributions of income taxes on government generated revenue in Nigeria?\n4. What are the lapses evident in the Nigeria’s tax system?\n5. How can the government provide solution to the lapses inherent in the Nigeria’s tax system?\n1.3     STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES\n    The research work has the following objectives;\n1. To establish the relationship between income taxes and government generated revenue in Nigeria.\n2. To establish whether income tax has positive impact on government generated revenue in Nigeria.\n3. To ascertain the contribution of income taxes on government generated revenue in Nigeria.\n4. To establish the lapses evident in the Nigeria’s tax system.\n5. To establish ways the government can provide solution to the lapses inherent in the Nigeria’s tax system.\n 1.4     RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n    Hypothesis is a tentative statement that shows the relationship between two or more variables. Shaibu (2012) defines a statistical hypothesis as a statement about the value of a population parameter which may or may not be true. This means that a hypothesis is an educated guess or logical speculation based on information that is available to a problem under investigation. Hypothesis can be null and alternate. The null hypothesis is denoted by Ho while the alternative is represented by Ha.\nFor the purpose of this study, the hypotheses to be tested are five being;\nHo     There is no significant relationship between income tax and government generated revenue in Nigeria.\nHa     There is a significant relationship between income tax and government generated revenue in Nigeria.\nHo     Income tax has no positive impact on government generated revenue in Nigeria.\nHa     Income tax has a positive impact on government generated revenue in Nigeria.\nHo     Income taxes do not contribute positively to government generated revenue in Nigeria.\nHa     Income taxes contribute positively to government generated revenue in Nigeria.\nHo       There is no lapses evident in the Nigeria’s tax system.\nHa       There are lapses evident in the Nigeria’s tax system.\nHo      There are no ways the government can provide solution to the lapses inherent in the Nigeria’s tax system.\nHa     there are ways the government can provide solution to the lapses inherent in the Nigeria’s tax system.\n1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n    According to Shaibu (2012) “to delimit a study is to define its scope”. In the light of this, the scope refers to the boundary of the study. The scope of this study covers the total tax revenue generated from the period of 2000 to 2011 in Nigeria.\n1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n    This study is carried out in order to assess the revenue implication of the Nigeria’s income tax system and its impact on revenue. The study will also assess the shortcomings in the income tax system and suggest ways of achieving a better result.\n1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS\nTAX\nA tax is a compulsory levy imposed by a public authority on the income, profit or wealth of an individual, community, corporate or unincorporated body etc for public purpose.\nTAXATION\nThis can be defined as the process or system of raising income through the levying of various types of taxes.\nDIRECT TAX\nThese are taxes levied on income or capital generated by factors of production such as land, labour capital and entrepreneur.\nINDIRECT TAX\nThese are taxes levied on goods and services.\nPROPORTIONAL TAX\nA tax is proportional when the same tax rate is applicable irrespective of the size of the income.\nPROGRESSIVE TAX\nA tax is progressive when the rate applicable increase as the income increases.\nREGRESSIVE TAX\nA tax is regressive when the proportion of the total income paid as tax falls as income rises.\nASSESSMENT\nAn assessment is the process of ascertaining the taxable income of the tax payer.\nGOVERNMENT ASSESSMENT\nThis is a system whereby the taxpayer provides relevant information to the tax authorities concerning his income on a prescribed tax return form.

The long run stability of the variable was tested and it was found that the data were stationary and co integrated. An error correction test was performed to detect the speed of adjustment to equilibrium in case of sudden chock. The outcome of the test showed that direct tax has a positive effect on foreign direct investment in Nigeria.\nThe result revealed that company income tax positively but statistically insignificantly affect foreign direct investment in Nigeria. Also, there exist a positive and statistically significant relationship between personal income tax and foreign direct investment in Nigeria. Lastly, the result revealed that petroleum profit tax positively but insignificantly affect foreign direct investment in Nigeria.\nIt was recommended that there is need for the government to reduce corporate tax rate in order to spur FDI into the country. Also, Nigerian government needs to come up with more friendly economic policies and macroeconomic adjustments that will lead to continuous increase and growth of the nation’s GDP and stable inflation rate thereby paving way for a friendly business environment.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION\n1.1        Background to the Study    -    -\n1.2      Statement of the Research Problem-    -    \n1.3     Objective of the Study-    -    -    \n1.4     Research Hypotheses    -    -    -\n1.5     Scope of the Study    -    -    -    \n1.6     Significance of the Study    -    -\n1.7     Limitation of the study     -    -    \nCHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW    \n2.1     Introduction-    -    -    -    -    \n2.2    Conceptual Literature    -    -    -    \n2.2.1     Concept of Foreign Direct Investment    -    \n2.2.1.1 Benefits and Costs of FDI and Economic Growth    -    \n2.2.2 Concept of Direct Tax    -    -    -\n2.2.2.1 The History of Direct Taxes    -    -    -    \n2.2.2.2 Types of Direct Tax    -    -    -    \n2.3 Theoretical Framework    -    \n2.3.1 Optimal Tax Theory    -    \n2.3.2 Laffer Curve Theory    -    -    \n2.3.3 Exogenous Growth Theory    -    -    -    -\n2.4 Empirical Literature    -    -    \n2.4.1 PPT and Foreign Direct Investment    -    -\n2.4.2 Company Income Tax and Foreign Direct Investment    -\n2.4.3 Personal Income Tax and Foreign Direct Investment    -    -\nCHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY\n3.1 Introduction    -    -    -    -\n3.2 Research Design    -    -    -    -\n3.3 Population and Sample    -    -    -\n3.4 Model Specification    -    -    \n3.5 Sources of Data    -    -    -\n3.6 Method of Data Analysis    -    -    \n3.7 Operationalization of Variables    -    -\nCHAPTER FOUR:DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS\n4.1 Introduction    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    \n4.2Data Presentation and Analyses of Results    -\n4.2.1 Unit Root Testing    -    -    -    -    -    \n4.2.2 Co-integration Test    -    -    -\n4.2.3 Descriptive Analysis    -    -    -    -    \n4.2.4 Correlation Analysis -    -    -    -    -\n4.2.5 Regression Analysis    -    -    -    -    \n4.3 Hypothesis Testing and Discussion of Findings    -    -\nCHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS\n AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n5.1     Introduction    -    -    -    -    -\n5.2     Summary of Findings     -    \n5.3     Conclusion     -    -    -    -\n5.4     Recommendations    -    -    -\nBibliography     -    -    -    -\nAPPENDIX    -    -    \nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1     Background to the Study\nTax is classified into two main categories that is direct and indirect taxation. Direct tax is imposed on properties, incomes and corporate profits etc. Indirect tax includes value added tax, sales tax and import duty etc. In case of direct taxes, tax revenue depends on a country’s policy, either it relaxes the direct taxes for attracting foreign investment or imposes to collect revenue (Fakile,&Adegbile, 2013). For example, tax holidays and tax credits for new foreign investment and exemption of import duty in case of imports of raw material and machinery. Secondly, indirect tax depends on the sales of goods and services.\nForeign direct investment (FDI) is a direct investment into production or business in a country by an individual or organization of another country, either by buying an organization or in the target country or by developing operations of an existing business in that country (Bénassy-Quéré, Fontagné,&Lahrèche-Révil, 2015). Foreign direct investment is as opposed to portfolio investment which is a dormant investment in the securities of another country, for instance, stocks and bonds. Adepeju (2012), conceptualized Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as investment that is made to get a persisting management interest (generally 10% of voting stock) in an endeavor and operating in a country other than that of the investors (describe as showed by residency) the investors aim being an intense voice in the management of earning either long term capital or short term capital as showed up in the nations balance of payments account decree (Macaulay, 2012).\nAccording to Adepeju (2012), Nigeria is in dilemma as it is in dare need of foreign capital for the on-going internal adjustment, yet it fears that commanding heights of some sectors of the economy may extract complete control of the national economy and the need for foreign capital has become indispensable if the economy must come out of the depression. The Nigerian Government in recognition of the importance of FDI as an important vehicle for industrial progress, most times expressed readiness to enter into bilateral agreement with foreign governments, or private organization that wish to invest in the country as well as discuss the additional incentives (Morisset, 2003).\nA competitive environment depends both on companies operating in that environment and on the rules and regulations provided by the state. Businesses are also seeking to obtain a higher profit through market share and in this sense they develop policies and strategies to differentiate them from the competition (Adepeju, 2012). At the same time, governments are struggling to gain a competitive advantage in order to attract greater investment in their territory. They are doing this because it will create new jobs, will boost revenues from taxation, lead to the formation of local budget and will also increase property value.\nThe main reasons why some businesses tend to have a higher interest in some countries rather than others is provided by the economic and fiscal policies of those states, and the level of bureaucracy or the presence of the necessary infrastructure (Okoi&Edame, 2013). Tax policies occupy a central place in the final destination of choice for a company wishing to invest in a country other than the country of origin (Justman, Thisse&Ypersele 2011). Bearing this in mind, we can say that a country is even more attractive to investors if its taxes are low. Moreover, the size of the economy, its purchasing power and other market related factors can be compensated if there are fiscal incentives for companies (Bucovetsky 2013).\nIn this way, each country wants to attract more foreign investors and it will act accordingly in terms of the administrative and legal framework. Countries use tax incentives and tax reductions to stimulate the inflow of foreign direct investments.\nCorporate tax is a levy imposed on taxable profit of firms with a stipulated statutory rate. The burden of corporate taxation obviously influences the volume and location of foreign direct investment (FDI) for the simple reason that it determines after tax returns from investment (Okoi&Edame, 2013).\n1.2  Statement of the Research Problem\nThere is a limited empirical work on testing the impact of FDI on direct tax revenue. Gropp and Kostial (2012) used the panel data of nineteen OECD countries to find relationship between FDI and direct tax revenue. They found a weak correlation between FDI and corporate income tax and found a strong positive impact of FDI inflows on the profit tax and on the total tax revenue.\nThe mechanism through which FDI impacts are transmitted still stays open for further discourse and research particularly in developing nations (Mintz, 2014). This study is significant in that it examines the effect of direct tax on foreign direct investment in Nigeria. Most of the earlier studies on FDI have either be in Africa, Sub-Saharah Africa or country specific.\nIn terms of policy forecast, because of economic and environmental differences it is good to study the environment differently so as to known what is good for such an environment (Ogbonna, 2013). This is what motivates the research to investigate the effect of direct tax on foreign direct investment in Nigeria. Also this study will consider personal income tax, company income tax and petroleum profit tax as components of direct tax. More recent data and the use of Error correction model and unit root test will be carried out to test the hypotheses due to the time frame which makes it different from other previous studies.\nMore specifically, this study seek to provide answers to the following research questions;\ni)    What is the relationship between company income taxand foreign direct investment in Nigeria?\nii)    What is the effect of personal income tax on foreign direct investment in Nigeria?\niii)    Does petroleum profit tax affect foreign direct investment in Nigeria?\n1.3  Objective of the Study\nThe main objective of the study is to determine the relationship between direct tax and foreign direct investment in Nigeria. Other specific objectives are to:\ni.    Determine the relationship between company income tax and foreign direct investment in Nigeria.\nii.    Determine the effect of personal income tax on foreign direct investment in Nigeria.\niii.    Examine the effect of petroleum profit tax on foreign direct investment in Nigeria.\n\n1.4 Research Hypotheses\nThe following hypotheses will be tested in the course of the study:\nHo1: There is no significant relationship between company income tax and foreign direct investment in Nigeria.\nHo2: Personal income tax does not have significant effect on foreign direct investment in Nigeria.\nHo3: There is no significant relationship between petroleum profit tax and foreign direct investment in Nigeria.\n1.5 Scope of the Study\nThe study is a Nigeria study, covering a period of 28 years (1990 to 2017). Relevant data shall be sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin (2017). The reason for the choice of this period is based on the fact that several foreign direct investment have occurred during the period in Nigeria coupled with several economic policy changes relating to tax revenue. This will in no small measure enable us to have a long time fair view of the effect of direct tax on foreign direct investment in Nigeria overtime.\n1.6 Significance of the Study\nAs indicated in the statement of problem, the study will definitely give an insight into the effect of direct tax on foreign direct investment in Nigeria.\ni.    The study will also be relevant to potential foreign investors who would want to come into the country to invest.\nii.    Furthermore, the study will be very relevant to the Nigerian government, corporate bodies and policy makers, as it will provide them useful information and guidelines to formulating appropriate policies and programmes affecting direct tax and foreign direct investment Nigeria.\niii.    Again, the academia, researchers, Finance students and other related disciplines will also benefit immensely, as it will also constitute viable data source that will enable them conduct further studies.\n1.7 Limitation of the study     \nThe major limitation of this study relates to the issue of conflicting values. Since the study relies heavily on secondary data, there were often conflicting values for some of the variables under investigation from different sources. Such shortcomings in the values of the variables occasioned by the sources of data used constituted a major constraint to the results of the study. Nevertheless, this constraint was minimized by trying as much as possible to stick to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin, since source is more credible in Nigeria.\n\nDIRECT TAX AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT",

For decades, tax researchers have investigated why some people pay taxes and others do not. This project have identified characteristics of non compliant tax payers and factors that motivate tax compliance.\nQuestionnaires were administrated to generate the necessary primary data, which were analyzed descriptively. A total of fifty questionnaires were administered in Benin City. The chi-square method was used to test the various hypothesis, review of relevant literatures were carried out in order to get a deeper insight and proper understanding of the project. The result of the hypotheses tested proved that demographic factor has impact on tax compliance in Nigeria, tax payers’ complained is affected by the complexity of the tax system in Nigeria and there is relationship between income level of taxpayers and non compliance in Nigeria.\nIt was therefore recommended that tax authorities should stiffer penalties for non compliance and general enforcement of tax rules and regulations.\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1        Background of the study\nThe primary function of the personal income tax system is to raise revenue for government. As revenue-raising mechanism the personal income tax system must be seen to treat all citizens fairly (Huxham & Haupt, 1998). It is important that taxpayers perceive the tax system as fair. This is most important, since fairness has been deemed as motivator that is meant for tax compliance and the determinant of taxpayers' satisfaction with the return from the government makes most taxpayers to comply with tax (Cowel, 1990). In the earlier period United States congress agitate about the impact of taxpayers' perception on fairness and the decreased in drift toward tax compliance. Unfortunately evidence abounds that taxpayers, both in the United State and Europe, have serious reservation about the fairness of their tax system (Jackson & Milliron, 1986), Smith & Priedman (2003) identify the need to understand the taxpaying culture and taxpayers behavior the study was conducted in south Africa. Hlophe & Friedman (2002) feel that there is room for improvement in the transformation of taxpayer's attitudes toward compliance. Taxpayers with this have serious interest in aversion about the fairness of their tax system.\nKinsey, Gasmask & Smith (1991) stated in their research that a country tax policy allow people to lower taxes legally and this can be in the aggregate to increase the perceived unfairness of the tax system. Ideally, what appears to be needed is a proper balance of treatments such that all taxpayers perceive equal or proper treatment. On the aspect of the United States income tax system is that, due to its varying objectives, it appear to be discriminately in nature (Porcano, 1984). If the fairness of tax and demographic factors toward tax system are important factors they have impact on compliance, then efforts should be made to improve the level of tax compliance based on the analysis reported (National Tax Policy 2008).\nDespite the Nigeria government aspiration on the way to improve compliance in 2002, the country still need to refocus its policy goal to encouraging tax compliance. In Nigeria there is the need to engage in the fairness of tax at all level of government in addition to the expressed desire to develop set of guiding principles to build the individual income tax on stability, accountability, equity and centralized authority for effective strategies to improve taxpayer's compliance. Lack of income tax compliance is resulting in low-revenues and drastically hampering economic development which resultantly contributes to a national budget deficit. Due to cultural and environmental different among African countries, there is a need to gather more relevant information about tax compliance in Africa with specific reference to Nigeria.\n    A review of the academic tax compliance literature reveals a consistent concern with fairness as a factor affecting compliance (McKercher & Evans, 2009). In the comprehensive review of the factors affecting tax compliance, Jackson & Milliron (1986) speculate that one reason for this inconsistency is the lack of a good operational definition for tax fairness. The central point of the variable is that fairness is a multidimensional variable due to cultural and environmental differences. There is a need to gather more relevant information about tax compliance in Africa with specific reference to Nigeria.\n1.2       Problem Statement\nThe Nigeria tax system is heavily relied on the petroleum industry through the Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT) for a significant proportion of its tax revenue, both in absolute and relative terms. Gallagher (2005) suggested that 80% of the Federal government revenues in Nigeria are derived directly from the oil sector.\nIn the analysis reported by the National Tax Policy (2008) described that the income tax of Nigeria workers and private sector employees is at zero level of compliance which shows that Nigerian workers are not compliance of tax or decline from paying their personal income tax. Based on the policy of the Federal Government of Nigeria, all salary or income earners are to pay tax and to be channel to the Federal Inland Revenue Service. The argument here is workers in Nigeria especially the Federal, State and Local Government are paying their tax which is deducted from the source. Hence, these three tiers of government are expected to forward these tax to Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), the private sector are expected to pay the tax of their employees. According to Ariyo (1997), there is need to review the fairness of individual income tax on tax compliance performance in Nigeria tax system has been attributed to the negative economic impact of the presidential fiscal deficit that have occurred primarily because of the inadequacy of the revenue based to coop with the targeted level of the economy activities.\n1.3    Research Questions\ni.    What is the impact of demographic factor on tax compliance in Nigeria?\nii.    How has the tax payers compliance been affected by the complexity of the tax system in Nigeria?\niii.    Is there any relationship between income status and tax payer’s compliance behavior in Nigeria?\niv.    Is there any impact on tax compliance by the construct of tax fairness and demographic factors in Nigeria?\nv.    What is the relationship between income level of tax payers and non-compliance in Nigeria?\nvi.    Is there any probability of detecting taxpayer’s compliance behavior in Nigeria?\n1.4    Research Objectives\ni.    To examine the impact of demographic factor on tax compliance in Nigeria.\nii.    To determine whether the complexity of the tax system in Nigeria affects taxpayer’s compliance.\niii.    To find out if there is any relationship between income tax status and tax payers compliance behavior in Nigeria?\niv.    To determine if there is any impact on tax compliance by the construct of tax fairness and demographic factors in Nigeria?\nv.    To examine the relationship between income level of tax payers and non-compliance in Nigeria.\nvi.    To determine if there is any probability of detecting taxpayers compliance behavior in Nigeria.\n1.5    Hypothesis of the Study\nHypothesis is a tentative answer to a research question. It can be stated in a null form (Ho) or alternative form (Hi). The following hypotheses will be formulated and tested in this study.\nHypothesis One\nHo:    Demographic factor has no impact on tax compliance in Nigeria\nHi:    Demographic factor has impact on tax compliance in Nigeria\nHypothesis Two\nHo:    Taxpayers’ compliance has not been affected by the complexity of the tax system in Nigeria.\nHi:    Taxpayers’ compliance has been affected by the complexity of the tax system in Nigeria.\nHypothesis Three\nHo:    There is no relationship between income status and taxpayers’ compliance behavior in Nigeria.\nHi:    There is relationship between income status and Taxpayers’ compliance behavior in Nigeria.\nHypothesis Four\nHo:    There is no impact on tax compliance by the construct of tax fairness and demographic factors in Nigeria.\nHi:    There is impact on tax compliance by the construct of tax fairness and demographic factors in Nigeria.\nHypothesis Five\nHo:    There is no relationship between income level of taxpayers and non-compliance in Nigeria\nHi:    There is relationship between income level of taxpayers and non-compliance in Nigeria.\nHypothesis Six\nHo:    There is no probability of detecting taxpayers’ compliance in Nigeria.\nHi:    There is probability of detecting taxpayers’ compliance in Nigeria.\n1.6    Significance of the Study\nThis study will be immense benefits to various stakeholders precisely tax authority will find it indispensable in tax strategies and policies formulation; also tax authorities need it to effectively maximize its tax revenue. It will also be relevant to the academicians as it will enrich tax compliance literature. Tax consultants and tax analysts will find it useful in the course of this work and analysis. The researchers will find it as a basis for further research.\n1.7    Scope of the Study\n    The scope of this study will be centered on personal income taxpayers in Nigeria. This study shows variables that can determine personal income tax compliance in Nigeria.\n1.8    Limitation of the Study\nThe limitations of this study include:\na.    The sample size compared to the population may not give an accurate result.\nb.    The inability to obtain a complete random sample.\nc.    Inadequate research materials online and even academic publications and journals were problems to this study.\nd.    The high cost of sourcing for information also made it difficult to access most of the population of research institutions.\ne.    Little understanding of taxation among the population made response to the questionnaire quite difficult.\n1.9    Definition Of The Concepts And Key Terms\n1.

A study of some selected limited liability company in rivers states.\n    The method used to carry out this research is primary data which is questionnaire distribution to the respondents. The research design used is quasi-experimental design. Yaro Yamen’s formula used to determine the sample size. 50 questionnaires distributed and 48 of them were duly returned. The statistic tools used is chi-square the three hypotheses were accepted because they meet the necessary requirement for acceptance of an alternate hypothesis.\n    It was found out that the reliability of published accounts affect investment decision. Finally, from the analysis we saw that firms evaluate the work done by the external author.\nBased on the analysis, we conclude that the published accounts have a significant relationship with the true position of the enterprise.\nFinally, we recommended the external auditors and management relationship should be at arm length to ensure adequate degree of independent work and only competent external auditors should be engaged to prepare financial report\nTABLE OF CONTENT\nCHAPTER ONE\n1.0    Introduction    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n1.1    Background of the Study    -    -    -    -    -\n1.2    Statement of the Problem    -    -    -    -    -\n1.3    Purpose of Study    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n1.4    Objective of Study    -    -    -    -    -    \n1.5    Research Question        -    -    -    -    -\n1.6    Hypothesis            -    -    -    -    -    -\n1.7    Significance of the Study    -    -    -    -    -\n1.8    Scope of the Study    -    -    -    -    -    -\n1.9    Limitation of the Study        -    -    -    -    -\n1.10    Definition of Terms    -    -    -    -    -    -\n1.11    Organization of Study        -    -    -    -    -\n    References    \nCHAPTER TWO\n2.0    Literature Review    -    -    -    -    -    -\n2.1    Introduction    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n2.2    Nature of Audit and External Auditors\nIndependence    -    -    -    -    -    --\n2.3    Published    Financial Statement    -    -    -    -\n2.4    Published Financial Statement Disclosure    -    -\n2.5    Basic Content of the Audit Report    -    -    -    -\n2.6    Opinion of     External Auditor’s and Financial\n    Statement User        -    -    -    -    -    -\n2.7    Unqualified Opinion        -    -    -    -    -\n2.8    Opinion Based in Part on Report of\nAnother Auditor        -    -    -    -    -    -\n2.9    Departure from recognized Accounting Standards    -\n2.10    Emphasis on a Matter        -    -    -    -    -\n2.11    Qualified Opinion    -    -    -    -    -    -\n2.12    Uncertainty    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n2.13    Disagreement    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n2.14    Materiality and Fundamentality    -    -    -    -\n2.15    Limitation on Scope of Examination    -    -    -\n2.16    Qualified Audit Report    -    -    -    -    -        \n2.17    Auditors Report to the Members    -    -    -    -\n2.18    Major Uncertainty Affecting a Clients Business    -\n2.19    Qualification as to Accounting\nProcedure and Disclosure    -    -    -    -    -2.20    Adverse Opinion        -    -    -    -    -    -\n2.21    Disclaimer Opinion    -    -    -    -    -    -\n2.22    Restriction imposed by Client    -    -    -    -\nCHAPTER THREE\n3.0    Research Methodology        -    -    -    -    -\n3.1    Research Design        -    -    -    -    -    -\n3.2    Sampling Procedure    -    -    -    -    -    -\n3.3    Determination of Sample Size    -    -    -    -\n3.4    Data Collection Method    -    -    -    -    -\n3.5    Primary Data    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n3.6    Secondary Data        -    -    -    -    -    -\n3.7    Questionnaire Design    -    -    -    -    -    -\n3.8    Operational Measure of Variables    -    -    -    -\n 3.9    Data Analysis Techniques        -    -    -    -\n    References        -    -    -    -    -    -    -\nCHAPTER FOUR\n4.1    Introduction        -    -    -    -    -    -\n4.2    Return of Questionnaires    -    -    -    -    -\n4.3    Testing Hypothesis    -    -    -    -    -    -                                      \nCHAPTER FIVE: FINDINGS, DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION\n5.1    Finding        -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n5.2    Discussion    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n5.3    Conclusion    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n5.4    Recommendation    -    -    -    -    -    -\nBibliography    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\nAppendix    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n      CHAPTER ONE\n1.0    INTRODUCTION\n1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\nRecent business failure involving or caused by inaccurate published Accounts or Financial Reporting have focused worldwide attention on the external auditors.  Roles and responsibilities with respect to his ability to separate himself both physically and mentally from the clients company.  It is important to note that, in obtaining a general understanding of the external Auditor (the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the entity and industry) and how the entity and industry complies with that framework.  The external auditor is in a better position to cause operations or call into question the entity continuance as a going concern, thus the external auditor can achieve on a strict basis of being independence.  \nThe need for financial information cannot be over-emphasized.  This was noted by Asechemie [1994] that a lot of money is spent on setting up and operating managerial accounting systems in the hope of making available useful information in the management process.  But why information at all?  Can managers not operate without information? Why is it important?  Three identifiable conditions exist for the explanation of the importance of information.\nThese are the off the scene condition, uncertainty condition.  This in effect, point to the fact that society would integrate without information and information would help in creating awareness about the unknown.\nInformation as an important component that leads to social economic and political development of society needs to be regulated especially those that are financial in nature so as to deduce relevant information.  Lee [1982] states that the complexity or an economic structure regulates the types and amount of information which flows through the system.\nHowever, the identity of such information depends not so much on its volume as on its quality.  Its user must be confident of its reliability and credibility.  This quality basically explains the importance of information to a society.  The problem associated with the financial information and external Auditor’s independence is unique that a basic understanding of auditor’s role and duties will help to clear the puzzle that surrounds the audit function.\nIn addressing the issue, Lee [1982] noted that the degree of confidence held in the Auditors opinion and in the annual financial statement he is attesting by the shareholders and other users of the statement varies directly with his ability, physically and mentally to disregard and to disassociate himself from the client company and its management.  \nPublished Accounts should be studied carefully by users before making use of it.  He went further to say that the particular use will determine the method of analysis to be used in evaluating the published accounts.\nAuditing as a concept can be defined as an independent examination of an expression of opinion on the financial statement of an enterprise by an appointed auditor and in compliance with any relevant statutory obligation.  Audit can also be defined as an independent review and investigation of the Financial Statement of the underlying transaction with a view to reporting thereon.\nEton (1996) states that Audit given credibility to accounts and third parties tend to rely more on audited accounts than unaudited accounts especially where finance is being sought or business is being offered for sale.\nAlso, he said that it is not the main purpose of audit to detect errors and fraud.  It is the director’s task to device procedures to minimize such risk and discover them as they occur.\nHowever, the fact that an audit is regularly undertaken will act as a moral detriment against fraud, while persistent error or serious fraud should be discovered if a reasonably competent audit has been conducted.   In this context an external auditor is the appointed person by shareholder management of the company to carry out an audit function.  \nThis study is aimed at reviewing, evaluating the roles of external auditors in the public accounts of some selected Limited Liability Company in Rivers State.\n1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nCorporate organizations in recent times have faced a lot of constraints.  Some of these constraints are as a result of lack of independent of external auditor which had led to inaccurate published accounts.\nMost people argued that external Auditors should be held responsible for any misconception created by the published accounts.  \nThis issue becomes more prominent when despite the health position presented by the published accounts; still the business may be operating in trouble order.  Most investment analysts argues that the role of external auditors in published accounts should be reviewed and addressed properly.  According to them, some of the investment advice and constitutional services made, using the published accounts turned out to be failure.\nThe imperial evidence to the problem under study can be found in the recent banks distress that arise after these banks financial statement were adjudicated as given a true and fair view of the state or affairs of the bank.\nThey went further to state that their reliance on the financial accounts prepared by professional accountants has cost so many positions in the business of investment and consultancy services.  Accountants on their own argue that the accounts prepared according to the requirements of law and based on the financial records kept by the corporate organization can be said to be or a true and fair view.  The researcher decided to carry out the study on external Auditors and published accounts.\n1.3    PURPOSE OF STUDY\nThe aim of the study is to examine the role external Auditors play in published accounts.  The purposes of the study are stated as follows:\n(i)    To ascertain the reason for lack of credibility in published accounts.\n(ii)    To investigate the role of external auditor in published accounts.\n(iii)    To determine how far these roles have contributed to the credibility of published accounts.\n(iv)    To find out how one can determine the extent of credibility of the published accounts.\n1.4    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\nThe objective of this study is to examine the role external Auditors play in published accounts.\n(i)    To find out how one can determine the extent of credibility of the published accounts.\n(ii)    To evaluate the responsibility of external Auditors to third parties making use of the published accounts.\n(iii)    To determine the importance of independence in general audit work.\n(iv)    To find out the role of accountancy bodies in published accounts.\n(v)    Finally, to give useful suggestions, recommendation that will serve as a foundation for enforcing the credibility of published accounts by Accountants and Accountancy bodies.\n1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION\nThe study will attempt to answer the following questions and others as they may arise:-\n(i)    Does reliability of Published Accounts affect investment decision?\n(ii)    What is the reason for appointing an external Auditor?\n(iii)    How can you evaluate the work done by the external Auditor?\n(iv)    In what ways can you determine the credibility of published accounts?\n(v)    What are the factors militating against the credibility of published accounts?\n(vi)    What are the role published accounts has to play on investment analysis?\n(vii)    How would one evaluate the trueness and fairness of published accounts?\n1.6    HYPOTHESIS\nFor effective administration of this research work, the following hypothesis are formulated and stated in the null forms:\n(i)    The Published Accounts has no significant relationship with the true position of the enterprise.\n(ii)    There is no significant relationship between the reliability of published accounts and the independence of external Auditors.\n(iii)    There is no significant relationship between the reliability of published accounts and effectiveness of investment decision by users of financial report.\n1.7    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nIt is hoped that this study would help in educating and highlighting the benefit of credible published accounts.  Again the researcher is hopeful that this work will serve as a foundation for enforcing the credibility of published accounts by Accountancy bodies.  It will also highlight the consequences of an incredible in published accounts for both the public and users.  \nThe study will go further to show that published accounts, if more credible will contribute to the over-all performance of the investment sector.\nThe study will show to Accountants and Accountancy bodies how they should present the true position of the enterprise and their present position of published accounts.\n1.8    SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThis study is restricted to the following corporate organizations such as:\n(a)    Akintola Williams Co., Port-Harcourt Branch\n(b)    K.P.M.P.

The level of specialization in the economy (economic development) depends on the quality of financial institutions.Underdeveloped financial markets prohibit an economy to specialize in sectorswhere finance is important. Capital flows and international trade are complements when countries differ in the degree of development of their financial sectors. Capital flows to countries with more robust financial institutions which in turn allow their economies to develop sectorsthat are financially dependent.Questionnaires, focus group discussion and interviews schedule were used in systematic arrangement and method of formulating and implementing the purpose/objectives of the study for data analysis. The total sample size for this study obtained is 375 respondents of the focal groups amounting to 71.3%.  The designs, among other things, describe a phenomenon of interest, to test the research hypothesis and provide forms of casual explanation to evaluate the objectives of interest. The conclusions drawn from this research quite explicitly show thatTrading friction induced by regulations in the stock market may reduce speculative trading activities and may help stabilize market prices and the stock market in limiting managerial risk-taking.  And also recommendation was drawn in this study.\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1    Background of The study\nTransaction costs for investor trading in the U.S. stock market have declined significantly over the past 30 years: for example, the bid-ask spreads on Dow Jones stocks dropped from over 0.7% in 1980 to 0.2% in the 2000s, and the average brokerage commissions on listed stocks fell from 13 cent per share in 1980 to 4 cent per share in the 2000s.\nThere has been a debate over the effect of such changes on asset prices and financial stability. On the one hand, a lower transaction cost enhances trading and promotes market efficient market efficiency. On the other hand, an easy transaction makes the financial market less stable and may have a detrimental effect on the macro economy. The proponents of the “Tobin tax,” for example, tend to emphasize the latter view.\nOne recent development in the corporate finance literature is the emphasis on the “feedback” effect. This literature challenges the traditional view of the financial market as merely a mirror image of real economic activities, emphasizing that activities in the financial market reveal information and affect (thus “feed back into”) the behavior of firms and other economic actors. In light of this view, one natural question is: how does the decline in transaction costs in the financial market affect the real activity?\nIn Nigeria these objectives include achievements of domestic price stability, balance of payment equilibrium, efficiency, equitable distribution of income and economy and development.\nEconomy refers to the continuous increase in a country’s national income or the total volume of goods and services, a good indicator of economy is the increase in Gross National Product (GNP) over a long period of time. Economy development on the overhead implies both structural and functional transformation of all the economy indexes from a low to a high state (Siyan, 2000:150) one of the macro–economy variables of importance is the exchange rate policy country.\nExchange rate policy involves choosing where foreign transaction will take place (Obadan, 1996). Exchange rate policy is therefore a component of macro-economy management policies the monetary authorities in any given economy uses to achieve internal balance in medium run. Specifically internal balance mean the level of economy activity that is consistent with the satisfactory control of inflation. On the contrary, external or sustainable current account deficit financed on lasting basis expected capital inflow.\nIt is important to know that economy objectives are usually the main consideration in determining the exchange control. For instance from 1982–1983, the Nigerian currency was pegged to the British pound sterling on a 1.1 ration. Before then, the Nigerian naira has been devalued by 10%. Apart from this policy measures discussed above, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) applied the basket of currencies approach from 1979 as the guide in determining the exchange rate was determined by the relative strength of the currencies of the country’s trading partner and the volume of trade with such countries. Specifically weights were attached to these countries with the American dollars and British pound sterling on the exchange rate mechanism (CBN, 1994). One of the objectives of the various macro–economy policies adopted under the Structural Adjustment Programme (SPA) in July, 1986 was to establish a realistic and sustainable exchange rate for the naira, this policy was recommended in 1986 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). On exchange mechanism and was adopted in 1986.\nThe key element of Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) was the free market determination of the naira exchange rate through an auction system.\nThis was the beginning of the unstable exchange rate; the government had to establish the foreign exchange market (FEM) to stabilize the exchange rate depending on the state of balance of payments, the rate of inflation, Domestic liquidity and employment. Between 1986 and 2003, the Federal Government experimented with different exchange rate policies without allowing any of them to make a remarkable impact in the economy before it was changed. This inconsistency in policies and lack of continuity in exchange rate policies aggregated unstable nature of the naira rate. (Gbosi, 1994:70).\n 1.2      Statement of The Problem\nThis major problem which this study is designed to solve is whether the exchange rate has any bearing on Nigerians economy and development. While some Economist dispute the ability of change in the real exchange rate to improve the trade balance of developing countries (Hinkle, 1999:21) because of elasticity of their low export, others believe that structural policies could however change the long-term trends in the terms of trade and the prospects for export led. Instabilities of the foreign exchange rate are also a problem to the economy.\nThe following statements of the problems are:\n1)    To ensure there is stable foreign exchange rate.\n2)    Devaluation of naira.\n3)    To ensure there is stable government policy in the country.\n 1.3      Objective Of The Study\nThe objective of the study is to show the effect of money market trading mechanism and development of the Nigerian economy identifying the impacts of the unstable exchange rate of the naira on these major macro-economy variables would however, depend on the conditions prevailing in the economy at a given time.\nThe main objectives of exchange rate policy in Nigeria are:\n1.    To identify the fluctuation of price in the stock market.\n2.    To present the value of the domestic currency.\n3.    To maintain favourable external reserve position.\n4.    To ensure price stability and price levels which are consistent with those of our trading partners.\n5.    To have a stable and realistic exchange rate that is in consonance with other macro-economy fundamentals.\n1.4     Research Questions\n1.    Does Exchange rate fluctuation effect on Nigeria economy and development?\n2.    Does Price stability effect on Nigeria Stock Exchange?\n3.    In what way Unstable of government policy in the country effect foreign exchange?\n1.5    Research Hypothesis\nBased on the objectives of the study, the following hypothesis were formulated.\n1)    Ho: Price stability has no significant effect on Nigeria Stock Exchange.\nHi: Price stability has a significant effect on Nigeria Stock Exchange.\n2)    Ho: Unstable of government policy in the country has no significant effect foreign exchange.\nHi: Unstable of government policy in the country has a significant effect foreign exchange.\n3)    Ho: Exchange rate fluctuation has no significant effect on Nigeria economy  and development.\nHi: Exchange rate fluctuation has a significant effect on Nigerians economy and development.\n1.6    Significance of The Study\nThe significance of this research work lies in the fact that if the cause of the unstable exchange rate of the naira is identified and corrected, the economy will rapidly grow and develop into an advance one. This is so because if the unstable exchange rate of naira is proved to be affecting the macro- economy major variables badly, including Real exchange rate, Real interest rate, inflation rate, gross domestic product and trade openness of the country, attempts should be made to stabilize the exchange rate. This is because these variables are gauge for the measurement of and development of any economy. Importantly, this study would help the government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to identify the strength and weakness of each foreign exchange system and hence adopt the policy that suits the economy best. This will definitely enhanceand development of the economy, the study will also serve as a guide to future researchers on this subject.\n1.7    Scope Of The Study\nThis research work is designed to cover the period 1980-2009 a period of thirty years. The scope consist of the regulatory and deregulatory exchange rate period i.e. the fixed exchange rate and the floating exchange rate period. The study is based on core macro-economy performance of Nigeria between 1980-2010 more so, it rests can core economy  and development in Nigeria for the period of thirty-one years.\n1.8    Definition of Terms\nFinancial Market: is a market in which people trade financial securities, commodities, and other fungible items of value at low transaction costs and at prices that reflect supply and demand. Securities include stocks and bonds, and commodities include precious metals or agricultural products.\nStock Markets: which provide financing through the issuance of shares or common stock, and enable the subsequent trading thereof.\nMoney Markets:which provide short term debt financing and investment.\nCapital Markets: may also be divided into primary markets and secondary markets. Newly formed (issued) securities are bought or sold in primary markets, such as during initial public offerings. Secondary markets allow investors to buy and sell existing securities. The transactions in primary markets exist between issuers and investors, while secondary market transactions exist among investors.\n\nFINANCIAL MARKET FRICTIONS AND ITS EFFECT ON THE MONEY MARKET TRADING MECHANISM\n",

These resources are known as the four “Ms” in the vocabulary management. They are; man, materials, money and machines. Of these four, the most important element is unarguably the resources – man. The development of people in an organization will lead to improved performance.\nAlthough business executives believe that people are the most important asset, some of these executive fail to invest in people.\nPartial  evidence abounds as to the connection between people development and financial performance.  Companies that invest in the development of human capital seem to achieve better financial performance than those that do not. Training is one of the ways in which an organization can develop employees for improve performance. It helps to ensure that workers in an organization function effectively, through equipping them with required skills and knowledge and also up date their knowledge as condition changes. Many new employees come into the organization already equipped with skills and knowledge that will help them to start work. Others may require extensive training before they are ready to make such of a contribution to the organization. Majority, however, at one time or the other will require some type of training in order to maintain an effective level of job performance. While training may be accomplished on an informal basis, better results are usually attained through a well – organized formal training program. The question now is – does human capital development drive superior performance or does superior financial performance make it possible to take a more strategic approach to human capital development? The ability for profitable companies to provide better pay and better training opportunities than their competitors may lead employees to “blur engagement” which connotes involvement and superior contribution – with satisfaction, with pay.\nThe biggest challenge for managers is the ability to create a highly motivated human resource development unit. Modernization of human resource development and the transformation of human capital are efforts essential for the provision of excellent and high quality service to the stakeholders and client.\nFor years, companies have vigorously treasured key areas of their operations – from the success rates of new product introductions and productivity of manufacturing operations, to direct mail conversion rates and customer retention. The reason is obvious: brining desirable new products to market, squeezing the most from one’s most physical assets and gaining and keeping customers are all critical factors in a company’s success. Without concrete performance measures, effective e management of these areas would be impossible. However, while measurements of supply chain, research and development and sales activities has been common place, consistent and routine gauging of the performance  of the work force – as well as the impact of the human capital investments – has been virtually non existent. The fact is that successful organizations today and in the foreseeable future will be those that are able to measure the business impact of the investment  in people – whether that investment is employee recruiting, performance management, skills development or benefits administration.\nFor quite sometime now, attention ahs often been focused almost entirely on financial and physical assets, like cash, stocks, machines, equipment, land and building to mention but a few. However, the resulting human metrics can serve as a catalyst for change, providing a critical missing link for creating and sustaining competitive advantage for organization operating in an increasing knowledge intensive global economy.\nAlthough employees are always treated as both assets and cost for their employers, most organizations have proven to be much more capable at measuring the cost side of human capital than the asset side. At a minimum, this imbalance results in inefficiencies in human capital management. Analysis shows that, in many cases, the imbalance creates a chronic under investment in human capital elative to other forms of investment. The result is sub – optimal performance on the part of most organizations, often accompanied by a sacrifice of long term productivity and portability in exchange for short – lived gains.\nImproving the quality and the relevance of human capital measurement enables organizations to better understand their overall “people – related” strengths and weakness and identifying areas for improvement. It is essential to correct this situation. Any organization hoping to perform at highest level need to link investments in people to bottom – line business result.\nThe rise in human capital management in the 1990’s brought management scholars to debate on the linkage between the management of people and performance. A number of attempts were made to put empirical flesh on the theoretical bones of the resource based view and he specific human resources prescriptions. Some of these studies include;  (1) A cross sectional study of U.S owner firms by Huselid, M.A (1995), he was that high performance work systems have an economically and statically significant impact on both turnover productivity and performance.\nHuselid, M.A Jackson, S.E and Schuler, R.S (1997), did a cross sectional study on 293 publicly held U.S firms. They discovered that human resource   can perform by recruitment, selection, training, performance appraisal and compensational administration.\nThe system  of human resource practice can increase organization performance (Yeung and Ulrich, 1990).\nFor organizations given the present difficult business environment which is highly competitive, all organizations including banks have come to recognize the importance of having the best type of workers. The value that people can bring to services and products for customers depends on the competence and ownership toward work performance. Developing employees competence and commitment is an investment that would ensure organizations continued business success.  \nThis study is therefore undertaken to show the relationship between human capital development and corporate performance, that is how human capital development will bring about increase/improved performance.\n1.2    PROBLEM ANALYSIS\nA country’s overall economic development and growth can be assumed to be particularly related to how the available human resources are harnessed towards stated goals and objectives. There is no doubt that developing an organization human capital will lead to improved performance.\nA successful organization is one which has an effective human resources policy on ground. It is important to note that the task  of managing resources is not an easy one especially when it comes to the management of people as resources. Since it is not easy managing people upon whom the growth and efficiency of all organization depend, adequate plans and strategies needs to be put in place which are aimed at acquiring the right personnel, and also fine turning such personnel, so to speak, in order that they may function optimally the realization of organizational goals. The problem here is to determine the quality of human capital development that will lead to improved performance; that is, the human capital initiatives that will help to increase performance.\nThis research work is aimed at addressing performance management through human capital transformation and development. In the fight of this therefore, the following questions merits serious consideration.\n1.    What is the relationship between training and performance of workers in the organization?\n2.    What is the relationship between mentoring and performance of employees?\n3.    What is the relationship between internship (on – the – job training) and performance of employees?\nThe above questions are therefore issues which are at the heart of this study\n1.3    RESEARCH OBJECTIVES\nThe following are fundamental objectives of this research:\n1.    Ascertain the relationship between training and performance of workers in the organization.\n2.    Determine the relationship between mentoring and performance of employees.\n3.    Determine the relationship between internship ( on – the – job raining) and performance of employees.      \n1.4    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\nIn order to realize the objective of this study, the following null and alternative hypothesis have been formulated for testing:\n1.    HO:    There is nor relationship between training and performance of Workers in the organization.\nHI:    There is a relationship between training and performance of workers in the organization.\n2.    Ho: There is no relationship between mentoring and performance of employees.\nHI:     There no relationship between mentoring and performance of employees.\n3.    HO: There is no relationship between internship and performance of employees.\nHI: There is a relationship between internship and performance of employees.\n1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThe objectives of this study are stated above. It is important to point out here that this study is aimed at ascertaining performance of employees through human capital development.\nIt is important to understand the population; it may not be feasible to access the whole population, hence for convenience, a particular size or number is selected. This size is known as the sample size. In order to reduce the problem encounter in sampling organization as a whole; a sample of 30 companies and banks quoted in the Nigerian Stock Exchange were used for this study. These companies were used because of the ease and access to information on them.\nThis study centers on the development of human capital for improved performance, and it will cover such areas as: recruitment, supporting and investment in people using variety of means including, education, training, coaching, organizational development and human resource management as well as problems that may arise from the attempts at developing human resource in Nigeria organizations.\n1.6    RELEVANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nWhen completed, the findings from this study will apart from advancing academics on the subject of human capital development and corporate performance in Nigeria organizations, it will also be relevant to stakeholders, ultimately in arriving at an appropriate mix for decision to enhance their returns. It will also be useful in the following ways:\n1.    It will assist managers in the organization whose task is to sharpen the productive abilities and qualities of employees to achieve corporate goals.\n2.    This study will also be of immense importance to the employees in the organization, whose collective task will make or mar the organization.\n3.    This study will highlight the different aspects of human capital development and performance.\n4.    Researchers in the field human resource generally will also find the study quite useful when completed.\n5.    The findings from this study will highlight the problems of human capital development and how such problems can be tackled for sustained organizational achievement of stated goals.\n6.    Finally the findings from this study will be of immense benefit to the general public in various ways.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE PERFORMANCES ",

The philosophers of risk management, conceptual  framework as proposed by several authorities have not made certain, any best way of risk management in bank although options such as avoidance transfer, retention and/or even portfolio diversification have been unshelled as probable measures of risk control. The study sample transcends beyond First Bank of Nigeria Plc to include the operational 23 commercial banks in Nigeria.\nThe ordinary Least Square (OLS) was used for data analysis for which data was obtained from the statistical bulletin of CBN in 2009.\nThe results were discussed, thus revealing that there is a significantly positive relationship between the nations GDP (economic health) and the activities of bank in areas such as credit to private sector and money supply.\nBased on the findings, it was recommended that the Nigerian banks in conjunction with monetary authorities exert more efforts in curbing by way of managing and mitigating, the risk of banks in Nigeria. Hence the need to be systematic and structured, transparent and inclusive, dynamic, iterative and responsive to change and create value always.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCHAPTER ONE\n1.1    Background of the Study    -    -    \n1.2    Statement of Research problem     \n1.3    Objective of the Study    -    -    -    \n1.4    The Research Hypothesis    -    -\n1.5    Significance of the Study     -    -    -\n1.6    Scope and Limitation of the study    -    -\nCHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW\n2.1    Risk in Nigerian Banks-    -    -\n2.1.1    What is Risk?    -    -    -    -\n2.1.2    Nigerian Banks in Risky Business    -\n2.2    Risk Exposures (Types and Measures)-    -    \n2.2.1    Credit Risk Management    -    -    \n2.2.2    Credit Exposure (Types of Criteria)    -\n2.2.3    Market Risk Management     -    -\n2.2.4    Operations Risk Management     -    \n2.2.5    Liquidity Risk Management     -    -    -\n2.2.6    Legal Risk Management     -    -\n2.2.7    Information Security Risk Management     -\n2.2.8    Compliance Risk Management     -\n2.3    Process of Risk Management in Nigerian Banks\n2.3.1    Risk Analysis Risk and Return     -    \n2.4    Theoretical Foundations and Conceptual\nframework for Risk-Return Analysis    \n2.4.1    CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)     -    \n2.4.2    APT (Arbitrage Pricing Theory)    -\nCHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n3.1    Research Design    -    -    -    -    \n3.2    Population of the Study    -    -\n3.3    The Sample and Sampling Technique    \n3.4    Data Collection                -\n3.5    Data Analysis Techniques         -    \nCHAPTER FOUR : DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION\n4.1    Introduction    -    -    -    \n4.2    Data Presentation    -    -    -\n4.3    Analysis and Interpretation of Data Result    \n4.4    Policy Implications    -\nCHAPTER FIVE:\nSUMMARY, RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION\n5.1    Summary of Findings    -    -\n5.2    Recommendations     -    -    \n5.3    Conclusion    -    -    -    -    \n    Bibliography     -    -    -    \n    Appendix     -    \nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n    There is no gain saying, the fact that banking business is a sensitive business highly induced with maximum risk from operations to image making among other things.\n    However, the issues of risk management in the banking sector is gradually gaining light and the consciousness is on the increase thanks to the global economic meltdown which has to a greater extent exposed the inefficiency of bigger financial institutions to manage risks at their disposal especially that of credit risk. This adduced to the fact why big banks such as the Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, later taken over by JP Morgan  of Washington Mutual (America’s largest bank); take over of Merill Lynch by Bank of America US Government takeover of AIG  (World’s Largest insurer), the government bail out of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mac (key US mortgage institutions); and the collapse of Bear Steams amongst other developments, led to a failure of confidence that let to a credit freeze and the current meltdown. In the Nigerian peculiarity, evidence is drawn from the banking recapitalization and consolidation processes of 2005 drastically shrinking the one time 89 institution (banks) industry to 24 banks. Also, recently is the Central Bank (CBN) exposure of failing banks which will leave the industry having no fewer than four institutions to be rescued.\n    At the macro level, Nigeria and other Sub-Saharan African countries no doubt, are vulnerable to the effects of global recession although the impact is yet to completely unfold. The fact remains that if financial institutions in this part of the world should take with levity, the issue of risk management and corporate governance, the downfall of bigger financial institutions are inevitable even in the face of the capital market crisis rocking the economy presently which came as a result of banks exposure to the market. Hence, it is undisputable that failures of most financial institutions would over were attributed to the lax and carefree attitude and the insensitivity of managers to risk management issues at their disposal.\n    Risk therefore, is a disturbance variable in banking and incidentally can not be avoided as long as operators (bankers) remain in business wherein the challenge is not taking risk without calculation, as the returns from such risks will usually be outstanding if successful but devastating if unsuccessful. Upon this note, the chartered institution of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), through the office of the directors of consultancy, training and research urged bankers to always identify risks, assess risks and mitigate them.\n    Moreover, First Bank Nigeria  Plc has noted that there has been no systematic banking crisis of the scale witnessed in advanced economies like the US and Europe, because with the minimal cross border banking system linkages, there is less exposure to complex financial products and financial systems are not well integrated with other global financial markets which have undergone a revolution driven by deregulation, a rapid pace of financial innovation including risk of alternative capital pools and global financial integration to which effect, the crisis continues to unfold itself on the national economic becoming evident in the following areas: shrinking economy and/or show growth; decline in government revenue; inflation (which pushed up the year-one-year headline inflation rate the 15.7 percent in 2010 compared with 6.6 percent at the end of December 2007 thus, adversely affecting the purchasing power of consumer and increasing operating cost); credit crunch; drop in equity market (the general flight to safegy and liquidity triggered by the global meltdown led to the withdrawal by foreign investors from our equities market which in turn triggered a bearish trend that saw all share index loosing about 45.8 percent of its value with the market capitalization dropping by N3.2 billion in 2008 alone) and so on. By this, First Bank Nigerian Plc has posited variants of risk natures ranging from the characters of operational risk, legal risk, market risk, credit risk etc, its management philosophies as well as procedures.\n    Moreso, risk has today assumed different connotations in the everyday usage, stressing that it may be defined as cause of action and sometimes inaction, taken under conditions of uncertainty which exposes one to possible loss. However, in a banking institutions, financial risk is the possibility that the outcome of an action could bring up adverse impacts which could either result in a direct loss of earnings or capital or may result in imposition of constraints on the banks ability to meet its  business objectives or even loss a business opportunities. Hence, risk management is a discipline at the core of banking business and encompasses all activities that affect a banks risk profile involving identification measurement, monitoring and controlling of risks. Risk management therefore, should be a continuous and developing process and should run throughout the organization which ought to translate the strategy of an organization into tactical and operational objectives assigning responsibility throughout the organization with each manager or employee being made responsible for the management of a component of the risk as part of his job description. This will indeed support accountability, performance, measurement and reward thus, promoting operational efficiency at all levels.  \n1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n    This understudy, tends to profer a headway for the following puzzles in risk management in banks.\na)    Are there established risk management policies and procedures, articulated, documented and entrenched in Nigerian banks?\nb)    Does every party involved in the risk process, adhere strictly to these policies and procedures?\nc)    Does the risk management process provide for close analysis and monitoring of the dynamics of operating environment with a view to evaluating their impact on the banks past, present and future risk decisions?\nd)    Are the banks risk managers adequate in number, efficient in training and experience to meet challenges of the market that is both highly competitive and affected by recession and technology?\ne)    How relevant is risk return consideration factors in the operations analysis process of Nigerian banks?\nf)    Do Nigerian banks have any known standard risk-acceptance criteria peculiar to the bank concerned or perhaps the banking industry?\ng)    Are there, well articulated risk-rating system and format that ensures consistency in the evaluating existing and prospective risk portfolio?\nh)    What role does the prudential regulation play in enhancing banks risk management systems?\ni)    Are there lapses in the risk management process of Nigerian banks today and what possible suggestive remedial measures should be taken.\nj)    If there is a direct relationship between banks’ risks and financial crisis.\n1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n    In a bid to explore the realism inherent in risk management of Nigeria banks, this study posits the following as purposes of t he research work:\na)    Identify risk management processes adopted by Nigerian banks.\nb)    Establish the degree of entrenchment and adherence of such policies by risk managers in the banks.\nc)    Identify whether inherent risks are commensurate with return through appropriate pricing of the facility which should be a function of facility (enterprise) risk rating.\nd)    Ascertain the role of government at enhancing banks risk management process through its relevant regulatory authorities.\ne)    Determine how Nigerian banks balance the challenge of providing expenditure service delivery to customers with thorough and prudent bank management process especially given the threat that exist from environment; company; and investment analysis.\nf)    Assess the capacity of Nigerian banks risk management process to provide for close analysis and monitoring of the dynamics in the operating environment with a view of evaluating their impact on the banks past, present and future risk trends.\ng)    Identify shortcomings and suggest corrective measure to the banks’ risk management process in a bid enhance the banks’ overall quality.\n1.4    THE RESEARCH HYPOTEHSIS\n    In reflection of the possible relationship of factors causing and/or enhancing risks as well as those being affected by risk, t he following inferences are thus noteworthy;\nHA:    Inadequate management of banks risk is responsible for financial crisis in an economy.  \nHO:    Inadequate management of banks risk is not responsible for financial crisis in an economy.  \nHA:    Inadequate prudential regulations from government authorities necessitate banks risk consequences.  \nHO:    Inadequate prudential regulations from government authorities do not necessitates banks risk consequences.  \n1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n    Moye (2003) in reflection of the unoveremphasizable need for concerned parties in the Nigerian banking industry to identify, assess and mitigate risk inherent in banking business and operations posits the following:\ni.    The differing natures of bank risks\nii.    The variant degrees of bank risks\niii.    Measurability of bank risk through adequate assessment procedures.\niv.    Measures of mitigating bank risks effects on national and global economics respectively.\nv.    The best practical of banks risks: its indulgence, safety nets optioning as is obtainable.\nWith this on hand, it is expected that the numerous bank failure, economic and financial crisis rocking nations and the world and Nigeria in  particular are short-lived hence, enhanced banking service quality at an abruptly reduced risk encumbrances is the focus of this study. In furthermore of the relevance of this study, exploration will be adequately given to the highlighted points above.\nThis study shall be relevant and useful in the following areas of bank management, financial regulation by necessary regulatory authorities, economic management et cetera hence, bank management and staff, CBN, and offices of financial and economic planning of states, and federal government and as well agents of financial transactions. All these and sundry will find the work more than useful in their obligations.\n1.6      SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n    This study in its bid to affect its reality focuses firstly on the Nigerian banks with particular interest in First Bank of Nigeria Plc, a fore leading bank in the country especially for its risk management and risk disclosure. Moreos, the study is directed to utilize extensively the information from the annual report of First Bank Nigeria Plc in 2009 as well as its publication on risk management disclosure in 2009. In addition, this study explores the possible dimensions of risk evident in Nigerian banks and their peculiarity.\n    Despite the rigorous work carried out on this salient issue in Nigerian banks, this study as presented lends to be bedeviled by some sort of shortcomings that necessitate limitations on the level of accuracy, adequacy and reliability. These short comings include:\na.    The use of one bank as a case study not withstanding the high pedigree of first bank of Nigeria Plc in the industry which aids the drawing of a reasonably fair inference from this work on risk management systems in Nigerian Banks.\nb.    The inadequacy of relevant literature as well as inappropriate documentation of data thus, adding to the inefficiency of data generation. These weaknesses however, are seen to be occasioned to this degree by time and financial constraints literature and inevitable in the course of carrying out this study.\n\nA STUDY OF RISK MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIAN BANKS: FIRST BANK OF NIGERIA PLC AS A CASE STUDY",

By implication a chartered accountant must have successfully undergone intensive academic and professional training as required by the rules and regulations of the institute to be able to contribute professionally to the economic needs of the society.\n    The training and examinations which a member of the institute must have successful completed before admission provides a business education of the highest order. Remaining a member of the institution, in good standing, required of a chartered accountant, continuing commitment to integrity, independence and objectivity and an abiding interest in seeking to remain up to date in the legal, technical and professional matters that affect his work.\n    Any environment where resources are committed to the attainment of economic objective will certainly require the services of a chartered accountant. As a result, chartered accountants are invaluable tools in environments such as:\ni.    Government  establishment\nii.    Commerce and industries, and\niii.    Educational institutions.\nThe services required of a chartered accountant in the above organization depend on the particular need of the organization concerned, which may be in any of the following services areas.  \na)    Accountancy Services\n•    Setting up a sound accounting system including computerization of manual system.\n•    Preparation, maintenance and adequate record keeping of all financial transactions.\n•    Preparation of annual accounts and reports viz: profit and loss accounts, balance sheets source and application of funds, etc.\n•    Establishment and operation/maintenance of payroll systems.\n•    Assisting in the improvement of internal control systems\n•    Assisting in the improvement of internal control systems.\nb)      Auditing and Investigations Service\n-    Auditing of financial statements to comply with statutory requirements.\n-    Investigations of financial matters.\nc)    Taxation Services\n•    Preparation of tax computations and agreeing tax liabilities with\nd)    Management Services\n•    Analysis and interpretation of accountants to show areas of weakness, strengths and emphasis\n•    Project analysis and appraisals\n•    Cash/working capital management\n•    Design and maintenance of accounting and management information systems.\n•    Development of computer systems.\n•    Conducting feasibility studies and preparation of feasibility reports.\n•    Personal recruitment and manpower development\n•    Company formation and registration and general advice on company secretarial matters including filling of annual returns.\nIt is interesting to note that chartered accountants can be further sub-classified into practicing and non-practicing. The main difference between these two classifications is that the non- practicing chartered accountants can undertake all the services listed above as do the practicing, except for auditing of financial statements to comply with statutory requirement. In other words, the practicing chartered accountant is a member of the institute who applied for and was granted licensed to practice by the council while the no-practicing accountant is one that has not been granted such a license. A number is not eligible for this license until he has a continuous period of thirty months before or after or partly before and after becoming a member of the institute been employed in a responsible accountant in public practice in Nigeria or elsewhere.\n    Chartered Accountants besides their professional training are also members of the large community. Like every rational man, they make decisions, interact, react to their environment, which can either be legal, economic, political, social, technological or otherwise. They also make rational choices amongst competing alternatives. Infact, one of their functions in management include project analysis and appraisals, i.e they advice on investable areas amongst industries and even companies within the same industry. The fact that they are not excluded from the investing public also means that they can analyse investments that they are aware of and appraise them in order to streamline their preferences.\n    The institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) defines investments as assets acquired by an enterprise for purpose  of capital appreciation or income generation without any activities in form of production, trade or provision of service. But at  the individual level, which includes the chartered accountants, investments, involves trading on shares, securities and stock market which are already existing in the  stock market (Financial Assets). It also includes engaging in ventures involving commitment of economic resources to attainment of specified objectives.\n    For one, including the chartered accountants, to engage in investment activities, there is needed to be aware of the investment profile and also to be to appraise the investment in other to make a choice. However, this project is designed to know the investment awareness and preferences amongst practicing and non-practicing chartered accountants in Nigeria.\n1.2    PROBLEM DEFINITION\n    Accountants are supposed to be well trained in financial matters. Their level of exposure and financial strength could tend to affect their investment ability for example, reading financial reports about companies and being able to ascertain whether or not a company is doing well. The audited financial statements prepared by a company reveal the economic well being or otherwise of the company. It is expected that such knowledge would stimulate investment decisions even for the chartered accountant.\n    In particular, the researcher is interested in determining the investment awareness and preferences amongst practicing and non-practicing chartered accountants. This can be achieved by providing empirical answer to the following questions.\ni.    Do Accountants invest at all?\nii.    What is their investment preference?\niii.    How much do they invest on annual basis?\niv.    What are their motives for investing?\nv.    What are the general problems affecting their investment endeavour?\nvi.    What kind of analysis do they carry out before decision on what to invest on?\n1.3    OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n    The major objective of the study is to find out the investment preference and awareness of chartered accountants both in the public and private sector. In this regard, the following sub-objectives will be pursued.\n1.    To identify the level of Accountants investments\n2.    To find out their investment preference\n3.    To determine the level of shareholdings and distribution of share holding\n4.    To determine the motives behind their investments   \n5.    To examine the problems affecting their investment endeavour.\n1.4    HYPOTHESIS\n    It is generally accepted that inflation, income level, expected rate of returns etc, make an impact on individual investment decision. In this study, following hypothesis would be tested.\ni.    There is more investment awareness amongst practicing than non-practicing chartered accountants.\nii.    Practicing and non- practicing chartered accountants have different investment preferences.\n1.5    SCOPE OF STUDY\n    This study is restricted to practicing and non-practicing chartered accountants in Nigeria. Chartered accountants in Nigeria carry out their day to day activities in the following works of life.\ni.    Government departments\nii.    Statutory bodies\niii.    Commerce and industry\niv.    Educational institutions\nv.    Practicing firms and\nvi.    Personal business.\nAs a result, questionnaires shall be distributed amongst the sin possible state of the chartered accountants community. In this way, the outcome shall be properly representative.\n1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n    A study of this nature would be relevant to several people and institutions. They include:\n1.    The chartered accountants and the institute itself.\n2.    Investors (potential, present and future)\n3.    Stock brokers\n4.    Financial analysis and the Inland Revenue\n5.    General public (including research students)\n1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS\n1) Equity: This is a security representing residual ownership in a corporation. If there is no preference in payment of individual it is called common stock. If the preference is shown among owners, it is called preferred stock.\n2) Yield: It is a general term for the percentage return on a security investment\n3) Planning: This is the specific process of setting goals and developing ways to reach them. Stated otherwise, planning represents efforts to predict events and be prepared to deal with them.\n REFERENCES\nHumpton, J.J.

Contrary to the general view that risk taking in banks, or in any business activity as solely led to corporate failure, fear of these potential losses may prevent them from engaging in certain activities which may turn out to be very profitable; Isenmila (2002). Banking is in existence because of risk taking and the industry is booming because they have managed their risk, they take risk such as deposit, given loans and advances as well as investing in bills and other security, bank continuously engaged in risk taking even though the embodied liabilities and assets very in their risk. Risk of bank can be classified into two broad categories; fraud risk and market risks.\nFraud is a deliberate deception, trickery or cheating for unlawful gain through theft, defalcations and embezzlement. Frauds result in the largest losses to depositors and other creditors including deposit insurance agencies. They are rampant pervasive and the biggest single cause of bank failures in the United States of America during the 1959/1971 was due to fraud and irregularities. Hill (1975) also found that 88% of the 67 failures during 1960 to 1994 was due to improper loan defalcations, embezzlement and manipulation.\nAdewonmi (1986) observes that of all the various problems confronting Nigerian banking industry today, that fraud is easily the most intractable. Fraud therefore, is a “cankerworm that has eaten deep into the fabric of the present banking industry.\nThe second broad category of bank risk is market risks. This takes many forms. It comprises of all exposures t6hat subject the bank to the prospect of loss and hence the weakening of capital resources. As pointed out in another study, Nwankwo (1989) it is the pervasiveness of these risks and the failure of the market to effectively control them that explains why banks are more heavily regulated than any other commercial or industrial undertaking. Although, it is emphasized that the ultimate responsibility for evaluating risk and settling limits commensurate to a bank’s financial strength, reside with bank management. It is observed that without regulation, an undue percentage of financial institutions are likely to take excessive risk however, despite regulation and partly resulting from the cost of regulation risks have increased as bank innovated around the controls through services of off-balance sheet activities which earned them income without increasing the balance sheet totals. It is therefore necessary to examine what these risks are.\nOff-balance sheet risks relates to those risks incurred by bank as the result of activities related to contingent assets and liabilities. However, the balance sheet does not tell the whole story. It does not contain all the risks in bank operations. This is because banks undertake a number of activities or operations off-balance sheet. These operations which have been on the increase since the nineteen seventies (1970s) are in broad categories.\nOne relates to guarantees and similar contingent liabilities. These include guarantees, acceptances, standby letters of credit warrantees, endorsement, some of which in practice are binding on a bank in all circumstances and some from which a bank could withdraw without penalty, an example of the former is the irrevocable letter of credit floating rates notes, note insurance and revolving under-writing facilities.\nA third category covers foreign exchange interest rate and stock index related transactions. In most transaction the bank is exposed on the whole of the underlying principal of the transaction except when the settlement become due to those transactions involving the exchange of principal because of their substitutability for and similarity to on-balance sheet operations, supervisory opinion concluded that the risks involved in off- balance sheet operations are similar to the risks arising from on-balance sheet operations and that this risk should not be analyzed differently but as an integral part of banks overall risk exposure.\nUnion Bank of Nigeria Plc commenced operation in the year 1917 after being authorized by the banking act of 1916, Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, known as colonial bank, opened for business in Nigeria in Lagos, than Jos and Port Harcourt.       \nIn 1918, more branches were opened, namely Ebute-metta, Ibadan, Kano, Onitsha, Zaria and Burutu. In 1925; Barclays was formed to take over the activities of the colonial Bank along with two other British Banks. For the following 25 years, only three offices were added to the existing nine (9) branches which were at Aba, Gusau and Ijebu-ode, although, during the depression of 1939/1945 some branches were closed down. In 1950s, the bank (DCD) and a period of expansion commenced which led to the reopening of all offices that were closed. As a result of this development, the bank was able to open over fifty additional branches between 1959 and 1970.\nOn the implementation of the Nigeria enterprise promotion decree of 1972 and 1977, which empowered the government indigenization policy, the federal government of Nigeria acquire 51.672 of the shares while Barclays Bank Plc were left with 210% and 8.339 with the Nigerian public on the 22nd of March, 1978, the Federal Government ordered sanction against the bank as a result of the pronouncement of Barclays Bank International Limited of London on its activities in South Africa. The sanction led to massive withdrawals by depositors creating a liquidity crisis for the bank.\nIn 1979, Barclays Bank decided to sell 50% of its share to Nigeria, thus reducing the former equity holding to 20% consequently, the name was changed from Barclay’s Bank of Nigeria Limited to Union Bank of Nigeria Plc to reflect the new ownership structure of the Bank from 1979 to 1998, the ownership structure has remarked the same 51.67% for the ministry of finance (Federal Government) 28.33% for private Nigeria investors and 20% Barclay’s Bank but since 1999 to date, the ownership structure has been 100% by Nigeria without foreign interest.\n1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nThe basic objective of most banks include survival and growth, fulfillment of  social responsibility and making of satisfactory profit, but today most banks in Nigeria over the recent past have been making unusual high provision for doubtful debts which reduces profits.\nOne of the most striking trends involving modern banks has been the growth in their off-balance sheet activities and thus, their off-balance risk. Some of these activities are structured to reduced banks exposure to credit, interest rate or foreign exchange risks, but mismanagement or inappropriate use of these instruments can result in major losses for the banks and this will pose threats to the survival of banks. This problem has promoted this study.\n1.3    RESEARCH QUESTION\nThe following questions will be addressed in this study:\na.    What are the contingent contracts?\nb.    What are commercial letter of credits?\nc.    Does a Bank loan commitment have a significant relationship with off-balance sheet risk?\nd.    What are standby letters of credit?\n1.4    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\nThe objectives to guide this study include:\na.    To find out the causes of off-balance sheet risk of banks.\nb.    To find ways of minimizing off-balance sheet risk of banks.\nc.    To determine if off-balance sheet is the same among banks.\nd.    To find out ways of handling off-balance sheet risk of banks.\n1.5    HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY\nBase on the above research questions, we hereby formulate our hypothesis as follow:\n1.    H¬0:    There is no significant relationship between off-balance             sheet risk (contingent contracts and commercial letter of             credit) and Bank future profit after tax.\n    H1:    There is a significant relationship between off-balance             sheet risk (contingent contracts and commercial letter of             credit) and Bank future profit after tax.\n2.    H0:    There is no relationship between off-balance sheet risk             (commercial letter of credit) and Bank failure network.\n    H1:    There is a relationship between off-balance sheet risk             (commercial letter of credit) and Bank future network.\n1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThis study basically tends to deeply examine the off-balance sheet risk of banks and to really examine its effect on the banking industry. The benefits of these are highlighted as follows:\na.    Provides banks with useful information on the causes of off-balance sheet risk.\nb.    Provides banks with relevant ways of minimizing off-balance sheet risk.\nc.    Provides banks with relevant ways of managing off-balance sheet risk.\nd.    Serves also as reference material for future researches into off-balance sheet risk in financial institutions/banks.\n1.7    SCOPE/LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\nThe extent of this study will be limited to off-balance sheet risk of banks a case study of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc.\nThe study will cover the areas of off-balance sheet risk as it affects the assets and liabilities of banks such as loan, advances and overdrafts, acceptance, guarantees and other loss contingencies that are connected with off-balance sheet risk.\nFurthermore, this study also reviews the nature of the off-balance sheet risk exposure as it affects liabilities such as depositors and possible assistance.\n\nDETERMINANTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURES: CASE STUDY OF PETROLEUM AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES ",

To carry out this study a more recent data for the period 2012 – 2014 was reviewed and a model with the necessary variables constructed. For seeking out the dividend cut relationship sales growth, earnings per share growth, leverage, capital expenditure and cash flow from operations were chosen. The sample size of 70 was split into 35 dividend cutters and 35 dividend non-cutters using an equal sampling technique. A probit binary regression and a Jarque-bera test was adopted in the study.\nThe results revealed that companies with high fixed asset investment, growing earning per share and also companies that use borrowed money to finance their fixed asset expansion are significant dividend cutters. It we therefore conclude that company would not cut their dividend but the dividend payout would be insignificant. There should be a compulsory policy on the minimum percentage in which companies should pay as dividend.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION\n1.1    Background to the Study            \n1.2    Statement of the Research Problem    \n1.3    Objectives of the Study            \n1.4    Research Hypotheses            \n1.5    Scope of the Study                \n1.6    Significance of the Study            \n1.7    Limitations of the Study                \nCHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW\n2.1    Introduction                    \n2.2    Conceptual Framework                \n2.2.1     Dividend                            \n2.2.2     Dividend Policy            \n2.2.3     Dividend Payout            \n2.2.4    Sales Growth                    \n2.2.5    Cash Flow from Operations                \n2.2.6    Capital Expenditure                    \n2.2.7    Leverage (debt)                \n2.2.8    Earnings per Share                \n2.3     Empirical Framework\n2.3.1    Introduction                \n2.3.2     Sales Growth and Dividend Cut            \n2.3.3     Leverage (debt) and Dividend Cut                \n2.3.4    Cash Flow from Operations and Dividend Cut    \n2.3.5    Capital Expenditure and Dividend Cut            \n2.3.6    Earnings per Share Growth and Dividend Cut        \n2.4    Theoretical Literature\n2.4.1     The Bird in Hand Theory                \n2.4.2     Clientele Theories                                                                     \n2.4.3     Signalling Theories             \n2.4.4    Free Cash Flow Theory/Agency Theories            \n2.4.5    Theory on Self Control                \n2.4.6    Mental Accounting                        \n2.4.7    The Inertia-Based Explanation For Dividends        \n2.4.8    Dividends as a Valuation Yardstick                      \n2.4.9    Dividends as a Social Norm                    \nCHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY\n3.1    Introduction                            \n3.2    Research Design                        \n3.3    Population of the Study                \n3.4    Sample Size                            \n3.5    Source of Data                        \n3.6    Method of Data Analysis                \n3.7    Model Specification                        \n3.8    A-priori Expectation                            \nCHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS\n4.1    Introduction                \n4.2    Descriptive statistics                                  \n4.3    Regression Results                                   \n4.3.1     Insignificant Result                                                        \n4.3.2    Significant Result                        \nCHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n5.1    Introduction                        \n5.2    Summary of Findings                        \n5.3    Conclusion                            \n5.4    Recommendations                    \n5.5    Suggestion for Further Studies            \n5.6    Contribution of Knowledge                    \nBIBLIOGRAPHY                            \nAPPENDIX                                    \nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background to the Study\nThe dividend behaviour of firms is one area that has puzzled researchers. The issue of dividend cut continues as one of the most challenging and controversial issues in corporate finance and financial economies. Research into dividend cut has shown not only that a general theory of dividend cut remains elusive, but also that corporate dividend varies over time between firms. This description is consistent with Black (1976) who stated that “The harder we look at the dividend picture, the more it seems like a puzzle, with pieces that don’t fit together”. For a firm, which encounters financial difficulties, reliance is placed on retained earnings which consequently results in lower payout ratios. However, shareholders have enthusiasm in the outcome of their investments; these outcomes are expressed in terms of dividend and capital gains.\nDividend is the return that accrues to shareholders as a result of the money invested in acquiring the stock of a given company (Eriki & Okafor 2002). A dividend represents the cash distribution of a company’s earnings, and any direct payment by a company to the shareholders is considered part of a dividend policy (Ross & Westerfield, 1988).\nDividend is not just a source of income for shareholders, but an indicator of the performance of the firm (Al-Malkawi, Rafferty and Pillai 2010). Once a firm initiates dividend, it is expected to continue paying dividends and to build credibility of paying regular dividends in the fourth coming periods (Subramanian & Ramesh 2013). The decision whether or not to pay dividend rests in the hands of the board of directors of a company. Presumably, for companies that pay dividend, investors can ascertain a proper level of dividend payout by measuring the ratio of dividends to earnings. From this ratio they are able to determine when a dividend reduction has occurred.\n    A stable dividend payout is in the interest of both investors and the company. The reason for this is that investors are thought to assign informational content to a company’s dividend policy (Keown, Martin Scott and William. 1991). Investors tend to discount a company’s stock price when there are no visible signs of financial distress that warrant the conservation of cash (Jensen 1989), but if optimal dividends are paid then the company’s shares reflect their intrinsic value.\nAnother reason for an investor preferring a stable dividend is the potential need for current income as many investors rely upon dividends to satisfy personal needs. The attainment of a stable dividend payout all the time, however, is predicated on stability of income streams as well as outlay of investment (capital expenditure). Other reasons why dividend payout may be unstable include leverage position of the company, sales growth and of the resultant earnings per shares.\n    It might become inevitable therefore, for dividend to be cut at some point in time by managers because of the reasons stated above. It follows that dividend cut is a reality no matter the reluctance of managers to hold back cash dividend. This study examines the factors that determine dividend cut among some Nigerian listed companies over a specific time frame\n1.2 Statement of the Research Problem\n    This study differs in several ways from previous studies. Most of the studies reviewed focused on whether to cut dividend or not to cut dividend (Laarni, 2010). In Nigeria no researcher has empirically provided studies on dividend cut of firms as previous studies concentrated on dividend payout and dividend policy. The present study is an attempt to fill this existing gap in the literature by examining dividend cut of 20 quoted companies in the Nigerian stock exchange. In this paper, we revisit the question of why firms cut their regular cash dividend. On this issue the following questions are raised;\n1.    What is the relationship between sales growth and dividend cut in Nigerian companies?\n2.    What is the relationship between capital expenditure and dividend cut in Nigeria?\n3.    What is the relationship between cash flow from operations and dividend cut in Nigeria?\n4.    What is the relationship between earnings per share growth and dividend cut in Nigeria?\n5.    What is the relationship between leverage and dividend cut in Nigeria?\n1.3 Objectives of the Study\n    The main purpose of this study is to review, and to add to, the evidence on the determining factors of dividend cut among Nigerian quoted companies. Against this backdrop the following research objectives are stated:  \n1.    To establish the relationship between sales growth and dividend cut among Nigerian companies;\n2.    To establish the relationship between capital expenditure (CAPEX) and dividend cut;\n3.    To establish the relationship between cash flow from operations and dividend cut;\n4.    To establish the relationship between Earnings per share growth and dividend cut; and\n5.    To establish the relationship between leverage and dividend cut.\n1.4 Research Hypotheses\nThe following hypotheses are stated in their null forms;\nH01: There is no significant relationship between sales growth and dividend cut among Nigerian companies.\nH02: There is no significant relationship between capital expenditure (CAPEX) and dividend cut.\nH03: There is no significant relationship between cash flow from operations and dividend cut.\nH04: There is no significant relationship between earnings per share growth and dividend cut.\nH05: There is no significant relationship between leverage and dividend cut.\n1.5 Scope of the Study\n    The primary emphasis of this research work is to identify the factors that influence the dividend cut by Nigerian quoted firms between 2012 and 2014. Basically analysing 70 quoted non- financial companies with consistent dividend paying history.    \n1.6 Significance of the Study\nWhile we find numerous studies on the dividend payout behaviour of firms in various countries across the globe, we still fail to identify very specifically as to what factors distort the payout behaviour in the corporate world. Upon careful review of the literature on the subject I found very scanty studies focusing on the dividend payout behaviour of Nigerian firms.\n    No study in the past has taken the variables used in this study. This paper will also help us to better understand why firms cut their dividend, what kinds of firms cut their dividend, and why other firms don’t cut their dividend. Overall, this study documents new findings that help explain the motivations behind dividend reductions and furthers our understanding of dividend policy.\n1.7 Limitations of the Study\nSince dividend cut became an area of serious inquiry by researchers in corporate finance, so many factors/determinants have been identified. In a study being undertaken at undergraduate project level, it may be unmanageable to test for all the variables together as far as the Nigeria environment is concerned, as it would need large scale statistical equations well beyond the capacity of the project.\nSo this project primed its focus on testing five hypotheses in establishing the core and major determinants of dividend cut by firms in Nigeria. This study used the data of listed companies for 3 year i.e. 2012-2014 and also used a sample size of 70. Therefore future researchers can conduct study with same variables for more than 3 years and further more increase the sample size. Also, the results of this research can only be generalized to firms that are similar to those that were included in the study i.e. financial firms where not study\n    In addition, is the limitation of data availability to test for some variables like board independence and firm size which would have required far more time and resources in the assessment of various company boards.\n\nDETERMINANTS OF DIVIDEND CUT IN NIGERIA",

Although the ancient history of auditing has sparse documentation, its existence had been traced from the records of the Mesopotamian civilization dating back to 3,500 BC. The Mesopotamian records, which were essentially financial transactions, exhibited marking. Viewed as a system of verification, provided e evidence of the existence of internal control and separation of duties (Oladipupo, 2005).    \n    Going by historical approach the work Audit is a Latin word known as “he bears”. This was brought about by the practice whereby the accounts of the estate domain or manor were checked by those in authority ensuring accountability. Hence audit in recent time refers to a process whereby the accounts of business entities are subjected to scrutiny in such details as will enable the auditor (independent person) to form an opinion as to their truth and fairness (Woolf, 1994).\n    An audit is the examination of the financial report of an organization as presented in the annual report by some independent of that organization. The financial report includes a balance sheet, an income statement, a statement of change in equity, a cash flow statement, and notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies, and other explanatory notes.\n    Audit has been seen overtime as a relevant tool in reducing the threat and risk faced by organization. One of the most significant threats for many businesses today despite their size and the nature of their operations is insolvency. Extant evidence shows that in the past two decades business collapse have occurred at higher rates than at any time since the early 1930s. It is also interesting to note that during the 1980s certain sectors of the Nigeria economy, such as industrial businesses and banking sector in depressed areas experienced collapse rates as high as 50% over a time-years period (Rees, 1995).\n    The economic cost of corporate collapse is relatively large. Evidence shows that the market value of the distressed firms decline substantially (Wainer, 1997).\nSTATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM  \n    Many companies have failed and others are at the verge of failure in Nigeria due to various factors. It is provided in SAS of CAMA (2004) that all companies must prepare financial statements and these statements are subjected to Audit by independent person called Auditor. One of the reasons for the audit function is for the audit to express an independent opinion of the financial statements prepared by the Directors, the following problems call for answers:\n1. What are the factors responsible for corporate failures in Nigeria?\n2. Can Audited financial statement assist organizations to predict corporate failure using the Altman Z-test model?    \n OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  \n    The objective of audit of financial statement is to guarantee accurate and exhaustive financial reporting, resulting in improved financial management of private sector and providing a sound basis for performance auditing.\n    When financial audit were first introduced, their aim was to verify whether or not the financial reports of companies give an adequate overview of their actual financial situation.\n1.    To identify reasons for corporate failure in Nigeria.\n2.    To examine the relevance of audited financial statement using the Altman’s Z-score model in predicting corporate failure in Nigeria.\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n    This research is restricted to collapse entity and how the use of audited financial statements helps in recovery. It covers information gotten from personal interview, relevant journals, internet and textbooks.\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY   \n    Most time when organizations collapse, that is go bankrupt, lose market share, show low profits or losses for long periods, etc, one tends to assign some single, and very often an external event for example long-drawn labour strike, failure of a major product or bad investment etc. as  the root cause.\n    Corporate collapse has been attributed to reasons which are both external e.g. competition, change in government regulation, scarcity of inputs, and internal e.g. management incompetence, structural rigidity, lack of leadership etc and most importantly lack of audited financial statement.   \n    Therefore, this study will help examine the following:\n1.    It will help to examine the causes of decline in companies and organizational life-cycles.\n2.    It will help to examine why most companies tend to get trapped in their past success pattern, and lose their flexibility to change and adapt.\n3.    It will help to examine the usefulness of financial statement.\nLIMITATION OF THE STUDY       \n    The failed companies were limited to the banking sector because their financial statements were already in the Nigerian stock exchange fact book. More failed companies were not ready to release their financial reports.  \n\nIMPORTANCE OF AUDIT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

A regression model was used to analyse the existence of significant relationship or otherwise between the dependent and independent variables. The ordinary least regression methodology was utilized in analyzing the specified model.\n    Audit quality has a significant and positive relationship with board independence, while firm size was also found to be significantly, but inversely related to audit quality. Both ownership structure and audit committee independence were found to exhibit a positive, albeit non-significant relationship with audit quality. The study concluded that the results of the study have significant implications for company regulators and researchers in Nigeria. The results signify the importance of board independence in enhancing the overall quality of the audit.       \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION\n1.1    Background to the Study-    -    -    \n1.2    Statement of the Research Problem-    -    -\n1.3     Objectives of the Study-    -    -    \n1.4     Research Hypothesis -    -    -    -\n1.5     Scope of the Study -    -    -    -\n1.6     Significance of the Study -    -    -\n1.7     Limitations of the Study -    -    \nCHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW\n2.1    Introduction -    -    -    -    -    \n2.2    Conceptual Framework Audit Quality -    \n2.3    Theoretical Framework -    -    -    -\nCHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY\n3.1    Introduction-    -    -    -    -    -\n3.2     Research Design -    -    -    \n3.3    Population and Sampling -    -    -\n3.4     Source of Data -    -    -    -    \n3.5    Measurement of Variables-    -    -    -    \n3.6    Model Specification and Data Analysis Method -    -\nCHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS\n4.1     Introduction -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n4.2     Descriptive analysis -    -        -    -\n4.3    Correlation analysis    -    -    -    -\n4.4    regression analysis    -    -    -    -\n4.5     Test of Hypotheses -    -    -    -\nCHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n5.1    Introduction -    -    -    -    -\n5.2     Summary of Findings -    \n5.3    Conclusion -    -    -    -    \n5.4     Recommendations -    -\nBibliography-    -    \nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1    Background to the Study\nIt has been argued by a large number of researchers in the field of study that the fundamental reason of an audit assignment is to create a quality report. The point here is on 'quality report\", thus, it is assumed that the most important part of this research is the creation of a quality report; accomplished through strict adherence to the standards of high audit quality (Enofe, Mgbame, Aderin & Ehi-Oshio, 2013). DeAngelo (1981) defines “audit quality as the market-assessed joint probability that a given auditor will both detect material misstatements in the client’s financial statements and report the material misstatements”. DeAngelo (1981) theorized a two-dimensional definition of audit quality that has set the standard for addressing the issue. First, a material misstatement must be noticed, and second, the material misstatement must be reported. Audit quality as such is the increasing function of the ability of an auditor to detect accounting misstatements and is related to the degree of auditor independence. This measure looks upon the broad concept of an auditor’s professional conduct which factors objectivity, due professionalism and conflict of interest (Mgbame, Eragbhe & Osazuwa. 2012).\nAlleyne & Howard (2005) propose that a good auditor provides precise information involving the firm’s value. Because the purpose of an audit is to provide assurance as regards the financial statements. Audit quality is defined by Weber; Willenborg & Zhang (2008) as the probability that financial statements contain no material misstatements. Onwuchukwu; Erah; & Izedonmi. (2012) define “audit quality as the ability of the auditor to detect and eliminate material misstatements and manipulations in the earnings reported”. Chang; Dasgupta & Hilary (2009) noted that a good-quality auditor will always detect any misreporting, so its clients announced earnings are the same as its true earnings. Similarly, Gui, Lynn & Tsui (2002) define audit quality as the auditor’s ability to detect and eliminate errors and manipulations in reported earnings. Chan & Wong (2002) noted that audit quality, though unobservable, affects the probability of the successful detection of  discrepancies between the firms’ favourable report and the true quality of the project. The implicit common link in all these statement is the auditor’s ability to satisfy their professional obligation is to find material misstatements through the execution of the audit process. The characteristics of audit quality are unquantifiable and have lead to the use of  different proxies by researchers to measure it like: audit size, audit hours, audit fees, corporate reputation, board independence and discretionary accruals. Auditors generally perceive audit quality in terms of strict adherence to GAAS/ISA requirements. Auditors of a company would endeavor to avoid audit failure through the reduction of their business risk by minimizing audited dissatisfaction, limiting the damage to their reputation and avoiding litigation (Nagy, 2005). The demise of Arthur Andersen in 2002 is an example of the ultimate result of audit failure. Corporate scandals like Enron's fiasco and Andersen collapse confirmed a requirement for high audit-quality and drew considerable attention to various factors that may have effect on audit quality. High audit quality refers to the production of financial information without misstatements, omissions or biases. From an agency theory perspective, Dang (2004) argues that audited financial statements are a monitoring mechanism to provide assurance for users of financial information. In essence, auditing is used to give investors the needed assurance in  an  audited financial statements. More precisely, the function of auditing is to reduce information asymmetry on accounting numbers and to lessen the residual loss resulting from managers’ opportunism in financial reporting (Adeyemi & Fagbemi, 2010). Effective and perceived qualities (usually designated as apparent quality) are essential for auditing to produce advantageous effects as a monitoring device. Although so many different proxies have been used, Lennox (1999) believed that most researchers generally agree that auditor independence and size are appropriate indicators of audit quality.\nIt is therefore, based on these tenets, that this study aims to analyze the relationship between company attributes and audit quality. Having established that the contribution of the auditor to the business environment is basically through the production of a quality report, the study investigates the factors that could influence the achievement of high audit quality and determine the existence of relationships and correlation among these factors.\n1.2    Statement of the Research Problem\nHypothetically the auditor is relied upon to be independent of the administration staff of the organization being audited. The creation of a quality audit report is seen to cultivate induced trust in the financial reports by the users of those reports. Investors specifically tend to place better trust in financial statements that are audited as the normal autonomy of the examiner supports the confirmation that significant investment choices can be made on the push of those statements (Hsieh 2011). The increased certainty of these set of financial information users  has a tendency to draw in capital which has a positive long-term impact on  development and advancement in the business environment.\nHowever, inefficiencies on the part of management could lead to creative accounting,then the resulting financial statements would not be a true reflection of the financial position of the organization hence,any plans based on these statements would not yield the expected results. Poor results on investment would lessen the validity of the financial statements; resulting in a reduction in the level of capital flow,which would have adverse effects on the state of the business environment (Cook & Omer 2012).The onus in this way lays on the auditors to address these issues through proficient and viable execution of the audit assignment, and the resultant generation of a quality report. The study in this manner explores the variables that could influence the nature of the audit assignment, and examine the presence and level of connectedness between these elements and the achievement of high audit quality. Moizer (1997) noted that the appraisal of the indices  used in measuring the quality of the audit service is not without its challenges since audit quality is typically unobservable (as cited in Francis 2004). According to Hay & Knechel (2010), “auditing could be categorized as a type of credence good and hence auditors add credibility to corporate financial reports by expressing an opinion about the true and fair representation but only in so far as the user of financial statements perceive that opinion as valuable”. In such manner Hardies, Breesch & Branson (2010) argued that audit quality is not just about auditor competence and independence but also involves  the perception  of the market about the value of the auditor’s report which is the result of the perceived competence and independence of the auditor. Hence we can say that audit quality refers to the credibility of the audit opinion which is a measurement of the degree of confidence users place upon the information provided by the auditor . In any case, the non quantitative nature of audit quality as a variable has required the presence of  plenty of intermediaries and markers for its estimation (Cohen & Hanno, 2000).\nA few studies (Francis 2004, Geiger & Raghunandan 2002) measure audit quality with audit or reporting failure in view of the thought that audit quality is inversely related to audit or reporting failure. Different studies (Nagy. 2005, Myers & Omer. 2003) utilized income as a surrogate for audit quality. The underlying supposition is that high audit quality suggests high income quality (Johnson, Khurana & Reynolds, 2002). Researchers have utilized discretionary accruals as a surrogate for audit quality (DeChow, Sloan, & Sweeney 1996). Krishman & Schauer (2000) noted that audit quality is measured by the penchant of the auditor to issue a going concern opinion subsequent to controlling for different variables that may influence this choice.\nAll of the divergences with regards to the appropriate measure of audit quality may be seen to reflect the need by researches to monitor and provide indices amenable to control so as to make inferences on the audit quality, as the need to monitor necessarily should be preceded by the ability to appropriately define the concept. Subsequently, studies have endeavored to distinguish conceivable control variables for the state of audit quality. In light of these studies, there are clashing discoveries which this examination endeavours to give observational proof from Nigeria utilizing the engagement of the Big-4 audit firms as a variance for audit quality, and exploring the different outcomes when compared with those of former studies.                                                     The following research questions are addressed to.\n1.    What is the relationship between audit committee independence and audit quality in Nigeria?\n2.    What is the relationship between firm size and audit quality in Nigeria?\n3.         What is the relationship between board independence and audit quality in Nigeria?\n•    What is the relationship between ownership structure and audit               \n            quality in Nigeria?\n1.3     Objectives of the Study\nThe broad objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between company attributes and audit quality in Nigeria. The particular goals of the studies are to:\n1.    evaluate the relationship between audit committee independence and audit quality in Nigeria;\n2.       investigate the relationship between  firms size and audit quality in Nigeria;\n3.    analyse the relationship between board independence and audit quality in Nigeria and\n4.    examine the relationship between ownership structure and audit quality in Nigeria.\n1.4     Research Hypothesis\nThe following null hypotheses are tested for the study:\nH1:     There is no significant relationship between audit committee independence and audit quality in Nigeria.\nH2:     There is no significant relationship between firm size and audit quality in Nigeria.\nH3:     There is no significant relationship between board independence and audit quality in Nigeria.\nH4.     There is no significant relationship between ownership structure and\n              audit quality in Nigeria.\n1.5     Scope of the Study\nThe study means to research the relationship between company attributes (which for the purpose of this study includes firm size, audit committee independence, board structure and ownership structure) and audit quality. The study will concentrate on 57 organizations cited on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, and will cut crosswise over different businesses. Therefore the study is a pool that will cover from  2008-2013.\n1.6     Significance of the Study\nThe study aims to provide additional insights into the relationship between company attributes and audit quality in the Nigerian context. It is hoped that the evidence would serve as important quantitative information for policy formulation, as well as add to the existing body of empirical literature from a developing stock exchange such as that of Nigeria.\nInvestors see audited financial statement to be more helpful in making economic decisions. The audited nature of financial statement has however, failed to revise the syndrome of  failing  organisations. A comprehension of the factors that impinge on audit quality is therefore important for investors and stakeholders alike. It is also hoped that the research will contribute to existing knowledge and act as a guide for future researchers.\n1.7     Limitations of the Study\nA study of this nature cannot be carried out, without some form of constraints militating against it. These constraints do not only make it execution of the research work difficult, but also limit the scope of study. The difficulty to be encountered in the use of secondary data in this research is the sureness of reliability. The choice of the sample (to be attained through the use of random sampling); despite its representativeness of the population can not be expected to produce exactly the same results as the entire population. Also due to availability of data, the scope of the research is limited to public companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. It is likewise trusted that the examination will add to existing knowledge and go about as an aide for future research.\n\nEFFECTS OF COMPANY ATTRIBUTES ON AUDIT QUALITY\n",

The specific objectives include; to examine the relationship between state government tax revenue and Economic growth, to examine the relationship between Local government tax revenue and Economic growth and also to examine the relationship between Federal government tax revenue and Economic growth.\nThe population of this study comprises of the state government tax revenue, local government tax revenue and federal government tax revenue. Data collected was analyzed using the panel regression and the method of estimation was least square estimation techniques\nFrom the hypothesis tested, it was showed that there exist a significant relationship between the state government tax revenue and economic growth, local government tax revenue and economic growth and Federal government tax revenue and Economic growth in Nigeria. The study also discover that there exist an inverse relationship between the state government tax revenue and Economic growth in Nigeria. This implies that when tax rate increases, it brings down economic growth. The Local government tax revenue and economic growth has a direct relationship. This means that when the local government tax rate increases, economic growth will also increase. At the federal government level, the tax revenue has an inverse growth relationship with economic growth. This implies that when tax rate increases, it brings down economic growth.\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1    Background to the Study\nSince the creation and existence of man,there has been increasing needs for the provision of social amenities. The quest for the satisfaction of these needs has led authorities and governments to source for means of raising funds.\nTax as a means of raising fund,no doubt,plays very critical role in government revenue generation. In some advanced democracies or countries.  The earliest trace of any form of taxation in Nigeria even before the British Administration was in Northern Nigeria. The North was favored for this because it had a form of organized central administration under the Emirs unlike the south which except in few places in the west was not as organized.Thus taxes such as Zakka, Gada, Kindin, Kararat and Jangoli which were typical forms of taxes on agricultural products and livestock. With the coming of the British and their consequent colonization of Nigeria they took advantage of tax system that was existing in the Northern part of the country to introduce direct taxation into the area since that was the only alternative available to them to arise fund to administer the region. In 1914 when Northern and Southern Nigeria were amalgamated the then Governor- general deemed it necessary to extend the system of direct taxation which had been in existence in the north to the south part of the country provinces for fear of disturbance. As regard to this, direct taxation was not introduced in Eastern part until 1927 Resistance to this form of direct taxation in this area was such that it led to riot notably in Calabar, Owerri and famous Aba women riot of 1929 which was so severe that it attracted a probe into it. They were later modified and incorporated into the Direct taxation ordinance No. 29 of 1943 respectively. The direct taxation ordinance 1940 empowered native authorities to tax Africans in their area of jurisdiction while the income tax ordinance 1943 was for the taxation of non-Africans and companies. These two ordinances were the foundation of our modern taxation.\nTax according to longman dictionary of contemporary English is defined as “an amount that must be paid to government according to your income, property, goods etc and that is used to pay for public services”. There are basically two types of tax, they are direct taxes and indirect taxes. Direct taxes includes; personal income tax(PIT),poll tax ,company tax, capital gain tax(CGT) etc. while indirect taxes includes import and export duties, excise duty, value added tax(VAT) etc.\nTaxation plays a crucial role in promoting economic activity and growth. Through taxation, government ensures that resources are channeled towards important projects in the society, while giving succor to the weak. Unfortunately, in today’s Nigeria, the economic development is nothing to write home about. The role of taxation in promoting economic activity and growth is not felt, primarily because of its poor administration.\nIn the view of Ayua(1996),”tax administration has to be revamped while refunds of taxes as well as duty draws backs administration are inefficient. This study seeks to evaluate the impact of government tax revenue on economic growth in Nigeria.\n1.2    Statement of Research Problems\nIt is the duty of the government of any country to provide its citizens with those basic amenities that will make life enjoyable for them. This is because individuals cannot single handedly provide amenities for themselves. The provision of these basic amenities can only be possible through taxation.\nTax from time immemorial has been a powerful agent or instrument for revenue generation considering the efficiency of taxation. Taxation is the major problem that obstructs the maximum collection of taxes from individuals and groups. Though it could also be accepted that improper revenue collection methods and shortage of manpower and facilities hinder the efficiency of the taxation system. This deprives the tax of the government that is due and drastically reduces revenue generated from taxes. Due to this, the amount available for the provision of necessary social and economic activities are also reduced and finally results in governments inability to provide the citizens with the basic necessities of life.In Nigeria, the government’s fiscal power is based on a three-tiered tax structure i.e. the Federal, State and Local Governments, each of which has different tax jurisdictions. In 2002, about 40 different taxes and levies are shared by all three levels of government.\nThe first need of any modern government is to generate enough revenue which is indeed “the breath of its nostril”. Thus taxation is by far the most significant source of revenue for the government.Arnold (2011) asserted that economic growth will increase if more savings are channeled into the activity with high productivity while reducing the risk associated with liquidity needs. This shows that banks provide the benefit of eliminating Overview of Tax System in Nigeria.\nOdusola (2006) stated that Nigeria’s tax system is characterized by unnecessary complexity, distortion and largely inequitable tax laws that have limited application in the informal sector that dominates the economy. This study seeks to examine the significant influence of government tax revenue on economic growth in Nigeria.\n1.3    Research Questions\nThe problems that this research tries to find answers to include the following:\n1.    What is the relationship between state government tax revenue and economic growth?\n2.    What is the relationship between local government tax revenue and economic growth?\n3.    What is the relationship between federal government tax revenue and economic growth?\n1.4    Objectives of theStudy\n    The general objective of the study is to assess the tax system in Nigeria in relation to growth.The specific objectives include;\nTo examine the relationship between state government tax revenue and Economic growth.\nTo examine the relationship between Local government tax revenue and Economic growth.\nTo examine the relationship between Federal government tax revenue and Economic growth.\n1.5      Research Hypothesis\n    1.    Ho:    There is no significant relationship between state government tax revenue and economic growth\n        H1:    There is significant relationship between state government tax revenue and economic growth\n    2.    Ho:    There is no significant relationship between local government tax revenue and economic growth\n        H1:    There is significant relationship between local government tax revenue and economic growth\n     3.        Ho:    There is no significant relationship between federal government tax revenue and economic growth\n        H1: There is significant relationship between federal government tax revenue and economic growth.\n1.6    Significance of theStudy\nThe essence of this research work is to examine government tax revenue and economic growth in Nigeria. Thus, this study will at a wide range be of great benefit to the local, state and federal governments as it will highlight the effect of taxation on the economy.\nThis study would also be of benefit to employers and employees of the various Inland Revenue services who have been experiencing incorporation of tax payers by not paying taxes regularly.\nIt would also be of immense benefits to students of higher learning who may wish to carryout research on the similar topic.  \n1.7    Scope of theStudy\nThe scope of the study will cover the effect of tax revenue on economic growth in Nigeria. The length of period covered by this study will be between 1981-2013.\n1.8    Limitations to theStudy\nThe study is not immune to some constrainable forces that are capable of downplaying the result of the study but not sufficient enough to undermine the reliability of the information provided. Getting the required secondary data was a major constraint.\n1.9    Definition of Terms\nIt is pertinent to consider the use of a number of terms in the course of this study. Many of which are familiar to layman but very much peculiar to taxation laws and it’s often misused or misinterpreted.\n(1)    Tax Evasion: Tax evasion is a deliberate act on the part of the tax payer not to pay tax due. It is a criminal offence on the part of tax payer.\n(2)     Revenue: This is the income of a government from taxation, excise duties, customs or other sources, appropriated to the payment of the public expenses.\n(3)      Tax: It is defined as an amount that must be paid to government according to your income, property, goods etc and that is used to pay for public services.\n(4)    Tax Administration: This means the development and formulation of federal tax policy relating to existing or proposed internal revenue laws and conventions. It includes; assessment, collection and enforcement.\n(5)  Economic growth;An increase in the amount of goods and services produced per head of population over a period of time.\n(6)   GDP; This stands for Gross domestic product and it  is the monetary value of all of a nation’s goods and services produced within a nation’s border and within a particular period of time\n\nTHE TAX SYSTEM IN NIGERIA IN RELATION TO ECONOMICGROWTH\n",

Timelinessof accounting information is about the accessibility of accounting data when it is needed and how currentwhen it is received and used.””\n“Dabor and Dabor (2015) opine that financial reviews as the most critical components of abookkeeping transaction, because it’s aimed at presenting data to guide investors’ decisions, serves as a prospectus for capacity investors and a barometer for ascertaining manager’s performance.””\n“According to Ogiedu and Odia (2013) its miles the obligation of management of a corporation to prepare financial reviews for the consumption of their share/stakeholders. Thisfinancial reports display the monetary health of a company, and it is an avenue for communicating an organization financial dealings to the stakeholders and in most instance the only data accessible by them.”Accordingly, investors and different stakeholders agree with these financial reports to ascertain their relationship with the organization.\n“Aliyu and Ishaq, (2015) opine that the management of public liability in Nigeria is responsible for the coaching of annual monetaryassertion of which the auditor is to attest. Thus, financial report is one of the gadgets utilized by stakeholders in assessing the board of administrators’ performance.”\nHowever, through specific methods, the board of administrators’ frequently manipulates the financial report in the recordings of the company’s bookkeeping activities which are known to as earning management in accounting.\n“Corporate governance is a concept where management supervision takes place in the decision making manner of a corporation. The leadership (board) quality plays a crucial role in the implementation of corporate governance as they are responsible in finding out the method to direct, control, and the management of resources according with the company’s objective.”\n“It is expected that at the cease of an enterprise financial year, directors of the company render a stewardship account to her shareholders. This report is subjected to audit via a certified external auditor(s) before the final disclosure.”\n“It takes a number of days to months for the management of quoted corporation (directors) to prepare the financial statement and its audit. The time interval taken between the accounting year end, the accounts preparation and its audit report is known as audit delay.” “\n“Audit delay is therefore defined as the number of days from the accounting year end of a company and the audit report date (Dibia and Onwuchekwa, 2013).”Also “Ibadin and Afensimi, (2015) opine that audit delay is the length of time from a company’s financial year-end to the date of the auditor’s report and thus it is measured as the number of days between a firm’s fiscal year-end and the report date.”\nTimeliness of financial reporting has allowed the data to be accessible to decision-makers before it loses its ability to influence enterprise decisions (Shukeri & Islam, 2012).Just as Modugu, Eragbhe and Ikhatua (2012) opine that, financial data users require accurate and timely information for knowledgeable choice making.”\n“Oladipupo and Dabor, (2013) point out that timeliness is one of the proper characteristic for desirable accounting. Timeliness of financial records is about making audited yearly report and accounts accessible to the users of financial data as at when due and making sure that it’s miles modern-day when it is acquired and when it is to be used data.”\n“Any delay in disclosing accounting information springing up from the extensive or prolonged reporting interval could automatically have an effect on the timeliness of the corporate annual report and accounts.” In the mild of the above discussion, the researcher examines the management delay in financial reporting and firm characteristics.”\nStatement of the Research Problem\n“The growing information wishes of stakeholders who have vested interest in financial reporting have resulted in the quest for timely and credible financial reports”. “According to the International Accounting Standards Board timeliness of financial reports is the availability of information needed by decision makers for useful decision making before it loses its capacity to influence decisions (Iyoha, 2012).”“\nIn emerging economies, the provision of timely information in corporate reports assumes more significance on the account that different nonfinancial statement sources such as media releases, news conferences and financial analysts forecasts are not well developed and the regulatory bodies are not as effective as in Western developed countries.”\n“In Nigeria, the need for high quality and timely financial information has become particularly imperative due to the increasing exposure of Nigerian business organizations to international capital markets. Thus, the business organizations are being obliged to satisfy the information demands of foreign investors and to provide them with more timely information in annual financial reports.”“\nRecognizing the importance of timely release of financial information, regulatory agencies and laws in Nigeria have set statutory maximum time limits within which listed companies are required to issue audited financial statements to stakeholders and also file such reports with relevant regulatory bodies (Iyoha, 2012).”\n“Studies on management delay in financial reporting and firm characteristicsissues have not been topical in Nigeria, and in developing economies. To the best of the researcher knowledge, only Oladipupo and Izedonmi (2013) have carried out a study on relative contributions of audit and management delays in corporate financial reporting in Nigeria; no empirical studies have been conducted to examine management delay in financial reporting and firm characteristics, hence the need for this study.”\nIn the light of these, the following research questions are raised:\nWhat is the relationship between company size and management delay in financial reporting?\nTo what extent does profitability influence management delay in financial reporting?\nWhat is the relationship between leverage and management delay in financial reporting?\nWhat is the relationship between company age and management delay in financial reporting?\nObjective of the Study\nThe objective of this study is to empirically examine management delay in financial reporting and firm characteristics in Nigeria.\n    The specific objectives are to:\ndetermine the relationship between company size and management delay in financial reporting;\nexamine the extent to which profitability influence management delay in financial reporting;\nascertain the relationship between leverage and management delay in financial reporting;\ndetermine the relationship between company age and management delay in financial reporting;\nResearch Hypothesis\nThe following hypotheses stated in null form were tested in the course of the study;\nH01:    There is no significant relationship between company size and management delay in financial reporting.\nH02:    There is no significant relationship between profitability and management delay in financial reporting.\nH03:    There is no significant relationship between leverage and management delay in financial reporting.\nH04:    There is no significant relationship between company age and management delay in financial reporting.\nScope of the Study\n“This study focuses on management delay in financial reporting and firm characteristics– evidence from quoted firms in the Nigeria Stock Exchange. As such, the population of the study is the entire one hundred and seventy (170) quoted companies on the Nigeria Stock Exchange as at December, 2018 (NSE, 2018).A sample of thirty (30) quotedcompanies on the Nigeria Stock Exchange will be drawn from the population using the convenience sampling technique. The choice of the convenience sampling technique is hinged on the anticipated difficulty in downloading or accessing published financial statements and accounts of the entire quoted companies in Nigeria for the period under study.”\n“The study will cover a period of six (6) years i.e. (2012 – 2017).”\nSignificance of the Study\n“This study is anticipated to give beneficial insight into improving the quality of financial reporting decisions to a very healthy result in quality investment. This study will contribute to the literature as it will provide additional empirical evidence on the impact of company size, profitability, leverage, company age and liquidity on management delay in financial reporting practices in companies.”\n“Furthermore, given the empirical nature of the study, the outcome of this study would aid policy makers and regulatory bodies in economic modeling and policy simulation with respect to the selected variables examined in the study.”\nThe result of the study would be of benefits to investment analysts, investors and corporations in examining the influence of firm characteristics on management delay in financial reporting in Nigeria.  \nIt will also be useful in stimulating public discourse given the dearth of empirical researches in this area from emerging economies like Nigeria.\nFinally, it would also add to the available literature on the area of study while also providing a platform for other researchers who may want to further this study.\nLimitation of the Study\nThe use of sample size instead of the entire population of the study. However, the sample size will not be sufficient enough to capture the parameters of the population.\nMeasurement of variables: variables measurement will reflect the normal measurement accepted in empirical research and globally acceptable; that is the study will adopt the measurement of variables used in internationally and locally published journals.\n\nMANAGEMENT DELAY IN FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FIRM CHARACTERISTICS AMONG COMPANIES IN NIGERIA\n",

This question has attracted attention from regulators, researchers and financial press. In response to the concerns related audit fees, the US Congress passed the Sarbanes – Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002, which prohibits auditors from providing to their clients certain types of non-audit services. To comply with Sox, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revised the rule on auditor independence, which now limits the circumstances and remuneration for providing certain types of non-audit service (SEC, 2001). In addition, the revised rules require that client firm shall disclose all fees paid to an audit firm by separate categories including services related to auditing, financial information system design and implementation, and others so that investors are fully informed about the types and magnitude of these fees.\n    Another stream of research in the auditing literature focuses on the association between auditor independence and audit tenure. The importance of auditor tenure is also reflected in section 203 of the Sox, which requires a five-year rotation cycle for the external lead or reviewing audit partner. However, empirical evidence to date shows that longer auditor tenure rather than shorter auditor tenure is associated with higher quality earnings.\n    Several studies have tried to study the effects of audit tenure and audit fees on auditors independence. The results have been conflicting. In this study we integrate the research on auditor tenure with the research on non-audit fees and auditor tenure is likely to provide an incomplete picture we therefore, include auditor tenure in the analysis of the association between non-audit fees and auditor independence and evaluate whether auditor tenure affects this association.\n    Audit fees are defined as all those fees paid to an auditor carrying out an audit assignment. Such services may be management advisory services. (MAS) and compliance related services (tax and accounting services). These services can be provided by the incumbent audit firm or another audit firm. Non-audit services constitute the source of non-audit income. It may be described as any other services rendered to an audit client different from the examination of financial statements and expression of a professional opinion thereof. Ye Carson and Simmett, (2006) opine that the economic dependence of auditors on non-audit services, lengthy audit tenure and personal relationships built through alumni employees have contributed to the erosion of auditor independence. The work of Hayes, et al (2005) suggests that there exists a potential for the impairment of auditor independence in appearance in relation to the fees they charge.\n1.2    Statement of Research Problem\n    Auditor independence has been the subject of considerable debate for some time, and has been examined from the perspective of both non-audit fees and auditor tenure. The existing studies on the association between audit fees and auditor independence have evaluated whether higher non-audit fees create an economic bond between the auditor and the client, which enable the client firm to exert influence over the auditor decision and make auditor less independence\n    The impact of auditor tenure and audit committee independence on auditor independence has attracted attention from regulatory agencies. Auditor rotation has been supported on the ground that longer auditor tenure leads to economic bonding between the auditor and client firms. Hence, auditors are likely to compromise their independence as auditor tenure increases.\n    In the light of all these, the following research question will be ask.\nWhat is the relationship between audit fees and auditor independence?\nDoes audit committee independence have a significant effect on auditor independence?\nWhat is the significant effect of auditor tenure on auditor independence?\n1.3    Research Objectives\n    The main aim of this study is to examine the effects of auditor tenure and non-audit fees on auditor independence. The objective includes:\nTo examine the relationship between audit fees and auditor independence.\nTo ascertain the effect of audit committee on auditor independence.\nTo find out the significant effect of auditor tenure on auditor independence.\n1.4    Research Hypotheses\n    The following hypotheses are tested in this study,\nThere is a relationship between audit fees and auditor independence.\nAudit committee independence has a significant effect on auditor independence.\nAuditor tenure has a significant effect on auditor independence.\n1.5    Scope of The Study\n    This study examines the effect of auditor tenure and audit fees on auditor independence.\n    The time frame for this study is 2007-2012. Geographically, this study will be limited to Nigeria. This study will focus on manufacturing companies quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n1.6    Significance of The Study\n    This study will its conclusion and recommendation will prove very useful. It will prove useful in the sense that it will contribute positively to the dearth of literature as regards this area of study. It will expose to us factors that can impair auditor independence. It will also be very useful to firms especially the boards in taking certain decisions as regards auditor remuneration and job specification.\n1.7    Limitation of Study\n    These are the methodological imperfection associated with the study. The limitations are;\nSmallness of sample size\nData may be hardly reliable and up to date.\n\nAUDIT FEE, AUDIT TENURE AND AUDIT INDEPENDENCE",

It may be distinguished from non audit fee which relates to payment for other services other than that related to the audit function such as human resources management, tax advisory services amongst others. Since the early work on the audit fee by Simunic (1980), research has been stimulated to examine the role of the audit committee characteristics in audit determination (Abbort, Parker, Peters, & Raghunandan, 2003). The Canadian institute of chartered accountants (CICA), (1992, 20) defined audit committee as a committee of directors of an organization whose specific responsibility is to review the annual financial statement before submission to the board of directors.\nThe relationship between audit committee and audit fee is a complex one, stemming from both the demand for audit services by the client and the supply of audit services by the external auditors. (Collier & Gregory, 1996).Generally, there are two perspectives to the relationship to the relationship; the demand side and the supply side. From the demand side, the presence of an audit committee may have a positive association with audit fees by ensuring that audit hours are not reduced to a level that compromises the quality of the audit. Hence, firms with effective audit committees demand additional assurance from their auditor to preserve their reputation and avoid potential litigation. (Carcello, Hermanson, Neal,& Riley 2002) resulting in a higher audit fee. From the supply side, the audit committee’s side involvement in strengthening internal controls may lead the external auditor to reduce the assessed level of control risk. As a consequence, the auditor’s reliance on internal controls should result in less substantive testing and, hence, a lower audit fee (Collier & Gregory, 1996). So, from the supply side perspective, auditors regard audit committees as an internal control mechanism that influences the nature and extent of audit testing. In firms with effective audit committees, auditors will reduce their audit risk assessment. They would consequently reduce their audit testing, leading to lower external audit fees.\n1.2 Statement of Research Problem\nThe result of prior literatures emphasizes the relation between audit committee and audit fees effectiveness has been inconsistent. For instance, Carcello et al (2002), using US data from the early 1990s, found that board characteristics are associated with audit fees. In contrast, Abbort et al. (2003), using US data, provided evidence of a significant positive association between audit committee attributes and audit fees; though not all attributes were significant.\nSharma (2003), using Australian data, finds a significant positive association between audit fees and 3 way interaction between independence expertise and meeting frequency. However Sarkar, Hossain and Islamand (2009) find that non- executive in the audit committee has no impact on audit fees. Lee and Mande (2005) document that audit fees increase with audit committee’s independence and financial expertise while Vafeas and Waegelein (2007) report that audit fees increase with the size of the committee.\nThe polarity in findings as observed suggests that research into audit committee characteristics and audit fee determination is far from settled and hence, the needs for further investigation of the subject. In addition, we also find that while the impact of audit committee characteristics on audit fee determination has received considerable research attention from several countries e.g in Australia (Stewart, & Munro 2007) In the light of the above, the following questions were streamlined.\n1. What is the relationship between audit committee independence and audit fee?\n2. What is the relationship between audit committee size and audit fee?\n3. What is the relationship between numbers of audit committee expertise and audit fee?\n4. What is the relationship between numbers of audit committee meetings and audit fee?\n1.3 Objectives of the study\nThe broad objective of the research is to examine the effect of audit attributes on audit fee. The specific objectives were to:\n1. To find the relationship between audit committee independence and audit fee.\n2. To examine the relationship between audit committee size and audit fee.\n3. To investigate the relationship between numbers of audit committee expertise and audit fee.\n4. To determine the relationship between numbers of audit committee meetings and audit fee.\n1.4 Hypotheses\nTo enable us achieve the objectives of this study, the following hypothesis were stated in their null form.\n1. There is no relationship between audit committee independence and audit fee.\n2. There is no relationship between audit committee size and audit fee.\n3. There is no relationship between numbers of audit committee expertise and audit fee.\n4. There is no relationship between numbers of audit committee meetings and audit fee.\n1.5 Scope of the study\nThis study adopted the use of panel data for 16 companies for the period of 2010 to 2013 from annual reports of selected quoted companies in Nigeria.  A sample size of sixteen (16) companies of the 186 listed equities was selected using the simple random sampling technique.\n1.6 Significance of the study\nThis study will help investors gain insight into how audit committee attributes mechanism may influence audit fees in Nigeria. The research findings would be of importance to policy makers at national levels as the design policies aimed at enhancing the accounting profession through a better audit system. Student, and other scholars who wish to undertake further study on audit attributes will find literatures arising from this study to be of great value as it will be added to existing literatures.\n\nAUDIT COMMITTEE ATTRIBUTES ON AUDIT FEES IN NIGERIA.",

Some business failures such as the infamous Bank Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) Scandal heightened the demand for improved corporate governance, especially in corporations operating in the developed countries. More recently, high profile scandals, financial crises and/or institutional failures in Russia, Asia and the United States have brought corporate governance issues to the fore in developing countries and emerging markets.\n\nThese incidents illustrate that the lack of corporate governance enables insiders, whether they be company managers, company directors or public officials, to ransack companies and/or public (offers at the expense of shareholders, creditors and other stakeholders (employees, suppliers, the general public, etc).\n\nAccording to Hermes, corporate governance activities is the improvement of the performance of the companies in which it invests on behalf and for the benefit of its clients.\n\nAlso, the term corporate governance means decisions-making and control procedures in respect of company’s relations with wide range of stakeholders or company’s compliance with the provisions of best practice codes.\n\nMcKinsey’s survey (2000) (updated 2002) surveyed over 200 institutional investors and found that 80% of the respondents paid their premium for well governed companies. In 1975, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was established by the Central Bank Governors of ten group of countries to issue guidance on good governance on banks operation.\n\nIn Nigeria, the financial services sector in the 1990s witnessed a turmoil arising from widespread abuses of corporate governance principles. This led to the emergence of the failed banks. Tribunals in the 1990s and eventually the consolidation in the banking industry in the early 2000s. This research work is an attempt to look at corporate governance in the banking industry.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\nFor proper focus of the study, corporate governance in the banking industry, will be aimed at finding solutions to the problems faced by banks and the public.\n\nAlso, the efforts of government to control, introduce a more effects the development, policies and implementation.\n\nAnother area of the study includes the efforts of government to check the excess of banks and how to stabilize them. Against this backdrop, we are going to be faced with the following research problems in the course of this research work.\n\nWill corporate governance improve professionalism in the banking industry?\n\nDoes the effectiveness of corporate governance in the banking industry depend on strong government policies and implementation?\n\nWhat are the inhibiting factors that hindered the development of corporate governance in the banking industry?\n\nIs it not possible for banks to circumvent the government in the banking?\n\nOBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study is aimed at the following objectives:\n\nTo find out whether corporate governance will improve professionalism in the banking industry.\n\nTo determine whether the effectiveness of corporate governance in the banking industry depends on strong government policies and implementation.\n\nTo find out the inhibiting factors that hindered the development of corporate governance in the banking industry.\n\nTo determine whether it is possible for banks to circumvent the governance in the industry?\n\n \n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study is aimed at examining the corporate governance in the banking industry. However, for the purpose of proper focus and better analysis of the study, Benin City Commercial banks were used as a case study.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe significance of the study is to identify the most appropriate policies that will lead to the realization of the chosen policy objectives of the corporate governance in the banking industry in Nigeria. Also, this study will be of immense importance to students of accounting, finance, business and other economic related discipline for further research work on the subject matter. It is equally expected that this study will be a useful guide to investors (potentials and present). The study will help to know the type of policy that enable banks to have strong financial hold to meet its financial transactions to avoid liquidation.\n\nRESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\nHo:      Corporate governance will not improve professionalism in the banking industry.\n\nH1:       Corporate governance will improve professionalism in the banking industry.\n\nHo:      The effectiveness of corporate governance in the banking industry will not depends on strong government policies and implementation.\n\nH1:       The effectiveness of corporate governance in the banking industry depends on strong government policies and implementation\n\n \n\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nResearch methodology refers to the techniques that will be used in the collation and analysis of data and also the types of data that will be used (Izedonmi, 1998).\n\nThis study will make use of secondary source of data obtained from already published works, Central Bank of Nigeria, Journal and the questionnaires and the hypothesis tested and “Statistical References”.\n\nThis study will also rely on the technique of regression, which emphasized the minimization of the sum of squared residual.\n\n \n\nLIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe nature of this study makes it prone to a number of constraints and limitations.\n\nThese constraints are the response of respondents is at low rate, thereby leading to the smallness of the sample size. Also, the imprecise measure of variables.\n\n \n\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nFor the purpose of clarity and misconception of terms, the following terms are hereby defined in the context in which they are used in this paper.\n\nBank: A financial institution where money is kept and used for business transaction.\n\nMerger of Banks: this implies coming together of commercial banks into one stronghold to transact solid financial businesses.\n\nPolicies: Guided operational rules and regulations.\n\nPerformance: A patterned behaviour of business transaction.\n\nImplementation: Carrying out or doing what the policy says.\n\nMismanagement: Wrong control of business activities.\n\nCorporate Governance: As an internal system encompassing policies, processes and people which serves the needs of shareholders and other by directing and controlling management activities with good business savvy, objectivity accountability and integrity.\n\nSound corporate governance is reliant on external market place commitment and legislation, plus a healthy board culture which safeguards policies and processes.\n\nBoard Members: Members who have a senior management position as well as being a member of the board.\n\nProxy: Someone empowered to vote on behalf of their shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM).\n\nCapital Increase: An issue of new shares by a company.\n\nExecutive Committee: A committee formed the boards executive members like members of management board, members of the executive committee may be titled “directors” and may have similar powers, however, unlike the management, the committee is not a separate board ties.\n\nNon-Executive Board Members: A board member who broadly speaking does not take part in the day to day operation of the company and is not an employee of the company.\n\nOECD: Organization for Economic Corporation and Development is an institution that notably includes the country’s corporate laws, security laws, accounting rules, generally accepted business practices and prevailing business ethics.\n\n \n\nREFERENCES\n\nBebchuk, L., Cohen, A. and Ferrrell, A.

Questionnaires were administered to generate the necessary primary data, which were analysed descriptively. A total of eight-four questionnaires were administered to tax payers in Benin City. The chi-square method was used in test the various hypotheses. Review of relevant literatures were carried out in order to get a deeper in sigh and proper understanding of the project. The result shows that there is a significant relationship between “demographic variables” and personal income tax compliance in Nigeria and that there is relationship between “economic variables”, “behavioural variables”, non-compliance opportunity, tax system/structure and personal income tax compliance.\n    It was further recommended that the tax rate should be minimal and realistic for people to be able to comply and that the tax authorities should properly review and evaluate the assessment and collection procedures so as to encourage compliance by taxpayers.  \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION\nBackground to the Study                    \n1.2    Statement of the Problem        \n1.3    Objective of the Study            \n1.4    Hypothesis of the Study                \n1.5    Significance of the Study                \n1.6    Scope of the Study                    \n    Reference                             \nCHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW\n2.1     Introduction                    \n2.2 Review of Previous Studies             \n2.2.1 Meaning of Taxation                    \n2.2.2 Meaning of Personal Income Tax            \n2.2.3 Forms of Personal Income Tax                    \n2.3      Determinants of Tax Compliance            \n2.3.1 Demographic Variables                    \n2.3.1.1  Age                                 \n2.3.1.2 Gender                            \n2.3.1.3 Education                                \n2.3.1.4  Income Level                    \n2.3.2 Economic Variables                        \n2.3.2.1   Probability of detection and penalties        \n2.3.2.2 Tax rates                        \n2.3.3 Behavioral Variables                    \n2.3.3.1 Fairness of tax system                    \n2.3.3.2 Peer Influence                        \n2.3.3.3   Distributive Role of A Tax System            \n2.3.4  Non-Compliance Opportunity                \n2.3.4.1   Income Source                    \n2.3.4.2  Occupation                    \n2.3.4.3   Complexity of Tax System                    \n2.3.4.2 The Structure of the Nigerian Tax System        \n2.4    The Concept of Tax Compliance Behavior and\nTaxpayers' Attitudes                    \n2.5     Determinants of Individual Income Compliance    \n2.6   Current Taxation Reforms                \n2.7    The Process of Tax Administration            \n2.7.1 Problems of Tax Assessment and Collection        \n2.7.2 Political Culture                    \n2.8    Sustaining Growth in Developing Economies\nThrough Improved Taxpayer Compliance:\nChallenges For Policy Makers And Revenue\nAuthorities                    \n2.8.1    Tax Evasion by Small Business            \n2.8.2 Strategies to Improve Taxpayers' Compliance        \n2.8.3     Voluntary Compliance in Personal\nIncome Tax Administration            \n2.9     The Tax Compliance Decision            \n2.9.1 Factors Affecting Compliance            \nReferences                     \nCHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n3.1    Introduction                            \n3.2    The Research Design                     \n3.3    Population                         \n3.4    Sample Size                    \n3.5    Sources of Data                     \n3.5.1    Primary Sources of Data                \n3.6    Research Instrument                     \n3.7    Method of Data Analysis                \n    References                             \nCHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS\n4.1     Introduction                    \n4.2    Data Analysis and Its Interpretation                \n4.3.

Hostilities towards tax compliance data back to the history of taxation. “Taxes are considered a problem by everyone. Hostile taxpayers behaviours implies that given a chance taxpayers would not comply with tax laws.\n    Perhaps understanding the taxpayers’ behavior in terms of factors which influence their attitude towards tax compliance and how to influence the very factors would be a solution to this puzzle. Magutu and Mokoro  (2010). The payment of tax is a civic duty and an imposed contribution by government of her subjects and companies to enable her finance or run public utilities and perform other social responsibilities. However, one of the greatest problems facing the Nigerian Tax System is the problem of tax evasion. Tax evasion has been an important subject of inquiry in a large number of developed countries over a long period of time.\n    Tax non compliance is described as intentional illegal behavior, or as behavior involving direct violation of tax law to escape the payment of tax. The deliberate under-reporting of income and over claiming of tax deductions are examples of tax evasion (International Bureau and Fiscal Documentation (IBFD, 2001). In contrast, tax avoidance is a term used to describe taxpayer infringing the tax laws. Although tax avoidance can be used to refer to acceptable forms of behavior, such as tax planning, it is more often used to refer to something unacceptable or illegitimate, but generally illegal.\n    But, reducing tax evasion is not only a matter of applying higher penalties and/or increasing the frequency of audits. Indeed, extreme penalties may backfire by creating a setting in which bribery and corruption are more prevalent. The result may be lower tax compliance and a general loss of trust in the public institutions. To develop policies for the reduction of tax evasion, it is essential to understand the behavioural aspects of tax compliance decision. This is true  whether one is designing a tax enforcement regime anew or simply devising policies to encourage tax compliance within the existing tax enforcement system. If individual attitudes towards compliance are a function of social and cultural norms, then enhancing these norms may be a desirable policy options.\n    Tax compliance is a complex behavioural issue and its investigation requires the use of a variety of methods and data sources as each instrument has advantages and short-comings. There is a considerable literature suggesting that compliance with rules is affected by social norms. Some sources of such overall level of social capital. For example, interactions that demonstrate government responsiveness and fairness have a positive effect on tax reporting behavior as will be perception that the government is using tax revenue for socially desirable purposes.  \n1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n    In Nigeria taxpayers exhibit varying levels of tax compliance. Tax administration is generally weak with widespread evasion, corruption and coercion. Taxpayers tend to have low levels of literacy, low tax morale and negative attitudes towards government.\n    The extent of the impact of attitude and attitudinal change on tax compliance behavior is not well understood. Therefore, addressing this knowledge gap was the primary purpose of this study. It is for this reason that this study attempt to find out how taxpayers’ attitudes influence tax compliance behavior in Nigeria.\n    The study tried to answer the following questions:\nWhat is the relationship between demographic determinants and personal income tax compliance?\nWhat is the relationship between economic determinants and personal income tax compliance?\nWhat are the behavioural factors that can affect personal income tax compliance?\nWhat is the relationship between non compliance opportunity and personal income tax compliance?\nHow does the tax system/structure affect personal income tax compliance?\nWhat is the relationship between tax compliance and tax enforcement?\n1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\nTo determine whether there is a relationship between demographic variables and personal income tax compliance.\nTo establish that some economic variables can affect personal income tax compliance.\nTo determine whether behvioural variables can affect personal income tax compliance.\nTo establish that there is a relationship between non compliance opportunity and personal income tax compliance.\nTo determine whether the tax system/structure plays any role in personal income tax behavior.\nTo examine the relationship between tax compliance and tax enforcement.\n1.4    HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY\n    Hypothesis is a tentative answer to a research questions. It can be stated in a null form (Ho) or alternative form (Hi).\nThe following hypothesis will be formulated and tested in this study:\nHYPOTHESIS ONE\nHi:    There is a significant relationship between demographic variables and personal income tax compliance.   \nHo:    There is no relationship between demographic variables and personal income tax compliance.   \nHYPOTHESIS TWO\nHi:    There is a significant relationship between economic variable and personal income tax compliance.   \nHo:    There is no relationship between economic variable and personal income tax compliance.   \nHYPOTHESIS THREE\nHi:    There is a significant relationship between behavioural variable and personal income tax compliance.   \nHo:    There is a negligible relationship between behavioural variable and personal income tax compliance.   \nHYPOTHESIS FOUR\nHi:    There is a significant relationship between non compliance opportunity and personal income tax compliance.   \nHo:    There is no relationship between non compliance opportunity and personal income tax compliance.   \nHYPOTHESIS FIVE\nHi:    There is a positive relationship between personal income tax compliance and the tax system/structure.   \nHo:    There is no relationship between personal income tax compliance and the tax system/structure.   \nHYPOTHESIS SIX\nHi:    There is a positive relationship between personal income tax compliance and tax enforcement.\nHo:    There is no relationship between personal income tax compliance and tax enforcement.\n1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe benefits of this study can be seen from the recommendation it provides. If implemented, it will enhance and improve factors that can be most effective in improving both personal and corporate taxpayer compliance and the necessary steps to implement them in other to achieve sustainable economic growth in Nigeria. This study will afford the general public an insight into the importance of effective tax payment in Nigeria, thereby increasing and improving the awareness and knowledge of students.\n1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n    The scope refers to the boundary of the study, the scope of this study is narrowed down to personal income tax payers in Edo State. The study shows variables that can determine personal income tax compliance in Nigeria.  \n REFERENCES\nMagutu, O. and Mokoro, L.O.

These two sectors of the economy though similar in most areas yet are contrasted in some areas especially in their approach and methodology to the detection and prevention of fraud. (Salau, Dodo & Aladesunkanmi. 2012).  \n    The private sector is the segment of the national economy owned, operated, controlled and managed by private individuals or enterprises. The private sector main objective is the maximizing of profit, creation of wealth for its shareholders and minimizing of cost. The Public sector on the other hand is the part of the economic system that is controlled by the national, state, provincial or local government. It is the part of the economy concerned with providing various governmental services as well as basic amenities in other to make the standard of living affordable to it citizens (Schacter, 2000).\nThe unending distortion of economic and social development in Nigeria due to various financial scandals and fraudulent practices calls for the need to eliminate fraud (Salau, Dodo & Aladesunkanmi. 2012). It has been generally observed that government spending has always been big business but it has become so massive and extravagance today that the public through its legislators is demanding to know whether the huge outlays of money are being spent effectively or whether they should be spent at all on the project the government claim these funds are spent on.\nFinancial fraud can generally be defined as an intentional act of deceit involving financial transactions for the purpose of personal gain at the expense of a system, an entity or a person. What then is the role of the forensic accounting in curbing the drastic growth of the fraudulent financial practices in the public sector as well as its negative impact on developing economy and its regular citizen?\nThe fundamental role of the forensic accountant is to ensure proper investigation in other to detect fraudulent practice in the business environment, According to Manning (2002), forensic accounting is the combination of accounting, auditing and investigative skills to a standard that is required by a court of jurisdiction to address issues in dispute in the context of civil and criminal litigation. This has its own tangible role in the process of fraud control because in the course of investigating the financial statement of the organization the forensic accountant reveal the fraudulent practices concealed in the financial statements as well as those involve in these practice and also go ahead to advise the management of the measures to be taken in order to forestall the recurrence and continuity of these acts. By monitoring the operation of public power and how public resources are used, forensic accounting can reduce the abuse of power and public resources. The Association of Certified Fraud Examination (ACFE), in agreement with the separate surveys carried out by the U.S department of Justice, Price Water House Coopers identified three main categories of fraud that affects organizations; the first of these is asset misappropriations, which involves the theft or misuse of an organizations asset. Examples include theft of inventory or cash, false invoicing, accounts receivable fraud and payroll fraud. The second category of fraud is fraudulent financial statements which are the most costly with median loss of $2million among the 99 financial misstatements included in the 2008 ACFE study carried out in the United States America. The final of the three fraud categories and most common is fraud due to corruption occurring in 27 percent of all fraud cases (AICPA, 2009).\nRabiu and Noorhayati (2015), expressed their grief that fraud has not only distressed the Nigerian economy but also impacts on the personal life and behavior of the ordinary citizens. It therefore should be made mandatory that good  risk management skills, professional prevention and detection measures  as well as well designed internal control  mechanisms be installed in every public sector organization by the public authority.\nOne of the pivotal mechanisms for fighting financial fraud especially in the public sector is forensic accounting. Irrespective of the strategies, reporting mechanisms, best practices and other effective internal control measures used. However, it is important to note that without the professional roles of auditors in the public sector, the forensic paraphernalia to curb the extant fraud and its increasing impact in the public sector are not complete.\nForensic accountant are experts in detecting fraud due to their application of accounting and investigating skills, which makes them very important in fighting the underlying financial frauds in the public sector of developing economy. Ribadu. (2004) stated that accurate record keeping of government income and expenditure by the public sector accountants is a key importance of tackling financial fraud in the Nigerian public sector.\nForensic accountant are not without challenges as they have some environmental factor limiting the discharge of their duties as a result of the challenges they encounter. Challenges such as testifying as an expert, obtaining evidence which can serve as a litigation support in the court, to mention a few over detecting of financial fraud (Izedonmi F. 2011).\n1.2 STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEMS\nThe negative effects of the fraudulent practices in developing economy such as Nigerian and their impact on the lives of ordinary citizen call for great concern. It has been observed that in developing economy, huge amount of money is lost through fraud which drains the nation’s meager resources with their far-reaching and attendant consequences on the development of the nation. Thus, like Kamaludeen (1991) observes “billions of naira is lost in the public sector every year through fraudulent means” this he argues represents only the amount that is ferreted out and made public. Khan (2006) opines that the loss or inaccessibility of documentary evidence results in the increased opportunity for corruption and fraud. Hence, as a result of the above problems and others (theft of inventory or cash, false invoicing, accounts receivable fraud and payroll fraud, fraudulent financial statements, tax fraud) the following research questions have arisen:\n1.    How does forensic accounting as a fraud detection method enhance fraud control in Nigerian economy?\n2.    Is there any relationship between forensic accounting and detection of fraud in the Nigerian economy?\n3.    Is forensic accounting a solution to fraudulent practices in the Nigerian economy?\n1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n      The primary objective of this study is to analyze the incidence of fraudulent financial practices in the Nigerian public sector and the roles of the forensic accountant in the elimination of these fraudulent practices. Specifically, the study aims at achieving the following objectives:\n1.    Examine how forensic accounting as a fraud detective method enhances fraud control in theNigerian economy.\n2.    To verify the relationship between forensic accounting and detection of fraud in the Nigerian economy.\n3.    To determine whether forensic accounting is a solution to fraudulent practices in the Nigerian economy.\n1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n     The hypotheses of this research work are as follows and stated in null form.\nHo1: forensic accounting as a fraud detection method does not enhance fraud control in the Nigerian economy?\nHo2: there is no relationship between forensic accounting and detection of fraud in the Nigerian economy?\nHo3: forensic accounting is not a solution to fraudulent practices in the Nigerian economy\n1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThe geographical scope will be centered on the Nigeria economy, and the research work will cover the Nigerian economy using the Edo state public sector as a case study. In other to be unbiased, a period of 10 years encompassing 2007 to 2017 will be considered and will consequently serve as a time frame of this study.  \n    This work will utilize primary data from federal and state agencies, parastatals, audit firms as well as ministries in Edo state, Nigeria.  \n1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe need for developing economy to free from fraudulent practices cannot be over emphasized for it’s a major key to rapid development.\n    Honestly, financial fraud in the Nigerian Public sector has created a wide deviation from the supposed efficient and effective operations of the Nigerian public sector and their contribution to the economy. The need to close or bridge the deviation gap and restore the efficiency of operations and economic contribution of developing economy is the essence of this study. The essence is to see how forensic accountant fight and curb the extant fraudulent practices in the economy and thereby restore the efficiency and effectiveness of the country’s public sector. Another significance of this study is to bring to light the functions of the forensic accountant that are yet to be recognized in developing economy thereby putting an end the ever increasing growth of fraud in developing economy.\n       This research work will help the following beneficiaries in the knowledge of this study.\n1.    Policy makers; to help policies identify the key issues in financial fraudulent practice and how to prevent it.\n2.    Finance student; to help finance students to have the knowledge of the study and exposure on fraudulent practice and how to avoid it.\n3.    Government and their agencies; to enlighten the government and its agencies on how forensic accounting can be used effectively in the detection and prevention of fraud in the public sector.\n1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n    The proposed research cannot be guaranteed to come out imperfectly. This is because of the challenges that were likely encountered in the course of the study. These challenges include:\n1.    Possibility of bias opinion:\nThis is an inherent problem in human opinion bases studies. Respondents may not always be sincere in their opinion and more so in this case involve accounting practitioners and their auditing activities. Hence, the findings of this study may better be appreciated as “practitioners’ perspectives”.\n2.    Attitude and disposition of respondents\nSome of the respondents might be very reluctant in accepting the questionnaires claiming that they were very busy and had urgent tasks before them. Some respondents may not return the questionnaires given to them, the reason for which more questionnaires were printed in order to make up to the number for the sample size.\n3.    Sample size:\nA larger sample size would increase our confidence level but we could not obtain it due to human inadequacies and time factor, thus restricting us to sample size of 100.\n\nFORENSIC ACCOUNTING AND FRAUD DETECTION IN THE NIGERIAN PUBLIC SECTOR ",

Auditors are entrusted by law with conducting statutory audits and fulfil  an  important  role  in  offering  an opinion(reasonable assurance) on  whether  the  financial  statements  are stated  truly and  fairly (Quick, R. 2012). This assurance help to reduce the risk of misstatement, subsequently, reduce the costs of business failures. (Mansi, Maxwell and Miller 2004) identify two roles of an auditor: the information role and the insurance role. As an information intermediary, an auditor is a person who independently and effectively verifies the correctness of company’s financial statements before they are published. As an insurance provider, on the other hand, an auditor is a person who is legally accountable for damages to financial statement users. Auditors therefore carry out primary responsibility for promoting transparency in financial reporting processes that in turn generate high quality financial statements. In other words, auditors are one of the key drivers that help promote the transparency of the stock markets.\nEarnings management is a popular subject in the accounting literature and there many slightly different definitions used for it. The earnings management definition used in this study is that of (Healy and Wahlen 1999) who state that Earning management occurs when management use judgment in financial reporting and in structuring transactions to alter financial reports to either mislead some stakeholders about the underlying economic performance of the company or to influence contractual outcomes that depend on reported accounting numbers.” (Koh et al. 2008) examine earnings management as the propensity of firms to meet or exceed analysts’ expectations in the periods following the Sarbanes Oxley Act. The study finds that managers are less likely to employ accrual based earnings management techniques in the periods following the accounting frauds of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Furthermore, the findings indicate that meeting or exceeding the analyst forecast in the post-Sarbanes Oxley period is more positively associated with future cash flows. This suggests that the decrease in accrual based earnings management techniques has improved the quality of firms’ earnings, as they are more reflective of future performance.\nAs mentioned above, the choice of auditor has played an important proxy of difficult-to-observe audit quality in different aspects. Previous theoretical and empirical research has generally established that audit has economic value, even in the absence of a mandated audit requirement (Sundem, Dukes, & Elliott,1996). The value of information and audits.( Coopers & Lybrand.). The decision to have an auditor, the selection between different auditors, and the decision to switch auditors are complex choices. Prior research has partially explained auditor choice by using agency theory (DeFond, M. L., & Subramanyam, K. R. 1998). Auditor changes and discretionary accruals. The demand for audit of companies’ accounts is created by the agency problems which are related to the separation of corporate ownership from control (Gerayli, Yanesari & Ma’atoofi, 2011). The agency problem arises from the existence of asymmetric information in the principal – agent contracts (Jensen, & Messier,2000). Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure. Findings Show that the existence of information asymmetry between corporate management and company shareholders greatly enhances the easy perpetration of earnings management practice. The audit of a company’s accounts is a monitoring or control apparatus that minimizes information asymmetry and protects the interests of the principal.\n1.2 Background of study\nTheoretical and empirical research has generally established that an audit has\neconomic value, even in the absence of a mandated audit requirement (Sundem, Dukes, & Elliott,1996),the value of information and audits.( Coopers & Lybrand).  The decision to have an audit, the selection of an audit firm, and the decision to occasionally switch auditors are all complex choices.  Prior research has used agency theory to partially explain auditor choice and auditor switches (Defond,(1992). The association between changes in client firm agency costs and auditor switching.  In the most narrow sense, the basic role of the audit is to improve the quality of financial statements and extensive literature has found that a high quality audit reduces the incidence of earnings management (Becker, DeFond,  Jiambalvo, and  Subramanyam 1998).  On the other hand, some researchers have suggested that demand for quality auditing is multifaceted and depends on more than just a cost of capital argument (Knechel 2001, 2002; Abdel-khalik 1993; Wallace 1981).  For example, an audit can help managers improve the efficiency of a firm or remove information asymmetries related to internal reporting.  Some firms may place more value on these potential gains that might accrue from the improvement of external financial reporting, especially for firms that are small and/or not public traded. Prior research on audit quality has tended to focus on the differences between Big 5 (Big five) audit firms and smaller audit firms.  (DeAngelo, L. E. 1981), Auditor size and audit quality, argued that the Big five provide better quality audits because they have more reputational and legal risk.4  We know from prior research that audits by the Big Six are associated with higher fees , lower levels of discretionary accruals lower litigation rates , higher rates of compliance with GAAP (Krishnan and Schaur,2000), higher earnings response coefficients , more informative signals of financial distress (Lennox, 1999), and less mispricing of IPOs .  While these attributes are considered to be manifestations of audit quality, other research has been less successful at finding quality differences among the large firms, e.g., 9  see the extensive literature on specialization (Craswell, Francis, and Taylor (1995).\n1.3    Statement of the Research Problem\nEarnings management can be beneficial or harmful for the firm’s value based on how managers employ it. In general, earnings management consists of both positive and negative earnings management. Positive earnings management is the use of earnings management in a way that benefits firm value. Meanwhile, negative earnings management is the use of earnings management for private benefit that can be harmful to the firm’s value. In Nigeria, corporate scandals are publicly known and has resulted in misleading financial reports. There is therefore a concern about the quality of accounting income and its relationship with the quality of the auditing process, which has been observed to increase over time following the periodical clusters of business failures, frauds, and litigations. The issue is whether these corporate collapses are not the outcome of poor audit quality and the inability of the audit function to arrest Earnings Management.\nConsequently, the study examine whether audit choice can significantly minimize the negative consequences of earnings management of quoted companies in Nigeria. The study attempts to ascertain and establish whether audit quality exhibits significant impact and relationships with the amount of discretionary accruals of quoted companies in Nigeria.\nAgainst this backdrop, the following research questions will be addressed;\nTo what extent does audit opinion affect earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies?\nWhat is the relationship between audit tenure and earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies?\nTo what extent does audit firms type influence earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies?\nWhat is the relationship between audit fee and earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies?\nObjectives of the Study\nThe broad objective of this study is to investigate the effect of auditors’ choice on accrual earnings management in Nigerian quoted companies. Specifically, the objectives of this study include to:\nexamine the extent to which audit opinion affect earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies,\ndetermine the impact of audit tenure on earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies,\nAscertain the extent to which audit firms type influence earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies, and\nInvestigate the relationship between audit fee and earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies.\nResearch Hypotheses\nFor the purpose of this study, null hypotheses will be stated and formulated. The following hypotheses seek to answer the research questions stated above.\nH01:    There is no significant relationship between audit opinion and earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies.\nH02:    There is no significant relationship between audit tenure and earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies.\nH03:    There is no significant relationship between Big 4 audit firms and earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies.\nH04:    There is no significant relationship between audit fee and earnings management proxy by discretionary accrual in Nigerian quoted companies.\n1.6 Scope of the Study\nThe focus of this study is to examine the effect of auditors’ choice on accrual earnings management in Nigerian quoted companies. To achieve the objective of this study, the research covered manufacturing and service sectors. Further, the manufacturing sector consists of different companies such as agro-allied, food and beverage, breweries, pharmaceuticals and building materials or construction. The service sector comprises of banks, insurance, transportation and telecommunication companies. In this regard, fifty(50) companies will be randomly selected from two industries in the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for the period of 2011-2016.\n1.7    Significance of the Study\nThe significance of the study will be benefited to the banking sector, academician and to the whole society in general.\nIt will also assist auditors in carrying out their operation in an orderly and efficient manner.It will also assist them in identifying the appropriate system for adoption in order to curb / curtail fraudulent malpractice in banking sector and to be familiar with the banking sector in Nigeria.    \nFinally, professional will find the material useful in their fields because of the fact in it and management will take this material as a judicious material that will help them in making important business decisions.\n1.8 Limitations of the Study\n    The major limitation of the study as it is with several studies in developing economy is data accessibility and accuracy. Also, there is the challenge of inappropriate measurement of variables. The subject of auditors’ choice and accrual earnings management is one that is bedeviled with several measurement indices in literature due to its qualitative nature. Different perceptions exist as to what the indices for auditors’ choice should be.\n\nTHE EFFECT OF AUDITORS’ CHOICE ON ACCRUAL EARNINGS MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIAN COMPANIES ",

Specifically, this study is designed to: to examine whether the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Nigeria has improved the quality of financial reporting in Nigerian banks, to find out role the of IFRS play in banking institutions in Nigeria, to determine whether IFRS adoption and implementation has been made positive impact in Nigeria.\n. For the purpose of this study a research design was adopted by which questionnaires are designed and administered to employees of randomly selected banks in Nigeria. The data collected were presented in percentages, presented in tables and analysed using “Chi-Square test of independence” to test the relationship between the variables in the hypothesis.\nThe finding of this study are To achieve this ultimate goal, the study revealed that: IFRS aid quality financial statement in the Nigeria banking industry, IFRS improve the quality of financial reporting in the Nigeria banks,  IFRS play a very significant role in the banking institution in Nigeria,  IFRS and quality financial reporting has strengthen the international labor market, IFRS and quality financial reporting has improve calculation of tax liabilities.\n    CHAPTER ONE\n                    INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background of the Study\n International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) are designed as a global language for business affairs to enhance understanding and comparability across international boundaries. Most countries of the world have various national standard which differs according to there environmental peculiarity. As a result of global international trade, a set of globally acceptable accounting standard is desirable (Ball 2006). IFRS is a single set of high quality, globally accepted accounting standard that enhances comparability of financial reporting across the globe, which could result in better investment decision and optimal allocation of resources across the global economy (Jacob and Madu, 2009).\n The drive behind adoption of IFRS in Nigerian banks is to harmonize financial reporting across the globe especially in banks with international branches smooth transition, including attracting foreign direct investment, reduction of the cost of doing business, and cross border listing. IFRS formally known as IAS was first issue in 1973 by International Accounting Standard Committee. In 2003, the first IFRS was issued. Given the numerous benefits of IFRS, which span beyond harmonization and easy comparability of financial reports of organization across the globe, the Nigerian corporate environment embraced it adoption since January 2012 to unite with the global need for it adoption, this  transition needed to be carefully executed in a logical manner to ensure smooth, transparent and truthful compliance. It must be stressed that the transition process till this moment involves key stakeholders such as educators, professional bodies, preparers, users, regulators and auditors. The ability to identify the challenges and how to address such challenges has ensured smooth transition and adoption.\n This led to transition from the local standard (SAS) to IFRS, The primary objective of the accounting standards is to enable corporations to provide investors and creditors with relevant, reliable and timely information which is in line with the IASB’s accounting framework for the preparation and presentation of Financial Statements. Such information, it is argued, contributes towards the achievement of orderly capital markets around the world Imhoff (2003:117).\n1.2 Statement of Research Problem\n The practical challenges in Nigeria as a result of implementing IFRS are to be identified and addressed in order to benefit fully from the introduction of IFRS. These challenges have been identified by previous studies conducted by scholars such as: (Alp and Ustundag, 2009): potential knowledge shortfall, (Li and Meeks, 2006): legal system effect, (Shleifer and Vishny, 2003): tax system effect, (Irvine and Lucas, 2006): education and training, (Martins, 2011): enforcement and compliance mechanism.\n In spite the opportunities from the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard by most countries, the procedure for adoption suffers a set back in Nigeria. These include; cost implication suffered by the users of IFRS, technicality in the method and strategy for adoption, inadequate capacity building for transition, all of which reflected the low level of preparedness by government and users of the standard for smooth transition. Nigeria embraced IFRS in order to participate in the benefits it offers, including attracting foreign direct investment, reduction of the cost of doing business, and cross border listing. In implementing IFRS, Nigeria is confronted with challenges including the development of a legal and regulatory framework, awareness campaign, and training of personnel.\nThe above problems are to be looked into in this research work and possible solutions will be adequately provided.\nFrom the above problems the following research questions has been extracted,  \n1.  Does International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Nigeria improved the quality of financial reporting in Nigerian banks?\n2.     Does IFRS play any significant role in banking institutions in Nigeria?\n3.     Has there been effective implementation and adoption of IFRS in Nigerian banks?\n 1.3 Objectives of the Study\n This study examined and assesses post implementation challenges of IFRS in Nigeria banking industry, Provide measures for ameliorating the challenges confronting implementation of IFRS. Specifically, this study is designed to:\n1.     To examine whether the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Nigeria has improved the quality of financial reporting in Nigerian banks.\n2.     To find out role the of IFRS play in banking institutions in Nigeria.\n3.     To determine whether IFRS adoption and implementation has been made positive impact in Nigeria.\n1.4 Research Hypotheses\nBased on the objectives of the study and the research questions for which answers were intended from the findings of the study, three hypotheses were formulated and stated in their null form:  \nH1:     IFRS does not aid the quality of financial reporting in Nigerian banks\nH2:     IFRS does not play any significant role in banking institutions in Nigeria.\nH3:     There is no significance relationship between effective implementation and adoption of IFRS in Nigerian banks\n1.5 Scope of the Study\nThis study examines and attempts to assess the impact of international financial reporting standards in the financial reporting system of Nigeria banks. In the course of this study questionnaires will be administered to employees of some randomly selected banks quoted in the Nigeria stock exchange and this include:\nFirst Bank Plc, University of Benin, Benin City\nZenith Bank, University of Benin, Benin City.\nGT Bank, University of Benin, Benin City.\nAccess Bank, University of Benin, Benin City.\nFidelity Bank, University of Benin, Benin City.\n1.6    Significance of the Study\n Since every decision has cost and benefit, this research is designed to embrace International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS), identify its benefits as well as addressing the challenges faced after it implementation to improving the quality of financial reporting in Nigerian banks. The local standard seems out of date and may not be sufficiently comprehensive to form a basis for preparation of high quality financial statements with international standard. The adoption of IFRS has therefore resulted in high quality, transparent and comparable financial statements that are based on modern accounting principles and concepts applied globally. This study empowers investors and analysts in making easier comparisons across firms of the world as well as ensuring that management stewardship functions are dully performed.\n This research examined challenges to provide required knowledge that enables firms to adjust timely to the new accounting standard. This research is therefore of immense benefit to shareholders, management, researchers, analyst, as well as regulator and legal institutions. As such, this research has contributed positively to the body of knowledge on IFRS implementation benefits, challenges and improvement to its adoption.\n 1.7 Limitation of the Study\nThis research work could have covered all public quoted companies listed in the Nigeria stock exchange but due to uncooperative attitude of respondents in making relevant information available which is considered confidential and might be detrimental to their operation, climate conditions, distance and other academic workload could not make this possible and also the period within which the study is conducted is short for a thorough research work, hence gathering adequate information becomes very difficult. And\nfinally, lack of materials on the topic due to the fact that IFRS was adopted only in 2012 by Nigerian banks in its financial reporting system. Therefore, the researcher resolved to seek friendly approach in order to obtain the needed materials or information from the banks under study through the administration of questionnaire.\n\nTHE IMPACT OF IFRSS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING QUALITY IN NIGERIA BANKS\n",

The financial market is segmented into two (i) the money market which also deals in short-term fund and (ii) the capital market that is for long-term dealings in loan able fund (Anyanwu 1966). The channeling of fund in an economy is driven by the difference in the size of the fund, maturity and risk attached to the transfer. The basis of distinction between the money market and the capital market lies in the degree of liquidity of instrument bought and sold in each of the market, which can be further sub-divided into the primary and secondary markets. Primary market is concerned with the raising of new funds, while the secondary market is for the sale and purchasing of existing securities, thus, enabling savers who purchased securities when they had surplus to recover their money when they are in need of cash (Afolabi 1991).\n Money markets play a key role in bank’s liquidity management and the transmission of monetary policy. In normal times, money markets are among them most liquid in the financial sector. By providing the appropriate instrument and partners for liquidity trading, the money market allows the refinancing of short and medium term position and facilitates the mitigation of your business liquidity risk.\nThe banking system and the money market represent the exclusive setting monetary policy operates in. a developed, active and efficient inter bank market enhances the efficiency of central bank’s monetary policy, transmitting it impulses  into the economy best. Thus, the development of the money market smoothes the progress of financial intermediation and boosts lending to economy, hence improving the country’s economic and social welfare. Therefore, the development of the money market is in all stakeholders.\n  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nThe role of the financial market in the development of the real sector and the economy at large can not be overemphasized. A critical characteristic of the money market is that, it should be deep and broad so as to absorb large volume of transactions without significant effect in security prices and interest. This characteristic requires that there exist many active market participant such that the transaction of an individual investor will have just infinitesimal (very small) effect on security prices and interest rates. The characteristic also requires that there are many varieties of security so as to ensure that there are always alternative investment instruments available to satisfy the respective return-risk desires of investors in the market.\nA money market that has depth and breadth will be informational as well as operationally efficient and will contribute significantly to the growth of the economy. Iyiegbuniwe (2005) opines that although the Nigerian money market has experienced significant growth both in the breadth of securities as well as the volume if trading since the liberalization of the financial system in 1986, it still need to be deepened further to achieve the required vibrancy that is expected of a money market. This is not to say that the Nigeria money market is ineffective, much have been said and written about the Nigerian capital market but the reversal is the case for the money market in the country.\nTherefore, there is the need to examine the crucial market and evaluate its performance in terms of its contribution to economic development.\n RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nIs there a relationship between monetary policy and economic growth in Nigeria?\nIs there a relationship between Bond issued and economic growth in Nigeria?\nIs there a relationship between Treasury bills and economic growth in Nigeria?\n OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\nThe specific objectives of this study are to determine;\nThe impact of the money market on economic growth in Nigeria.\nThe impact of money market variable such as Treasuring bill, Bonds issued, fixed capital formation and monetary policy rate on the growth of the Nigeria economy.\nTo evaluate the contribution of the Nigerian money market to the economic growth of the country.\n HYPOTHESIS OF STUDY\nThe following are the hypothesis for this study;\nTreasuring bill has a significant effect in enhancing rapid economic growth in Nigeria.\nBond issued has a strong impact in economic growth in Nigeria.\nMonetary policy rate has a strong and positive linkage with economic growth.\nThe higher he fixed capital information the higher the rate of economic growth in the Nigerian economy.\n SCOPE OF STUDY:\nThis study basically examines the relationship between money market and economic growth in Nigeria. Money market variables will be used from the year 1990-2011.\n SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY:\nThis study is significant in several aspect, this includes;\nThis study will be a reference material for further study on the money market and economic growth in Nigeria.\nThis bank and other business executives will be well guided on the contribution on money market of the development if the Nigeria economy.\nThis study will be a reading companion to potential investor in the economy.\nThis outcome of the study will be added to the existing body of knowledge on the money market.\n\nTHE ROLE OF MONEY MARKET IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NIGERIA ECONOMY\n",

According to Benin (2001) in his dictionary of management, Vol. 2 defined audit as a critical examination and analysis of an activity by an independent person performed to check the efficiency of the activity and often to check security. This definition is however narrow.\nThe international encyclopedia of social sciences defined auditing as concerned with the independent verification of the statement of financial position and the results of operations of an entity.\nIn Penguin Dictionary of Commerce it was defined as “inspection of a set of books and or accounts by a person other than the one who prepared them (with the object of ascertaining whether or not the books are properly kept and or the accounts shows a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the organization at the data stated) followed by a report to the persons by whom the auditors were appointed.” (Greener, 2000)\nHowever, the up to date definition being accepted by many professional bodies is the one defined by the consultative council of Accountancy bodies (CCAB).\nAccording to the definition, an audit is the independent examination of and expression of opinion on the financial statements, of an enterprise by an appointed auditor in pursuance of that appointment and in compliance with any relevant statutory obligation. The statement adds that the responsibility for the preparation of the financial statements and the presentation of the information included there in rest with the management of the enterprise. The Auditor’s responsibility is to report on the financial statement as presented by management. Jim Ade notes that the main purpose of an audit is to show whether financial statement reflect true view of organization position.\nThe preparation of the accounts of local government is a very complex operation with differing orientations, legal systems and accounts and control systems. The examination of such account by independent expert trained in the assessment of financial information is of benefits to those who control and operate such local government as well as to the nation.\nIt is clear in all the definitions state above that what is important in this case is the independability, checking the verification and efficiency of the system, ascertaining whether the proper books of accounts are maintained not so as to show a true and fair view of the state of affair of the organization on which the auditing is built.\nThough there is variation in language and choice of words used by the different authors, it is crystal clear that they are all saying the same thing.\n\n    A Synopsis of Local Government Audit\n\nIn a series lecture by Jim Ade of the Esan West Local Government Council, he noted that the study of local government audit is as important as auditing in every other sector including the financial sector of the economy. This is because local government being the closest government institution to the people at the grassroots demand adequate financial resources, which of properly controlled would benefit the rural communities\nJim reports that in local government, there is a department referred to as finance and treasury department. This department is charge with the responsibility of ensuring that local government or public fund is well administered. This, it achieved by receiving fund, expending fund and properly accounting for it.\nHowever, at a particular point in time an independent person known as an internal auditor checks to ensure that these functions (receiving funds, expending funds and accounting for them) are adequately performed\nLocal government audit therefore, is an examination of financial statement or records of the local government in order to established if they show a true and fair view.\n\n        Qualities of an Auditor\n    Independence: An auditor is expected to be an independent person to be able to function effectively. Independence enables an auditors to have an independent or unbiased opinion about the state of affair of local government\n    Technical Competence:  This is an ability to express an opinion in a logical manner. He should be able to analyze any financial situation. No matter how complex it is.\n    Computer Literacy: An auditor is expected to be computer literate. He is expected to be aware of all the going on in the computer technology environment.\n    Analytical Knowledge: As an auditor, you, are expected to have a strong analytical skill. This involved explaining and analyzing a situation in numerical terms. Source: (Jim Ade, 2012: EWLG lecture).\n        The Objective of Local Government Audit\n\nThe objective of an audit is to detect irregularities or fraud. As stated by the consultative council of accountancy bodies (CCAB) the responsibility for the prevention and detection of irregularities and fraud rests with the management who may obtain reasonable assurance that this responsibility will be discharge by instituting an adequate system of internal control.\nThe auditor’s duties do not requires him specifically to search for fraud unless required statute or the specific terms of the agreement. However, the auditor should recognized the possibility of material irregularities or fraud which could unless adequately disclose, distort the results or state of affairs shown by the financial statement therefore the conducting of an audit is itself can often discourage any attempt to institute, irregularities or fraud.\nFurthermore, the detecting of fraud and errors and prevention of errors and fraud in the accounting system is what is considered the secondary objective of an audit.\nThe now almost notorious expression of Lopas, L.J. in the case of Kingston Cotton Mill Company Limited (1896) that the auditor “is a watch dog not a blood hound” is very obvious\nWhen a statement of account is presented to government auditor, he will need to scrutinize the underlying documents such as receipts, payment vouchers, various ledgers, bank tellers, bank statements etc. He will also ask for explanation and information from the officers of the organization whose accounts he is auditing.\nBesides, the auditor will need to examine the physical assets and the organization such as buildings, plants and machinery, motor vehicles, stores, the auditor in trying to satisfy himself as to the correctness or otherwise of the statement of the account he is examining.\nHis final report will be based on the opinion he has formed on this examination\nViewing the radical changes in Nigeria today where most Nigerians, including high placed government functionaries and officials do not see any need for judicious spending of public funds thus erroneously believing that they are gold mine from which to help themselves, move emphasis is now been placed on the treatment of the discovery of fraud as a primary objectives.\nOkolo (1997) had added more colour to this fact by saying “it is my submission that the auditing which stipulates that the discovery of errors and fraud is not a primary objective of an audit is not applicable to the audit of public funds in Nigeria.\nHowever, it has to be stated therefore that the auditor general (A.G) of the federation and the directors of audit of the various states of the federation are not only interested in the correctness of the financial statement, there are also very much interested in the prudence with which public funds are managed hence is of expenditure and sometimes queries as “unreasonable expenditure”.\nThe financial Memoranda has given credence to this by stating in chapter 40.2 that one of the objectives of the external auditor is to assisting in protecting the assets and interests of the local government by carrying out a continuous examination of activities in order to detect fraud, misappropriation, irregular expenditure and losses due waste, extravagance and maladministration.\nSection 117 of the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria provides the following\n\n    There shall be a director of audit for each who shall be appointed in accordance with the provision of sec. 118 of this constitution\n\n    The public accounts of a state and all office courts and authorities of the state, including persons and bodies established by law entrusted with the collection and administration of public moneys and assets shall be audited and reported on by the director of audit, and for that purpose, the director of audit or any person authorized by him in that behalf shall have access to all books, records, returns and other documents relating to these accounts.\n    The director of audit shall submit his reports to the house of assembly of the state and the house shall cause the reports to be considered by a committee of the house responsible for public accounts.\n    in the exercise of his functions under this constitution, the director of audit shall not be subjected to the direction or control of any other authority or person. (FRN, 1999).\n        Types of Audit and its Application in Local Government\n\nThe range and dept of audit work undertaken in any given situation will depend upon the auditor’s owe assessment of the system which produces in the first place the records which he is required to audit. Since both the complexity and dependability of systems are almost infinitely variables, the length of time taken to conduction audit and the number of level of audit personnel to require to do so, are equally variable. It is possible to draw up the following broad classification given by Howard (2001)\n\n    Complete or final audit\n    Continuous audit\n    Procedural audit\n    Management audit\n    Balance sheet audit\n\nThe clans of audit applicable to the local government accounts is a combination of final, complete audit and continuous audit. The former applied at the close of the financial year. Financial statements for that year one sent to Edo state director of audit through the principal auditor of the various local government areas. The relevant records such as the following will obtained from the council.\n\n    Payment vouches\n    Departmental vote expenditure account (DVE)\n    Departmental vote revenue account (DVRA)\n    Expenditure abstract\n    Investment abstract\n    Investment ledger\n    Investment ledger\n    Advances ledger\n    Deposit ledger\n    Bank statement tellers and cheques stamps\n    Annual financial statement\n    Contract register\n\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT AUDIT AND ITS EFFECT ON COUNCIL'S ACCOUNT",

This information can be quantitative (financial) or qualitative (non-financial) both of which require a reasonable level of skills on the side of the user to effectively interpret and use. The published financial statements prepared by the directors of companies and certified by external auditors remain the primary means of informing users about financial performance, progress and position of the firm. All things being equal, the audited financial statements should be credible, believable and reliable. However, this condition may not hold due to weak corporate governance structures, codes and institutions, untimeliness of the financial information and the level of skills of the user (Dabor and Adeyemi 2009).\nA number of studies have been conducted on corporate governance and financial reporting at different times in developed, as well as, developing countries, most of which are well documented in accounting and finance literature (Ofoegu and Okoye, 2006; Dabor and Adeyemi, 2009; Tijjani and Dabor, 2010; Abbas, 2011; Hassan, 2011). And the major reasons for the huge bodies of literature is to ensure that the financial statement show the true and fair view of the actual outcome of the operations of the firm, and management claims empty of any form of manipulations, falsifications and the art of creative accounting. Recent corporate scandals have created holes in the mind of investors and have made investment decision to be cumbersome creating the need for quality financial information by ensure the appropriate structure or governing bodies within and outside the organisation are available, not just available but sure to perform their duties to shareholders and avoid the threat of loss of investment due mainly to large scale corporate fraud.\nIn Nigeria, concerns have been expressed about the large scale malpractices and abuse of the system by capital market operators in the past, especially following the recent incidence on the sale of forged shares of publicly quoted companies. Companies have gone into liquidation for reasons bordering on ineffective or non-existing system of corporate governance. Examples are OnwukaHitech, Abacus Merchant bank and others (Tijjani and Dabor 2010). In the Nigerian petroleum industry the case of Africa Petroleum (now Forte Plc) where 24 billion naira credit facility was not disclosed in the financial statement was unethical. In response to calls for strengthening corporate governance mechanism to enhance the oversight function of the board of directors and to restore public confidence in the integrity of financing reporting, the Security and Exchange Commission promulgated the Nigerian Code of corporate governance in 2003 which was later reviewed in 2011 to enhance its effectiveness. This code requires companies listed on the Stock Exchange to appoint independent directors and supervisors, including at least one financial expert, and to establish an audit committee.\nThe purpose of quality of financial reporting is to promote transparency and deliver high quality annual report through comprehensive disclosure. Users should be able to understand the information presented without undue effort (IASB, 2008). Standard setters, regulators, and policy-makers all have a vital interest in the effect of financial reporting on the economy. This interest is due to the economic consequences associated with financial information. According to proponents of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), publicly traded companies must apply a single set of high quality accounting standards, in the preparation of their consolidated financial statements, in order to contribute to better functioning capital markets (Quigley, 2007). The wide spread adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) facilitated the harmonization of accounting standards around the globe. For example, Ball (2006) notes that the fair value orientation of IFRS could add volatility to financial statements, in the form of both good and bad information, the latter consisting of noise which arises from inherent estimation error and possible managerial manipulation. Therefore it is one of the major responsibilities of the board to ensure the appropriateness of the application of the standards that will yield or produce quality financial report\n1.2 Statement of the Problem\nThe weakness of corporate governance is perhaps the most important factor blamed for the corporate failure of the past. The question of audit quality has received increased attention from regulators, academics and practioners around the world in recent years due to highly publicised audit failures (Lin & Liu, 2009). The impact of a lack of auditor independence can be extremely severe to the audit process; this has affected audit quality (Abdullar, 2003). Therefore our study extends and contributes to the body of research using Nigerian data to investigate the relationships between corporate governance and  quality financial reporting.\nIn recent times, a series of well-publicized cases of accounting improprieties in Nigeria (for example, such as is reported in relation to Wema Bank, NAMPAK, Finbank, and Spring bank, Oceanic Bank, among others in Nigeria) has captured the attention of investors and regulators alike (Adeyemi&Fagbemi, 2010). The search for mechanisms to ensure reliable, high quality financial reporting has largely focused on the structure of a strong corporate governance practices. The auditing profession which is part of the governance structure has been proactive in attempting to improve audit quality by issuing standards focused on discovery and independence. As a result, there has been a concerted effort to devise ways of enhancing independence (Corporate Governance Code of Nigeria, 2005). The profession has also responded to denigrations on audit quality.\nThis study is motivated by the interest surrounding the appropriateness of reforms instituted by corporate governance practice in relation to corporate failures, global best practice and their implied efficacy in the face of significant implementation whether or not the these structure formations of governance and regulations impacted quality financial reporting in Nigeria. Following from the above, the research questions therefore are:\n1 what is the relationship between board independence and financial reporting quality?\n2 what is the relationship between audit committee size and financial reporting quality?\n3what is the relationship between board size and financial reporting quality?\n1.3 Objectives of the Study\nThe broad objective of the study is to examine the relationship between Board characteristics      and financial reporting quality in Nigeria. The specific objectives of the study are:\n1 To examine the significant relationship between board independence and financial reporting quality;\n2 To ascertain the significant relationship between audit committee size and financial reporting quality and\n3 To evaluate the significant relationship between board size and financial reporting quality.\n 1.4 Hypotheses of the Study\nThe following null hypotheses are formulated to be tested in this study.\nH1: there is no significant relationship between board independence and financial reporting quality;\nH2: there is no significant relationship between audit committee size and financial reporting quality;\nH3: there is no significant relationship between board size and financial reporting quality\n1.5 Scope of the Study\nThis study basically seeks to investigate the effect of Board Characteristics on quality financial reporting. To achieve the objectives of this study, data are collected for the period of ten (10) years (2004-2013) from companies’ annual reports and accounts. In addition, using simple random sampling technique, the study considered a total of 20 listed firms in the Nigerian Stock Exchange Market. The choice of the selected firms arises based on the availability of data.\n1.6 Significance of the Study\nThe importance of governance can be illustrated under the principal-agent relationship. The demand for checks is directly related to the fact that it is the directors (the agents) who prepare the financial statements, which is primarily based on cost reasons (Adeyemi&Fagbemi, 2010).Therefore, this study is expected to provide useful insight into improving quality financial reporting. This study contributes to literature as it provides additional empirical evidence on the impact of the size of audit firm (big and non-big) on the level of audit quality. The study also reflects the quality of audit services between “big and non-big” audit firms in Nigeria that will ensure quality financial reporting. This study will be useful to stakeholders in the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) as it provides evidence on the relationship between quality reporting and the reform instituted by them in formulating the Code of Corporate Governance for listed companies in Nigeria.\n1.7 Limitations of the Study\nThe limitations of this study are outlined below.\nThe data for this study is a secondary data extracted from annual reports and accounts of sampled firms. But the availability of companies’ report from year to year was not consistent as some companies’ report was not in stock. This posed challenge for the researchers in data extraction.\nThe sampled firms are a mere representation of the entire population of the study. The sampled twenty (20) firms are considered small compare to the entire population. But the researchers make do with these numbers due time constraint.\n\nBOARD CHARACTERISTICS AND QUALITY FINANCIAL REPORTING IN NIGERIA",

The main objective of this study is to investigate the impact of corporate governance on environmental disclosures of organization specifically examining some corporate governance mechanisms with environmental disclosure.\nThe study made use of annual report and account of companies quoted on the Nigerian stock exchange. Data was collected for five years ranging from 2012 to 2016 of which both descriptive, correlation and multiple panel linear regression analysis data analysis method was used to examine the variables.\n The regression results show that board size impact positively on environmental disclosure, board independence exhibits a positive relationship with environmental disclosure. Board gender diversity was found to impact positively on environmental disclosure. While board meeting was found to impact negatively on environmental disclosure. The study recommends a mandatory board composition of firms to contain a majority of non-executive members. There is the need for future studies and techniques to examine more corporate governance variables and how they affect the environmental disclosures of quoted firms by elongating the time period.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION\n1.1.

Environmental aspects of the disclosure are contained in the company’s annual report and aim to disclose information relating to the environment, In this way company can benefit from the positive attention, trust and support of the community, Based on this opinion environmental disclosure can help companies in getting support and capital issues from stakeholders and investors, In addition it can be to access the impact of risk that may be incurred by the company’s operations and reduce the effect of its activities on the environment, so that the company’s image and external legitimacy can be improved. (Deegan & Brown, 2008).  \n            Studies conducted to date on corporate governance and environmental disclosures have shown that corporate governance mechanism have influence on corporate environmental disclosure, However in Nigeria corporate environmental disclosure is still on voluntary basis (Onyali, Okafor & Egolum, 2014). Therefore it is inconclusive if such characteristics and voluntary initiation alone would also influence corporate environmental disclosure in Nigeria’s firms (Onyali et al., 2014).\n     Corporate Environmental disclosure (CED) entails the financial and non–financial disclosure of social and environmental aspects upon which firms activities have an impact on its environment. There is a dearth of literature on Corporate Environmental Disclosure in Nigeria.\n1.2   STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM\nThere is a large difference in the volume of corporate governance and environmental disclosure research in countries with developed capital markets when compared to countries with less developed capital markets. In countries with developed capital market and effective legal/regulatory frameworks, a significant amount of research on corporate governance and environmental disclosure has been executed (Marston & Shrives, 2016). Unfortunately, this is not the case with countries with less developed markets. In less developed countries, there is a scarcity of research on corporate governance and environmental disclosure; in all sincerity, this should not be so (Okpara, Bhasin & Oluwagbemiga, 2014). In comparison with corporate governance and environmental disclosure in developed countries; in developing countries, there are generally lower disclosure standards, weaker regulatory and legal systems as well as limited enforcement capacity (Okike, 2007). There is significant state ownership or holding of many private business corporations in developing countries. (Samaha, Dahawy, Hussainey & Stapleton, 2012).\n       The intention of this research is to examine if corporate governance mechanisms such as board size, board independence, gender diversity and frequency of board meetings influences the level of corporate environmental disclosure specifically in the firms in Nigeria. The increasing environmental issues of which companies tend to have a profound impact on the environment calls for examination of the quality of environmental disclosure voluntarily provided in the annual reports to creating awareness among the stakeholder. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between corporate governance and corporate environmental disclosure.\nFlowing from the above, this study is set to proffer solution to the following research questions.  \n Is there a significant relationship between board size and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firm?\nIs there a significant relationship between board independence and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firm?\nIs there a significant relationship between gender diversity and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firm?\nIs there a significant relationship between frequency of board meetings and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firm?\n1.3    STATEMENT OF RESEARCH OBJECTIVE\nThe main objective of this study is to ascertain the impact of corporate governance on corporate environmental disclosure in Nigeria. The specific objectives of this study are:   \nTo determine if there is a significant relationship between board size and environmental disclosure.\nTo ascertain if there is a significant relationship between board independence and environmental disclosure.\nTo examine if there is a significant relationship between board gender diversity and environmental disclosure.\nTo establish if there is a significant relationship between frequency of board meetings and environmental disclosures\n1.4    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\nIn line with the objectives of this study, the following hypotheses will be formulated in null form:\nThere is no significant relationship between board size and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firms.\nThere is no significant relationship between board independence and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firms.\nThere is no significant relationship between board gender diversity and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firms.\nThere is no significant relationship between frequency of board meetings and environmental disclosure in Nigerian firms.\n1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThis study basically investigates the effects of corporate governance variables on environmental disclosure. Some of the attributes of corporate governance variables used in this study include: board size, board independence, board gender diversity, frequency of board meetings.\nTo achieve this objective, the corporate annual reports in 15 companies ranging between the periods of four years (2012-2016) will be analyzed. The choice of these firms arises based on their direct or indirect contribution to the environmental.\n1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n    This study is expected to provide useful insight into improving environmental disclosure quality. The study contributes to the accounting literature as it provides additional empirical evidence on the impact corporate governance on environmental disclosure quality. The study also will be useful to stakeholders in Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) as it provides evidence on the relationship between corporate governance attributes and environmental disclosure quality and the reform instituted by them in formulating the code of corporate governance for listed companies in Nigeria.\n Other significance of the study are:\n It also provides an insight to organizations on how to satisfy the growing demands and continuous yearning for the voluntary disclosure of corporate environmental information in their annual reports.\nFinancial institution: More so, it makes available for banks both within the financial institution on the need for environmental improvement and environmental performance. This in the long run, helps to visualize an image of the banks as having a moral obligation to account for its environmental activities.\nPolicy-makers: Furthermore, this study will educate policy-makers on ways in which the environmental performance of companies can be measured and analyzed using ISO requirements.\nResearchers: it serves as a beacon for other researchers that are involved in carrying out studies that are inter-country based, especially within the context of developing economies. Finally, this study serves as a reference point for subsequent research on environmental disclosure practices in Nigerian banking sector.\n1.7    LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\nThe study identifies the following limitations:\nFirstly, there is the challenge of inappropriate measurement of variables such as those addressed in this study are examined. Thus in dealing with such issues, the potential for subjectivity is often inevitable.\n In addition, the smallness of the sample size is also considered a limitation. This occurs both in terms of the respondents for the study and in the geographical spread to be covered. It also suffices to note that a study of this nature is constrained by time and resources. This is because this research needs to be carried out simultaneously when the academic work is going on.\nAlso, the eventual analysis of the research findings is always subject to the assumption that the respondents have provided a true opinion to the questions and often times this cannot be ascertained by the researcher.\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE",

Turner (in Elliot & Willingham, 1980:97) and Robertson (2002:5) define fraud more broadly as \"all means that human ingenuity can devise, and which are resorted to by an individual to get an advantage over another by false suggestions or suppression of the truth\". This type of fraud includes surprises, tricks, cunning, dissembling and any other unfair way by which another person is cheated. The definition of financial statement fraud is essentially the same as that of fraud, apart from a few additional aspects. \nThe International Standard of Auditing (lSA) 240 (IAASB, 2007:272) defines corporate fraud as \"an intentional act by one or more individuals among management, those charged with governance, employees or third parties, involving the use of deception to obtain an unjust or illegal advantage\". Financial statement fraud is thus fraud committed by the management of an organization with the goal to artificially improve the financial performance and results of the company as stated in the financial statements. This is done most often by means of overstating assets and revenue or understating liabilities and expenses. \nFinancial statement fraud must be clearly distinguished from non-fraudulent earnings management and accounting errors. Non-fraudulent earnings management takes place when a legitimate generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) method is applied, but only because it has a favorable impact on the financial statements (Rezaee, 2002). An example is a company's management decision to use certain inventory valuation or depreciation methods. Such practices must, however, also be looked upon critically, as it can lead to greater accounting risk in the financial statements of a company. \nAccounting risk refers to the increased risk of a company's management perpetrating financial statement fraud at some stage in the future to improve the appearance of financial performance and position. The research therefore seek to investigate Effects of firm characteristics on financial statement fraud –A case study of Total plc. \n1.2 Statement of the Problem \nFinancial statement fraud has larger implications than many managers realize. For many, it is only a means to improve results, but apart from harming the company in which it is being perpetrated, it can also affect economic markets.\nRezaee (2002:7) gives the following summary of the potential harmful effects of financial statement fraud: it undermines the quality and integrity of the financial reporting process; it jeopardizes the integrity and objectivity of the accounting profession; it diminishes the confidence of capital markets and market participants in the reliability of financial information; it makes the capital market less efficient; it adversely affects a nation's growth and prosperity; it may result in litigation losses; it destroys the careers of individuals involved in the fraud; it causes bankruptcy or economic losses by the company engaged in the fraud; it encourages a higher level of regulatory intervention; and it causes destructions to the normal operations and performance of the alleged companies. At least for the above reasons, it is necessary to attempt the prevention of fraud incidences. A profile that is developed to analyse a company's character and situation can help interested parties in a proactive way to protect their interests.  Therefore, The problem confronting the research is to determine the effect of firm characteristics on financial statement fraud using Total Plc as the case study. \n1.3 Objectives of the Study \nTo determine the effects of firm characteristics on financial statement fraud. \nTo determine the effects of firm characteristics on financial statement fraud in Total Plc.\n1.4 Research Questions \nWhat is the Effect of firm characteristics on financial statement fraud? \nWhat is the Effect of firm characteristics on financial statement fraud in Total Plc?\n1.5  Research Hypothesis \nHo: The Effects of firm characteristics on financial statement fraud in Total plc. is low. \nHi:  The Effects of firm characteristics on financial statement fraud in Total plc. Is high.\n1.6 Significance of the Study \nThe study elucidate on the Effects of firm characteristics on financial statement fraud, a case study of Total plc. Financial statement fraud has larger implications than many managers realize. For many, it is only a means to improve results, but apart from harming the company in which it is being perpetrated, it can also affect economic markets.\n1.7 Scope of the Study \nThe study focuses on the appraisal of the Effects of firm characteristics on financial statement fraud –A case study of Total plc.\n1.8 Limitations of the Study \nThe study was confronted by some constraints including logistics and geographical factor.\n1.9   Definition of Terms \nFRAUD DEFINED \nThe Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) (2001) defines fraud as \"an array of irregularities and illegal acts characterized by intentional deception\". Turner (in Elliot & Willingham, 1980:97) and Robertson (2002:5) define fraud more broadly as \"all means that human ingenuity can devise, and which are resorted to by an individual to get an advantage over another by false suggestions or suppression of the truth\". This type of fraud includes surprises, tricks, cunning, dissembling and any other unfair way by which another person is cheated. \nFINANCIAL STATEMENT FRAUD DEFINED \nThe International Standard of Auditing (lSA) 240 (IAASB, 2007:272) defines corporate fraud as \"an intentional act by one or more individuals among management, those charged with governance, employees or third parties, involving the use of deception to obtain an unjust or illegal advantage\". Financial statement fraud is thus fraud committed by the management of an organization with the goal to artificially improve the financial performance and results of the company as stated in the financial statements. \nREFERENCES \nElliot, R.K. & Willingham, J.J. 1980.

(a study of abbot resources Enugu)\". The objective of this study includes the following: to identify the effect of electronic accounting on the account receivables of an organization, to examine the extent to which electronic accounting have impact on account payables of an organization. For a successful completion of this research work, the researcher made use of both primary and secondary methods of data collection for information gathering. Primary data were collected through questionnaire administration, oral interview, and personal observations. Secondary data were collected through periodicals and journals, textbooks and lecture note books, and also the Internet. The data collected were presented in tables and analyzed with simple percentage while the hypotheses stated were tested with chi square. The researcher found out that electronic accounting has significant effect on the account receivables of an organization, electronic accounting has impact on financial reporting of an organization. In conclusion, Electronic accounting has impact on account payables of an organization to a very great extent, Electronic accounting has impact on financial reporting of an organization. The researcher recommends that Managers of organizations should critically study the diverse accounting policies and apply them in their decision making processes as they aid managerial decision making in organizations, Organizations should not ignore the use of accounting policies because of the costs involved in using these tools due to the fact that the costs involved in the use of these tools quantify their benefits.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nAccounting according to Adebiyi, (2010:12) is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities. Accounting, which has been called the \"language of business\", measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users including investors, creditors, management, and regulators (Agbasi, 2008:43).\n\nAnunolam (2006:88) defined accounting as the systematic and comprehensive recording of financial transactions pertaining to a business. Accounting also refers to the process of summarizing, analyzing and reporting these transactions. The financial statements that summarize a large company's operations, financial position and cash flows over a particular period are a concise summary of hundreds of thousands of financial transactions it may have entered into over this period.\n\nAccounting is one of the key functions for almost any business; it may be handled by a bookkeeper and accountant at small firms or by sizeable finance departments with dozens of employees at larger companies.\n\nDreytus, (2009: 12) is of the view that the reports generated by various streams of accounting, such as cost accounting and management accounting, are invaluable in helping management make informed decisions. While basic accounting functions can be handled by a bookkeeper, advanced accounting is handled by qualified accountants who possess designations such as lCAN (Institute of Chartered Accountants). All accounting designations are the culmination of years of study and rigorous examinations, combined with a minimum number of years-of practical accounting experience.\n\nElectronic accounting according to Eze, (2010:21) is the application of' online and internet technologies to the business accounting function. Similar to e-mail being an electronic versi on of traditional mail, electronic accounting is electronic enablement of lawful accounting and traceable accounting processes which were traditionally manual and paper-based.\n\nNweze (2008:56) opined that electronic accounting involves performing regular accounting functions, accounting research and the accounting training and education through various computer based /internet based accounting tools such-as digital tool kits, various internet resources, international web-based materials institute and company databases which are internet based, web links, internet based accounting software and electronic financial spreadsheet tools to provide efficient decision making.\n\nElectronic accounting improve the corporate performance of organizations by enhancing its diverse accounting activities such as associated with accounts payable, accounts receivable, financial reporting and bank and account reconciliations. The above variables are the dependent variables which this study is meant to establish a relationship with the independent variable (electronic accounting).\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nUsing electronic accounting system comes with its own set of problems, such as the need to protect against data loss through power failure or viruses, and the danger of hackers stealing data. This can alter information on both accounts payables and receivables of an organization thereby affecting its overall performance.\n\nComputer fraud is also a concern and situations where there are no systems of control to monitor access to accounting information can go to a great extent in affecting diverse activities of the organization. It could lead to wrong financial reporting or even poor bank and account reconciliations.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe broad objective of this study is to appraise the effect of electronic         accounting.\n\nThe specific objectives include the following:\n\n1.     To identify the effect of electronic accounting on the account receivables-of an organization.  \n\n2.     To examine the extent to which electronic accounting have impact on account payables of an organization.\n\n3.     To determine how electronic accounting impacts on financial reporting of an organization.\n\n4.     To examine the effect of electronic accounting on bank and account reconciliations of organizations.     \n\n1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nThe following research questions are stated for this study:\n\n1.     Does electronic accounting have significant effect on the account receivables of an organization?\n\n2.     To what extent does electronic accounting have impact on account payables of an organization?\n\n3.     How does electronic accounting impact on financial reporting of an organization?\n\n4.     Does electronic accounting have significant effect on bank and account reconciliations of organizations?\n\n1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\nThe following hypotheses are formulated for this study:\n\nHYPOTHESIS ONE\n\nHo: Electronic accounting does not have significant effect on the account receivables of an organization.        \n\nHI:    Electronic accounting has significant effect on the account receivables of an organization.\n\nHYPOTHESIS TWO\n\nHo: Electronic accounting does not have impact on account payables of an organization.\n\nH1:   Electronic accounting has impact on account payables of an organization.\n\nHYPOTHESIS THREE\n\nHo: Electronic accounting does not impact on financial reporting of an organization. .\n\nHI:    Electronic accounting has impact on financial reporting of an organization.\n\nHYPOTHESIS FOUR\n\nHo: Electronic accounting does not have significant effect on bank and account reconciliations of organizations.     \n\nHI:    Electronic accounting has significant effect on bank and account reconciliations of organizations.\n\n1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study will be of enormous significance especially to the management and staff of Abbot Resources Enugu as it will enlighten them on the diverse roles of electronic accounting in enhancing organizational performance.\n\nThe recommendations of this study will suggest for other firms on the strategies or diverse electronic accounting tools to promote organizational performance.\n\nThe general public will not just be enlightened on the concept of electronic accounting but will be made to understand how to apply its tools in their diverse businesses for enhanced performance. Students and other researchers will widen their scope from the information contained in this study.\n\n1.7 SCOPE AND OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study covered electronic accounting in the corporate performance of organizations.

But key business objectives in today’s business environment are difficult to realize without developing highly committed and motivated employees who would strive to contribute to organizational goals. Several behavioral and HRM studies have been investigating the issues of employee commitment and employee satisfaction since long but its importance was never felt as today in global scenario. Even though both these concepts are seen as psychological links between organizational and employee goal, how to achieve them has not been properly researched. From past many decades, on the one hand, behavioral theorists have tried to focus on various types of commitments like behavioral commitment (Salancik, 1977), organizational commitment (Mathieu and Zajac, 1990), continuance commitment, calculative commitment (McGee and Ford, 1987; Meyer and Allen, 1984), job involvement (Kanungo, 1982; Rabinowitz and Hall, 1977), professional commitment (Lachman and Aranya, 1986), normative commitment (Wiener, 1982), and organizational identification (Hall et al., 1970). On the other hand, HR researchers have favored the use of HRD practices like career ladders, training, flexibility, reduced hierarchies, team, jobs with upgraded skills, job security, new forms of assessment, payment systems, and quality for achieving high commitment (Arthur, 1994; Beer et al. 1984). According to them, the companies with high commitment have high productivity, high job satisfaction, lower scrap rates, and lower employee turnover than those with tight. Unlike western countries, in India, because of overpopulation and rising unemployment amidst growing global economy, HR practices have to take care of issues like earnings, job security, welfare facilities, career planning before thinking about providing overall employee satisfaction and employee commitment (Mankidy, 2004). The primacy of HRD over HRM in India focuses on learning and development for the organization as well as to drive employee behavioral changes in a positive way (Rao, 1999; Pareek, 2004). Our goal, however, is to examine employee commitment (EC) and overall employee satisfaction (OES) in hope of re-directing research in this area, rather than just proposing theories about EC and OES. Most of the work in this field deals with psychological aspects and there remains a gap between theory and practice. Little empirical work has been done on the role of HRD strategies in bringing about EC and OES. We believe that the focus on these two heavily researched measures may have wider implications for HRM and HRD practices.\n\nWendel (1973) described human resources in his books as consisting of all individuals engaged in any of the organizations activities regardless of their levels. Human resources from the above simply means, men and women working for an organization, irrespective of the post they are holding. However, this went further to emphasis that there was no demarcation for men and women working for the organization that belong or do not belong to the human resources of the organization.\n\n        Meanwhile, any activity in the organization from the beginning to the end stage depends on human resources. Therefore, any organization aiming at achieving some of their goals must ensure not only maintaining constant and adequate supply of human resources but also ensure that they were adequately motivated. This is because, the human resources that are motivated will be answering human resources of the organization without putting in their best.\n\n        James (1946) stated that the effective use of people is still the key to productivity and your assignment is to motivate people to get the best of their skills and abilities. He affirmed that organization will achieve high productivity more than ever before by motivating their workers and sending them for training.\n\nMorevover, Ubeku (1983) went further to say that although the task of motivating workers is vested on the management team as a while but said that managers have more roles to play. He said that managers, can provide the organization a continuous day to day coaching, appraisal and encouragement – that the employees will need more than ever before. He was of the opinion that manager have upper hand in motivating workers. He further stated that the supervisor who works with his subordinates on this intimate basis can do much to influence his organizations programme.\n\nTraining and development of human resources have been considered an expandable luxury in terms of financial constraints. The growth and development of any organization depends on its human resources, a specific cost of management to develop individual skills or a means of developing people for promotion to the next level of organization leadership. While these views carry some validity of human resources should be regarded in the large context of trends in society and the need of changing organization.\n\nIn the past, not much importance was attached to the role or human resources development on the growth and efficiency of organizations.  No pride of place was given man-power planning and development as a save way to enhance skills knowledge and capacities of personnel in organizations. The importance of investing in human resources has become much clear in recent years because of mounting evidence on the extent of which such investment as an engine change. Although, human resources management is that sub system of an organization which is directly concerned with planning, controlling the procurement, development, compensation, integration and maintenance of the human resources component of the organization. The effectiveness of this sub-system will be judged by the way policies and practices affect the performance and productivity of individual workers will be achieved towards the realization of the effectiveness of the organization.\n\nToday, one of the major problems confronting management in an organization is the most effective way of putting the right position. Management should identify and provide for its human resources to accomplish its task. The concept of organizational effectiveness is that which organizations as a social system give certain resources and means fulfils its objectives without a capacitating its means and resources and without placing undue strain upon its members. The means and resources referred to have cannot be personal constituents of the organization on who the achievement of effectiveness in the organization is based through their increased performance and productivity. The existence of a conducive and carefully designed human resources management policies and practices appear inevitable for the attainment of these goals.\n\n1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nOne of the major problems confronting management in any organization is the most effective way of matching people with jobs. This calls for man power planning program. Many organizations fail to progress due to their inability to train and develop their work force. Lack of adequate skills and knowledge, which are required to work and attain the major organizational objectives, constitute a cog in the wheel of achieving them. There has been criticisms from different works of life both within and outside the country about the inefficient performance of our SMEs. The personnel officer should understand and identify certain conditions that will serve as pointers for the need for training. It is in view of this that the researcher intend to investigate how human resource development enhanced employees commitment.\n\n1.3      OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe paramount objective of this research work is to ascertain the impact of human resource development and employees commitment in selected SMEs in Edo state; but for the successful completion of the study, the researcher intends to achieve the following sub-objective\n\ni)             To ascertain the role of human resource development in ensuring employees commitment in an organizations.\n\nii)           To evaluate the impact of human resource development on the growth of SMEs in Edo state\n\niii)          To ascertain the relationship between human resource development and employees commitment\n\niv)         To ascertain the effect of employees commitment on the growth of SMEs.\n\n1.4      RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\nFor the successful completion of the study, the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher\n\nH0:human resource management does not play any role in ensuring employees commitment\n\nH1:human resource management plays a significant role in ensuring employees commitment\n\nH0:human resource development has no impact on the growth of SMEs\n\nH2:human resource development has a significant impact on the growth of SMEs\n\n1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis research work is significant to both the management (employers) and the labour (employees).  Secondly a close look at the work carried out will reveal a significant effect of human resources development and employees commitment. Moreso, the research work will serve the role of shaping the organizational policies on human resources (personnel) for the overall attainment of the set objectives. It is only when the human resources is adequately qualified for the job to be performed that we can hope that the material resources in put can be effectively allocated and usefully utilized in the most optimum manner. If personnel administration is to be successful, management must give it sincere support in order to sustain  organizational growth.  The practical relevance of this study lives in the fact that no organization can achieve its set objectives without competent employees. Hence the issue of training and development becomes a central pre-occupation of any organization out to achieve and sustain efficient operation.\n\n1.6      SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of this study covers the human resource development and employees commi\n\nEmployees commitment in selected SMEs in Edo state. But in the cause of the study there are some constrain beyond the control of the researcher which limited the scope of the study;\n\na)     AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL: The research material      available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study.\n\nb)     TIME: The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider         coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities        and examinations with the study.\n\nc)     FINANCE: The finance available for the research work does not     allow for wider coverage as resources are very limited as the        researcher has other academic bills to cover.\n\n1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nSMEs\n\nThe European definition of SME follows: \"The category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro\n\nHRM\n\nHuman Resource Management (HRM or HR) is the management of human resources. It is designed to maximize employee performance in service of an employer's strategic objectives\n\nEmployees Commitment\n\n EC is defined as the employee's positive emotional attachment to the organization. Meyer and Allen pegged AC as the \"desire\" component of organizationalcommitment. An employee who is affectively committed strongly identifies with the goals of the organization and desires to remain a part of the organization\n\n1.8      ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThis research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows Chapter one is concern with the introduction, which consist of the (overview, of the study), statement of problem, objectives of the study, research question, significance or the study, research methodology, definition of terms and historical background of the study. Chapter two highlight the theoretical framework on which the study its based, thus the review of related literature. Chapter three deals on the research design and methodology adopted in the study. Chapter four concentrate on the data collection and analysis and presentation of finding.  Chapter five gives summary, conclusion, and recommendations made of the study.\nHUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYEES COMMITMENT IN SELECTED SMES IN EDO STATE ",

As social contract term the ruler is expected to perform some roles; be it administrative, social, economic, political, cultural or religious. In return, the ruled subjects that enjoy the benefits from these roles performed are to give something for keeping the machinery working. This could be in cash or in kind. 'In light of the above, every constituted human society, whether primitive or modem, has one form of levy or the other. This necessitates tax and taxation. A historical review of man and societyreveals that tax exists as a major source of revenue for government.\n\nTax payment, according to Nightingale (1998), \"is the part of the price to be paid for living in an organized and orderly society, for if this is not done, the miscreants produced through the inequality in the system will be a source of constant irritation to the well-being of those who have.\" A system of tax- will vary (even if slightly) from one 'country to the other because it is a socio­political and economic' model representing society's social, political and economic needs and aspiration at arty given time. Because of this, Nigerian tax system is dynamic and is continually changing to meet the needs of the constituents of the society.\n\nAn income tax is a tax levied on the income of individuals or business(corporations or other legal entities). Various income tax systems exist, with varying degrees of tax incidence. Income taxation can be progressive, proportional, or regressive, when the tax is levied on the income of companies, it is often called a corporate tax, income tax, or profit tax. Individual income taxes often tax the total income of the individual (with some deductions permitted), while corporate income taxes often tax net income (the difference between gross receipts, expenses, and additional write-offs). Various systems 'define income differently, and often allow notional reductions of income (such as a reduction based on number of children supported).\n\nAccording to Lekan and Sunday (2006) \"Personal Income Tax is a tax imposed with income as its base.\" This income is as received by some chargeable people. Agbetunde (2004) states that \"It is not everybody that falls under the coverage of this tax but certain sets of people called taxable persons.\" The discussion on the administration of income tax is incomplete without due consideration of the socio-economic development of Ikeja Local Government Area of Lagos State.\n\nIn light of the above, the revenue generated through taxation in Ikeja Local Government of the state has been channeled to various areas such as road construction and rehabilitation, transportation, traffic management, environmental beautification, waste management, flood control, physical planning and flood upgrading, education, job creation, health, economic planning, commerce and industry, housing, etc. most feasible in Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way, ObafemiAwolowo Road, Oba Akran Road, Airport –Road etc,\n\nThe economic impact of personal income tax administration in Ikeja cannot be over-emphasized. It is seen in the system of transportation in that, roads have enormous impact on the standard of living of the people in so many ways. It is also noticeable in the environment to general, because of the determination to have a sustainable environment and this has prompted an aggressive promotion of a culture of 'Greening Ikeja Local Government. '\n\nThe success 9f this landscaping and beautification exercise is self-evident in many outer and inner areas and major roads as stated earlier.\n\nIn the course of this study, effort shall be made to discuss extensively on the economic importance of personal income tax administration in Lagos State, and Ikeja Local Government in particular.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe following are the problems that prompted the pursuit of this study:\n\na.

There is however a consensus' that these small and medium enterprises have largely failed to ·deliver on this score. Lack of access to credit from financial institutions has been identified as constituting the greatest clog in the wheel of progress for small and medium enterprises. This research work seeks to appraise the process of analysing credit requests on small and medium enterprises in. the Lagos Metropolis using Bank PHB as a case study. In carrying out this research study, questionnaire was used as the instrument and chi-square also was used for the testing of the hypothesis formulated with the use of non-parametric statistical techniques. The management and staff of Bank PHB PIc was used as the respondents which relevant question was structured to sought respondent's opinion on the credit analysis on small and medium enterprises by banks. It was recommended that a mechanism should be put in place whereby governments at various levels could guarantee SMEs loans availed by banks.\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nAccording to Nwankwo (1990), since the first formal bank was established in 1656 in Sweden, the banking industry has always been a pervading institutional player in any given economy, being the only sector that thrives on other people's money. Although element of the practice of banking has always existed both In pre and post-colonial periods, the introduction of modern banking in Nigeria dates back to 1892 when the African Banking Corporation (ABC) came into existence, engaging in commercial activities. This bank was later changed to Bank of British West Africa (BBWA) in 1894, now the First Bank of Nigeria Plc. Other banks have since sprung up in the financial landscape offering a variety of innovative financial products to their ever-burgeoning clientele.\n\nAccording to Enyinnaya (1991), granting of credits is one of the fundamental and basic functions of banks and other financial institutions. By their nature, banks intermediate between savers and users of funds, i.e., banks source funds from economic sectors with surplus funds in form of deposits, and disburse the same to economic units that need them for various purposes in form of credits or loans. Aside from providing the fiduciary responsibility on depositor's funds, granting of loans appears to be the next most important function of banks since this activity represents one of the key sources of income for banks generally. However, in considering requests for loans, income or profit motivations do not and should not prevent the lending financial institution from ensuring that the loan together with associated interest income is repaid fully and timely. One of the surest ways of ensuring that a credit facility together with its related interest income gets fully and timely repaid is through a thorough credit analysis. This analysis as basis for determining worthy customers to be availed credit facility is done for all categories of customers including individuals, corporate organizations, and in some instances, governments including its agencies and parastatal. In a profit driven market economy like ours in\n\n\nNigeria, the major borrowers are organizations in the private sector. Even amongst players in the private sector, the small and medium scale industries are rated as having a large appetite for credit. This is not surprising, as small and medium enterprises constitute an important segment partly due to the fact that the sub sector has been widely known as the backbone of many economies and their engine of growth and development.\n\n1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nWe had acknowledged the central role to be played by small and medium enterprises industries in the drive for economic development of the country. There is however a consensus those small and medium enterprises have largely failed to deliver on this score (Bunmi, 2002). The immediate past CBN Governor in a key note address at the national summit on \"Revamping small and medium scale industries\" organised by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) at the MAN House, Ikeja on March 04, 2004, laid this failure squarely on the absence of what he termed critical success factors including:\n\n             i.        Competent entrepreneurship\n\n            ii.        Technical and managerial skills; as well as\n\n           iii.        Enabling environment for investment in small and medium scale industries.\n\nHe listed other constraints to include:\n\n·        Poor access to money and capital markets. >High rate of enterprise mortality.\n\n·        Shortage of skilled manpower.\n\n·        Financial indiscipline.\n\n·        Lack of infrastructural facilities.\n\n·        Poor policy implementation.\n\n·        Poor management practices and low entrepreneurial skill base.\n\n·        Restricted market access.\n\n·        Overbearing regulatory and operational environment.\n\nHowever, he singled out lack of access to credit from financial institutions as constituting the greatest clog in the wheel of progress for small and medium enterprises (Olowe, 1998). This research work seeks to appraise the process of analysing credit requests of small and medium enterprises by banks in the Lagos Metropolis using Bank PHB as a case study.\n\n1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objective of this is to examine the credit analysis on small and medium enterprises by banks with reference to Bank PHB. The specific objectives are:\n\n1)   To determine the level of credit demanded by banks\n\n2)   To examine the criteria emphasized in credit analysis on small and medium scale enterprises (SMES)\n\n3)   To identify the credit monitoring and follow-ups for small and medium enterprises.\n\n4)   To identify the average time fir the analysis and approval of credit\n\n5)   To determine what can be done to reverse the trend identified in small and medicine scale enterprises.\n\n1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n(1)         What is the level of credit demanded by banks?\n\n(2)         What is the criteria emphasis in credit analysis on small and medium scale enterprises (SMES)?\n\n(3)         Does credit monitoring and follow-ups for small and medium scale enterprises worthwhile?\n\n(4)         What is the average time for the analysis and approval of credit?\n\n(5)         Is there a solution to the reverse of trend identified in small and medium scale enterprises?\n\n\n1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n\nThe following hypotheses were formulated for the purpose of this study. They are as follows:\n\nHypothesis I\n\nHi:      There is a positive relationship between credit analysis and small and medium scale enterprises.\n\nHo:     There is a negative relationship between credit analyses and small and medium scale enterprises.\n\nHypothesis II\n\nHi:      There is a relationshipbetween the average time for the credit analysis and approval of credit\n\nHo:     There is no relationship between the average times for the credit analysis and approval of credit\n\n1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study will be significant in the following ways:\n\n1.      It will serve as a source of enlightenment to those who may be uninformed about credit analysis for small-scale industries.\n\n2.      The study will serve as codified material for credit analysis for small­scale industries.\n\n3.      It is expected that small-scale industries will learn useful lessons from the conclusions of the research.\n\n4.      It is also hoped that the result of this study would be of great assistance to other researchers.\n\n1.7     RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nThe methodology to be used in this research work would be survey method through the administration of questionnaire as the instrument. The data gathered are primary data and would be analyzed using the following statistical technique:\n\n(1)        Simple percentage: It will be used to analyze the bio-data section and the subject matter itself.\n\n(2)        Chi-square: This will be used to analyze the data and test the operational hypothesis formulated, non-parametric test statistic with the use of statistical package for social scientist to analyze and compare the calculated and the expected to arrive at a reasonable conclusion.\n\n1.8     SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study is intended to have an over view of lending generally. It shall delve into various forms of lending and how lending decisions are made. Special emphasis will be made on the procedure adopted by banks in analysing credit requests from small-scale enterprises. This is with a view to identifying the reasons for the high rejection rate presently the lot of small-scale industries.\n\nThe work of some authors and researchers would be incorporated in the literature review and finally, recommendations will be made based on the conclusions.\n\nA major limitation was time constraint, which could have inadvertently affected the depth of the study. Restrictions to access to information, where available, were also experienced, and certain cases of outright unavailability of relevant information were also observed. However, a great deal of thoroughness was employed in the use of available data and information.\n\nAnother limitation was the inability to study all the mega banks that resulted from the recently concluded consolidation exercise, hence the need to select and do a special analysis of Platinum Habib Bank Plc.\n\nWorthy of mention is the fact that that apart from above mentioned limitations; the researcher also experienced financial handicaps, which greatly determined the volume of research work.\n\n1.9     ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY\n\nChapter one will provides the introductory part of the study coupled with the sub-headings such as statement of problems aim and objectives, research questions, research hypothesis, significance of study, scope and limitation of study, methodology, work plan and operational definition and terms.\n\n\nChapter two provides the interactive review and the related study of the past scholars and writers on the topic will also be considered.\n\nChapter three intends to give the research design, instrument for data collection, population and sample, sampling technique and limitation of the methodology.\n\nChapter four present of data and analysis. Here the data gathered from questionnaire administration will be highlighted, presented and interpreted alongside with the hypothesis formulated.\n\nChapter five is the concluding part of the research work, which includes the summary of finding, recommendations, suggestion for further studies and conclusion.\n\n1.10   DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nBank: A financial institution licensed by Central Bank of Nigeria for collection of deposits and rendering of banking related financial services to the general public.\n\nCredit Analysis: Aims at ensuring that the loan together with appropriate interest will be repaid as they fall due.\n\nTerm Loans: are given to customers to buy items that are of long term in nature.

The unique feature of most SMEs is that, they can be easily established since their requirement in terms of capital, technology; management and even utilities are not as demanding as it is the case of large enterprises. Consequently, small enterprise sector is one of the leading employers (next only to peasant agriculture) in Nigeria and has been recognized as significant sector in employment creation, income generation, poverty alleviation and a base for industrial development. It is estimated that there are over 30 million enterprises in the sector employing between 15 to 16 million people. Despite the enormous potential of the private sector, poor record keeping is identified as a constraint hampering its growth in Nigeria. Businesses are unable to keep track of daily activities and banks are unwilling to lend to SMEs all due to lack of financial information. Hence, this study seeks to investigate whether SMEs practice bookkeeping or not, and the contributions of bookkeeping to the growth of SMEs in the Uyo in Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria. The study considered a total population of 450 comprising SMEs, 15 Banks as well as SMEDAN office in the Local Government Area. Out of this figure, a simple random sampling technique was used to select a sample size of 136 for the study. From the findings of the study, it was revealed that, 80.8% SMEs were practicing bookkeeping and the manual system was predominantly used. The recommendations however were that, SMEDAN must be strengthen and well resourced by government to offer support services in the area of organizing effective training programmes for SMEs operators. There must also be an intensive publicity in the local dialect through the mass media to sensitize SME operators on the need to maintain proper books of records.\nASSESSING BOOK-KEEPING PRACTICES OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES",

Obviously, one of the factors that separate competitors (banks) from the other (other banks) in the Nigerian banking industry is their level of services delivery. This is because service delivery determines the level of customers' satisfaction and consequently, the customer patronage of any bank. The patronage by customers on the service delivered by a given Bank, no doubt is a function of the satisfaction they so derive from it. Satisfaction in relation to bank service delivery is the customers' evaluation of the service in terms of whether that service met their needs and expectations (Babatunde and Olukemi, 2012).  Happy and satisfied customers behave in a positive manner.\nThe effect of service delivery by banks and the satisfaction derivable by the customers are becoming perceptible. Given that the contemporary customers are more informed than ever before, Leboeuf (1987) posited that meeting their expectation as regards satisfaction is increasingly becoming more difficult.\nAccording to Woldie (2003), bank customers in Nigeria have been found to be dissatisfied with the quality, of services provided by banks. This calls for the need to actually investigate how customers behave or get satisfied with regards to the services of commercial banks in Nigeria. \nNo doubt that information from current technologies in banking operations has improved efficiency and effectiveness of their operations so that more transactions can be processed faster and most conveniently.  However, this development in the Nigerian banking industry seems not to have achieved the very essence and goal of satisfying the myriad of customers (Babatunde and Olukemi, 2012). Long queues  are still seen in the banking halls, bank customers still handled too much cash, and hardly the people talk about the electronic banking service delivery that are presumed to enhance customers satisfaction in Nigeria banking industry. Against this backdrop, this study examines Bank services delivery and customer satisfaction in Nigeria.\nBANK SERVICE DELIVERY AND CUSTOMERS SATISFACTION IN NIGERIA BANK",

On the theoretical aspect it reviewed the concepts of monetary management, the objective of monetary policy and the instruments of monetary policy.The highlights of the Nigeria economy of the 1970’s were the growing importance of oil, the expending role of the public sector in the economy and the large dependable on the external sector. Despite the family impression economic performance of the period, some economic problem such as growing fiscal pressures, assumed more serious dimensions. In the prevailing circumstances, monetary central framework and the large divergence of fiscal operation from the set monetary and credit targets.The oil boom of the 1970’s come to an end in the early 1980’s. \nConsequently, the development strategies, which were considered appropriate during that period, became inappropriate under the environment characterized by substantial reduction in oil import earnings and revenue. Rigorous economic controls were mounted to stain the determination in the general framework. Monetary policy applied more vigorously the credit ceiling. Selective credit controls and regulating on interest rates.\nThe currently problem of monetary policy were largely a carryover from the previous decade and these included the apparent inefficiencies of the monetary control framework based on direct instrument and government fiscal operations especially the increased financing of fiscal deficit by the central bank.Monetary policy, though having the same over all objectives as before was employed to play a unique role in restore my economic stability.\n In order to reduce credit expansion by banks, credit certings were reduced and backed up liquidity mopping measures such as the withdrawal of all deposits on outstanding external payment arrears and public sector deposits from the bank in 1986 and 1989 respectively, the sectional credit flexibility in their credit operation, which in August 1987 all controls on interest rates changed by banks were removed.\nDespite the good intentions of monetary management domestic liquidity expand substantially during the period, especially in 1988 and the main source of increase in aggregate bank credit to the economy. Similarly, banks performance with regards to credit certings and sectoral credit guidelines was very poor.Full economic recovery could not be achieved within the short span of the SAP, even though its impact in light of the monetary development was to some extent positive in relation terms. Nevertheless, the problems of monetary policy appeared to have persisted in so far as the fundamental causes had not been removed. \nThe monetary targets were not being achieved, been used over time it become more difficult to enforce compliance particularly as frequent changes were made in the composition of credit and timely data were not usually available.Above all, monetary policy did not achieve the type of synchronization with fiscal policy as envisaged in the monetary control framework. When fiscal operations deviated from the targets monetary developments could not uphold the underlying assumptions and hence domestic price stability and external equilibrium, which are important objective of monetary policy could be assured.\nTHE EVOLUTION OF NIGERIA'S MONETARY POLICY AND ITS PERFORMANCE SINCE THE EARLY 1980S",

R.(1982): Social welfare services are required for the improvement in the society effort to attain the objectives of higher levels of social justices, social security, freedom and better quality of life as right of  each individual social welfare services could therefore be define as the services designed to improved a lot of individual family ,groups and local communities to enable them cope effectively with the social problems affecting the constantly or rapidly changing society .the above definition was published by the ministry of home affairs and information in 1971.\n\nHISTORICAL FACTS\n\nSocial welfare services were popularized by the British (colonial masters) immediately after the Second World War they could not finance any developmental projects where there was global economic recession vany longer.\n\n            According to Darie B C (1988): stated that in many loses, the causes of broken home are linked to unnecessary family interference, the set of children (female or male) mostly were male children are particularly preferred because of emphasis on succession. Where female children dominate in marriage, less attention are given to those children are sending them to school or paying of school fees and provision of material or school requirement are problem.\n\n            According to Paul J II (1996) says that another factors that can lead to broken home is polygamy where the man marries more than one which lead to having many children. The first wife to be neglected  due to unhealthy rivary from other women and lack of love from their spouse ,pack out of such homes undermining the consequences on their children.\n\n            In broken homes, children hardly related well with their parents, this can affect them emotionally and psychologically. Broken homes or pre-mature separation if allowed to persist for a long time it can lead girls to grow up anxious and neurotic, while boys can be bullies and delinquent. This is why social welfare services are needed so as to ease family relations problems and such family problem like broken home.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\n            In the society today, issue of broken homes have becomes controversial and this constitute a social problem. My strong emphasis is on Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\n            Majority of the people are mainly illiterates, this situation constitute a problem that harbor some element of superstitions. Some men believe that once their wives or wife can not give birth to male child, the next thing is to look for another wife not knowing that the fact is the male that determines the sex of a child and not the female.\n\n            Also in a family where we have polygamy in operation, the husband tend to show more love to one wife not minding what the reaction of the other wife or wives would be, this action brings separation among family and can cause broken home.\n\n            Some people are suspicious of the services rendered by the social welfare agents and they see no reason why such people should interfere in their family problems.\n\n            Some are not willing to co-operate at all because they felt that social welfare services are a mere waste ones time.\n\n            In course of this study we shall consider the role of social welfare services on broken homes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n            This study was conducted to educate the people on the roles of social welfare services on broken home\n\nIn Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State little has been done on the role social welfare services on broken homes, it is important therefore that more of such studies be carried out, this will enable the people to see how broken homes can be restored back.\n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n            This Study is limited to one (100) staff made up of 50 junior and 50 senior staff in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\nASSUMPTION\n\n            It is assumed that the questionnaires are set properly and answered correctly and that the students responded positively.\n\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nI will like to use this opportunity to define the following word in order to avoid any misunderstanding and for clarity.\n\n1. Social Welfare\n\n2. Service\n\n3. Social Welfare Service\n\n4. Broken home\n\n5. Home background\n\n6.Polygamy\n\n1.

Family planning techniques commonly used include sexual education, prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections, pre-conception counseling and management and infertility management (Wikipedia, 2010). These services are defined as “educational, comprehensive medical or social activities which enable couples, individuals including sexually active adolescents and minors, to determine freely the number and spacing of their children, avoid getting pregnant and/or even avoid sexually transmitted diseases, to select the means by which this may be achieved” (Wikipedia, 2010; Plata, 1996). Family planning is sometimes used as a synonym for birth control or child spacing, though it often includes more.\n\nThe use of family planning implies that the users make concerted efforts to deal with procreation within the context of a sexual relationship. This covers things as varied as when to get pregnant, the number of children that are wanted, how to deal with fertility issues, how to avoid getting pregnant, whether to consider an abortion if an unwanted pregnancy occurs, or adoption etc. to say nothing of working out parental strategies with one’s partner. Family Planning was listed as one of the twelve pillars of Reproductive Health. Among the objectives of Family Planning is to help women to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies (FMHN, 2005). In Nigeria, before the introduction of modern family planning by Babangida administration in 1989 there were traditional methods of birth control (Odimegwu, 1999). These traditional methods which still exist and are convenient for users (Encyclopedia Americana, 2001) are natural while the modern types which are new in Nigeria are both natural and artificial. In Nigeria like in most developing countries, the story of family planning services is not successful because of a number of factors, such as culture of the people and low status of women (Coleman, 2004). Other factors include lack of education and understanding about health related issues, the ability of women to command resources and make independent decisions about their fertility, birth control knowledge, (Nwakeze, 2003). Location, religion and social class, lack of cooperation from spouse, cost, perceived difficulty with the method and lack of knowledge about contraceptive methods etc. (World Bank, 2004; IPPF, 1993). Moreover in Nigeria, the provision of health services is more in the urban areas than in the rural areas (Dobie, et al 1998). Where family planning services are located in rural areas, access is low due to lack of proximity, bad road network and the nearest urban center, where such clinic is available, it may not provide adequate care because of lack of proper trained staff and equipment (Wikipedia, 2009; Quedraogo, 2005; NISER, 2001). Other factors include lack of proper family planning function dissemination; inadequate motivation to seek actively, access and regularly use contraceptives (Odimegwu, 1999).\n\nLack of use of family planning services is enormous as it affects the individual, the family, the community and nation at large. Empirical findings have shown that it leads to increase in maternal illness, such as multiple pregnancies, hemorrhage, etc. (Ikpeze, 2010; Wikipedia, 2009; Wikipedia, 2008). It sometimes leads to social problems in the family and community such as violence, desertion, accusation of infidelity, fear of violence on the part of the woman, mistrust. On the part of the man, it could lead to having multiple sexual partners with its attendant contraction of STIs and HIV/AIDS, affecting sexual and reproductive lives of women (Ezumah, 2003; Pop Report, 1999) and sometimes it leads to maternal death. These have socio- economic consequences on the immediate family as the resources meant for the up- keep of the family are diverted to the health care of the parent(s) as the case may be, time wasted and the future and the life of the children truncated. Family planning services have the function of preventing most maternal illnesses and deaths (Wikipedia, 2008), yet it has been recorded that the rate of maternal morbidity and mortality is high in developing countries compared to developed countries (Ikpeze, 2010; FMHN, 2005). UNICEF (2008) estimate shows that maternal mortality in Nigeria is high about 800/100,000 live births yet attitude of members of the developing countries to family planning services is low and this attitude is attributed to socio-cultural and economic reasons (Engender Health, 2009; Galadanci, 2009; Agujiobi, 2003; Ezumah, 2004; Onyeneho and Okeibunor, 2003; Nwakeze, 2003).With the adverse consequences of non-consent and non-use, and the inappropriate understanding of the importance of family planning services on the reproductive health of women, concerted efforts must be  made economically, socially, politically and otherwise towards  ensuring that the negative consequences of lack of use of family planning services are controlled to the barest minimum. This study therefore will examine the socio-economic and cultural barriers to access and use of family planning services by women of reproductive age in Nkanu area of Enugu State and suggest measures that could enhance effective use of family planning services for both genders in the research area.\n\n1. 2   Statement of the Problem\n\n Although the population of Nigeria is very high due to high marital fertility of about 5.6 children per woman and provision of family planning services limited, worst still is that utilization is low as a result of cultural and social pressures. For example, Child-bearing and rearing defines a woman’s value and status in her community, alongside the number and sex of children (NISER, 2001; Onyeneho and Okeibunor, 2003; Agujiobi, 2003; Nnorom, 2003; Ezumah, 2003); therefore deliberate attempt not to access these services by those women may be made (Engender Health, 2009; Galadanci, 2009), this is because of the importance attached to procreation which is emphasized in the extent a barren woman goes to get a wife for her husband to bear children on her behalf, or a wife goes outside her matrimonial home (with or without the consent of her husband in the case of infertility on the man’s side) to get children in order to maintain the family’s existence and value in the community (Ezumah, 2003).. Even though development has increased attitude to use of family planning services especially among the urban middle class in African societies, Bowman and Kuenyehia (2003) empirical findings, show that in urban areas where there are Family planning services information and enlightenment, the rate of access and usage is low as some women shun the use of western methods because it conflicts with indigenous beliefs and practices.Family Planning Services are aimed at benefiting the health and wellbeing of women and families throughout the world, by the provision of contraceptives which help them avoid unwanted pregnancies and space births; provide protection against sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS; and provide other health benefits, in spite of its’ benefits most Nigerian women do not access to it especially those in the rural areas (Wikipedia, 2008), because in relation to contraception, it is a male prerogative (Okeibunor, 2000; Pop. Report, 1999).\n\n Male control is a major constraint to women’s access and use of family planning services. Also the nature of women’s work in production and reproduction such as household work, (drudge) and child bearing pose great restrictions to accessing and using Family Planning Services, (Barua & Kurz, 2001). Poor financing of health care services (Ikpeze, 2010), lack of focus on curative measures and political will (Quedraogo, 2005) by government serve as barrier to access and use of family planning services in Nigeria (Ikpeze, 2010), disparity in health care services delivery between the remote and non-remote areas (Huang, Yip, Chang and Chou 2006), as in Nigeria, where access and use is limited in rural areas unlike in urban areas (Engender Health 2009). Agujiobi (2003), attributed it to ignorance on the part of the ruralites, and the cause of the ignorance she attributed to lack of presence of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOS) in the rural areas of Nigeria to educate and enlighten them on the presence and importance of Family Planning Services.  Sometimes the available clinics may not provide decent care because of lack of proper staff and equipment (Engender Health 2009; Wikipedia, 2009). The effects of not planning the family cause a large number of women to continue to experience unplanned pregnancies leading to morbidity, mortality and social distress (Caufeild, 1998). Health of women in developing countries, Nigeria inclusive, is precarious because of high fertility rate; it’s been found that women who have been pregnant six times have twice the risk of experiencing maternal death more than women who have been pregnant only three times (Okeibunor, 2003; Odimegwu, 1999). In sub-Saharan Africa, the life time risk of maternal deaths is 1 in 16 and for developed nations only 1 in 2800 (Wikipedia, 2008). Maternal mortality and morbidity are often much higher in rural areas than in urban areas with up to 1000 per 100,000 reported in rural areas of several countries in Africa. Quedraogo, (2005), noted that 13% of maternal deaths in Africa are due to unplanned pregnancy and risky abortions. These reproductive health problems women experience particularly those that are pregnancy related are preventable; yet they constitute major problems, because women of reproductive ages do not use Family Planning Services (UNICEF, 2008; Bowman & Kuenyehia, 2003:233).\n\n In Nkanu area, people’s main source of livelihood is subsistence farming which makes their condition even worse. Social amenities such as quality health care facilities, government presence, etc, are lacking causing increase in high maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Also prevailing attitude and cultural practices affect women’s knowledge of their reproductive health needs and their willingness/ability to seek appropriate care (Alumanah, 2003). Nkanu area is culture bound and therefore could be described as traditional society even when some of its communities are close to the city. Little or no academic research on family planning has taken place in this study area, even though pregnancy related problems exist here as in other rural communities in Nigeria. If use of family planning services is not encouraged in this study area, it will become not only a great health problem but also continuous social and economic problems to the community and nation at large. Therefore this study will seek to investigate the socio-cultural and economic barriers to access and use of family planning services among the people of the study area.\n\n1. 3      Research Questions\n\n            This study will seek to provide answers to these questions:\n\n1)         What is the level of people’s awareness of and use of family planning services in the study area?\n\n2)         What types of family planning services are available in the study area?\n\n3)         What are specific constraints militating against people’s use of family planning services?\n\n4)         What problem(s) arise(s) as a result of people not accessing any of these services?\n\n5)         Who decides when and how to access or not to access family planning services?\n\n6)         What are peoples’ preferred methods of family planning?\n\n7)         What efforts are in place to encourage peoples’ use of family planning services in Nkanu Area?\n\n8)         What suggestions can be made on how to improve peoples’ access to and use of family planning services in Nkanu area.\n\n1. 4      Objectives of the Study\n\nThe main objective of the study is to investigate socio-cultural and economic factors that determine married women’s access to and use of family planning services in Nkanu Area of Enugu State.\n\nThe specific objectives of the study are to;\n\n1)      Ascertain married women’s awareness and knowledge of provision and importance of family planning services;\n\n2)      Ascertain  the type of family planning services  available in the study area;\n\n3)      Identify specific constraints that people experience in access to and use of family planning services;\n\n4)      Identify problems that arise as a result of people not accessing family planning services;\n\n5)      Determine who decides when and how to access or not to access family planning services and consequences of such decisions;\n\n6)      Determine the most desired and accessed family planning methods and reason(s) for their acceptance;\n\n7)      Ascertain the efforts in place (especially stake holders) to encourage target groups’ use of family planning services in Nkanu Area;\n\n8)      Make suggestions on how best to enhance (currently in-union) access to and use of family planning services in Nkanu.\n\n1. 5      Significance of the Study\n\n      This study will be theoretically important. Wikipedia, (2008), noted that the essence of family planning services is to benefit the health and wellbeing of women and families throughout the world. Pooda (2005), noting WHO’s estimate stated that one woman dies every minute due to complications of pregnancy and/or childbirth, about 4 million women suffer disabilities, some of which are serious and lifelong. Family planning therefore is expected to serve the purpose of helping couples to plan to have the number of children they desire and also be able to raise their children with full assurance of available resources, maintain good health and save (Wikipedia, 2010), and unmarried women including adolescents and minors to manage their active sexual lives properly without  regret. It is hoped this study will provide additional insight to the existing literature on family planning services, attitudes and perceptions in Nigeria with particular reference to Nkanu area. It is hoped to form a basis for triggering-off follow-up or new studies on the topic.\n\nThe practical significance includes the fact that the findings will be of immense benefit for stakeholders in making policies that will empower women in accessing family planning services, and encourage male and female support of use of family planning services and their health in general.\n\nIt is expected that this study will: (a) help raise consciousness of not just the target group but all who have attained adolescence and are sexually active especially in the rural and semi-rural areas of the need for access and use of family planning services, (b) help stake holders co-join in making millennium development goal of attaining good health for all by the year 2020 a reality in Nigeria.\n\n1.6       Definition and Operationalization of Concepts\n\nSocio-economic factors: these refer to the level of education, income, occupation of the people under study and how they affect their knowledge, access, and use of family planning services.\n\nCultural factors: refer to the institutions, language, symbols, practices, values, beliefs, norms, folklores, etc of the people and how these affect knowledge and access to family planning services. \n\nPostpartum: refers to the period from delivery of a baby to the period when the woman’s body is said to return to normal. This may last up to three to four years; that is when the child is weaned depending on the sex and society.\n\nThe woman after postpartum period is compensated by her husband through showering her with gifts of cloths, jewelleries and merry making before normal sexual relation is resumed.\n\nEducation: is a social institution, which enables and promotes the acquisition of skills, knowledge and the broadening of personal horizon (Giddens, 2010). It also refers to formal training and instruction that create awareness, knowledge and give empowerment to the educated. For this work levels of formal education will be taken thus: low educational attainment = no formal education, middle educational attainment = elementary one (1) to six (6) and high formal attainment = from class one and above.\n\nEmpowerment: Batliwala, (1994) defined empowerment as control over material assets, intellectual resources and ideology. Empowerment is also seen as a process involving not just women, but men, society and the state, and requires a change of attitudes and behaviour of both men and women. It is a process of creating conditions under which women can meet their daily needs and become actively involved in defining and promoting their own social, political and economic projects (IPPFAR 1996). It is the ability to act on knowledge acquired through family planning programmes without restriction, and is encouraged through improvement in literacy level, finance and political policies and programmes, which should insist on family planning services as a basic right. \n\nMaternal Mortality Ratio: is the rate of the number of maternal deaths per 100,000. Maternal mortality ratio in sub-Saharan Africa rose by 15% from an average of 870/100,000 live births in 1990 to 1000/100,000 live births in 2000 (Pooda, 2005). In Nigeria the ratio is 800 maternal deaths to 100,000 live births.   \n\nMaternal mortality: Also known as maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and size of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management including incidental causes but not accidental causes (WHO, 2005).                                             \n\nIncidental causes of maternal mortality: include deaths due to violence against women that may be related to the pregnancy and be affected by the socio-economic and cultural environment, such as wife beating, rape, STDs, other harmful traditional practices such as food allocation, widowhood practices, adult circumcision, etc which are legitimized and perpetuated by beliefs, norms and other social institutions.\n\nPolygyny: is the marriage of one man to more than one wife at the same time. This occurs sometimes through outright marriage of more than one wife, widow inheritance, or levirate marriage . Though no more strictly institutionalized in the study area, its effects still linger such as the issue of concubineship which is not really frowned at.\n\nContraceptives: devices used to prevent fertilization of an egg such as barriers (e.g condom, etc.) hormonal (such as removable implants, etc.), intrauterine devices, chemical barriers (such as spermicides) vaccines, etc.\n\nPopulation policy: this refers to a programme or a set of programmes of action that seeks to contribute to national development and welfare goals through measures that are directly or indirectly aimed to influence fertility control and well being of women.\n\nReproductive Health: it is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes (IPPF, 1996). The reproductive health status of the study area will help explain the health status of Enugu state especially its rural areas and inform current decision making and planning strategies for the health sector.\n\nReproductive Health Care: a group of methods, techniques, and services that contribute to solving reproductive health problems. It also includes sexual health, the purpose of which is the enhancement of life and personal relations and not merely counseling and care related to reproductive and sexually transmitted diseases (IPPF, 1996). \n\nSexuality Communication: refers to the discussions on sex issues such as on menstruation, free period, child spacing, initiating sex, number of children to have, use of contraception such as condom, sterilization, etc infections, etc by couples. Sexuality communication is high when partners discuss freely on sex, sexual activities, etc, it is middle when one of the partners can freely initiate the discussion and the other will not feel offended but finds it difficult to contribute to the discussion, while it is low when it is not allowed at all.\n\nSuppository: also known as spermicidal vaginal tablets, is a small dissolvable medicated solid: a medicated mass that melts at body temperature, designed to be inserted into the rectum, vagina or urethra 10 to 15 minutes before intercourse in order to melt and disperse the spermicide (Birth Control, Microsoft 2009).\n\nLife time risk: it is the rate at which a female dies as a result of unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, complications from childbirth. The lifetime risk of a woman in a developing country dying in pregnancy related illness is 1 in 25 to 1 in 40 compared to 1 in 1000 or several thousand risks for women in developed world (Symke, 1991).\n\nA Nigerian woman’s lifetime risk of dying from pregnancy or childbirth is 1 in 13 (FMHN, 2005).\nSOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL DETERMINANTS OF USE OF FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES\n",

The administration of low interest rate which was intended to encourage investment was witnessed in the 1950s to mid 1960s.\n\nIn the third quarter (3/4) of 1986, Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) was introduced by the then head of state General (Rtd) Ibrahim Gbadamosi Badangida. This programme ushered in an era when fixed low interest rate was gradually replaced by a deregulated interest rate regime where rates were more influenced or determined by market forces. The policy shift de-emphasized direct investment stimulation through the low interest rates. The mobilized fund was intended for investment.\n\nIn Nigeria, the pursuit of the two interest rate regime provide a case study for Keynesian interest rate investment relationship and the McKinnon Shaw interest rate saving and investment hypothesis. Several reason have been given as to why people invest and save. Some of these reasons are; the direction of interest rate, the returns that is expected from such an investment, the interest accrues to savers and some other developmental reasons. It is obvious that the higher the rate of interest the lower the level of investment and also the lower the rate of interest, the higher the level investment.\n\nHowever, this work is also directed toward understanding the kind of relationship that exist between interest rate, savings and investment McKinnon and Shaw conclude that higher interest rate induce savings which can be utilized is investment therefore these two transmission channeled through which interest rate affect investment, the relate to interest rate as a cost of fund (capital).\n\nAlso, interest rate encourage financial savings, which can be invested (self-finance) or lent out to borrow as loan (external finance).\n\n1.2              STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\nThe upsurge in real interest rate observed worldwide in the early 1980’s raised a widespread concern about their possible detrimental economic effects. Numerous studies were carried out to measure the impact of high interest rates on key economic variables such as growth of output, investment factor productivity and relative factor returns in response to these concerns. An empirical regularity observed in several cross-country studies e.g. World Bank (1989) and Galbis in 1992 that countries with high real interest rate generally intended to exhibit faster output growth but not higher investment, encourage a more efficient allocation of resources which raises overall productivity such that the nit impact on growth is positive while other studies e.g. (Khatkate 1998) have questioned the empirical robustness of these findings. A basic lesson from this literature skill hold namely higher interest rate on investment and growth mainly depends on what has caused interest rate rise in the first place.\n\nIn Nigeria case, in 1986, interest rate was extensively prior to the adoption to SAP. The economic rational behind this extensive control of interest rate and other elements of financial market have been motivated by a variety of factors including the desire to influence the flow of credit to preferred sectors of the economy and the concern that market determined interest rate could result in a serious imperfection in lending rate that would increase the rate cost of capital and thereby discourage investment.\n\nMoreover, such high normal investment rate would also increase the cost of servicing the public debt. Thus, interest rate policy should be used to increase the availability of credit in order to encourage the accumulation of domestic financial assets by offering holders of these asset sufficiently attractive rates. The deregulation of interest rate during the SAP period seems to be justified by this consideration.\n\nThe market determined interest rate is meant to mobilize financial savings and for efficient channeling of such savings into productive investment. This deregulation which resulted to concurrent increase in interest rate and savings seem to lay credence to McKinnon and Shaw interest rate, saving and investment hypothesis. What happened to saving mobilized during this period is the key issue, which is the focus of the study. The study will try to find out the following.\n\ni.                    Whether the savings generated during this period was transformed into real investment.\n\nii.                  What is the relationship between interest rate, savings and investment in Nigeria?\n\n1.3              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of the study involves the following:\n\ni.                    To appraise the performance of interest rate policy in Nigeria in directly stimulating investment on one hand and mobilizing financial solving on the other hand by constructing an analytical model explaining the relationship between interest rate, savings and investment.\n\nii.                  To compare the effect of interest rate on savings and investment in an era of strict interest rate administration and that of a liberalized interest rate regime – specially the project will try to evaluate which of the two approaches by the interest rate influences investment is more appropriate to Nigeria\n\niii.                To investigate using econometric analysis (technique) whether there is an autonomous component in the investment pattern in Nigeria.\n\n1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\nFollowing the downtime in Nigeria fortune arising from the collapse of world oil price in the early 80’s, the economy has continued to wallow in uncertainties, manifesting in several macroeconomic dislocation and internal and external disequilibrium.\n\nThis include price instability, high rate of unemployment balance of payment problems, debt crisis, political instability capital fight, low capacity utilization, low savings, investment and income, downward trend in economic activities and lately, economic depression. Several solution have been proffered to solve these multifarious problems both by individual(s) and institutions prominent in the later category is the Breton-Wood twice (IMF and World Bank) whose support and influences fed to the adoption of Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) by the administration in 1986. The programme was to effectively after and restructure the consumption and production pattern in Nigeria economy as well as to eliminate price distortions and heavy producers goods. SAP is a programme which combine a nexus of measure to promote economic efficiency and long term growth with stabilization policies designed to restore balance of payment equilibrium and price stability. The overall aim is to totally revering the Nigeria economic (Anyanwu 1983). The fulcrum upon which the two key macroeconomic variable (Savings and Investment rest is interest-rate). Appropriate interest rate is the “sine qua-non” for saving mobilization and transformation of such saving into profitable investment. Thus, this study will be significant to policy makers to make appropriate policy which will go along way toward alleviating investment problems and bring about the desired improvement in the nation’s economy since developing economy like Nigeria which is bedeviled by need to determine the appropriate policy mix to achieve stability.\n\n1.5              STATE OF HYPOTHESIS\n\nIn conjunction with the objective state above. The following hypothesis will be tested to determine the veracity of theories involved.\n\ni.                    Total financial savings has significant and negative relationship with the level of investment.\n\nii.                  Total financial saving has significant and direct relationship with normal saving rate.\n\niii.                Total financial saving has a significant and positive relationship with the level of investment.\n\niv.                Savings rates also depends on interest rate in Nigeria\n\nv.                  Inflation has an inverse relationship to both savings and investment.\n\n1.6              RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nEfforts will be intensifies toward reading textbook periodicals, seminar paper and some economic journals in order to obtain require facts. Secondary data provide by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) will be used for regression analysis on the relevant using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method. The main benefit of the above methodology is that bias from personal feeling is much reduced then would be found in primary data collection.\n\nThere can be comparism as they are historically analysed based on past experience. Besides those who write the periodicals and paper are authorized in their area of specialization, this, what they say can be considered reliable. In the same vein, simple regression analysis will be used to measure the co-variance between interest-rate, savings and investment the main disadvantage is that not all the required information can be provided by the date available for the other weakness is that some of the data may not be up-to=date, but may be the only available ones at the period of study.\n\n1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\n1.7.1        The meaning of interest rate\n\nThe rate of interest is the reward of parting with liquidity for a special period. It is the inverse proportion between a sum of money and what can be obtained for parting with control overtime the money in exchange for a dust for a state period of time.\n\nIn this sense, it is seen as a measure of the unwillingness of those who passes money to part with their liquid control over it. It is the “prince” which equilibrate the desire to hold wealth in the form of cash with the available quarterly of cash in the price for credit (J.C. Anyanwu 1995).\n\n1.      Minimum Discount Rate\n\nThis refers to the amount that is charged by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for lending to banks in the performances of its function of a lender of last resort. Minimum rediscount rate also refers to charge by the Central Bank of Nigeria to the discounting bills before maturity.\n\n2.      Savings Deposit Rate\n\nThis rate is the amount paid by banks for funds with withdrawal after seven day notice. Thus, restriction is however soldomly applied.\n\n3.      Fixed Deposit Rate\n\nThis is the rate paid when deposits are fixed for a period of time say 90 or 180 days.\n\n4.      Prime Lending Rate\n\nThis is the interest rate applied to loans made to customers with the higher credit rating for each bank, the rate should also represent the minimum rate.\n\n5.      Maximum Lending Rate\n\nThis refers to amount charged by banks for lending to customers with low credit rating.\n\n6.      Inter Bank Interest Rate\n\nThis is the rate that applied to transaction between banks mostly for over-night and short terms funds.\n\n7.      Cost of Fund\n\nThis refers to net expense incurred in raising borrowed fund including a reasonable profit margin. The expenses include the interest on deposits, reserve requirement and other administrative expenses as a proportion of total funds borrowed\n\n8.      Treasury Bill Rate\n\nThis is the rate paid to holders to federal government of Nigeria treasury bills issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). These bills have a maturity period of 90 days as opposed to treasury certificates, which matures between one to three years.\n\n9.      Rate of Return on Investment\n\nThis refers to the interest payable to holders of government stocks, industrial stocks and equities (CBN).\n\n1.7.2        What is interest rate policy\n\nWe can define interest rate policy as one of the subset of policy measures enshrined in the general set of monetary policy of the Central Bank.\n\ni.

It is made up of convertible currencies that are generally accepted for the settlement of international trade and other external obligation. Just like every other commodity, a market is established which works more like any other market having a supply curve, a demand curve and an equilibrium price and quantity. There are also conditions which are held constant (creteris paribus). When these conditions change, the curve shift and there is a change in the equilibrium price quantity. This market for currencies is known as the foreign exchange market.\n\n            The foreign exchange market according to the central bank of Nigeria is the medium of interaction between the sellers and buyers of foreign exchange a bid to negotiate a mutually acceptable price for the settlement of international transactions. The sellers of foreign exchange constitutes the supply while the buyers of foreign exchange constitutes its demand. The supply of foreign exchange is derived from oil exports, non-oil export, expenditure of foreign tourist in Nigeria, capital repatriation by Nigerians resident abroad etc.\n\n            The demand for foreign exchange on the other hand consist of payments for imports, fianacial commitments to international organizations, external debt service obligations etc.\n\n            Before 1958, when the central bank  was established and the enactment of the exchange control act of 1962, foreign exchange was earned by the private sectors and held in balances abroad by commercial banks which acted as agents for local exporters. Another feature of this period was that agriculture exports contributed the bulk of foreign exchange receipts. The fact that the British pound sterling was at par with the Nigerian pound sterling with easy convertibility delayed the establishment of an active foreign exchange market.\n\n            However by 1958, when the central bank was established and subsequent centralization of foreign exchange authority. In banks,  the need for a local foreign exchange market because paramount. Other factors that led to the evolution of the foreign exchange market in Nigeria include:\n\nThe changing pattern of international trade institutional changes in the economy. structural shift in production, etc.\n\n            By the early 1970’s, the official exchange receipt was enhanced following the sharp rise in prices and demand for crude oil exports which had by now displaced agricultural exports. The foreign exchange market experienced a boom during this period and there became a need for the management of foreign exchange resources. However, it was not until 1982 that comprehensive exchange controls were applied.\n\n            The exchange control system failed to evolve an appropriate mechanism for foreign exchange allocation. This led to the development of a dual exchange rate system, comprising of the first and second tier foreign exchange market which was adopted in September 1986. The first tier was managed while the second tier was subjected to market forces. Not only has there been a metamorphosis of the institutional frame work from second tier foreign exchange market (SFEM) to foreign exchange market (FEM) to inter bank foreign exchange market (IFEM) to Autonomous Foreign Exchange market (AFEM) etc, there have been frequent changes in operational guidelines and procedures. Various pricing methods, marginal and weighted average exchange rates determinations and the Dutch Auction System (DAS) among other have also been adopted .\n\n            All those aimed at ensuring more efficient allocation and utilization of scarce foreign exchange resources, to enhance the flow of capital into the country, stimulates domestic industrial production, promote export, increase revenue to the government, help reschedule our foreign debt at more profitable terms etc.\n\n            When there are fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, various economic activities are usually affected such as the purchasing power, balance of payment, prices of goods and services, import structure, export earning, government revenue, external reserves among others.\n\n            These prevailing instability in exchange rates and its effects on various economic variables, will be the areas of concentration of the research work.\n\n1.2.                                    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nSince September 1986, when the market determined exchange rate system was introduced via the second tier foreign exchange market, the naira exchange rate has exhibited the features of continuous depreciation and instability.\n\n            This instability and continued depreciation of the naira in the foreign exchange market has resulted in declines in the standard of living of the populace, increased cost of production which also leads to cost push inflation. It has also tended to undermine the international competitiveness of non-oil exports and make planning and projections difficult at both micro and macro levels of the economy. A good number of small and medium scale enterprises have been strangled out as a result of low dollar/ naira exchange rate and so many other problems resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates can also be identified.\n\n            This movement of the exchange rate along the path of depreciation since 1986 has raised a lot of questions on the impact of exchange rate policies on the Nigerian economy.\n\n            It is therefore the goal of this study to identify thses problems and make recommendations which will help reverse this prevailing trend.\n\n1.3              OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nIn a highly import dependent economy like Nigeria, the naira exchange rate has become one of the most widely discussed topic in the country today. This is not surprising as this topic has had a lot of macroeconomic impact on the Nigeria economy.\n\nIt is therefore the objectives of this study to:\n\n-          Evaluate the effect of exchange rate fluctuation and management on various sectors of the Nigerian economy.\n\n-          Identify those economic variable mostly affected by exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n-          Identify the strengths and weakness of various exchange rate policies.\n\nIn the light of its findings, make certain recommendations which will be helpful in management, restructuring ensuring stability and appreciation in the naira exchange rate\n\n1.4              FORMULATION OF HYPOTHESIS\n\nFor meaningful findings, conclusions and recommendations, a set of testable hypothesis based on available data will be necessary. In the course of this research work, the following hypothesis would be tested.\n\nHYPOTHESIS 1\n\nHo: The continued fluctuation in the exchange rate of the naira has not reduced the purchasing power of the average Nigerian.\n\nHi: Exchange rate fluctuations have no effect on Nigeria economy.\n\nHi: It has fluctuations in exchange rate has significant effect on the purchasing power of the average Nigerian.\n\nHYPOTHESIS 2\n\nHo: The fall in the naira exchange rate has not affected the importation of goods\n\nHi: The fall in the exchange rate has significant effect on importation.\n\nHo: Exchange rate fluctuations have no effect on importation of goods in Nigeria economy.\n\nHi: It has exchange rate fluctuation have no effect on importation of goods in Nigeria economy.\n\n1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study would identify the strengths and weakness of exchange rate policy and management, identify those economic variables that are mostly affected by instability in exchange rate and provide the general public with the awareness on the foreign exchange transaction and its impact on the economy.\n\nThe various findings of this would enable the government and financial authorizes to device, modify and adopt a better foreign exchange transaction for the economy.\n\n1.6              DEFINITION OF TERMS :\n\n1.      Foreign Exchange\n\nForeign exchange is a means of payment for international transactions. It is made up of currencies of other countries that are freely acceptable in settling international transactions.\n\n2.       Foreign exchange market :\n\nThis is a medium  of interaction among  buyers and sellers of foreign- exchange with a view of negotiating acceptable prices for settling international transaction.\n\n3.      Exchange rate – This is the price of one currency in terms of another\n\n4.      SEMI- Second tier foreign exchange market. Under this system the exchange rate is largely determined by market forces.\n\n5.      AFEM – Autonomous foreign exchange market. This exchange rate under this system  are being determined essentially through market forces.\n\n6.      IFEM – Inter bank foreign exchange market.\n\n7.      Dutch auction system (DAS) – this is a method of exchange rate determination through action where the bidders pay last bid rate that clears the market.\n\n8.      Dual exchange rate regime- This situation exist when two exchange rates are in existence in an economy.\n\n9.      Marginal pricing method: This is the method in which bid rates are arranged in a descending order of magnitude . the last bid rate at which available foreign exchange is exhausted (marginal rate) is the applicable exchange rate.\n\n10.  Exchange control – This is a foreign exchange arrangement in which the government purchase all incoming foreign exchange and is the only source from which foreign exchange can be purchased legally.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE",

To a great extent, the positive relationship between capital accumulation and real economic growth has long been affirmed in economic theories (Anyanwu, 1996). Success in capital accumulation and mobilization for development varies among nations, but it is largely dependent on domestic savings and inflows of foreign capital. Therefore, to arrest the menace of the current economic downturn, effort must be geared towards effective resource mobilization. It is in realization of this that consideration is given to measure for the development of capital market as an institution for the mobilization of finance from the surplus sectors to the deficit sectors.\nThe development of capital market in Nigeria, as in other developing countries, has been induced and fostered by the government. Though, prior to the establishment of stock market in Nigeria, there existed some less formal market arrangements for the operation of capital market. It was not  prominent until the visit of Mr. J. B. Lobynesion in 1959, on the invitation of the Federal government, to advice on the role the Central Bank could play in the development of local money and capital market. As a follow-up to this, the government commissioned and a set up the Barback Committee to study and make recommendations on the ways and means of establishing a stock market in Nigeria as a formal capital market. Acting on the recommendation of the committee, the Lagos Stock Exchange (as it was called then) was set-up in March 1960, and in September 1961, it was incorporated under Section 2 cap 37, through the collaborative effort of Central Bank of Nigeria, the Business Community and Industrial Development Bank.\n\nWith the establishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria in 1959 and the coming into existence of the Lagos Stock Exchange in 1961 and Subsequently, the Nigeria Stock Exchange by an Act in 1979, a sound foundation was laid for the operation of the Nigerian Capital Market for trading in securities of long term nature needed for the financing of the industrial sector and the economy at large. After the incorporation of the Lagos Stock Exchange, it was granted further protection under the law and its activities was placed under some sort of control by the government, hence the passing of the Lagos Stock Exchange Act. However, the Lagos Stock Exchange was only operational in Lagos. By the mid 70’s, the need for an efficient financial system for the whole nation was emphasized, and a review by the government of the operations of the Lagos Stock Exchange market was advocated. The review was carried out to take care of the low capital formation, the huge amount of currency in circulation whichwere held outside the banking system, the unsatisfactory demarcation between the operation of Commercial Banks and the emerging class of the Merchant Banks, and the extremely shallow depth of the capital market.\n\nIn response to the problems mentioned above, the government accepted the principle of decentralization but opted for a National Stock Exchange, which will have branches in different parts of the country. On December 2nd 1977, the memorandum and article of association creating the Lagos Stock Exchange was transformed into the Nigerian Stock Exchange, with branches in Lagos, Kaduna,Port-Harcourt and now in Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja some other cities. The history of Nigeria Capital Market could be traced to 1946 when the British colonial administration floated a N600,000 local loan stock bearing interest at 3¼% for the financing of developmental projects under the Ten-Years Plan Local Ordinance. The loan stock, which had a maturity of 10-15 years, was oversubscribed by more than N1 million, yet local participation of the issued was terribly poor.\n\nUndoubtedly, potential invisible funds abound in Nigeria, but the overriding consideration in this project will be to examine the role of the capital market in harnessing and mobilizing these resources (invisible funds) to generate economic growth in the country and consequently, economic development.\n\n1.2     Statement of the Problem\n\nThere is abundant evidence that most Nigerian businesses lack long-term capital. The business sector has depended mainly on short-term financing such as overdrafts to finance even long-term capital. Based on the maturity matching concept, such financing is risky. All such firms need to raise an appropriate mix of short- and long-term capital (Demirguc-Kunt and Levine 1996).\n\nMost recent literatures on the Nigeria capital market have recognised the tremendous performance the market has recorded in recent times. However, the vital role of the capital market in economic growth and development has not been empirically investigated thereby creating a research gap in this area. This study is undertaken to examine the contribution of the capital market in the Nigerian economic growth and development. Aside the social and institutional factors inhibiting the process of economic development in Nigeria, the bottleneck created by the dearth of finance to the economy constitutes a major setback to its development. As a result, it is necessary to evaluate the Nigerian capital market.\n\n1.3     Objectives of the Study\n\nThe broad objective of this study is to examine the activities and performance of Nigerian capital market. The specific objectives of the study are as follows:\n\n\n1.       To evaluate the performance of the capital market in relation to the\n\neconomic growth in Nigeria;\n2.       To examine the operations of the Nigerian capital market;\n3.       To examine the rate at which new stocks are issued on the capital\n\nmarket.\n\n4.       To make recommendations as to how the operations of the market\n\ncould be improve to boost economic growth and development of Nigeria.\n\n1.4     Research Questions\n\nThis research shall be guided by the following research questions:\n1.       How does the capital market impact on the economic growth and\n\ndevelopment process in Nigeria?\n2.       What is the trend of trading activities on the Capital Market?\n3.       What is rate at which new stocks are issued on the Nigerian capital\n\nmarket?\n4.       How could the capital market through its crucial role stimulate\n\neconomic growth in Nigeria?\n\n1.5     Research of Hypothesis\n\nThe hypothesis that would be tested in the course of this research is stated below as:\nH0:  That the capital market operations have not contributed to Nigerian\n\neconomic growth.\n\nH0: That the capital market operations have contributed to Nigerian\n\neconomic growth.\n\n1.6     Scope of the Study\n\nThe economy is a large component with lot of diverse and sometimes complex parts; this research work will only look at a particular part of the economy (the financial sector). This work will not cover all the facets that make up the financial sector, but shall focus only on the capital market and its activities as it impacts on the Nigerian economic growth. The empirical investigation of the impact of the capital market on the economic growth in Nigeria shall be restricted to the period between 1986 and 2011 due to the non-availability of some important data.\n\n1.7     Significance of the Study\n\nThe study will explore the impact or effectiveness of capital market instruments on Nigerian economic growth. Though the scope of study will be limited to the capital market, it is hoped that the exploration of this market will provide a broad view of the operations of the capital market. It will contribute to existing literature on the subject matter by investigating empirically the role, which the capital market plays in the economic growth and development of the country. The main importance of this study is that it will provide policy recommendations to policy-makers on ways to improve operations and activities of the capital market.\nTHE IMPACT OF THE CAPITAL MARKET ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA",

Sellers in the commodity market labour market and capital market kept increasing there prices for some economic and other reasons, in the commodity market producer or sellers complain of increasing cost, employees in the labour market form union and fight for increased wages to enable them meet up with the high cost of living and depreciation in the purchasing power of money, while suppliers of land and capital increase there rents and interest with excuse of rising cost of funds.\n\n            One ultimate effect is that prices continue to go up from time, if this increase in prices where gradual may be one or two percent per year, people can easily adjust without much complaint. But when prices are rising generally at very fast rate people become very worried and that is when the effect of rising prices becomes of significance to the economy and however lead to a situation known as inflation in view of their devastating effect of inflation in Nigerian economy, this project work will in chapters that follows carry one a “statistical analysis on inflationary trend in Nigeria from the period of 2001 to 2010\n\n1.2                BACGRUOND OF STUDY\n\nAccording to oxford advance learners dictionary inflation is a general rise in the prices of goods and services in a particular country resulting in a fall in the value of money  Webster new English collage dictionary defines inflation as “an increase in volume of money and credit relative to available goods and services resulting to substantial and continuing rise in general price levels.\n\n            Solow (1979) sees inflation as going on when one needs more and more money to buy some representative bundle of goods and services or a sustained fall in purchasing power of money steady persistent rise in prices caused by too much money chasing too few goods. It is a state of conflict and disequilibrium in which a given community is struggling to acquire more goods and services that are available.\n\nTo illustrate the meaning of inflation the more consider the diagram.\n\n                                                                                                                                    B\n\n                                                                                                                                    A\n\nFrom the diagram above it can be observed that N1000 is originally chasing 200 units of goods and services and the price is established at say A on the price line, the supply while goods and services merely increased by four times to 800 units if the community competes for these limited goods and services there will be excess demand over supply at current price A, the result to too much money chasing too few goods it will be that price will steadily rise to B and may continue to rise if left unchecked by the community.\n\n1.3                STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nIn recent past there has been alarming increase on the rate of inflation imposing on adverse effect on saving and investment, it has also affected the living standard of Nigerians mostly affected the are the public servants whose incomes are relatively fixed, considering utilization where many industries in Nigeria produce below full capacity because of high cost of raw material, machines, distorting our trade relations with other countries across the border and responsible for constant industrial unrest since with persistent increase in prices, unions like labour and trade union continues to agitate for higher wages\n\n            This however poses a great effect on the performance of various sector of our economy and analysts are not left out in this situation of examining the rate of inflation in our economy in the world.\n\n            In view of the difficulties created by inflation in Nigeria, the problem of this research work becomes to investigate the trend of quarterly inflationary rate in Nigeria for the periods in view as well as ascertain whether there is seasonal variation in the inflationary rate for those periods and if the yearly inflationary rate depend on some quarters of the year in focus.\n\n            Another problem of these research survey is to examine how inflationary rate in this period are affected by unpredicted external factors as well as cyclical fluctuation in the trend of inflationary rate and also examine the root causes of inflation in the country and the control measures taken by government, whether  it has yielded any significant result against this devastating problem of inflation which has eaten deep into our economy\n\n1.4                 AIMS AND OBJECTVES OF THE STUDY\n\nBased on the increasing problems created by inflation in the Nigerians economy which has led to the devaluation of our money where large amount of money is found chasing few goods, leading to loss of confidence in our money.\n\n            The statistical analysis on inflationary rate in Nigeria is aimed at achieving the following objectives\n\n(1.)                To ascertain whether there is a quarterly increase in trend of inflationary rate in Nigeria from 2001 – 2010 and make forecast for its future occurrence.\n\n(2.)              To investigate if there is any seasonal variation in the quarterly inflation rate in Nigeria for the period in view.\n\n(3.)              To estimate the cyclical and irregular variation in inflationary rate in Nigeria for the period in view for effective prediction.\n\n(4.)              To determine the undependability or otherwise of inflationary rate in some quarters of the year.\n\n(5.)              Do identify factors that are responsible for the rate of inflation in Nigeria and if there is any positive effect of inflation in our economy\n\n(6.)              To X- ray the corrective measures taken against inflation rate in Nigeria if it has yielded any significant result.\n\n(7.)              Finally to make necessary recommendations based on inference drawn from the findings towards fighting the ugly trend of inflation in our society.\n\n1.5                SIGNIFCAINCE OF THE STUDY\n\nIn view of the objectives which this study has set to achieve in the analysis of inflationary rate in Nigeria, it is necessary at this point to reveal the contributions and importance of the study to the federal state and local government and general public at large. Therefore the study will be great significance in the following ways.\n\n(1.)      If the inflationary rate in the economy of Nigeria is found to be on increase it will enable the federal government to fight inflation through introducing contractional monetary and fiscal policies.\n\n(2.)     Secondly the study will enable the federal government to implement policies and programs like price control measure and rationing of available products in those quarters of the year, where there is more influence of inflation, if it is found out that there will be or there is a strong seasonal variation and if also that the yearly inflationary rate depends on some quarters/period of the year from the analysis carried on the period of the years under review.\n\n(3.)    The knowledge of the causes of inflation rate in our economy will go to long way in reducing the problems through applying some corrective measure to stop these causes.\n\n(4.)     Generally the study will assist decision makers in the country to realize the importance of keeping data up to date and the usefulness of statistics and statistician in providing analytical devices in various economic planning and national development.\n\n1.6                THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe statistical analysis of inflationary rate in Nigeria economy however covers a wide scope which involves several statistical tools as could be possible, but the researcher has narrowed down the study to cover two statistical tools of time series analysis and chi-square X2 test of independence so as to meet up with the requirement of the study over a period of ten(10) financial year from (2001 – 2010) has been chosen so that the quarters of the years could be properly taken\n\n care of , which makes the series of (4 x 10) = 40 quarters which is a researchable scope.\n\n1.7                 THE SATAEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS\n\nHo: there is no significant increase in the trend of inflation rate of Nigeria from (2001 -2010)\n\nHi: there is significant increase in the trend of inflation rate of Nigeria from (2001 -2010)\n\nHo: there is no significant seasonal variation in inflationary rate of Nigeria from 2001- 2010\n\nHi: there is significant seasonal variation in inflationary rate of Nigeria from 2001 -2010\n\nHo: yearly inflationary rate is independent of variation of the quarters of the years from 2001 -2010\n\nHi: yearly inflationary rate is not independent of the quarters of the year from 2001 – 2010\n\n1.8                DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\n(1.)

This phenomenon has attracted the concern of economists, the government both at the federal and state levels because of its attendant’s problems such problems associated with rural-urban migration on the rural areas include decline in agricultural production, migration decline, rural poverty, rural depopulation, demographic consequences etc. it is against this background that the researcher has made conscious effor56t to examine the socio-economic impact of the rural urban migration on ora village. The study has carried out using 100 questionnaires administered to the indigenes of that village, and moreover 10 indigenes were interviewed personally. The analysis of the data shows that many reasons are responsible for the rural urban migration in ora village. Prominent among these reasons is the issues of lack of employment opportunities. As a result of the above, it is recommended that an integrated rural development planning should be vigorously pursued by the government. If all the recommendations were to be adopted by the government, it will minimize the mass movement of rural dwellers to urban cities.   \nTABLE OF CONTENT\nChapter One  \nBackground of the study\nStatement of the problem\nObjective of the study\nHypothesis of the study\nLimitation/scope of the study\nDefinition of terms\nChapter Two\nLiterature review\nDefinition of migration\nTypes of migration\nCauses of rural-urban migration\nSocio-economic effect of rural-urban migration of the rural area.\nChapter Three           \nMethodology\nIntroduction\nResearch design\nSampling techniques/instrument used/data collection\nValidation of instrument/method of data analysis\nChapter Four\nData analysis\nIntroduction\nAnalysis of data collection\nPersonal interview\nFindings\nChapter Five  \nSummary, Recommendations\nAreas of further research\nConclusion\nReferences     \nQuestionnaire           \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n\n            There have been rapid increase of youths movements from rural area to urban centres, no one is in doubt today of the fact the rate at which people (especially, the youths) move from rural area to urban centres is affecting the lives of the rural dwellers. Nigeria is a developing country; in fact, she is at the threshold of being a developed nation. On this note it is wise to be acquainted with the meaning of the world “migration”.\n\n            Migration according to Udo (1980) defined migration as the permanent or semi-permanent change in residence from one administrative unit (district, country, province, state or country) to another. And it is usually considered to be an economic man’s reaction to socio-economic differentials between regions. Migration has become an important factor influencing population dynamics in a geographical area. Fertility and mortality determines the rate of natural population increase in any locality. The overall size of the population such an area depend on the pattern of migration. Population movements are often responsible for observable sudden changes in population size in many locality. It is however, pertinent to note that migration is an instrument to the solution of many social and economic problems. As a socio-economic act, migration may not be of interest in itself other than in the result of its effect, but it does often gives rise to problems as well as providing solutions.\n\n            My people from rural area have been moving to urban centres. Rural urban has attracted many people simply because of white collar jobs, education, change of environment, climate or whether condition etc. the rural urban migration in ora clan can be seen as a spontaneous human effort to achieve balance between population and resources. It is natural phenomenon which produces demographic social and economic interaction that reduces some of the irregularities of nature i.e. people wants to move from a place where there are no socio amenities (rural), to where there are socio amenities (cities). According to Lawai (1983). The implications of this movement is that while most of our urban centres suffers from over population of people and activities, rural areas are often under populated. There are two factors responsible for this movement from rural area to urban centres. These are the “push” and the “pull” factors.\n\nPush factors: This factor causes the forwards movement of people from rural to urban centres. While the pull factor, it directed or draw people towards itself e.g. education, white collar job and among others. The most affected people in this rural urban migration are the educated youths who are unable to obtain a suitable job in a rural area.\n\n            Rural-urban migration has a dual impact on the individual as well as the community either directly or indirectly. It is through the contribution of successful migrants that most important projects in ora clan have been made possible. This fact can be buttressed by the financial support given to gigantic project like the building of community school and village town hall in ora. It is against this introductory background of the study that the researcher has intended to examine how rural-urban migration has affected the socio-economic development of rural settlement with particular reference to oral clan in Owan West Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\n1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS    \n\nSince 1960 there has been massive movement of people from rural areas to urban centres. This project was meant to find out the socio-economic impacts of rural-urban migration. Prothero (1965) recognizes four of rural urban migration which are the daily movement, seasonal migration, short-term or periodic movements, definitive or long term movements.\n\nRural-Urban Migration has become too rampant on the rural areas especially the study area (ora clan), in Owan West Local Government Area of Edo State. And they migrate without considering the socio-economic impact of this movement on their parents and the community in general.\n\n            Perhaps this movement may be as a result of lack of social amenities in the rural areas, searching for white collar jobs, for education purposes, climate condition among others. This is what the researcher will find out in this project. But finance and time has been the major constraints to the realization of this research work.   \n\n1.3              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nIn view of the above stated problems, the study therefore seeks to:\n\ni.                    Identify the causes of migration from ora village to urban centres and enumerate the rationale behind such movements.\n\nii.                  Examine the negative and positive of socio-economic impacts of rural urban migration.\n\niii.                Suggest possible remedies to check such influx of people from rural areas to urban centres form sound national planning and developmental purpose.\n\n1.4              RESEARCH QUESTIONS \n\nSince research preposition are meant to test the validity of assumption, the following questions are stated for the purpose of this study.\n\na.                   Why rural urban migration has greater influence on the life of rural dwellers.\n\nb.                  Did rural-urban migration occurs because of lack of employment opportunities in the rural areas\n\nc.                   Why did the rural-urban dwellers migrate to urban centres?\n\nd.                  What is the socio-economic impact of migrating from rural area to urban centres?   \n\n1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n-          The study when successfully completed will be of value to the educational planners.\n\n-          The study will be of importance to researchers/students working on related topics.\n\n-          The study will reveal the reasons why people migrate from rural area to urban centres.\n\n-          The study will also be an addition to previous work on the topic. Thus, an addition to knowledge.  \n\n1.6              DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nMigration: This means the movement of people from one place to another. Teriba (1982) sees migration as the movement of people from one civil division to another. \n\nSettlement: This is a place where people live.\n\nEmigration: It is the movement of people out of a country.\n\nImmigration: This is the movement of people into country.\n\nNet migration: The difference between the number of immigration and emigrants.\n\nImmigrant: These are people that move into a country.\n\nEmigrants: These are people that engage in the movement out of a country.\nTHE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT OF RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION ON THE RURAL AREAS\n",

The distribution of the wealth is also more equalitarian because the system does not discriminate between investors and the rate of return. What each investor gets out of the system is a matter of what he invests.\nThe capital market is the segment of the financial market where medium to long term financial instrument are created and/or traded to meet the long term funding needs of economic activities. The degree of effectiveness and efficiency of the market will determine the extent to which it will contribute to the process of economic growth and development. Adedipe (2004)\nThe capital market can also be defined as the aggregation of institutions and mechanisms through which long term funds are mobilized and used for development purposes (Obadan 1998)\nThe capital market, given the long term horizon and liquidity offered by its secondary market, provides the best framework for the mobilization of resources – G. Onosode (1998)\nAccording to K.S. Adeyemi (1998), the capital market is the aspect of the financial system which mobilizes and channels long term funds for economic development. \n“The capital market provides another option for government and companies to raise long term funds for the execution of capital projects such as construction of bridges, schools, factories, and purchase of vehicles, facilities, and equipment. This compares with the money market, which represents the short- end of the financial system that provides facilities for claims and obligations whose maturity vary from one day to one year.” (Okereke- Onyuike 2000).\nNdanusa, S.A (2004), defined capital market as the collection of financial institutions set up for the mobilization of medium or long term loans. It is a market for long term instrument which include; market of mortgages of loan that is the market for mobilization and utilization of long- term loans. It is a market for long term funds for development.\nOsondu(1993) within the capital market are the primary and secondary market which includes issuing houses and the securities authorities for issuing of corporate bonds, shares and market of mortgage, this concern and its activities regulations rest in the hand of the stock exchange.\nHence, capital market could be referred to as the mechanism whereby economic units desire to invest their surplus funds, interact directly through financial intermediaries with those who wish to procure funds for their business through the issuance or sale of shares stocks, bonds e.t.c Uzoagu (2002)   .\nIn the Nigeria context, participants includes; the Nigerian stock exchange, discount houses, development banks, investment banks, stock broking firms, quoted companies, the government, individuals and the Nigeria Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Nigerian stock Exchange operates and manages the activities of the capital market.\nThe capital market embraces trading in both new issues (primary) and old issues of stocks (secondary). \nEffective development of the capital market is necessary for the following reasons.\n\n    The mobilization of savings from surplus economic units for channeling into national economic growth;\n    The broadening of the ownership base of assets and, this, the creation of a healthy private sector through the empowerment of asset ownership.\n    The promotion of rapid capital formation and real investment culture as against short term portfolio investments.\n\n        The economic theory ‘growth’ is essentially a long term concept. It ignores short-term fluctuation in actual national income and emphasizes the impact of investment on raising expected income. Investment in the long run creates more and better capital equipment. The addition to the economy’s stock of capital raises the potentials of national income. The long-term increases in the growth theory rather than the short term fluctuations are found in Keynesian theory of income determination.\nKeynes (1978) said, from the earliest time- there was a very great change in the standard of life of the average person. This slow rate of progress or lack of progress was due to two reasons, the remarkable absence of important technical improvement and the failure of capital accumulation.\nBaran (1978) observed that the principle obstacles to rapid economic growth in the backward countries are the way in which their potential economic surplus is utilized.\nFrom the above elucidation, it could be seen that the capital market is paramount for economic growth in any economy.\n\n2.1.1   Brief history of Nigerian stock market \nThe Nigerian capital market (NCM) first came into existence in 1960 though it was then the Lagos Stock Exchange. It began operations in 1961 with 19 securities listed for trading. It had an authorized share capital of 10,000 Naira of 500 shares at 20 Naira each. The exchange was incorporated under the company ordinance as an associated company limited by guarantee and formed to promote commerce in Nigeria. The Lagos Stock Exchange was given initial financial backing by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\nIn December 1997, following the recommendation of the government financial system review committee of 1976 headed by Pius Okigbo, the Lagos Stock Exchange was renounced and reconstructed into the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\nTHE IMPACT OF STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE ON THE ECONOMY OF NIGERIA\n",

The banking sector is the engine of any nation's economy. The economic status of any nation depends on how stable their banking industry is. In other words, any issue that affects banks also has an impact on the economy of the nation (Kanu, 2016). In Nigeria, commercial banks have been the custodians of government funds. The banking system in Nigeria has experienced several reforms and policies, some favourable, others unfavourable. Many banks did not survive these reforms. Until the introduction of TSA, government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA’s) operated a multiplicity of accounts in the commercial banks. The MDA’s use part of the funds they generated to fund their operation and remitted the residual to the federation account. This resulted in leakages, embezzlement of funds and inadequate budgetary and financial planning. However the highest beneficiaries of this situation where the banks who relied on deposits from government agencies and lent back to the government at high interest rates. The banks however, operated “arm chair banking” as they no longer mobilized funds from other sectors of the economy. In light of these, the federal government directed all MDA’s to close their accounts with commercial banks and transfer the balances into the federation account with the Central Bank of Nigeria which was conveyed in a CBN circular no BPS/CSO/CON/DIR/01/079; dated, February 25, 2015 and addressed to all Deposit Money Banks (DMB). The circular was titled “Commencement of Federal Government’s Independent Revenue Collection Scheme under the Single Treasury Account (TSA) Initiative”. The TSA is a Unified structure of government bank accounts enabling consolidation and optimal utilization of government cash resources. Through this bank account or set of linked bank accounts, the government transacts all its receipts and payments and gets a consolidated view of its cash position at any given time (Yusuf, 2016). Prior to the introduction to TSA, Nigeria had fragmented banking arrangement for revenue and payment transactions. These were more than 10,000 bank accounts in multiple banks which made it impossible to establish government consolidated cash position at any point in time. It led to pockets of idle cash balances held in MDA’s account when government was out borrowing money (Obinna, 2015). (Yusuf, 2016) added that “the maintenance of Treasury Single Account will help ensure proper cash management by eliminating idle funds usually left with different commercial banks and in a way enhance reconciliation of revenue collection and payment. It is to this regards that the study wishes to consider the impact of treasury single account on the performance using Zenith bank as a case study\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nA great challenge facing most parts of the world and, particularly, the developing countries like Nigeria is how to achieve efficient allocation of resources as well as stabilization of the business cycles. An important factor for efficient management and control of government’s cash resources is a unified structure of government banking. Such unified banking arrangements should be designed to minimize the cost of government borrowing and maximize the opportunity cost of cash resources. This requires that cash received is available for carrying out government’s expenditure programmes and making payments in a timely manner. Many emerging markets and low-income countries have fragmented systems for handling government receipts and payments. In these countries, the ministry of finance/treasury lacks a unified view and centralised control over government’s cash resources. As a result, this cash lies idle for extended periods in numerous bank accounts held by spending agencies while the government continues to borrow to execute its budget. It is based on these reasons that the current global revolution in government accounting became paramount following which Nigeria has initiated and implemented the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and other series of economic policies to assist in the better management of her economy.\n\n1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n\nThe main aim of the research work is to determine the impact of treasury single account on the performance of commercial banks in Nigeria; other specific aims of the research work are stated below as follows:\n\n1.

It was originally used to indicate the process of training or coordinating sporting activities. Later its application was extended to the operations of government and businesses.\n\nAkpala (2001) describes management as the process of combining and utilizing organization's inputs (men, materials, money and' machine) by the mix of planning, organizing, directing and controlling activities for the purpose of producing outputs (usually goods and services), desired by the customers, so that the organization’s objectives are accomplished. In the definition given above, it is worthy of inference that control is an essential tool of management. The term control was rightly described by Lucey (1990) as “a systematic effort by business management to compare performance with predetermined standards, plans or objectives to ensure that performance is in line with standard and also to take remedial action required so that human and other corporate resources are employed in the most efficient and profitable manner.\n\nControl system is very essential in any organization be it a private or a public establishment/sector in order to check how effective and efficient they are in maximizing the use of resources. One of the measures commonly used to minimize wastage and guide plans to their eventual accomplishment is Internal Auditing.\n\nEmbezzlement, misappropriations, fraud and wastage of resources have been the characteristics of government ministries and public enterprises. Based on the literatures and daily experiences, one could conclude that there is a fairly unanimous feeling of dissatisfaction with the performance of most Nigerian public enterprises to date.\n\nInternal auditing has been defined by Adelaja (2000) as \"an independent appraisal of activity within an organization for the review of operations as a service to management. It is a form of a managerial control which functions by measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of other controls\". This project seeks to find out if the internal audit department exists in these enterprises and if it does, in what way has it contributed to the efficient management of such enterprise. It is not possible to sample all the public enterprises in Nigeria therefore the main focus of this project is on the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), Lagos branch.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nOgunjimi (2001) while writing on accountability in the Nigerian publicenterprise observed that in the course of government’s involvement in the economic and social aspects of the 'nation’s development; public enterprises now play a vital role in the development process and since these public enterprises handle high proportion of government fund, proper account of stewardship are needed. It is also important to note that established controls to ensure proper accounts of operation have been grossly abused by lack of accountability and stories of woe on the performance of such enterprises. Despite the controls installed, irregularities, embezzlement, misappropriation of public funds, fraud and gross wastage of resources-are still the order of the day in the public enterprises.\n\nThe internal audit department exists so as to reduce organizations’excesses such as financial mismanagement and lack of proper accountability to the barest minimum even if it cannot be completely eliminated. Internal audit which is supposed to serve as a control tool sometimes becomes ineffective due to some inbuilt factors that impair its independence and thus hinder its efficiency.\n\n1.3   STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE\n\nThe purpose of this project is to critically evaluate internal audit as a control tool for efficient management in Nigerian public enterprises using the Nigeria Television Authority, Lagos branch as a case study.\n\n1.4 STATEMENT OF RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nThe following questions are to be answered in the course of this study:\n\n(1)    What factors hinder internal audit efficiency in Nigerian public enterprises?\n\n(2)    Does good internal audit practice improve managerial performance in Nigerian public enterprises?\n\n(3)    Why have the established controls failed to enhance the managerial performance in the Nigerian public enterprise?\n\n1.5 STATEMENT OF THE HYPOTHESIS\n\nThe following are the statement of hypothesis to be utilized for the study and they include:\n\n(A)        Ho: Internal audit practice do not improve managerial    performance in Nigerian public enterprises.\n\nH1: Internal audit practice Improve managerial performance                  Nigerian public enterprises.\n\n(B)    Ho: There are no factors that hinder internal audit efficiency inNigerian public enterprises.\n\nH1:   There are factors that hinder internal audit efficiency in \nNigerian Public enterprises.\n\n(C) Ho: All established controls have not failed to enhance the              Managerial performance in the Nigerian public enterprises.\n\nH1:   All established controls have failed to enhance the managerial performance in the Nigerian public enterprises.\n\n1 .6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nGiven the necessary role that the internal audit department plays in public enterprises and the seeming ignorance of the employees as to their contribution to this department and to the efficient management of such enterprises, makes this study essential. It is therefore necessary to enquire into the relationship among the  internal audit department, employees and the management team as these three groups are supposed/expected to carry on activities directed towards the enhancement of the worth or value of their enterprise.\n\nThis study will also confirm or discredit the belief of some people that internal audit is not necessary in the public enterprise.\n\nAlso, this study will make insight into the deficiencies in the current internal audit practices and will therefore be useful to those who are at the helm of affairs in the country.\n\nFinally, it is hoped that this study will serve as a launching pad for researchers who may like to carryout research on similar area of study.\n\n1.7 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThis is the case study of Nigeria television authority- Lagos; and as such the outcome of the study may not be of universal application. This enterprise has been chosen due to the prominent role which it is expected to play in the life of the average Nigerian. This study is expected to be constrained by time, money, non release of questionnaires and the respondent attitude to revealing vital information.\n\n1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nA. CONTROL: This is the ability influence others in order to achieve a common purpose.\n\nB. INTERNAL AUDIT: This is a review of operations and records, sometimes continuous, undertaken within a business by specially assigned staff.\n\nC.

Hotel business is a potential foreign exchange earner if well harnessed in respect of these the Enugu state government in their quest to reap the fruit of the hotel business summoned for the establishment of fire star hotels; first of its kind east of the Niger, on the 6th day of February 1988, Nike Lake Resort Hotel was formally commissioned as five star hotel by the then chief of general staff and minister of defense lt. General Sani Abacha.\n\n            Nike lake resort hotel limited belong to the hotel sector in the state economy which witnessed on uproar of problems since its establishment as a result of the poor condition of the  economy, neglect by the government, insufficient power supply and employment discrimination.\n\n            These problems mentioned are not only facing Nike Lake Resort Hotel alone but does parade as a syndrome to the other entire fire star hotel.  They encounter the greatest form of instability both in structure and in output. This goes along to explain the unsteady setting and management of hotel industry.\n\n            The effects of may hotels and cut-throat competition in the hotel industry have equally called for various strategies to be used by the hotel involved, such as heavy promotional effort in form of advertisement and publicity etc.\n\n            Dwindling and deteriorating economy in Enugu has drastically reduced per capital income of an average Nigerian, leading to their concentration on basic necessities of life, such as food, shelter and clothing.  If one looks closer at some of these hotel industries, one may discover that some of the strategies are wholesome and helpful to marketing bodies of these hotels, while some are inefficient and run counter to the appeals and objectives of the industry.  An example of an inefficient strategy as regards promotion is where a half-nude girl is shown on the television screen attending to customers in the hotel.  The objective may be to attract the attention of the target market, though very discouraging especially in the Christian faith.\n\n            A fire star hotel is vital in every society because it helps for rapid development in technology and social fields.\n\n            Nike lake resort hotel happens to be the best leader in the hotel industries in Enugu, although the compare enjoy, leadership position, its life is not altogether easy. Some hotels keep challenging its strength while other hotels try to take advantage of its weakness.\n\n            Since the conception Nike lake resort hotel, it ensures to attain the motives of its establishment and also emulate the activities of other fire star hotels because marketing is a delicate port of the business that has to be planned very well and implemented so as to achieve organizational goal and to make sure that customers are satisfied with the product or service rendered by the business organization.  In other words, hotel business deals with customer satisfaction before its organizational goal can be achieved. Hotel business will have to be marketing oriented and customers satisfaction should be the topmost priority of the hotel.\n\n            In view of the importance of hotel in the provision of the economy and the needs to better the services in the hotel, the researcher takes a critical look at the problems and prospects of fire star hotel in Enugu metropolis with special interest on Nike Lake resort hotel Enugu.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nSome barriers prompt this research:\n\ni.                    Nike lake resort hotel was met with serious competition after its conception as regards to the other fire star hotels that entered the market\n\nii.                  Nike lake resort encountered poor condition of economy, neglect by the government, insufficient power supply, employment discrimination and instability in output.\n\niii.                More so, Nigeria is currently experience economic depression, high inflation and complete devaluation of its currency.\n\nThese bad situation have adverse affected the target market, thus hotels are seen as luxuries.  Nike lake resort hotel Inspite of the economic instability should strive to meet the demand of the customer, though while they are on this situation will as well encounter several problems this study attempts to make recommendations, statement of problems and corrections of the problems and corrections of the problem confronted during the research.\n\nOBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n            The objectives of the study are to evaluate the past and present marketing problems and prospects in the hotel services.\n\nNike lake resort hotel and from the analysis determine the following.\n\ni.

To examine if the quality of services provided by Nike lake will lead to a bright future for the hotel.\n\nvi.                And also to find out it the promotional strategies used by Nike lake leads to increase to customer awareness.\n\nFORMULATION OF HYPOTHESIS\n\nThe promotional strategies used by Nike lake resort hotel in Enugu do not lead to increase in customer’s awareness.  The promotional strategies used by Nike lake resort hotel Enugu lead to increase in customer’s awareness.\n\n2.

The scope of this study is very wide if it has to be carried out in all the fire star hotels in Nigeria due to time and other circumstance beyond the researcher.  The research work is limited only at Enugu metropolis.  And the research is concentrated more on Nike lake resort hotel.\n\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nThis means that some terms which feature in this work required some explanations.\n\n1.

Hence, it is not surprise that accountants have always been involved in many information related problems.  The need for this involvement is underscored by the avowed aim of accounting which according to the American association committee to prepare A statement of basic accounting theory (SOBAT, 1961).\n\n          SOBAT, (19610, described Accounting as the provision of relevant economic information to permit informed judgment and decision by users of the information.\n\n          The attainment of this objective, necessarily, requires both the identification as well as the disclosure of adequate amount of information considered relevant by the users.\n\n          Financial accounting covers those activities related to the preparation of certain reports which are known as financial statements.  These statements report the financial status of the firm at a particular time the firms activities and resulting profits and losses during the most recent period, and the flow of resources occurring within the firm during the same period.\n\n          Information, according to Reece, (1975) is a fact, datum, observation, perception or any other thing that adds to knowledge.\n\n          According to Joan, (1978), information is the information is the life wire of any organization.  He further said that the success of any organization whether profit or non-profit oriented depends particularly on how the information needs of the different levels of management are met.\n\n          Information can either be quantitative or non quantitative and out of many quantitative information, accounting is one.  It is distinguished from other types of information because it is usually expressed in monetary terms, though non-monetary information are also often contained in accounting reports in order to enhance the understanding of the manager.\n\n          Joan, (1978) affirmed that accounting information serves various uses; these users have different decisions to make and consequently, their information often differ.\n\n          In order that accounting information may be most useful, it is adapted to the particular needs of users.\n\n-Shareholders and investors whose main concern is with the value of the capital investment and expected dividend.\n\n-Management whose planning, controlling and decision making functions would be highly ineffective without quality information.  Financial reports are also an indication of management efficiency.\n\n-Creditors and potential creditors such as bankers bondholders, suppliers of goods and services they deduce from accounting information, the profitability and financial soundness of the business to enable them decide whether to expand or decrease financial commitment in the business.\n\n-Government, in order to calculate the company’s tax liabilities, regulates rules and evolve policies through the use of accounting information.\n\nEmployees who seek assurance of steady employer to ensure how frequently they would participate in company’s bonus, profit sharing and pension plans.\n\nMay, 1980, described that decision making is the process of choosing from among alternative courses of actions, conclusion and so forth, according to some criterion or criteria adopted by decision-making is the prime job of managers.  And for as long as men have been striving together to accomplish tasks of making decisions about scare resources in uncertain situations, management has been practiced, and information has been necked.\n\n          Making sound decisions is clearly an extremely important management function since they provide a basis for policy formulation and effect both the short and long term effectiveness of an organization.\n\n          Typically, a wide range of possible solutions and decisions can be found, and one of the managers key roles is to weight up these alternative opportunities and select.  This is as result of the fact that he often has to make decision within the frame-work of his resources, directives from his superiors and the time scale available.  Therefore, to make sound decision depends, in the first place, on the manager having a clear picture of what he is trying to achieve or what the problem entails.\n\n          To emphasize the importance of accounting information to the business management has only been made possible by accounting information.  Inevitably, business is financially oriented; it a process of using money to make money.  No management can escape having to pay out money for materials and services so as to be able to collect money in due course from the sale of its own products or services.  No management can avoid the necessity if it is to stay in business, for making a profit through an excess money income over money outgo.  And no management can succeed in doing this without accounting information for use in planning and control.\n\n          Historically, Nigerian Breweries Plc which was established in 1946 at Lagos.

Financial accounting then can be said to be a systematic gathering, identifying, summarizing and reporting of business transactions in monetary terms such that it provides information which permits informed judgment by the users of such information.\n\nInformation: These can be said to be facts needed or received by a person, or group of persons which is or will be useful to them.\n\nManagement: Management can be defined as the rational selection of courses of action to optimize the inter-relationship of a material and money for the survival and growth of the organization. It can also be regarded as the process of getting things done through people.\n\nDecision-Making: Decision making can be defined as identifying alternatives, evaluating such alternatives and choosing from such alternatives. Decision making can be viewed as the very fabric of which organized activity is made.\n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1            BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThe attainment of this objective necessarily requires both the identification as well as the disclosure of an adequate amount of information considered relevant by the users.\n\n          Financial accounting information therefore, is the information derived from the financial accounting report. The essence of this information is for management and other users to make decisions. Therefore, the accuracy of decision making depends on the effective and efficient design of management information system.\n\n          The accounting concerned prepares the financial accounting information in such a way that will enable users to derive maximum information for their use.\n\n          Decision making itself can be described as the art or science of choosing among possible managerial actions. The art or science of decision making enable management of a business to choose from among a range of already analysed and evaluated alternative.\n\n          Two classes of decision makers can be identified in respect of the use of financial accounting information. These are the external users and the internal users. Management represents and the internal users include creditiors, shareholders, government agencies, trade unions e.t.c. Managers are the major users of financial accounting information need this information to plan.\n\n          The impact of financial accounting information on the management of any business cannot be overlooked, though the extent of such..\n\n1.2            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nManagers of certain businesses do not have sound accounting systems to enable them monitor operating expenses and revenues. They do not need the warings communicated by financial accounting information. This ignorance or lack of financial accounting information, may lead to the non-effective and inefficient accomplishment of the firm’s objectives.\n\nIt is only through accounting information that managers and external users get a picture of the organization as a total entity. Managers who fail to realize this do not appreciate an accountants analysis in respect of financial accounting information generated. This may lead to poor decisions being taken and it may affect the profitability and performance of the organization.\n\nSome organizations, due to low financial layout or lack of adequate planning or ignorance may not employ expert hands needed and this causes the effect and importance of financial accounting information on decisions taken not to be noticed or gained by the organization.\n\nThe researchers in this study will seek to show the information management can derive from financial accounting and their usefulness for decision making in business.\n\n1.3            OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of study are as follows:\n\n1.                 To ascertain of there is any relationship between effective use of financial accounting information and the decisions made in an organization.\n\n2.

To determine factors that may constrain or promote the effective use of financial accounting information.\n\n4.                 To make recommendations which may enhance the employment of information provided by accounting system.\n\nImpact may not be the same for every business. This study will seek to inquire into how monetary and financial information arranged in a professional accounting manner will influence managerial decision.\n\n1.4            SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis work would be of immense benefit to the following groups.\n\n1.                 Financial analysts.\n\n2.                 Economic researchers and students\n\n3.                 Investors and shareholders\n\n4.                 Creditors\n\n5.                 Labour unions and the general public.\n\nThe major contributions of this work are:\n\n1.                 To the management of companies as a tool for evaluating their performance and knowing whether they really take note of financial accounting information.\n\n2.

They are often used interchangeably, they are professioner terms used to describe the aspect of marketing function which deals with information, persuading and reminding the target audience about a firm’s product offering. Thus promotion, comprises advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, publicity, public relation and direct marketing.    \n\n            It should be noted that promotion is one of the promotion tools of marketing that move a product or service or idea in a channel of distribution to the target market. Such promotion tool is the pates promotion which stimulates or arouse the interest of the consumer to buy. The Nigeria bottling company (NBC) producer of soft drink uses sales promotion tools which comprises the consumer promotion, dealers, and sales force promotion. The company capilizes on more of consumer promotion, in this we have the sampling and demonstrations, sweepstake and others tools etc.\n\n            According to Philip Kotler in (2003:609) in marketing management defines sales promotion as a key ingredient in marketing campaigns, consists of a diverse collection of incentive tools, mostly short term, designed to stimulate quicker or greater purchase of particular products or services by consumers or the trade.    \n\n            According to the American Marketing Association defined sales promotion as activities other than personal selling, advertising designed to stimulates sales dealer effectiveness which may take the form of displays demonstrations, show and exhibition and various non-recurrent effort not in the ordinary routine. It is used between producers and consumers to stimulate demand.\n\n            Sales promotion is short term investment of value offered to arouse interest along the marketing route in buying goods and services. It may emulate from the dealers to retailers and down to consumers, the occurs during period of stiff competition or during deedline in sales so as to boast short term sales. Sales promotion is a persuasive activity and could be either directed to the consumers of channel of distribution.    \n\n1.1              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThe Nigeria Bottling company (NBC) is an off short of coca-cola international which started in 1886 in Affanta Georgian in the United State of America. The Nigeria bottling company NBC has faced with production constraint which had been confronting its production plant in Wari Detta state. This is due to the inefficiency of the plants used on its peretimum. It has also been seen that some of its mechanics used has been antiquated which led to inefficiency of production its processes.   \n\nAccording to the plant engineer, Y. A. Kareem he said that this would soon be overcome. He was speaking agent the background of the recent communicating of the plants additional line 11 which was moved from former Warri plant and the linkage of the plant to the Asa dam. Likewise, the new washer meant for line 1 is expected to be in place by August – end he said.\n\nThis, he said would give a big boast to the plants production operation.\n\nThe Nigeria Bottling company started its operation in Nigeria in 1953 by holding franshize for coca-cola international. This means that the formulate for concentrate and receipt of the production has not been realized to the Nigeria bottling company but the formular and syrup of the mixture has been give to them to help to them bottle their product in Nigeria.\n\n1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nSince sales promotion is a very vital tool of advertising of a firms offerings. Thee are many factors that hinder the efficiency of sales promotional activities. These include the internal and external factors.\n\nIn the case of the internal factors, these are the strength and weaknesses of the organisation in which it has encountered. In this, there has been an inefficiency of production which has affected the sales of their product and the impact of sales promotion in the marketing of sold drink in Warri Delta state.\n\nIn the case of the external factors, the Nigeria bottling company (NBC) Warri Delta state is faced with competition from various other manufacture of simulo soft drinks which each striving to have the greatest market share. This factors (external) are threats and opportunities to the company. When the JUP bottling company first introduced its 35cl in the soft drink industry, coca cola company almost driven out of the industry by overtaken its market share. This occurred in 1999. What coca cola did was to introduce 35cl in its offering, this was how the coca cola bottling company was able to vetain its position in the industry. Giving that period a lot of advertising was done in order to re-shape its position in the soft drink product industry.\n\nThe reason of this was that the company (NBC) was not able to keep abreast of its changing or dynamic environment. That is why as a marketer you have to keep cognizance of your external environment so that your competitor will not overtake you.\n\nLastly, there is a reported language barrier of effective communication which may in turn lead to reduction in profit. Some of these barriers to effective communication are:\n\n1)      Linguistic problems and\n\n2)      Cultural difference which affects its operation in the marketing of consumer products and also, the issue of rapid sales promotion which eventually reduces the companys image, because consumers may begin to perceive discounts and other price deals as a reduction in product quality which makes it difficult for firm (NBC) to seal its products without sales production.\n\n1.3              OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nIt is a matter of truth that no study goes without an objective. In view therefore, this study will not be an exception to the Nigeria Bottling company NBC Warri Delta state. It is in the height of the above that the researcher emaciate the following objectives enumerated below:-\n\n1)                  To ascertain the effectiveness of sales promotion.\n\n2)                  To stimulate the minds of the consumers\n\n3)                  To know the impact of sales promotion\n\n4)                  To introduce new product\n\n5)                  To increase impulse buying\n\n6)                  To encourage consumption during off –season\n\n7)                  To build trials among non –users.\n\n8)                  To attract switchers way from competitors products          \n\n9)                  To encourage purchasing of large size unit.\n\n10)              To turn consumer into loyal brand users.\n\n1.4              HYPOTHESES FORMULATED\n\n1.

Therefore, education enhances manpower development by improving the number and quality of human resource. \nBareday in Afonja (2003) says that education is truly a mirror of the level of development and the aspiration of any people. \nEducation in general and functional literacy programmes in particular are means of advancing people in terms of giving them knowledge, skills attitudes necessary for expanding their potentials. \nAkinpelu (2002) is the view that education programmes are organized for learners who have pre-occupation or jobs other than studying. Further words education is associated with vocational occupation or professional stills of development. \nFunctional literacy is one step further from elementary literacy. \nIt refers to the ability to use the stills of reading writing and computing in the acquisition of such information as would make the individual function more actively and beneficially in the economics, social, political psychological and cultural activities of the community whether or she lives. Essentially, for any adults to participate in any functional literacy programme there must be need for it. Need and motivation are two important things that guide the adult participants in functional literacy progrmmes. Literacy is seen as a tool for developing skill, knowledge and attitudes for the daily survival of human persons. Therefore, literacy is an educational process which aims at in calculating in the individuals the ability to read and write and to carry out basic calculations.  \nLiteracy could be seen as the ability to function better in one's social context. Thus, literacy is aimed at enhancing one's understanding of the society in which one is required to assume a functional role. \nUNESCO (2011) defined it as the ability to identify. Understand, interpreted create, communicate, compute and use printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continue of learning by individuals to achieve their goals to develop their knowledge and potential and to participate fully in their community and wider society. \nOduaran (1991) defined functional literacy as one step further up from elementary literacy. It refers aptly to the ability to sue the skills of reading, writing and computing that would benefit the individual. \nBeder (1990) and Thompson (1992) identified self improvement, family responsibilities, job participation, advancement, urging by other people, social expectations and relationships, escape from bore dome and stimulation and cognitive interest as a basic motivation. \nNeeds attract the attach adults to take part in functional literacy programmes and \nFive Categories.\n\n    Psychological\n    Safety, stability and security\n    Belongingness (social affiliation love)\n    Self esteem\n    Self - actualization\n\nThe above hierarchy of needs make us understand why adult learners participate in functional literacy programs. For instance an adult learner who lacks social and economic rewards tend to participate in functional literacy programems so as to improve these needs he years to have and for growth and development of self. \nThe tension and problems learners encounter in his environment or working place will motivate him to learn more so as to find a solution to the tension and problems. He participates in functional literacy programmes so as to improve safety, security for himself, whether in his job or environment.\nThe learning needs of adult learners vary according to their social roe. Adults who newly arrive at working age will be obsessed with learning how to make a living, a woman with young learning how to make a living; a woman with young children will be interested in domestic matters and in the children's education. So also a member of a church choir will be interested in learning music better.  \nThe individual as an adult learner has a need that is sometimes termed self-fulfillment or self actualization. Some adult learners may wish to develop skills in their work which will enable them excel or in other skills from which they may derive satisfaction and recognition such as in sports or in domestic practice like sewing or cooking. Some may wish to enhance their social standing cultivate new social relationships and feel the need for learning how to achieve such needs. \nThere are some adult learners which may have last on educational opportunities in the past may feel incomplete as persons unless they fill what they see as gaps in their knowledge and education.  \nThe behavior of adult learners is a given environment is aimed at fulfilling basic want or needs which vary at a given time.  The need to improve on one's job, further knowledge or education, to improve social status, for socialization, mental improvement psychological capability, political orientation, religious improvement, awareness etc will motivate adult learners to participate in functional literacy programmes. The adult learners to participate in functional literacy programs. The adult learners can be a spouse, parents, works, young adults etc. if these needs that motivate them to participate in functional literacy programmes are met, they can be satisfied in the aspect of growth and development for themselves and the society in which they live. \nThe attitude of the adult educator can also motivate adult learners to enroll in functional literacy programmes. \nAvailability of the facilities in the environment where it is located can also encourage earners to participate in literacy programs. Because adult learners are motivated by what they see, how they are treated thereby causing growth and development. \nStatement of the Problem \nThere has been a rapid increase in the participation of adult learners in functional literacy programmes in recent years. This is evident in the high rate of adult learner's enrolment in functional literacy programmes in Benin metropolis taking advantage of centres offering such programmes. Inspite of the various tasks which adult learners who participate addles with, they still avail themselves with these learning and activities or opportunities what then could be the motivating factors. To what extent do these factors serve as determinants of adult learner's participation in functional literacy programmes? \nThe focus of this study is to determine the factors which motivate adult learner's participation in functional literacy programmes in Benin metropolis. \nResearch Questions\n\n    What are adult learner's objectives in participating in functional literacy programmes?\n    To what extent does adult learner's social interaction or relationship influence their participation in functional literacy programmes?\n    To what extent do adult learners psychological characteristics serve as determinants of adult learner's participation in functional literacy programmes?\n    Do responsibility and personal life factors motivate adult learner's participation in functional literacy programmes?\n    To what extent do adult learners economic reasons influence their participation in literacy programmes?\n\nPurpose of Study \nThis study seeks to find out the factors motivating adult learner's participation in functional literacy programmes in Benin metropolis. It is to seek the factors enhancing or propelling adult learners to take part in functional literacy programmes. \nFactors like physiological and basic human factors or needs motivate the adult learners to take part. They take part to seek improvement for what they feel is not fully actualized, until it is fully actualized. The need will continue to bother the adult learners. \nThe study is to know these needs or drives so that the adult educator can be well equipped and prepared on how to teach the adult learners. Cope with them and any situation they might have and to motivate and help them find solutions to those problems. Thereby bringing about growth, change in behavior of the learners and the society to which they belong. \nAssumptions \nThe following assumptions were made in the study;\n\n    If adults learners needs like physiological needs are not met. It can greatly affect their participation in adult learning.\n    If adult educators who understand these needs of adult learners are not available, it will greatly affect the learners.\n    If programmes designed are not fully exposed to adult learners, they will greatly affect their participation.\n    If the learning environment is not harmonious and peaceful, it will have negative effects on the adult learners.\n    The methodological issues if not carried out properly. It can affect adult learner's participation in functional literacy programmes negatively.\n\nSignificance of the Study \nThe study's findings is to help policy makers both public and private institutions in providing appropriate functional literacy programmes for adult learners to enable them keep a breast of social, economic political, psychological and educational changes. \nIt is the adult educator's missions in helping adult learners learn what will gratify their needs at whatever level they may be struggling. Therefore, if adults are hungry, they should be helped to learn what will give them food, if they are well-fed, safe, loved and esteemed, they must be helped to explore undeveloped capabilities and become fully equipped. \nTherefore, the federal government of Nigeria realizing that the only way to transform every area in the country into an advance state and to eradicate literacy, empower citizens is to direct its policy towards equal and adequate educational opportunities for all citizens by creating literacy centres that will promote functional literacy programmes for growth and development. \nIt is therefore very important to determine the factors that motivate adult learners to participate in functional literacy programmes.\n\nScope of Study\nThe study is limited to the geographical area of Benin metropolis. It covers specifically adult learners of some selected functional literacy centers who participate in functional literacy programmes. \nDefinition of Terms \nFor the purpose of this study the key concepts used are defined below!\n\n    Adult learners: Mature individuals who participate in a learning situation that will bring about changes.\n    Education: A process of teaching, training and learning made to improve on knowledge, behavior and to develop skills\n    Literacy: It is an instrument for acquiring relevant knowledge and skills required for development, literacy is the ability to read and understand a simple text, and to use and transmit written information of everyday life.  It is an activity embedded in social and cultural practices.\n    Functional literacy: The ability to use the skills of reading, writing computing in the acquisition of basic information for development. Also, the use of adult education to acquire knowledge and skills to meet individual's needs and foster national development.\n    Motivation: It is the management function that stimulates individuals to accomplish set down instructional or organization goals. It is an intrinsic drive towards the fulfillment of personal needs and the improvement of one's perceived status, it is influenced strongly by extrinsic factors.\n    Literacy programmes: It refers to the programmes designed to enhance the skills, and development. It is also a systematic planned activities intended to equip and individual participants to become skillful in the ability to read, write and compute to an appreciable level.\n\nLearning situation. Adult educators should endeavour to translate both the basic human needs and educational needs into interest so as to motivate the adults into participating more in functional literacy programmes. \nKnowles, stress that the highest expression of the act of the adult educator is skills in helping adult learners to discover and become interested in meeting their needs. \nFreire (1991) is of the view that in knowing learners needs will enable them organize themselves, translate their needs into interest in order to improve on the aspirations of their potentials. \nIt should be noted that people differ I need the specific needs of the adults should be given in the area of content, methodology and evaluation. \nMotivation is a psychological concept which explains what exactly propels human beings to voluntarily undertake specific actions. Psychologists differ in their definition of motivation. They define it as drives, needs, incentives reinforcement, energizer, goal and expectancy. \nBarelson (2004) defined motivation as an inner state that energizes, activates, moves, directs or channel behavior to exert high level of efforts or channel behavior to exert high level of efforts towards some set goals conditioned by efforts, ability to satisfy some individual needs. \nMotivation determines largely when an adult learners want to learn and how much far he will not respond to any stimulus unless he is in a state of need and feels he can himself, by responding. \nAs a matter of fat, man's need must be motivated so that he can be satisfied with himself, his job and his environment he lives. \nMaslow and Murray two psychologists identified some basic human needs. \nMurray a cognitive theorist sees internal structure as the basis of human behavior. Thus when the brain is internally instigated, it organizes other psychological processes. \nHe classified motives into two major categories of primary needs and secondary needs. The primary needs in basic requirements for living / such as the need for intake of food, water, air, the need for excretion and exhalation and the need for withdrawal (for safety) when faced with anger. \nThe secondary needs include the desire to control and influence others, desire to admire some one else, need for independence and need to fight. He further theories that at a given time some needs. Remain until they are satisfied. Murray postulated that needs come to the fore ad expresses themselves with ore urgency than others. Murray was the first need theorist of motivation. \nMaslow in his principles of motivation has highlighted that human beings are active beings whose behaviours are agitated or propelled by some potent forces. \nHe calls the forces organismicaly based needs. He postulated that unsatisfied need creates tension within an organism thereby serving as a force to direct behavior towards reduction of the tension. \nMaslow's hierarchy of needs consists of need for foods, shelter, health, clothing, transportation education. They need for transformation of experiences and awareness of reality for adult learners and societal benefit. \nIn the area of economic and physical need. This motivate the learner to participate in any of the functional literacy programmes because it will provide the knowledge for their need to be solved. \nThe adult learners want to be economically balanced that is to upgrade their skills and employability gives the need for their participation in functional literacy. \nThey also participate to meet employment expectations. Adult learners are encouraged because they want to be more acceptable and also to guarantee solution for the quest for a change in job and to reduce poverty. In order words to meet their immediate needs. \nLearning on the part of adult learners is supplemental and secondary to their primary role in the society. As soon as they identify the needs, they strive towards its fulfillment. They participate due to political need. If ne is not wise politically, their rights and privileges might be trampled upon. \nThe need or the driving force towards their participation in functional literacy programmes. They want to be responsible citizens and live right. The need for mutual interpersonal relationship in a community motivates their participation so that there will be development and executive of policies for the community. \nThe motive of adult learner's participation functional literacy programmes is to bring about solution of their felt needs. Adult learners desire a need and they are interested in the programmes in order to develop in their lives. The comfortability of the venue can also motivate adult learner's participation in functional literacy programmes. \nThe adult learners are group of individuals that need to be gratified; the need can be socially, educational - economic political, psychological, physical needs and also technological needs. If these needs are met, they can function meaningfully in the society they belong.\nFACTORS MOTIVATING ADULT LEARNERS PARTICIPATION IN FUNCTIONAL LITERACY PROGRAMMES\n",

Time is the feature of all items making up working capital.\n\nWorking capital describes the assets and liabilities of a business that are related directly to its trading activities.  Some of them are held to enable the business to function, such as debtors and creditors.  They are the items in the balance sheet whole vale and nature change continuously, since they are turned over regularly in the course of normal trading.  Working capital liabilities are those for which the business is most immediately at risk, hence, they are normally termed current liabilities.  Working capital assets are those on which the business can call most easily: hence, they tend to be referred to as current assets.\n\nMany businessmen control their working capital very carefully, they are aware that however high national profit is, survival and real success depend on whether profit materializes into cash and whether that cash is available when the business needs it.  Controlling the working capital will be limited value unless it is exercised within a framework, which takes into account:\n\n1.      The assets required to achieve the objective of the business.\n\n2.      The way in which such assets are used.\n\n3.      The way in which the business chooses to finance its activities.\n\nWithout adequate cash, a business cannot exist.  For this simple reason cash is often described as the “Lifeblood of a business and its control the means of maintaining commercial health”.  Liquidity is a pre-requisite for commercial life and cash management is as natural as staying alive:  It is the Naira amount of a firm’s current assets including cash and short term investments, account receivable and inventories.  These assets are regarded as liquid because they can be converted to cash within one year.\n\nConsidering the diversity of the scope of operations among our millions, of business firms, the many varieties of their seasonal patterns, the varied influences of secular growth and decline, the diverse effects of cyclical developments in general business activities, the wide differences in the degrees of competition among firms and industries, and variations among firms in their access to new sources of cash, it is patently impossible to formular a set of asset management rules or policies that would be good for all businesses at all times.  Indeed a most reasonable conclusion is that asset management policies that are good for a given firm at a given time may be quite bad for another at that time, as well as for the firm itself at other times when surrounding circumstances have changed.\n\nManaging the firm’s net working capital position (that is, its liquidity) has been shown to involve simultaneous and interrelated decisions regarding investment in current assets and use of current liabilities.  Fortunately, a guiding principle exists that can be used as a benchmark for the firm’s working capital policies: The hedging principles, of principle of self-liquidating debt.  This principle provides a guide to the maintenance of a level of liquidity sufficient for the firm to meet its maturing obligations on time.\n\n1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThe management of the working capital of any organization is sensitive area of that organization and its growth and strength depends on it.\n\nIn this country, much is not being said about the working capital management of firms and because of this much is not known about the importance of the management of working capital of firms.\n\nThe problem of inadequate information about the working capital management shall be addressed in this work.\n\n1.3              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe aim of this work “Relevance of working capital management” is to:\n\n1.      Study the methods adopted by firms in the management of their working capital.\n\n2.      To verify whether there is conformity in the management of working capital from one firm to another (firms in the same line of production or business).\n\n3.      Determine the factors that have aided the firm in the course of having an efficient working capital management.\n\n4.      Arrive at a conclusion and make recommendation where necessary.\n\n1.4              SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study will cover the appraisal of the working capital management in an organization.  The standard requirement of working capital management shall be study.  The method applied by the firm in the management of its working capital shall also be looked into as well.  The main focus of this work will be to verify the approach of a firm in the management of their working capital.\n\nIn the course of this research work, the researcher carried out the study with limits imposed by practical considerations of the financial involvement and time constraints.  The non-availability of enough data also passed a hindrance to the researcher.  These constraints limited the researcher’s ability to have a more comprehensive research work.  Nevertheless the researcher had to rely on interviews and review of past work on certain areas.\n\n1.5              RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nIn order to achieve the objective of this work, the researcher uses the following questions for this project topic: “The Relevance of Working Capital Management in a Firm”.\n\n1.      How important is it to invest fund in current assets?\n\n2.      What amount should be invested in the different types of current assets?\n\n3.      Which appropriate sources of fund should be used to finance current assets?\n\n4.      How liquid should a firm be at any particular tie?\n\n5.      What should be the level of stock a firm should keep in order to continue in business?\n\n1.6              HYPOTHESIS\n\nThe hypothesis upon, which the study is based are:\n\nH0:       A firm’s working capital does not influence its prospects in business.\n\nH1:       A firm’s working capital influence’s its prospects in business.\n\nH0:       Inadequate funding by finance houses does not affect working capital.\n\nH1:       Inadequate funding by finance houses affects working capital.\n\nH0:       Excess level of stock does not tie down working capital.\n\nH1:       Excess level of stock ties down working capital.\n\nH0:       Stringent credit policy does not affect working capital.\n\nH1:       Stringent credit policy affects working capital.\n\n1.7              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis research work is significance for the fact that it tries to high-light the importance of working capital management in firms.\n\nIt is paramount to study working capital management, which had in the past been neglected and to know the extent of its impact on the firm’s services.\n\nIt is also important to study steps taken by the firm to see that they maintain a balance between liquidity and profitability in order to remain in business.\n\n1.8              DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nThe definitions that will be made here may not necessarily mean the general one used, the ones made here are relevant for this work.\n\nNet Working Capital: This is the different between current assets and current liabilities.\n\nPermanent Working Capital: It is the Naira amount of working capital that persists over time regardless of fluctuations in sales.\n\nTemporary Working Capital: It is the additional assets required to meet variations in sales above the permanent level.\n\nWorking Capital Loan: It is the temporary accommodation required by a firm in excess of sanctioned credit limit to meet information contingencies.\n\nGross Working Capital: This means the firm’s investment in current assets to convert sales into cash.\n\nHedging Principle: In involves matching the cash flow – generating characteristics of an asset with the maturity of the source of financing used to finance its acquisition.\n\nPerfect Hedge: It is the financing of temporary current stock with short-term sources of funds and fixed assets and permanent current asserts with long-term sources of funds.\n\nConservative Hedge: It is the financing of some temporary current assets with short-term sources of funds and financing the remaining assets are financial with long-term source of funds.\n\nAggressive Hedge: The financing of temporary current assets and some permanent assets with short-term sources of funds.\n\nWorking Capital Policy: It is the decisions regarding:\n\n(i)                 Target levels for each current asset account.\n\n(ii)               How current assets will be financed\n\nCash Conversion Cycle: It is the length of time from the payment for the purchase of raw materials to manufacture a product until the collection of the accounts receivable associated with the sale of the product.\n\nInventory Conversion Period: It is the average length of time required to convert materials into finished goods and then sell those goods, it is the amount of time the product remains in inventory in various stages of completion.\n\nNear-Cash Assets: They are such assets like marketable securities, which essentially serve the same purposes as cash; such assets are extremely liquid.\n\nCash: The funds a firm holds that can be use for immediate cash disbursement needs.\nTHE RELEVANCE OF WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN A FIRM\n",

(Aspinall, 1970:37).\n\nAccounting has one or more of the following objects\n\n1.         The maintenance of a classified records d cash debtors and other property, of creditors and of changes in them.\n\n2.         The maintenance of a record of transactions classified to show gains or losses resulting from the various activities.\n\n3.         The periodic preparation of statements summarizing the economic results of the activities and the financial position.\n\n4.         The use of such  statements, by the management of an Undertaking to assist them in the conduct f its business by the proprietors to assist them in assessing the efficiency of the management and in determing policy with regards to further Investment and the withdrawal  of profit, and by the government in determing tax liability.\n\nThe owners of any business naturally wishes to run their business as efficiently as possible in order to be able to do this, accounting  information is  kept.  These accounting information enable the owner of the business to make Comparisons of the amount of each cost and each expense, it also services as a guide to business and financial decisions.\n\n          Accountants are responsible for preparing financial accounting information.  Some of these accountant exercise their profession as the  employees of Commercial Industrial and public practice of accountancy.\n\n          The financial accounting Information prepared by accountants are of quantitative nature because it is usually expressed in monetary terms, through non monetary information are also often contained in accounting reports.\n\n          The method and I or procedure for preparing financial accounting information are based upon definite principle which are usually rules and Conventions which have been adopted as a general guide to action by accountancy profession.\n\n          These principles are formulated in such away that he practical details of accounting may differ from one Company to another.  However, in order to secure acceptance such an accounting principle must be useful in copying with a practical recording problems, it must be reasonably objectives that is provides a similar answer in the hands of qualifies practitioners, and it must be feasible and as such not expensive to apply.  These accounting principles are known as generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP).\n\n1.1    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nMost corporate organisations may have sound accounting system which enable them not only in their decision making but also in monitoring operating expenses rules on the information content of the financial statement is quite uncertain because they may be managing the business Intuitively.\n\nFinancial accounting information involves technicalities such as quantitative analysis, adequate recording reporting etc.  Some organisation may unknowingly employ Incompetent and unskilled manpower and as such the financial accounting information prepared may not show a true and fair view of the financial strength, profitability and future prospects of the organisation.\n\nSome organizations have to realise that accounting information is the only medium through which both the management and external users get a clear picture of an organization.  They fail to realised, appreciate an accountants analysis in respect of the accounting information generated, this often leads to poor management decisions which will have negative effects on the performance of organization.\n\n1.2       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe Core objectives of the study is to examine the extent of reliance on financial accounting information for effective business and financial decision in corporate organization in Nigerian and in First Bank of  Nigeria to be precise.\n\nMoreso, the research intends to accomplish the following objective:\n\n1.           To ascertain whether there is a direct relationship between the performance of first Bank of Nigerian and effective use of financial accounting information.\n\n2.

To analyse the impact of and roles of financial accounting in First Bank of Nigeria Plc.\n\n4.           To identify the factors which may constrain or promote the effective use of financial accounting information.\n\n1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nBusiness organization exists to provide goods and services and in return provide rewards to its  Owners. These two needs are linked to each other in the sense that profitable organizations are those that normally receives more resources from their customers in exchange of  goods and services.\n\nSome business organizations are non-profit oriented.  However, Irrespective of the types of organisation therefore always have accounting information regarding the value  /normally in monetary terms, of the resources used in generating the required product and / or services used in generating the required product and / or services on the one hand and on the other, a fairly accurate measurement of income or profit or value of benefits earned from the disposal of their products and or services.\n\nThe study provide insight into the nature and roles of financial accounting information, as well as management needs for accounting information which may be said to resolve around the purpose of planning and controlling the affairs of an organisation making policy decisions and making choices among a number alternative options under circumstance which may be unexpected.\n\nThis work will serve as a guide to others who may intend to undertake a review of the work or other related topics in the future.\n\n1.4       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n\nIn view of the native and extent of the problem outlined for this study, it was considered appropriately to have a sound basis for a research for this nature.\n\nThese are:\n\nHi:   Financial accounting information has contributed to \n         effective decision making in first banks of Nigeria Plc.\n\nHo:   Financial accounting information has not contributed \n         to effective decision making in the bank.\n\nHi:    The information content of annual financial Statement \n         of the bank is effective.\n\nHo:   The information content of annual statement in the \n          bank is not effective.\n\n1.5       DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nACCOUNTING: The provision of relevant economic information to permit informed Judgement and decisions by users of the information.\n\nACCOUNTANT:  A person whose profession is to keep and examine business accounts.\n\nACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS / CONCEPTS:  These are general guide to action by the accountancy profession.\n\nGENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP):  They are accounting principle that have been developed largely in accounting practice or have been established by an authoritative organisation.\n\nLIABILITIES:  Debts owned by a company e.g trade creditors.\n\nOWNER EQUITY;  That  shares of the business that owners own out – right.\n\nFINANCIAL ACCOUNTING INFORMATION:  These are information obtained as a result of systematic gathering, identifying, summarizing and reporting business transaction in monetary terms.\nTHE EXTENT OF RELIANCE ON FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL DECISION IN CORPORATE ORGANIZATION\n",

The apex financial institution (CBN) declared that interest rates payable on deposits or chargeable on loans and advances were henceforth to be determined by the interplay of the market forces of demand and supply.\n\n            Nigerians being what they are agitative and speculative went to town some decrying the policy as the last straw that would break the back of our fragile economy, others extolled the policy as the best and boldest steps ever taken towards the revamping of the ailing economy.  These divergent views of the financial experts both in the academic and in the Banking sector about the likely impact of the interest rate deregulation motivated me to appraise the impact of the deregulation on commercial banking operation.\n\n            Notable among those who bemoaned the deregulation of interest rate was Abiodum (1987).  According to him, Deregulation a fragile economy like ours will have the overall effect of dampening it since the high interest rate will cause slow down investment as borrowing will be curtailed.\n\n            But this view was opposed by Iklude (1987) 2.  he was of the view that “interest rate deregulation will not only bring relief to the financially repressed economy but will ensure a real return on deposit which has over the year been negative.             What these argument  boiled down to was that interest rate deregulation would lead to efficient allocation of financial market resources because interest rate will now reflect relative scarcity and relative efficiency in different uses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\n            According to Abraham Nwankwo (1987) 3 “Bigger banks will price small ones out at the market by lending cheep to customers and paying them interest rate on their deposits”.\n\n            It is in the light of the controversies that accompanied the interest rate deregulation that prompted the deregulation on commercial Bank lending operation.\n\n1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\n            Interest Rate deregulation, like other stringent economy measured by the present administration has far reaching consequences on the nation’s banking industry and on the borrowing public.\n\n            Commercial banks that had lent huge sums of money before the deregulation of interest rate were in stormy water making their customers repay their loans at the new rate.  The borrowing public complained that their banks had without prior notice unleashed high interest rate on them.  They were at daggers drawn as the measure created had blood between the banks and their customers.\n\n            The interest rate deregulation with its attendant high interest payable on loan and advances terribly limited the borrower’s  quest for loan/advances since  it was impossible for most of them to get inflationary adjusted rate of return on their borrowed fund-this has remained elusive for many  borrowers.\n\n            Inspite of the deregulation, customers complain that commercial Banks pay  very  little interest rate for example on savings and charge borrowers/customers more than twice what they pay them on their savings accounts.  This they complained was unfair as the return became negative when adjusted with the rate of inflation.\n\n            The general public also complained that banks (especially commercial and merchant Banks) have been posting huge profit after tax inspite of the bitting effect of the economy.  The bank’s credit ceiling was partly responsible for the state of the affairs, invoking economic Aloxim that the constant liquidity mop up on the banking sector by the apex  financial institution was also responsible saying, the more illiquid a bank is, the more profitable it becomes”.\n\n            A  performance appraisal  of the impact of the deregulation is long over due at least to  shade light on the above controversies surrounding the policy three years after its introduction, thereafter, the problems are hereunder stated in question as follows:\n\n(i)         Did commercial bank’s loans and advances deteriorate during the deregulation of interest rate?\n\n(ii)        Did  depositors react favourably by increasing the volume of their deposit after the deregulation?\n\n(iii)       How have commercial banks been surviving the directives of deregulating the interest rate in this sector of the economy?\n\n1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n            The study aims to determine and analyze the impact of interest rate deregulation in Nigeria specifically, the study seeks to answer  the following  questions:-\n\n1.         Whether the interest rate deregulation has affected the volume of commercial bank’s  lending over the years.\n\n2.         Are the effect  statically different according to the size of the banks?\n\n3.         The study will also find whether the interest rate paid to deposits mobilized by the commercial banks.\n\n4.         The study will also find  whether there were more loan losses (bad and doubtful debt) during the era of interest rate moderation than this period of deregulation .\n\n5.         The research is also aimed at  finding whether commercial banks made more profit before or  during the deregulation.\n\n6.         What else do  commercial banks to attract more deposits to enhance commercial banks’ lending operation.\n\n1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n            A study of this nature which is  more of a p0erformance appraised of the  commercial banks’ lending operation during the deregulation is of great significance to group of persons, institutions and governments.\n\n            The study will be of  great importance to the banking  sector of our  economy because from  the empirical view of the impact of interest rate deregulation on commercial bank’s – CBN will also find  the study valuable because it will enable it feel the purse  of the commercial banks’ three years after the deregulation.\n\n            Commercial banks’ customers will also  find results of the research very useful since it will enable them have a generalized view of  lending operation  by commercial banks in a deregulation economy.\n\n            `commercial banks’  management will from the research evolve aggressive survival strategies.\n\n1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n            This study was  concerned with the impact of interest rate deregulation on  commercial banks’ lending operation.\n\n            For effective coverage the study focused on  loan and advances,  leaving operations like  call. Money and inter-bank lending as well as other short term placements of funds.\n\n            This research examined the volume of deposit liabilities, loans and Advances, Bad and doubtful debts and Net profit over the period of the Union Banks of Nigeria Plc Enugu.   \n\n1.7 HYPOTHESES\n\n      For effective and valid investigation, the following hypotheses have been  postulated which will be  tested using appropriate statistical instruments.\n\nHYPOTHESIS  I\n\nHo:  These is one significant difference between the volume of leading (loans  and  advances) by  commercial banks in interest rate regulated economy and one of interest rate deregulation.\n\nHA:  There is a significant difference between the volume of lending (loans and advances) by  commercial banks in interest rate deregulation.\n\nHYPOTHESIS II\n\nHo:  Commercial banks recorded more loan  losses (bad and doubtful  debt)  in interest rate deregulated period than one of interest rate  regulation\n\nHA:  Commercial banks did not record more loan losses (bad and doubtful debt) in interest rate deregulated period than one of interest rate regulation.\n\nHYPOTHESIS III\n\nHo:  These is no significant difference  between the volume of commercial banks’  total  deposit liabilities in interest rate regulated period and one of interest rate deregulation.\n\nHA:  There is a significant difference between the volume of commercial banks’  total deposit liabilities in interest rate regulated period and one of interest rate deregulation.\n\n1.8       RESEARCH QUESTION\n\n            In order to find out the impact of interest rate deregulation on commercial banks’  lending  operations in Nigeria ,the  following research questions should be considered.\n\n1.         What impact does  the interest rate deregulation crear in commercial banks’ lending operation?\n\n2.         What problems does it create in commercial banks’ lending operation?\n\n3.         How can these problems be solved to enhances the performance of the  commercial banks’ lending operations?\n\n1.9       DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\n            The  definition  of term used will be made only on the conceptual frame work for general comprehension of each term rather than  on the  theoretically analysis.\n\nInterest Rate:  Is used  broadly to  express the relationship in percentage between  the interest  for a given period of time and the principal.  Whereas interest when used in absolute term  means a payment for the use of a borrowed fund for a period of time.\n\nDeregulation:  Disentangling of official or administrative control  and allowing for the interplay of  at market forces of demand and supply to determine  the rate of exchange of values.  Deregulation of interest rate in Nigeria called for the setting of a floor rate below which it is no longer economically viable for any  bank to lend, hence the minimum Rediscount Rate of the central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nLending:-  This is letting of sum of money usually by a Bank or\n\nother financial  institution to a borrower to be repaid with or\n\nwithout interest\n\nDeposit:-  An account of funds consisting of cash and or\n\ncheques, drafts  coupons and other  cash items  that may be\n\nconverted into  cash upon collection.  The deposit is given to\n\nthe commercial banks for the purpose of establishing  credit\n\nbalance. \n\nSavings:-  The amount of existing income that is not spent on \n\nconsumption.  Savings as used in the research context  is that\n\npart of income that is not consumed but are left in the \n\ncommercial banks for some future use.\n\nBad debt :-  An  amount due on an open account that has been\n\nproved to be uncollectible.  Any uncollectible receivable is \n\nformed bad debts\nTHE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE DEREGULATION ON COMMERCIAL BANKS’ LENDING OPERATIONS IN NIGERIA",

In this study survey, research design was employed, while investigation and historic research was used to evaluate the problems of leadership and also the best style to be employed for effective leadership. The instrument of data collection was through the use of questionnaire. The findings of this research show that political instability, corruption, injustice, favoritism and bad policies are responsible for the poor administration and bad leadership. The study also found out that technological underdevelopment is a major factor that brings about stagnancy in the process of development. Finally, it is recommended that all clauses that give room to exploitation, corruption and domination should be amended in the constitution and that government should avoid favoritism when it comes to fixing personnel in certain key areas that requires expertise. It concluded that the solution to the problem of bad leadership could only be resolved through conscious efforts of both the government and the governed.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nTitle page                   \n\nTable of Contents\n\nAbstract         \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1              Introduction   \n\n1.2              Statement of Problem\n\n1.3              Objective of the Study          \n\n1.4              Scope of the Study\n\n1.5              Research Questions\n\n1.6              Significance of the study\n\n1.7              Definition of Terms\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\n2.0       Overview of Literature Review\n\n2.1       Nature of leadership\n\n2.2       Nature of National Development\n\n2.3       Leadership style and skills\n\n2.4       Nature of Nigeria’s socio-political Environment\n\n2.5       Achievements and challenges/controversies of President\n\nGoodluck Jonathan’s Administration\n\n2.6       Leadership theories and Approach    \n\n2.7       Effectiveness of Leadership\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n3.0       Research Methodology                      \n\n3.1       Sources of Data         \n\n3.1.1                Primary source of data           \n\n3.1.2                Secondary source of data\n\n3.2       Area of the study       \n\n3.3       Population of the study         \n\n3.4       Sample size Determination\n\n3.5       Research Instrument  \n\n3.6       Validity of the Instrument     \n\n3.7       Reliability of the Instrument  \n\n3.8       Method of data Treatment and Analysis\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0       Data Presentation and Analysis\n\n4.1       Presentation of Data\n\n4.2       Presentation of demographic characteristics\n\n4.3       Analysis Based On Key Research Questions\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nSummary of Findings, Conclusion and Recommendations\n\n5.1              Summary of Findings            \n\n5.2              Recommendations                 \n\n5.3              Conclusions                \n\n5.4              Limitation of the study          \n\nBibliography\n\nAppendix\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND OF the STUDY        \n\nA good leadership and administration has been widely acknowledged as a potent instrument for the achievement of national development especially in Nigeria.\n\n            Leadership is an important aspect of management. The ability to lead effectively is one of the keys of being an effective manager or administrator. The essence of leadership is follower ship. In other words, it is the willingness of people to follow those whom they perceive as providing means of achieving their own desires, wants and needs, not those who would not provide means of achieving their own desires, wants and needs. That is why any country/organization that desires to achieve her objectives must have an effective and efficient leadership that knows how to apply all the basic principles needed towards achieving a great height of development. The leader must be one who is willing to work with zeal and confidence. Leadership presupposes follower ship. It presupposes a group of people who from among themselves have produced a leader, or from among whom a leader had emerged.\n\nEvery one of us finds out that we are leaders and or followers in one context or the other.\n\n            National Development is our utmost desire; this is because of the poise and serenity it will bring to our country Nigeria if achieved. It should be noted that any nation without a good leadership and administration is like one driving a care without a head lamp in the night. For Nigeria to attain the height of National development, a good leadership and administration should be kept in view.\n\n            Good luck Ebele Jonathan, a former teacher, inspector of education, lecturer and environmental protection and pollution control officer, became Nigeria’s second university educated Head of Government, was sworn in again on May 29, 2011 for a full four year term, as the President of Nigeria following his victory in the April 2011 Presidential elections.\n\nGood luck Jonathan is the third President of Nigeria’s Fourth Republic and the Fourteenth Head of Government in about 40 years. He had been the President of Nigeria from May 6, 2010 to May 28, 2011 after the death of President Umaru Yar’Adua on May 5, 2010 and is a member of the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n            He was vice-president of Nigeria from May 2007 until February 9, 2011 invoked the doctrine of necessity to empower him to serve as Acting President, with all the accompanying powers, due to President Yar’Adua’s prolonged absence from Nigeria. On January 13, 2010, a Federal High Court in Nigeria had handed him the power to run the affairs of the Presidency while President Yar’Adua died on May 5, 2010 and Good luck Jonathan was sworn in as President of Nigeria on May 6, 2010 becoming Nigeria’s Fourteenth Head of State, as mandated by the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. \n\n            Nigeria is one of the largest countries in West Africa. Apparently because of its natural endowment with many resources such as mineral, coal, food and the most profound “Crude oil”. It is also rich in population, gifted with talents in all ramification of life i.e. entertainment (music and arts), sports and so on.\n\n            To this regard, if Nigeria must join the 20 largest economies by 2020 AD, her leaders and followers must demonstrate certain capabilities. There have been concerted efforts made by the President and all his cabinet members towards the enhancement of a good leadership and administration, but our leaders must develop new visions and new strategies: must summon new forms of determination and political will: and demonstrate higher levels of patriotism, hard work, selflessness and responsiveness to the challenges facing them.\n\n            However, there is a great need for “national development” and in respect to this; the leadership must have a collective vision of the future or its goal; and the path to the achievement of these goals. It must always carry the people along. Nigeria is still posed with challenges like “Ethnicism”. This is higher in the multi-national states in which our country is an example. There is need to reconcile the demands of various ethnic groups, build bridges across religions and gender, and establish a legitimate basis for new forms of Nationalism.\n\n1.2       Statement of the Problem\n\n            Unlike most advanced countries, Nigeria has struggled to have a constructive political system that provides total freedom from condemnation and imperialism.\n\n            In spite of the energy and curiosity, directed towards liberation of the country from decadence and impoverishment; it is evident that the people of Nigeria are still undergoing or witnessing various kinds of economic and socio-political crises that arise from bad governance/leadership which upon time had jeopardized sustainable development in the region.\n\n            To this regard, he problems and causes of poor leadership is specified as follows:\n\n1.         Corruption, greed, insensitivity and lack of human face from the leaders.\n\n2.         Shortage of skilled personnel in certain key areas.\n\n3.         Non challant attitude of government toward the development of science and technology.\n\n4.         Poor funding of researches.\n\n5.         Lack of modern medical and health facilities.\n\n            The above mentioned points are the causes of the problems the nation is posed with due to poor leadership and administration. Its effect on National Development is apparently negative.\n\nThe effects (negative are as follows:\n\n-           High rate of poverty, diseases and illiteracy.\n\n-           Bad road network, inter-tribal and religious conflict.\n\n-           Electoral fraud, rigging assault and political upheaval\n\n-           Insecurity if the lives and investments of both the citizens and foreign investors etc.\n\n1.3       Objective of the Study\n\nFrom all that has been said and written above, it is the purpose of the study to take a closer look on the effects of good leadership and administration in national development; particularly in Nigeria. The following form the basis of this research study.\n\n1.         To examine the effects of good leadership and administration in national development.\n\n2.         To investigate the effect of bad leadership in national development.\n\n3.         To provide/proffer solutions for positive change.\n\n1.4       Scope of the Study\n\nThe project topic “The effects of good leadership and administration in National Development” is a broad subject which can take an intellectual toll on the writer as well as the reader.\n\nFor our purposes, the scope has been limited to our country Nigeria, using the present administration of President Good luck Ebele Jonathan (GEJ) as a case study.\n\n1.5       Research Question\n\n1.         Is there any effect of good leadership in National Development?\n\n2.         Is there any effect of bad leadership in National Development?\n\n3.         What are the solutions for positive change?\n\n1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis research work is of great relevance to the society at large. This is applicable to the government, the readers of this research work and to the researcher.\n\n            “A problem shared they say is a problem half solved”.\n\n            The benefit of this research work to the government is that by the end of the research, the weak-points and short – comings of all the sectors of the nation would be pinpointed and displayed based on findings, thus proffering reliable solutions and measures to be taken, so as to attain the lofty height of good administration and National Development.\n\n            The benefit of this research work to the readers is that hopefully at the time they are done with the reading of the work, they will be upgraded intellectually and also will be highly informed of the up and doings of the current administration, including the weaknesses, strengths, success and achievement of both the past and present administration.\n\n            “Knowledge they say is power”. Hence, this research work will serve as an eye opener, which will give the readers insight on how to participate and also partake in the political affairs of the country geared towards the achievement of national development.\n\n            Finally, this research work will to a large extent, widen my scope of knowledge, especially in my course of study “Public Administration”. It will help me become a better administrator, with good leadership qualities if applied, knowing what leadership style to adopt and apply as a potential leader.\nTHE EFFECTS OF GOOD LEADERSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n",

One of such framework of the student is the co-operative.  The word co-operative can have different interpretation.  In a layman’s language, it means working together on working mutually.  The second interpretation , which is where the emphasis means a special type of co-operative.  The co-operative has been defined by different schools of thought but the various in the degree of emphasis on one aspect or the other.\n\nThe school of thought describes co-operative as business undertaking owned and operated by voluntary associations in order to provide themselves with work and wages or with goods and services.\n\nBut the International Co-operative Alliance (I C A) defined co-operative as an autonomous association of persons, limited voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprises.  The role of co-operative in agricultural is an important topic of study but already much has been done by co-operators to justify its prime role of score securing economic and political development particularly in developed countries like England known for consumer co-operatives.  France known for industrial co-operative and Germany known for credit co-operative.  Co-operative movement is world wide phenomenon.  It has developed from simple traditional form(s) of mutual institution  of modern formally organized institution.  This institution gained world wide acceptance because of the grate role.  It has been playing in the economic development of various countries particularly in the developing countries.  The improvement of agricultural production through co-operative inevitable has social effects.  Co-operative management bring better yield which in turn yields better living standard, better housing, better  education for members and their families.  This economic success of co-operative society has been witnessed invaluably in co-operative studies.\n\nIn Delta State, most inhabitants survive through and the main occupation is substantial farming, which attracted interest many co-operative societies, both existing ones and new initiated ones.  Improving the agricultural production was their main target and interest and at the same time lifting the level of its individuals.  Improvement target was both in size and qualities were poor and could not be marketed most of the crops having pest scales and most couldn’t grow well in other to produce as expected.  The product that were severely affected were yam tubers, cassava stems and tubers, cocoa yams, vegetables.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nNigeria had embarked on various programmes and  policies  costing hundreds of millions of naira aimed at reviving the depressed agricultural sector.\n\nIn view of this, agricultural co-operative was instituted so as to organize the small scale farmers who are still involved in manual labour type of farming in co-operative and had failed to produce enough food for our teeming population thereby the country to be involved in importation of large quantity of food with a huge percentage decline in agricultural exports.\n\nAll those governmental effort have not actually had much significant improvement in this sector as much emphasis now being placed on agriculture.  The call for urgent re-examination of the role of these agricultural production sure it’s aim of facilitating the attainment of self-sufficiency in agriculture and making agriculture to take its prime position in the national economy of this country in danger.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe general purpose of this project report is undertaken as a study of the existing farmers co-operative societies and their effects in improving the development of agriculture specify.\n\nFinally, the study has the following objective:\n\n(a)   To examine the organizational set and the operations of co-operative movement in Delta State with particular reference to Ndokwa west local government are co-operative societies, Delta.\n\n(b)  To examine the impact of the farmer co-operative and societies.\n\n(c)   To investigate the problems facing the farmers co-operative.\n\n(d)  To suggest pragmatic ways and means for enhancing the effectiveness of these societies main attempt to be as food production and assist in further research into contemporary issue on the matter.\n\n1.4   IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nAgriculture is so importance in order to sustain any economy.  Moreover, co-operative using the agricultural sector, thus any effort geared towards carrying out research aimed at improving the agricultural production should be considered work while any suggestion on  the improvement of agricultural co-operatives should have bearing on the sector.  This is therefore the most appropriate time to study the agricultural sector concerning the prevailing economic condition of Delta state.\n\nPresently, our farmers are not adequately remunerated despite the fact they bend over double trying to make the state sufficient and self-reliant in food production.  They cannot compete with their counterparts in Nigeria not to talk of the part of the world.\n\nIf they are organized in co-operative, increased productivity enhanced the profit maximized to them and then farming will once more look attractive.\n\nBased on the findings of this study and suggestions proffered it is strongly believed that the policy makers government would encourage our peasant farmers to voluntarily join the co-operative societies.  Moreover, healthy progrant and policies on co-operative and development would be mounted in addition, it would enable the manager of co-operative and organization to adequately organize the co-operative farmer for increased food production.  Furthermore, colleges of co-operatives, schools and researcher who wish to carry  out research in this field have been provided a springboard from where they can take off.\n\n1.5   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.     Does co-operative helps to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of agricultural production?\n\n2.     Does agricultural product helps to improve peoples standard of living?\n\n3.     To what extent has agriculture contributed tremendously to the overall development of economic of Nigeria?\n\n4.     How can you as a member of co-operative help to remedy some of the problems facing the development of co-operative society?\n\n5.     Does government show much concern to appreciate the work of co-operative in increasing productivity?\n\n1.6   DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nMost of their term (words or phrase that are used in this projects report may be unfamiliar or may have peculiar meaning and connotation.)\n\nThese terms includes:-\n\n1.  Agricultural Productivity:  The index of the ratio of the value of the total form output to the value of the total input used in farm production.\n\n2.  Farm Management: The application of farming science and technology as the solution of the day to day problems facing the farms.\n\n3. Bye –Laws:  We  mean the registered bye-laws made by a co-operative society which governs the activities of such society and which is made by a society in the exercise of any power conferred by the co-operative laws.\n\n4. Small-scale Individual farmers:  This implies that a farmer whose total cultivable farm land is not more than hectares and whose farm labour requirement are largely supplied by his family, his sells are good in a localized market.  He requires low initial capital investment farms on small holdings with simple technology and at least 60% of his annual income from agriculture.\n\n5. Enofed:  This means Ndokwa west local government area co-operative federal limited.  It is the highest co-operative body in this state that gives supervisory to other co-operative bodies in the state.\n\n6. Co-operative Society:   It is a form of organization whereby people voluntarily associate together as human beings on the basis of equality for the promotion of the economic interests of themselves.\n\n7. Auxiliary Co-operatives:  This type provides individual service to members.  The co-operatives main function are to provide credit supply and market and storage the co-operative has no hand in the supervision and management affairs of member farm.\n\n8. Productive Type:  Here there is a full integration.  The co-operation absorbs all the member business enterprise that is members’ economic responsibilities are borne be the co-operatives is found in Delta, Ndokwa West Local Government Area.\n\n9. Production Promotion Co-operative:  This is co-operative by integration, the farmer depends on society for his production activities.  This is a strong link between the co-operative and members in areas of management marketing credit and decision making.\nIMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THROUGH CO-OPERATIVE\n",

This definition is in line with the explanation offered by a South American Jurist more than 30 years ago, according to him “Terrorism consists of acts that are in themselves may be classic-crimes, murder, arson, the use of explosives, but that differ from classic crimes in that they are excited with the deliberate intention of causing panic and terror within an arranged or organized society1. It is the use of violence and most especially the fear it causes among people for political objectives.2\n\nIt was also defined by the Terrorism Research Center as “the systematic use of physical violence against non combatants but with an audience greater than the immediate victim in mind to create a general climate of fear in a large population in order to affect some kind of political and social changes”3.\n\nThe United States Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI) defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimate or coerce a government, the population or any segment thereof in furtherance of political and social objectives”4. In basic terms, terrorism is an act of inflicting terror upon the people in the process of achieving personal or political objectives5.\n\nAlthough from the above definitions, it can be rightly concluded that there is no precise or widely accepted definition of the concept of terrorism, it is generally believed that terrorism is the use of covert violent actions in order to achieve certain objectives. It is a form of covert attack directed at targets that are outside a certain range of clearly military targets. Though the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington DC constitute a prime case, most terrorist attack are aimed at domestic regimes or other targets within the terrorist own country7.\n\nTerrorism is not new on the world stage. Northern Ireland had been dealing with terrorists for more than forty years, Israel with Palestinian terrorists for much the same period and Spain with Basque terrorists.\n\nAlthough the use of terrorism as a political tool extends far back into history, recent decades have seen a rise in the practice for several reasons. One is the overwhelming advantage in weapons that governments usually have over dissident groups. Because many governments are armed with aircraft and other high tech weapons that are unavailable to opposition forces, it has often become nearly suicidal for armed dissidents to use conventional tactics.\n\nSecond, terrorists’ targets are now more readily available than in the past: people are more concentrated in urban areas and even in large buildings; there are countless airline flights, and more and more people travel abroad. Third, the mass availability of instant visual news through television and satellite communications makes it easy for terrorists to gain an audience. This is important because terrorism is not usually directed at its victims as such; rather it is intended to frighten others. Fourth, technology has led to the creation of increasingly lethal weapons that terrorists can use to kill and injure large numbers of people. These technological “advances” include biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological weapons7.\n\nTerrorists attacks are relatively regular event. In 2000 there were 423 international terrorist attacks – many of these carried out across national borders and there were many other incidents of domestic terrorism. However, through this time, Americans worried little about terrorism for example, in a survey conducted in 1999 that asked Americans to name two or three top foreign policy concerns, only 12 percent of the respondents mentioned terrorism as a worry.8\n\nThis American’s sense of security was shattered by the September 11, 2001 terrorists attacks which included the destruction of the World trade Center, major damage to the pentagon, the crash of a hijacked airliner in Pennsylvania, and the deaths of over 3,000 people.\n\nSoon thereafter President George W. Bush responded by announcing a war on terrorism9. An American led coalition of forces intervened in Afghanistan, toppling the Taliban government that had supported Al Qaeda and attacking Al Qaeda forces in the country. Later President Bush charged that Iraq, Iran and North Korea constituted an “axis of evil” that, among other things were guilty of state terrorism. In March 2003, the United States, in alliance with Great Britain and other countries known as the coalition of the Willing attacked Iraq, arguing in part that Iraq’s support of terrorism made it an international threat and an outlaw nation.10\n\nTerrorist make use of various means in achieving their aims, irrespective of whether it is individual group or state sponsored terrors. Some of which are briefly stated as follows:\n\nKidnapping: Seizure of one or more victims are then moved to a hideout. This method is regularly abducted by the Niger Delta Terrorists Movements.\n\nBarricade Hostage: Seizure of a facility with whatever hostages available, these is made cotangent on meeting terrorist demand.\n\nBombing: Major bombing is the use of any type of explosives or device for terrorist purposes, including those delivered through mail when sufficient demand or casualties occurs, the terrorists group claims responsibility. Example Commuter bombing in 2004 March that killed 191 people and wounded 1,8000. and July 7: London bombings – Bombs explode on one double-decker bus and three London Underground trains, killing 56 people and injuring over 700, occurring on the first day of the 31st G8 Conference. The attacks are the firstsuicide bombings in Western Europe.\n\nHijacking: An attempt to seize an airplane, ship or other vehicle with whatever hostage maybe in it, to force some actions or movement to another country upon an agreement by authorities involved to terrorists demand.\n\nArmed attack: An attempt to seize or damage facility with no intent to hold for negotiating purposes.\n\nAssassination: An attempt whether successful or not to kill a pre selected victim usually with small arms or letter bombs, are executed form this small category, in many cases, there is a specific intended victim.\n\nSabotage: this is willful destruction of properties by any means including bombing.\n\nExotic Pollution: The use of exotic substances such as atomic, chemical or biological to contaminate materials of the targeted state. For example, the introduction of mercury into orange shipped form Israel.\n\nThreat for hoax: The stated intent by a terrorist group to carry out an attack or a false alert of authorities about the coming of terrorists attack by a named group.\n\nMost of these means terrorists adopt in carrying out their activities are becoming obsolete because of the fact that most governments that are more effective in combating terrorist elements.\n\nFew governments are as inclined as they were some years ago to release captured terrorists simply to avoid further terrorists attacks. Most government have adopted non concessions, non negotiations politics in dealing with hostage cases or situation.11\n\nPhysical security around likely target has increased for example, it has become more difficult now, although it is still possible to smuggle weapons abroad through airlines. Embassies are becoming virtual fortress (especially after the terrorists attack on the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998).\n\nDiplomatic and top executives often travel in armored limousines with armed body guards (for example, the coming of former United States President Bill Clinton into Nigeria and Ghana with armored limousines and several CIA and FBI agents). But despite these undeniable achievements, the total volume of terrorist’s activities in the world has increased. At the same time terrorism has become bloodier and the terrorist seem to be less reluctant to inflict casualties. The latest fear exercise after the September 11th incident is the fear of terrorist making use of instruments of mass destruction in achieving their aims12.\n\nOne aspects of the problem of definition of the term terrorism is the difficulty in distinguishing between terrorism and a freedom fighter for example, the man who attacks a plane and proceeds to kill some or all the passengers.\n\nThe man who wrap bomb around his waist and drives into a shopping mall causing maximum damages of government may well be a freedom fighter to his kith and kin.\nTERRORISM AND ITS IMPLICATION ON GLOBAL SECURITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY\n",

This is an area of 922,200 square kilometers (356,000 square miles). To travel from the west to the east is a distance of 1,120 kilometers (700 miles) from the south to north of the country about 1,040 kilometers (650 miles). It is bounded in the north by the Sahara Desert and in the south by the Gulf of Guinea, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSeen on a map, Nigeria can best be described as an approximately square expanse of vast territory divided into three unequal parts by a rough letter Y, which is formed by the confluence of that majestic African river, the Niger, with its chief tributary, the Benue, on its coastward journey to the Atlantic Ocean, into which it merges in the mangrove forests that line the intricate network of the Niger Delta.2\n\nNigeria, being the most populous country in Africa, has been described as “the giant of Africa, benevolent hegemony”, etc. Nigeria with a population of approximately 150 million divided among three hundred and fifty ethnic groups practicing the two dominant monotheistic religions of Islam and Christianity and with a few still devoted to their African gods.3\n\nNigeria is also phenomenally endowed country with billions of barrels of crude petroleum and huge gas deposits, one of the largest in the world, abundant agricultural land and sunshine, untapped solid mineral of all kinds, coal rivers that are harnessed for hydro-electricity and above al, a virile and highly sophisticated and educated people.\n\nNigeria is indeed a land inhabited by a people of varied ethnic origin and culture, whose ancestors settled in the area that is now known as Nigeria in successive waves over many centuries. Among the chief ethnic groups that occupy Nigeria are the Hausa, Yoruba, Ibo, Kanuri, Fulani, Ibibio, Tiv, Ijaw, Edo, Efik, Nupe, Urhobo, Ekoi, Borgu and a host of other smaller groups each with its own tongue and specific cultural practices. However, underlying the diversity of the various group/peoples of Nigeria, is the deep current of cultural unity characteristic of all black Africa.\n\nAt the north, east and west borders of Nigeria are Nigeria, Cameroon/Chad and Benin Republic respectively.\n\nAggressive coastal erosion and flooding of the coastal villages and towns, a ravaging gully and bad land erosion of the eastern region characterized the land mass. There is aggressive desert encroachment from the north due to climatic changes and human activities (such as deforestation from fuel wood and overgrazing).\n\nThere is frequent flooding when rivers overflow their banks. Reservoir flooding is also a common occurrence. Besides, Nigeria gained independence in October 1st 1960. Since the first coup d’ et al in 1966, the country has been unstable, with so many coups.\n\nHowever, Nigeria was divided into four main geographical zones: Zone 1 is along the coast where rainfall mostly of swamps. The area is served by many rivers and creeks. Rainfall is high and spread over about eight (8) months in the year; Zone 2 is the forest region where rainfall is also heavy and the vegetation is made up mostly of the thick forest; Zone 3 is the semi-Savanna Zone which lies between the forest Zone and; Zone 4 the true Savanna Zone, in the north. Here the main geographical features are grassland and the low incidence of rainfall. The Sahara desert is not far away.\n\nIt is important to note at this juncture, however, the special position which the River Niger has held in the country. It is not surprising that the country has taken its name from the river. We must note that the river is unlikely to have taken its name from the colour, black or niger, used to describe Simeon of the period of the Apostles (Acts 13:1), or from the Afro-Americans carried across the Atlantic as human cargoes.4\n\nIt was once suggested that the river had been called Nigeir or Nigir from the second century and derived from the Latin word “black”. Other suggestions have been that Nijer was the name given by an African community to the river, or that the Greek word for river is Naghar.\n\nWhatever the root of the word “Niger”, it is sufficient for us to note that the word Nigeria was first used to describe the country by a British Lady, Flora Shaw.\n\nNeedless to say, the peoples of Nigeria have a history which stretches far back into the past; in the Savannah Lands and plains north and west of the river Nigeri, the Kanuri, Hausa, Fulani, Borgu, Nupe, Jukun and Yoruba people evolved well organized states of varying size, while the powerful Benin state lay in the forest lands immediately west of the Niger, and the Ibos, the Efiks and the people of the Niger Delta occupied the eastern bank of the Niger in political units of varied nature and size.\n\nOne of the greatest medieval empires to establish itself in the grassland of the western Sudan was that of Kanem-Bornu, which was first, establish in the Lake Chad region towards the eight century, and whose latter-day rulers, the Kanuri, now live mostly in the north eastern part of Nigeria. Bornu’s position at the receiving end of one of the most ancient trade routes across the Sahara from Cairo through the Fezzan to Lake Chad enabled it to develop rapidly as a leading commercial and political centre. Several centuries of development under the able leadership of Shehu El Kanemi in the nineteenth century, Bornu was the only major state in northern Nigeria to withstand the Fulani Jihad of Usman Dan Fodio.\n\nTo the west of Bornu were the seven Hausa states – Daura, Kano, Zau Zau (Zaria), Gobir, Katsina, Rano and Biram which had a history only a little less ancient than that of Bornu itself. Each of the Hausa states traced its origin to a common ancestor, called Bayajidda (or Abuyazidu) who is said to have come across the desert to Bornu from Arabia and gone from thence to Daura where he killed a sacred snake that had long prevented the people of Daura from drawing water from the local well. The queen of Daura married him and bore him a son, Bawo, who in turn had six sons who became the Kings of Daura, Kano, Zau Zau, Gobir, Katsina and Rano. These were known as the Hausa Bakwai (the seven Hausa states), the seventh being Biram. There is however no doubt that the history of the Hausa – speaking peoples stretches much further back than this, and it would appear that Hausa states had been in existence for a long time before the advent of Bayajidda. Although there are considerable ethnic and cultural differences among the various Hausa speaking groups, the seven Hausa states developed a common language, Hausa, and retained a close form of association in which the western state of Gobir was entrusted with the task of defending of other states from invasions from the west, while Kano, Katsina Rano and to a lesser extent Daura were commercial and industrial centres and Zaria was to guard Hausa land against the pagan people to the South. In addition, the Hausa believe that a number of other states, to which they refer as Banza Bakwai (illegitimate Hausa) and which are listed as Kebbi, Nupe, Gwari, Yauri, Yoruba and Kwararafa (Jukun) have related origins to the Hausa states. One source even identifies the Queen of Daura who married Abuyazziri as a decedent of Lamurudu, who is the father of the legendary ancestor of the Yoruba people. In the nineteenth century, the Fulani, a pastoral people partly settled in Hausa land, rose in a holy war against the Habe ruler of the Hausa states, and under the inspired leadership of Othman Dan Fodio succeeded in conquering all of Hausa land which they welded into a vast empire that the descendants of Othman Dan Fodio ruled from the new capital of Sokoto.5\n\nTo the south were the Yoruba kingdoms, also with a very long historical past. The Yorubas would appear to be the descendants of two main groups of people, one, an older indigenous stock whose religious centre was the city of Ife, and the other of the name stock as the founders of Bornu and the Hausa states. A myth of origin which reflects the latter element states that the Yoruba kingdoms were founded by Oduduwa, son of an Arabian or Nubian king name Lamurudu. As a result of internal strife, Oduduwa was driven out of his father’s kingdom in the east (possibly in the region of Nubia). After long wandering, he conquered the people of Ife and settled there. Out of his seven children, six became the crowned rulers of Yoruba land and another, the ancestor of the rulers of Benin. by the sixteenth century, the Yoruba kingdom had developed into a highly organized empire under the sway of the state of Oyo, and at its height this empire covered an area reaching from the banks of the Niger to the present boundaries of Togo. In the nineteenth century the Yoruba kingdoms fell victim to civil-wars and suffered immensely from the demand of the slave trade, while part of the northern reaches of the Empire were conquered by the Fulanis. Further south in the first hands, the kingdom of Benin which claimed relations to the Yorubas, had also developed into a highly organized state in medieval times. Benin was one of the first Nigerian state to visited by the Portuguese, and the Oba of Benin sent an ambassador to the court of Portugal early in the sixteenth century.6\n\nAll the states whose history we have briefly discussed, as well as a host of others including Nupe, Borgu, and Jukun people, as well as the Ibo – Benin States of Onitsha and Asaba on the River Niger attained a high level of material property and cultural development. Thus, although present-day Nigeria is a new country with arbitrarily carved out frontiers, it is by no means an agglomeration of petty tribes with few relations between each other, but on the contrary contains people with a long historical past who had achieved remarkable political organization in the past and had long been in contact with each other.\n\nHistory is essentially a dynamic and continuous process. The West Africa we observe today represent a specific moment in time, just as a photograph of athletes in the middle of a race freezes the runners in one specific moment in time. We may admire the photograph and the attitude of the athletes caught in that moment of time but it is not complete by itself and can only be fully appreciated if one knows that the athletes are in the middle of a race at that given moment and have not been standing all their lives in the position in which the photograph was taken. Similarly, West Africa has a long history behind it and the physiognomy we observe at present is by no means a frozen reality, but a moment in the flow of history.7\n\nAfrica has known in the past great nations and empires that brought together within their fold a wide variety of peoples. The nation-building process continued over several centuries before the European conquest. One after the other, the great empires of Ghana, Mali and Songhai had brought together many of the peoples of the Western Sudan in one single political entity. Askia Mohammed Toure, the greatest of the Songhai emperors, ruled over an empire that covers virtually the whole of West Africa from the Atlantic Coast in the West to Northern Nigeria as far as Agades in the East. Even as late at the Nineteen century, the Fulani Jihad had unified the Hausa speaking peoples of northern Nigeria in a vast empire ruled from Sokoto which extended as far south as the northern fringes of Yoruba land westward into the northern part of present-day Dahomey. British colonization of Nigeria was only different from the past attempts at setting up large-size nations in that the unifying element came from an external force, but this is by itself nothing new in history.\n\nA nation may be formed in two ways: internal conquest by one group which imposes its rule on the other component groups and than evolves a unified political entity with their participation, or external conquest by an outside group which forces the dominated groups into a new political entity forming part of its empire. The former may be said to be a case in countries like Japan, China or Russia, while the latter is true of countries like Britian or India. The British colonization may best be described as a unifying element which, although provided by an external factor, nevertheless had the result of welding the peoples of Nigeria into a single political unit. The point that must be stressed here is that although no Africa disputes the fact that the present boundaries of African states are in a sense artificial, the general desire is to break down these barriers to form larger units, not to regress by falling back into a multitude of mini-states. The apparent diversity of Africa ethnic groups is fundamentally misleading: underlying this apparent diversity there is in fact a very deep cultural unity. Within Nigeria itself, we have seen has in the Hausa myth of origin a number of other Nigerian peoples ranging from the Yoruba to the Jukun, the Nupe, etc, are said to be an offshoot of the Hausa-speaking tribes, while the Benin ruling dynasties are of Yoruba origin. Similarly, some of the Ijaw people in the Niger Delta claim to have come from Ife, the Yoruba spiritual home, while the Onitsha and Asaba Ibos claim to have originated from Benin. Many of the Nigerian languages belong to the same language groups, and animist, religious practices are basically similar all over Africa. It is against this background of deep cultural unity that the apparent diversity of African peoples must be viewed: Africa is in fact fundamental one.8\n\nBe that as it may, its role in the development of international organizations in Africa cannot be over emphasized.  Nigeria over the years, have been an active player in the development of international organizations in Africa and in other parts of the globe and in conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa and the rest of the world despite the myriads criticisms from many countries including those in Africa and their non-appreciation of the role of Nigeria in the development of Africa, and their claims that Nigeria is playing host to many contradictions, socially, politically and economically, to the extent that Nigeria’s quest for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council is seen as inconsistent with the domestic situation Nigeria has been championing the case of the whole of Africa. The survival and the development of international organization would have been futile without Nigeria as catalytic agent.\n\nNigeria’s contributions and her role in the reversal of the phantom coup in Sao Tome and principle during the Leon Sullivan Summit in Abuja in 2003 is a case in point. Emphasis must also be made on her role under the fourth republic, as well as the critical areas of Nigeria’s intervention, such as the Chairmanship of the African Union (AU) under President Olusegun Obasanjo, Africa Peer Review Mechanism, coverage of the African Union in the Nigerian press, peacemaking and peacekeeping among others.\n\nTo understand Nigeria’s decision to promote the establishment of a West African Economic Community and other organisations, one must first understand the evolution of Nigeria’s foreign policy since independent.\n\nNigeria played a crucial, if not critical role in the movement that culminated in the establishment of ECOWAS. The motivation for this commitment to a West African Economic Community lies more in politics than in economics in the short run. Although the economic gains of integration are not discounted, it appears the diplomatic leverage have in what was perceived as an increasingly polycentric world, featured more in the calculations of those who actively championed the establishment of ECOWAS.\n\nBy the time of her independence, Nigeria’s foreign policy guidelines had been formulated by the departing colonial power. These were embodied in a maiden foreign policy statement made by the first civilian prime minister on 20 August 1960 just a few months before formal independence. According to him, Nigeria would follow an independent policy founded on Nigeria’s interest and consistent with the moral and democratic principles on which our constitution is based.\n\nParadoxically, it is Nigeria’s own dominant position in the region and the implication of her leader’s commitment to the western model of development in circumstances (National as well as Global) hostile to such a course that may well be the most formidable obstacle to the emergence of the community.\n\nIndeed, it can be argued that ECOWAS drew considerable strength from the successful negotiation which had been concluded by the EEC with the combined representatives of African, Caribbean and Pacific states as contained in the Lome convention. This unity in the face of a strong and equality United Europe (not withstanding some minor differences within the EEC) impressed, Nigerian leaders in a way that an Economic Community of West Africa, modeled after the European Economic Community, was an immediate imperative.\n\nThis conviction led Nigeria to expand a lot of her resources in the campaign for the establishment of ECOWAS.\nNIGERIA ROLES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN AFRICA",

The presence of oil and gas in the region makes it the goose that lays the golden egg, thus making the region the center of economic and political activities in the country.\nThe Niger Delta was a foremost part of the area later to be called Nigeria and incorporated into the Atlantic world economy from the 16th century.  Thus, the region developed a monetized economy and become ahead of contemporary developments in others part of the future Nigeria, leading to a substantial degree of prosperity and the development of a proud culture in the region.  This rare feat constitutes the basis for the formation of own identity.\nHowever, the struggle for self determination and proper distribution of resources among groups within the region and Nigerians ethnic group started with the formation and consolidation of the Nigeria colonial state from the 1940’s.  This struggle became inevitable because Niger Delta is a dispersal of small ethnic groups which were force together with predatory and dominant majority ethnic groups.\nThis minority question was never addressed before Nigeria got her independence in 1960 despite The Henry Commission of 1956 that attempted to solve the issue of minority.  The point here is to present a fact that the Niger Delta crisis is rooted in the foundation and structure of the Nigeria state.  Over the years the question has contributed greatly to the emergence of violence in Niger Delta region over oil and mineral resources.  The insurgency in Niger Delta whether oil or crude oil benefit bother on the foundation and structure of Nigeria state.\nThese works examine the Niger Delta people before 1960.  The research contends that before independence, the people of the region live in peace despite some record of conflict among the ethnic groups in Niger Delta region.  The origin of crisis in Niger Delta region and also took a look at the attempt at addressing the crisis through military option to peaceful means.\nAIMS/OBJECTIVES\nThe aims and objectives of this study include:\n\n    To examine as baseline study that Niger Delta people and the extent to which it relates with others.\n    To examine the Genesis of the crisis of agitation in the region and how it affects the Nigeria state.\n    To examine the military option which hitherto escalate the Niger Delta crisis to insurgence in the country.\n    To examine the nature of the conflict as it portents to undermine the economy of Nigeria.\n    To identify and evaluate the amnesty programmes as relevant approach in addressing the Niger Delta struggle.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe Niger Delta question is an important discourse in Nigeria today.  This is so because of the discovery of oil in the region, thus making the region the life wire of the country economy.  Over the years resource has turn to serious issue as a result of the neglect of the region.  The distribution and the development oil has led to violence and armed conflict between the people and the federal government.\nThe relevance of this study is to investigate into the genesis of the problem and provide a framework for a critical analysis of why it is important to ensure that the amnesty idea is the best possible solution to the resolution of the crisis.  This work will provide first hand information for further research.\nMETHODOLOGY\nIn the course of research for this work relevant data and information were obtained from the main sources.  These were primary and secondary source.\n\n    Primary Sources:\n\nPrimary sources which were utilized in the course of the research for this work from archival research.  Material was consulted at the Edo State Library, Benin City, Benin Institute of Studies, Benin City and the national archive at Ibadan.  They include intelligence report other documents relating to this works.\n\n    Secondary Source:\n\nSecondary source which consulted in some university and public libraries across the country include textbooks, journals and periodicals information obtained from primary sources.  These sourced helped to provide data for a critical analysis of conflict management in the Niger Delta that will study Amnesty programme.\nSCOPE OF STUDY\nThe scope of this study on conflict management in the Niger Delta: A case study of the Amnesty programme is limited to the genesis of the Niger Delta question on the struggle for equal distribution of resources which later manifested to oil and mineral resources control.  Its manifestation took the shape of violence and insurgence that inevitably led to military option until amnesty programme.\nLITERATURE REVIEW\nThere is yet not much academic work on conflict management in the Niger Delta:  A case study of the Amnesty Programme.  This however, cannot be said of Nigeria where there are a number of works deal on the Nigeria evolution as a state in politics, economy and the society.  There is however, certain literature that deal on relevant aspects on conflict management in Niger Delta.  Some of the literature in this group include A. Boro work “A twelve Day Revolution” 1R.T. Akinyele “Patriarch of Minority activities in the Niger Delta”2 O. Ikime The merchant prince of the Niger Delta3.  Boro, it highlight the need for a revolution as the solution to the continue exclusion of the area from benefiting from the oil.  Akinyele work examine that the domination by the three major groups via Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo as the remote cause of the crisis in the region which border on unequal distribution of government services and institution and exploitation of the resources.  Suberu work identified five broad themes as the basis for the people demand and grievances, the disposition of mineral law rent, the application of federally collected mineral revenues, the appropriate institutions and fiscal response to the ecological problem of the oil producing area, the responsibility of the oil prospecting companies to the oil producing communities and the appropriate arrangement of securing the integrity and autonomy of the oil producing communities within the federal structure.\nThe works are base on conflict in Niger Delta and the problems in the region.  This however, would assist in the theoretical analysis of this study.\nFrom the above, it can be seen that none of the existing literature has carried out any substantial analysis of the subject of our study, as their primary focus was on conflict and problem in the Niger Delta.\nThis however, it will provide the framework for a comprehensive and detailed analysis for this work.  Thus, this work will provide a useful and detailed idea for further research on the conflict management in Niger Delta.\nCHAPTERIZATION\nThis project work is divided into five chapters:\nChapter One:  The Niger Delta; its people, cultures and values.  This chapter provides a brief historic background of the Niger Delta people.\nChapter Two:  The Nature of Niger delta crisis (2003 to 2011).  This chapter provides the analysis of the agitation move from peaceful on to insurgence in the region.\nChapter Three:  The military option that escalates the crisis.\nChapter Four:    The Amnesty Programme\n\nChapter Five:     Conclusion    \nCONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN THE NIGER DELTA ",

Nigeria is a country in Africa continent located in West of Africa close to the equator extending from latitude 4˚N to14˚ and from longitude 3˚E to 15˚E. Except for the Atlantic ocean to the south, Nigeria is surrounded by French-speaking countries; Niger, Cameroun and Benin Republic. Nigeria is a third world country which means it is a developing country.\nHowever, the fact that most of the population reside in the rural areas indicate that rural areas need more of infrastructural development such as good roads, electricity, good and well equipped schools for the growth and betterment of the people living in the rural areas. But in Nigeria, the reverse is the case. More attention is given to the urban centre for the detriment of the rural areas, as a result of the notion that urban centre are more populated; so they need more basic infrastructure than the rural areas. This perception has caused imbalance between the urban centre and the rural dwellers by creating a wide gap. By this gap the urban centre are growing immensely living the rural areas in a state of stagnation and depreciation which is growing at an alarming rate.\nIn the case of Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State being one of the largest local governments with a population of about 1.6 million people in which 74% of them living in the rural areas lack basic infrastructure for growth and development. Moreover, it is generally agreed that education has impact more substantially in rural area development process in developing nations. Therefore, education has a controlling influence over the development of rural societies, communities, individual or group of individuals and families which leads to the reduction of low income rate, poverty and rural-urban migration.\nAlthough, education has made a significant impact on rural areas in terms of marking personnel maintenance, system of supplying farm production, health care and good governance, but failure of government to tackle rural development and recognition of the importance of rural areas and rural people to the economic development still remains an issue.\nThe major aim of education is learning which is achieved through the teaching and learning process. According to Plato (437-337 BC) “Aesthetic education brings grace to the body and nobility to the mind. Until man in his physical and sensuous mode of being has been accustomed to the laws of beauty, he is not capable of spiritual liberty”. Therefore education would be incomplete without due consideration being given to rural areas. Education holds a significant place in this regard, so far as it forms a very convenient and powerful medium for individuals express themselves in a variety of ways in any situation including his mental skill in relation to overall academic performance. However, it is sad to note that some schools in rural areas have no rooms allocated for teaching even some with class rooms lack furniture; in some schools, teaching is carried on in makeshift classrooms and this can be uninspiring and boring. Inadequate and half-baked teachers in some secondary schools are also an issue of concern in this study (Madeki S.J (2008)).\nEducation impacts social change, by improving individual social position as well as standard of living. Education also increases critical ability of rural people to diagnose their needs, assert their right, taking greater control of decision affecting their lives. Education has the potential to respond to the transformation of rural areas, increase labour force and enhancing security. As the pivot of the educational system, the National policy on Education (FRN, 1981) noted that teachers in all educational institutions including the universities, should be professionally trained because is considered as a tool to be used for the integration of the individuals into the society to achieve self-realization, develop national consciousness, promote unity and strive for social-economic, political, scientific, cultural and technological progress.\nDurojaiye (1996) indicates three aspects that are of immediate relevance to education:\n1.  The learner, his growth and development, his needs and motivation, his individual characteristics and achievement, his nutritional state and the child-rearing approached employed by his parents.\n2. The learning situation, the school and wider society, the cultural context and effects on learning.\n3.  The learning process and the teacher who makes them happen including his method, approaches and personality.         \nEducation has brought about phenomenal changes in every aspect of human’s life.\nBrown (2011) opines that education is a process which brings about changes in the behaviour of the society. It enables every individual to efficiently and effectively participate in societal activities and make a positive contribution to the progress of the society. Education create awareness in the rural areas regarding their right to education as stipulated in Article 26 of the United Nation Declaration of Human Right (1984) which says that:\n1.  Everyone has the right to education.\n2.  Education shall be free at least in elementary and fundamental    \nstages\n3. Primary education shall be compulsory\n4. Education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all in the basis of merit.\nThe concentration of education in urban centres rather than rural areas has done more harm than good; it accelerates rural-urban migration, generating youth unemployment. This makes rural areas undergrowth or underdeveloped. Education enhances the capacity of people, expanding the area of competence and changes orientation and attitude which significantly improve the life style of people both in rural areas and urban centers. According to World Bank (2002) Education policy and programme must be carefully designed at both national and local levels.\nImpact of education in area of health is indisputable especially in area of mortality rate. However, in other to lower Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and achieve the lowest possible Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in rural areas education has a crucial role to play in girls that dwell in the rural areas, better education of a female child or pass through a process of learning can drastically reduce maternal and infant mortality; it will also bring about positive impact for family health, birth spacing, few children and fertility related issues, better care of children, seeking right services and counsel at the right point in time and the right places, and promote health and survival and life expectancy along with economic productivity for a better standard of living.\nEducation can initiate social change by transforming the out look and attitude of man; it can also bring about a change in the pattern of social relationship and thereby causing social change. This social change can be good behaviour, respect to elders, obeying one’s culture and all these have been the impact of education in rural development process. Be that as it may, education in Nigeria is now more of a private enterprise, but a huge government venture that has witnessed a progressive evolution of government complete and dynamic intervention and active participation. The federal government of Nigeria has adopted education as an instrument par-excellent for effecting national development.\nStatement of the Problem\nThis research is an attempt to investigate the discrepancies between urban and rural areas in terms of educational rural development process.\nThe gap between urban and rural areas arising from conduciveness of environment, availability of manpower and facilities in the teaching and learning process.\nOther issue of textbook selection or recommendation is a matter of concern to curriculum planners, the teachers and even the ministries of education.\nResearch Questions\n1.       Is there any relationship between education and provision of   basic infrastructure in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State?\n2.  Is there any relationship between education and rural         development process in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State?\n3.       Is there any impact of education in rural areas in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State?\n4.        Is there any difference between education and social changes in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State?\nHypotheses\nThis research is based on the following hypotheses.\n1.       There is no significant relationship between education and      provision of basic infrastructure in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.\n2.       There is no significant relationship between education and      rural development process in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.\n3.       There is no significant impact of education in rural areas in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State\n4.       There is no significant difference between education and social         changes in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.\nPurpose of the Study\nThe purpose of this research is to look at the impact of education in rural development process in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.\nIt is also to investigate whether there is any existing relationship between education and rural development process in Oredo Local Government Area.\nAlso to find out if people in rural area benefit from basic infrastructure in Oredo Local government Area.\nTo determine the impact of education in rural area in Oredo Local Government Area.\nTo investigate if education has improved social changes in rural area of Oredo Local Government Area.\nSignificant of the Study\nThis study when completed will be beneficial to the students, tertiary institutions, teachers and ministries of education. In addition, the study will try to provide adequate and enough information for planners of educational policies and curriculum with a particular reference to rural development process. No doubt, the study will help ministries of education to make useful and important recommendations on how to develop rural areas.\nThe curriculum designers could receive vital information about the problem being suffered in rural areas in teaching and learning and may adopt a system of solving the problems that will eliminate the difference and bridging the wider gap between urban and rural areas.Be that as it may, the study will no doubt enrich the libraries with useful copies of papers as researchers in Oredo Local Government Area in particular and Nigeria at large. It will also provide relevant information to researchers who might be interested in the educational research.\nScope of the Study\nThis study is designed to show areas to which the research work is carried out; it includes both the male and female staff of Oredo Local Government Council because the research is not affected by sex.\nLimitation of the Study\nThis study is meant to cover all the senior staff of Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. But due to financial constraint, only 40 senior staff were used for the research. The result from this study will be used to generalize all the senior staff in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State.\nDefinition of Terms\nImpact: a marked effect or influence.\nImbalance: A lack of proportion or balance.\nStagnate: Showing little activity.\nImmensely:  To a great extent, extremely.\nPivot: The central point.\nDiscrepancy: A difference or lack of compatibility between two or more facts that should be similar. \nIMPACT OF EDUCATION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\n",

The importance of this sector cannot be over emphasized, especially in a typical developing country like ours where the level of youth unemployment is rising beyond control. Hence small scale industries generate employment opportunities per unit of capital investment because they are generally more labour intensive which are more capital in nature. A large scale industry that cost N20million for instance, may employ a mere 70 (seventy) workers or less. Where as a small scale industry that cost just N150,000 (one hundred and fifty thousand naira) may employ about 20-30 workers.\n\nSmall scale business specialized in the production and marketing of various products and services ranging from food, beverages, drinks/sachet water, cosmetics, spare parts and many others.\nKilby (1969) acknowledge the diversity of terms of the degree of specialization and division of labour and the quantity of raw materials and output and the character of markets being served by small scale businesses. As a result the bulk of Nigerian business falls within the small scale business which account for over 80% of the number of enterprises in the country. (Ekunna 1992 Pg.160)\nSeveral number of small scale business are successful while other fail or are staggering for survival due to poor background management, lack of qualified manpower, poor capital base, lack of marketing research and appropriate technology and credit rating among banks and other lenders. These problems continue to militate against the establishment, survival and growth of small scale business in Nigeria. Although successful government in Nigeria have been emphasizing on the importance of small scale business and have established institutional support agencies to facilitate industrialization.\n\nHowever, small scale business still operate in uncertainty and are faced with serious obstacles, this raises the questions of whether  the federal government is actually up to the responsibility in the promotion of small scale business in Nigeria.    \n\n    OBJECTIVE OF THE ESSAY\n\nThe main objectives of this study is to evaluate the impact of federal government in the promotion of small scale business in Nigeria. This study will specially seek to achieve the following:\n\n    To evaluate the marketing challenges facing small scale businesses.\n    To identify the sources of funds to the activities of the industry.\n    To find out the extent of government involvement in  promoting the activities of the business.\n    To bring to light the contribution of the industry to the development of national diploma in marketing.\n\nFinally, it is my hope that the students of marketing and others in related discipline will find this study very informative and useful tool in their respective studies.\n\n    SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nAs the title of this essay indicates, the study focuses its attention to federal government support to small scale business enterprises in Nigeria, it causes various policy, guidelines, direct and indirect financial assistance and other programs and initiatives designed to promote this vital sector of the country.\n\n    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ESSAY\n\nThe significance of this study lies basically on its contribution to knowledge and its benefits to individual and organization. The current economic crises in Nigeria has deciminated the growth of infant industries and encourages the establishment of similar business venture in both small and large scale proportions.\n\nAlthough successful governments have vowed to support individuals and group initiatives in the establishment of small scale businesses.\nThe current state of most small scale business in Nigeria is a far cry particularly when structural adjustment programme (SAP) was introduced, which brought about the problem of devaluation of the naira and the scarcity of foreign exchange of raw materials from abroad which has adversely affected production unit especially under a depressed economy.\nThis study is an attempt to evaluate the role of government in the promotion of small scale business in Nigeria as a country.\n\n    DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nThe following terms and abbreviations used in the extended essay are defined below:\n\n    (SSICS) Small Scale Industries Credit Scheme\n\n(SME) Small and Medium Enterprises\n(NIDB) Nigerian Industrial Development Bank\n(NERFUND) National Economic Reconstruction Fund\n(NDE) National Directorate of Employment\n\n    Small scale enterprise: Apart from size, it is a type of business that is self initiated, largely self financial, closely self managed and is of relatively small in size when considered as part of the industry.\n    Management: Is the part of loaning organizing, directing and motivating others so as to enhance productivity with maximum utilization of available resources and achieving the organizational goals or objectives.\n\n    Resources: These are the primary inputs that needs to be put together into function before the proper management activities really take place. These activities include; men, materials , money and machines.\n\nEnterprises: This is one of the fundamental principles of management that is concerned with the division of labour and assigning of responsibilities with authority for the well being of business unit.           \nTHE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA IN THE PROMOTION OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA\n",

It is all around us. The price of a worker is wages, incomes taxes are the price we pay for the privilege of making money. In economic theory, prices policy tends to be relegated to a secondary role and attention is devoted to other dimensions of competitive strategy. It is important to be clear what we mean by price.\n\nAccording to Ode (2011), the term price simply means the amount of money that you actually pay in order to buy a good or service so that any relation between the buyer and seller is confined to the transaction itself. This definition is inadequate for marketing purposes because it ignores guarantees, after soles services, installation, maintenance, consultancy, delivery, credit, etc. which distinguish one transaction from the next but often “free” or included in the price.\n\nPrice in marketing is still broader than the economists conception. It is as much as the total product i.e the amount of money paid to acquire a good or service plus the cost of guarantees, after sales services, maintenance, consultancy, delivery, credit etc.\nPrice plays a central role in economy as a whole. It balance demand and supply, provide an incentive for new product distributes income between buyer and sellers,  professionals consider price from two perspective which are consumer (suppliers or services of the product) and provider (services provided for a fee to product users). An organization that wants to provide a satisfactory marketing mix (product, price, place and promotion). The price of its product must be acceptable to target marketing members. Price has a direct impact on company profit and all other elements of the marketing mix. Thus, the price of a product can be on influence on how consumers perceive it and how prospective seller attempts to optimizing this return. He tries to deal with volume, cost and price but he cannot keep them all in the air at a time. If he increases the price of his product, his volume of sales will fall and if he reduces the price, the volume of sales will increase.\n\nThe main purpose of these study is to examine the activities of price and price change on the sales of consumer  products in Mr. foods, it would however, highlight the problems and prospect of price changes in other to provide possible solutions that would be beneficial  to the management.\nStatement of the problem\n\nThe issue of pricing decision and the effect of change in price is sensitive to both firms producing homogenous consumer goods and buyers of such products. On the part of the firms, it is only price that brings about revenue, as such a slight change in cost of  production lead to price increment while the buyers on the hand, price is among the major determinant of buying  or buying a product or services. In spite of the sensitivity of price, business organization tend to commit common mistakes in their pricing decision. This is evident in the way some organization frequently review their prices upwardly while others fixed their prices independently of other marketing mix element as well as their competitors. This has made so many firms in the consumer goods industry to close shop due to their inability to effectively compete. Hence, the effect of price change on the sales of consumer goods has cut the attention of business managers, captains of industries, consultants and scholars. As such the researcher sees the subject matter of this research worthy of investigation.\nTHE EFFECT OF PRICE AND PRICE CHANGES ON SALES OF CONSUMER GOODS",

Convert economic resources into wealth, things into good.\n\nAny business must find out what its market is, who the customer is, where he is, what he considers value, what his unsatisfied wants, how does he buy and how can he be reached, it is the duty of the company to provide what the customers need.\n\n       The main function of a company is marketing and innovation.  Marketing is distinguishing the unique function of the business.  A business is set apart from all other human organization by the fact that it market a product or service.\n\nAny organization that fulfils itself through\n\n1.    Marketing a product or service is a business and any organization in which marketing is either absent or incidental is not a business any should never be run as if  it were one.    The duty of marketing starts at the beginning rather than the end of the business because through its studied and researches will establish.  What the customer wants in a given period or season, what price he is willing to pay in a given product, have authority in product planning, innovation which is the last function of a business is the provision better and more economic goods and services.\n\nIt is not enough for the business to provide just any economic goods and services, it must provide a better an more economic ones. Innovation goes right through all phases of business it may be innovation in design, in product, in marketing techniques, in price or in service to the customer.\n\n       Therefore, to develop and market new products the correct approach must be used to ensure that new product does not fail in the market.\n\nThere are two important stages in the development of any product and introduction or commercialization of the new product into the market.\n\n1.    Many products have failed to make the expected impact on the consumers because the companies involved did not use the right strategies such as pricing, promotion and high product quality.\n\nThey forget that buyers and subjected to a\n\n2.    Wide range of complexities and quovles reaction those are hard to predict.  Their attitudes, dispositions, perceptions and motivations must be considered along with income and other demographic considerations. It is the belief of this researcher that the satisfaction of the customer’s needs, wants and desires should be first in the uppermost mind of the producers and not profit maximization.  Though they should achieve sufficient profit to cover the risks of their economic activities so that losses can be curtailed.  A company like Encristo Pharmaceutical Company limited should avoid making mistakes that may spell danger for its newly developed product by making use of the correct approach in both marketing, commercialization/introduction of the product into the market.\n\n       The Encristo Pharmaceutical Company Limited being one of the indigenous pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria licensed today to produce (OTC) over the counter drugs has been pushing vigorously its policy of developing and adding new and better products to its existing products line.  On  September 8, 1997.\n\nThe company introduced a new product known as “Cristolyn Cough Expectorant” into the Enugu market.  At the early stage, this product did not make the expected impact and the company did not give up.\n\nThe product has bee in the market for up.\n\n3.    To four years and now in evaluating the performance of the new product, one would like to know the extent of its acceptance by the consumers.\n\nWhat strategies were used by the company in introducing the product into the market and how effective these strategies have been . The company would like to equip itself with these data in order to ensure that its product strategies are effective that is why this research has been undertaken.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nEncristo Pharmaceutical Company Limited has been one of the oral liquid preparations.\n\nThe company wants to maintain the leadership position in this area and that is why it has a policy of developing new products to extend its product lines, depth and width.  In pursuing this policy, the company developed a new product which is called “CRISTOLYN COUGH EXPECTORANT”.\n\nThe new product was introduced in Enugu in September 1997 and has continued to be marker there till now.\n\n       In looking a the new product, one would like to know how it has faired since its introduction, into the market, what strategies were used in introducing it in Enugu metropolis, what strategies are being used now to market the same product, have these strategies been effective and have consumers accepted the new product.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY \n\n1.        To find out strategies which Encisto Pharmaceutical company limited used to introduce Cristolyn Cough expectorant in Enugu metropolis.\n\n2.        To determine if these strategies are effective\n\n3.        To ascertain if the new product is acceptable to the consumers.\n\n4.        To find at how distributors evaluates the new product\n\n5.        To recommend what the company would do to further enhance the marketing of this new product.\n\n1.4   SCOPE OF STUDY\n\n       This study was carried out in Enugu and centered on evaluating the effectiveness of the strategies by Encristo pharmaceutical company limited in introducing Cristolyn Cough Expectorant into the market.  The study also evaluated the extent of acceptance of this new product by the consumers.\n\n1.5   RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\n1.    Ho:  The strategies used in introducing Cristolyn Cough Expectorant in Enugu metropolis has been effective.\n\nHi:   The strategies used in introducing Cristolyn Cough expectorant in Enugu metropolis have been effective.\n\n2.

They are important to both organization and the employees. From the views of the employees it is seen that a good employees welfare activities will induce the employee to work hard and improve their general attitude rewards the organization and increase their level of production. But for the employee these benefits represent an extra income, additional security or more desirable working conditions that require no additional efforts.\n\n        In business organization, employers of labour have seen in employee welfare services as the ability of the sub-ordinate to contribute more to the achievement of the organizational goal, promote industrial relations so as to maintain industrial pace. It is also believed that good employees services activities will motivate and induce employee to work hard, thereby increasing their productivity level and improve the general employee morale, also enhance the public image of the organization.\n\n        French and Saward (1977:138-140) defined employee welfare services as something of who value apart from the agreed regular monetary payment of salaries and wages given an employee. In recognition of the workers need fulfillment function, they are variously called welfare services, welfare benefits, employee benefits and amenities. They are also known as pay or supplementary and non wages remuneration. As non-taxable income and expenses they are being called indirect compensation and non-tax benefits.\n\n        Employee are directly influenced by nature and quality of welfare services offered because they compare themselves with their counterparts in other organizations. Therefore, every organization should bear in minds that for them to achieve the objectives, the employee welfare services should be adequately competitive and focused towards solving the real needs of the employees.\n\n        Nwachukwu (1986:75) has shown that workers prefer increase in welfare service to increase in salaries especially during the period of inflation and rising prices, workers get frustrated and dis-satisfied when welfare services are in-adequate. But if the opposite obtains workers are satisfied and more committed to give their best to the achievement of the companies objectives apart from this, the organization is rendered impotent and managerial functions at planning organizing, directing and controlling become ineffective resulting from heavy loss if money, time and resources. \n\n1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM.\n\nWorkers or employees are often attracted into certain organization not only because of the pays packages that are stated in the advert but also because of the benefits attached to them. These benefits usually include housing, transport, medical, pension or retirement benefits to name but a few.\n\n        These attractions also constitute to considerable objectives for which such individuals make up their minds to these primary attractions of such individuals into the organization will certainly lower the morale as well as the efficiency of such individuals performance which will in turn effect on the organization’s productivity.\n\n        Example, where organization have been faced within increase agitation from the workers unions and staff association because of the inadequate employees welfare services, poor administration of the existing ones or total withdrawal of the existing. These dis-satisfaction expressions or administration of employee welfare services activities need proper investigation and examination in order to find a lasting solution to these numerous problems.\n\n        These assertions will be examined with respect to DHL International Nigeria Limited in Enugu State.\n\n1.3       THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY.\n\n1.   To determine the various employees benefits available in DHL International Nigeria Limited and how they affect the increase productivity of the employees.\n\n2.   To ascertain whether any of the benefits formally enjoyed by the employees in DHL International Limited Has been withdrawn. If so the affect on the loyalty of the employees.\n\n3.

To ascertain the problems, if any that is encountered by the company in administering the benefits to the workers.\n\n5.   To determine the effectiveness of employees performance.\n\n6.   To make recommendations based of this study on how to improve provision and administration of employee welfare activities in DHL if there is need to it.\n\n1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis research work is significance to the board, government, companies, private companies, research students, policy makers etc. who are interested in finding ways of improving moral and general welfare of the workers.\n\n        Another significance is that the preferred suggestions will have a direct impact in the company, thereby creating a conducive atmosphere and environment for the attainment of the organizations aims and objectives. The management and staff of DHL international Nigeria Limited would benefit immensely from any snag in the administration of the workers benefits and also show how best to implement the issue.\n\n        The research is also important to partial fulfillment for the award of National diploma (ND) in Marketing.\n\n1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.   Can increase productivity be gotten from employees when there is proper provision and administration of workers incentives program?\n\n2.   Have workers benefits scheme in “DHL” International Nigeria Limited any direct effects on the productivity level or loyalty of the employees?\n\n3.   To what extent has the employee benefits scheme been administered or implemented in “DHL”\n\n4.

The product mix or component is however not complete without packaging.\n\nThroughout the world, packaging plays a significant role in the protection presentation and promotion of consumer goods and durables; it helps in the storage, reduces damage and loss to good – in – transit and minimizes pilferagse.\n\nTraditionally, packages have been viewed in a very utilitarian fashion, that is, as a way of protecting the physical goods as it moves through the distribution channel. However, packaging in developing nation would sound to be out of place when we still see market women and traders wrap their wares with banana leaves, used newspapers, and green leaves. These traditional methods of packaging not with standing, the need for packaging is growing fast and cannot be overemphasized. In recent times, marketers have been conscious of the fact that packaging is important in the decision to purchase a product. Emphasis have therefore been shifted from the traditional belief of manufacturers that package is meant for protecting a product only. It can now be seen that in most of the super- market, various colourful and indigenous packages are used especially when the products are competing for attention.\n\nAccording to Onah  (1996) “ principle perspectives and practices” in  mass media and marketing communication edited by Dr. Ikechukwu Nwosu (1996), where a Survey was conducted in Nigeria, “ Usuable when Empty” dominated the elements of package appeal with 36.9% frequency of mention. When the respondents single girl who uses cosmetics, to enhance her beauty is packaging herself for greater acceptance by the wife- seeking bachelor”.\n\nThe aim of this research work therefore, is to examine the use of packaging as a promotional tool in the marketing of beauty care products. Also, it aims at finding out to what extent packaging influences behaviour and salient features that make it a potent respect of competition.\n1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS\n\nDespite the increasing popularity of packaging in the promotion of goods and services, one cannot but agree that there are areas or problems which need to be studied. Through some business organisations are now using packaging to promote their wares, yet many business orangisations in Nigeria concentrate their marketing effort on the traditional elements in the marketing mix. The performance of their marketing activities. The rate at which wares or products are being advertised, one may be forced to ask questions bothering on the use of packaging.\n\nIn the application of marketing mix, many companies are faced with one problem or the other. It will not be out of place that they are confronted with packaging related problems. Such problems among others may be the following.\n\nThere is the need to know whether packaging is a good promotional tool: whether it affects consumer buying decision, whether it projects the image of a company and whether its usage is a good compliment or substitute for advertisement. Does the package of a product constitute one of the determinants of seller of that products\n1.3    PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe main objective of this study is to critically assess the area of problems and seek to proper solutions.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to find out the impact of a change in the package of a product. The studies will find out among others, whether packaging has a positive effect on the buying habit and decision of consumers. To determine whether the company  image is being projected through it’s packaging policy. To what extent producers are considering packaging in their product decisions.\n\n1.4    RESEARCH QUESTION/HPOTHESIS:\n\nIn determining the use of packaging as a promotional tool in the marketing of beauty care products, some null hypothesis, otherwise known, as tentative statements have to be tested. It is only when such statements are tested by way of asking relevant questions that solutions could be offered, to likely problems in the study.\n\nWhen these tentative statements are tested and found to be correct, then, they are accepted where they are found to be otherwise, such statements are rejected.\n\nThe following tentative statements will therefore be tested to find out their validity.\n\n1.         H0:  A good package cannot serve as a substitute to advertising.\n\nHi   A good package can serve as substitute to advertising.\n\n2.         H02:  An attractive package does not create impulse buying.\n\nHi:  An attractive package does create impulse buying.\n\n3.         H03:  Packaging is not a silent salesperson.\n\nHi:  Packaging is a silent salesperson.\n\n4.         Ho4; A good packaging policy cannot help improve a brand\n\nImage.\n\nHi: A good packaging policy can help improve a brand image.\n\n5.         H05: A beautiful packaging design cannot attract consumes.\n\nHi:  A beautiful packaging design can attract consumers.\n1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY \n\nThis research work is significance in the sense that the outcome will go a long way to solve the research problems. It will show the importance of packaging as promotional tool, to both consumers and companies.\n\nTo the company, it will show the effect of packaging as a promotional tool in the marketing of their products.\n\nTo the consumers, it will show that package is part of the product brought by them.\n1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of this research work is narrowed to the use of packaging as an effective promotional tool in the marketing of beauty care products as it related to impulse buying, projecting company’s image and its effect as a silent salesperson. It will cover the marketing of beauty care products and effects of promotional efforts.\n\n1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nMarking is defined as human activity directed at satisfying needs and wants through exchange process (Kotler 1980:9).\n\n        Packaging is refers to as what is used to protect the product from damage shipping and handling and to lessen spoilage if the product is exposed to air or other elements.\n\nPromotion: This includes advertising sales promotion, publicity, personal selling and direct marketing (Adirika 2007),\n\nProduct:  A  product is defined as a good service, or idea consisting of a bundle of tangible and intangible attributes that satisfies consumers and received in exchange for money or some other unit of value (Kolter 2005:276)\n\n\nPACKAGING AS PROMOTIONAL TOOLS IN THE MARKETING OF BEAUTY CARE PRODUCTS\n",

The organisation, their role, their main function and goals, financing and organisation and also history of corruption and it’s definitions.\n\nBACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL (TI).\n\nTransparency international, briefly (TI), is a non-governmental organsiation with seat, acting world-wide, in Berlin which engages itself in national and international people and economical corruption fight and raising the awareness of it. This includes, but not limited to political corruption, it publishes yearly its corruption perception index, a comparative listing of corruption worldwide.\n\nTransparency international were created in 1993 in Berlin friends from all over the world engaged by the former director of world Bank Peter Eigen and developed in shortest time to one most influential non-profit and partly-political independent movement of the most recent time, which can be compared concerning it political influence, for instance with Attac or Amnesty international. The head office of Transparency international and Transparency International Germany are in Berlin1.\n\n          The cause for the establishment of the organisation was the idea, the world corruption, which had accepted unbelievable extents and effect in the time of the cold war to fight by independent influencing control of an outstanding and particularly control instance standing for itself.\n\nThe worldwide reasonance on the establishment of transparency international in the year 1993 was unexpected. The historical framework offered a favourable surrounding field. The old iron curtain was with the German  unit  finally  pleases,  the  core  of  the  European  union joined\n\nthemselves straight, the Gulf was in Iran and Iraq,  the  civil  war  in Yugoslavia humans for justice had sensitized and frame the U.S.A, “blew the democratic wind” the Clinton era. Much was ready in paying a new. The idea of transparency international fell on fruitful soil, however in response also defense and criticism provoked.\n\nPHILOSOPHY OF THE MOVEMENT AND IT’S PROCEEDINGS\n\nTransparency International already carry the basic concept in the name. In the variety of the different kind of corruption is according to the principles of the organisation as large common denominator, when solution, to prevent simple transparency in handling the things crucially, which it make possible, corruption leads into constructional courses. Because so paradoxically has from the point of view of this system also jedwede corruption in society and economics their sense. It is the symptoms for a malfunction in the system and if one liked to fight corruption, one must extract their fertile soil from her:\n\n●  by consistent disclosure and transparency of the things and linear path by current control by independent supervision\n\n●        by persuasive power and acceptance opposite concerning and authors.\n\n●        by careful selection and rotation of the personnel within the ranges concerned.\n\nMulti-eye principle with financial effective control decision Complete documentation, particularly in the assignment and procurement area.\n\n          Most corruption accusation take place under poverty suffer on international level in state (south America, Africa). One of these states formed a proper vicious circle from poverty and corruption, which from own Kraft of the states hardly more is to be broken through and it makes susceptible thereby for outside political influencing control. When the fact appear particularly paradoxical that a certain “corruption impact is already presupposed” in investment funds (usually 10% of the sum total).\n\nFinanced in development assistance project usually from tax funds to be the same country the corruption again. Hence, it most often in interest of foreign ruling powers or companies to promote the corruption in a country to induce if not straight, in order to enrich itself.\n\nThe beginning of transparency international is not confrontative but consenstative contrary to Amnesty international of Green peace, D. H. the government or to stand comparing head as supporters and aids on an equal footing in things corruption to the side and meet them with reason and understanding. A beginning that always does not become and pretty often in the cross fire of the criticism was gladly seen stands. Straight of others non-governmental organisation (NGO), like Attac or Green peace, those their popularity from the power of the mass and the road refer. Peter Eigen justifies this proceeding with his origin.\n\nSomeone like the director of the world Bank within the range East Africa nearly 25 years “more over the top” in the political, social and economic High Society operated, could demonstrate badly also over 60 years again with a protest poster before company building.\n\nIt had to continue, where it had stopped. Above in the executive floor, in addition, this explains the success of transparency international. Before scarcely 15 years in particularly citizen of Berlin Manson as bare vision based, applies for transparency international today as one of most successfully anti-corruption movement of the world, which operate in the meantime offices in over 90 states locally established national and chapters information. The work beginning of Transparency International is to work “from above” itself thus with the powerful ones made of government to set economics and society to a table and to convince it from the sinnhaftigkeit  the non-corruption to. At the soundest one thing is that corruption is simply expensive the argument convenience so far most frequently to co-operate in the context of the transparency international consultation with the responsible anti-corruption expert2.\n\nORGANISATION AND ROLE\n\nTransparency International (TI) as a group of some 100 national chapters, with an international secretariat in Berlin, Germany originally  founded in Germany in May 1993 as a not for profit organisation TI is now an international non-governmental organisation (NGO’s) and claims to be moving towards a completely democratic structure TI say  of itself.\n\nTransparency international is a global network, civil organisation leading the fight against corruption it brings people together in a powerful worldwide coalition to end the devastating impact of corruption on men, women and children around the world. TI’s mission is to “create change toward a world free of corruption”.\n\nTransparency international as a global network fighting corruption in national arena in number of ways. They bring together relevant player from government civil society, business and the media to promote transparency in elections, in public administration in procurement and in business. TI global network of chapters and contact also use advocacy campaign to lobby governments to implement anti-corruption reforms.\n\nPolitically non-partisan, TI does not undertake investigation of alleged  corruption  or  expose  individual  cases,  but  as time were work in coalition  with  organizations that do. It  develop tools in fighting corruption and work with other civil society organizations, companies and government to implement them. TI is a non-partisan and to build coalition against corruption. Transparency international has the skills tools, expertise and broad participation to fight corruption on the ground as well as though global and regional initiative.\n\nMAIN FUNCTIONS AND GOALS\n\n1.       it help design and implement system for financial and administrative oversight of grants and project of the Americas Department (one country and multi-country) and provides administrative and logistical support to two senior programmed  co-ordinators;\n\n2.       being the lead co-ordinator, including financial and administrative management and monitoring of activities and result of the grants provided to TI nations in the Americas through the TI Anti-corruption. Delivery change (AD:DC) global programmes; and\n\n3.       Provide lead logistical supervision and co-ordination of key regional meetings.\n\nThe works of Transparency International is around and demand in population; enterprises and politics. In order to arrange for example the annual corruption index of the countries questionnaires provided with questions how; Which sector are according to their opinion affected particularly by corruption? (with a valuation of 1 (corrupt free) to 5 (particularly corrupt) as strongly their life is affected by corruption? (with valuation scale 1 (not at all) totally).\n\nCredit it or a member of their household in the last 12 months in any form bribe paid? (Answer Yes or No). On the basis of these data monthly to be different topic diagrams for the different nations. In transparency international quarterly news type character (TIQ    ) are the intermediate result as well as other messages to seen order than booklet from TI to refer free of charge event and results approximately around the world to the homepage.\n\nIn the Annual report (annual report) the analyses and research result are combined into the previous year. Additionally single results are published about special (bribe payers survey corruption special brochure) separately.\n\nFINANCING AND ORGANISATION\n\nThe foreign officers are subject to bilateral and multilateral financing and organisation. The parent company transparency international attaches importance to the fact that the daughter offices as selfly-sufficient as possible in its respective homeland or operational areas to become active to be able to sense from country to country and from culture to culture other rules must be considered and be supposed. Also, the definition of corruption is individually made in each country.\n\nTransparency international sub-divide it national offices (national chapters) in groups as regional and working groups which can act drop referred also independently. TI avoids it to interfere directly into the interest of the national chapters and depends on their international work exclusive of their structural so the local civilian – social forces are to be mobilize and promoted.\n\nTransparency and success\n\nThe principal purpose is the idealistic vision of total and world wide eliminating of corruption. On the way to this vision TI could already obtain some success and partial success.\n\nInternational (except)\n\nChange of consciousness with worldwide organisation such as the world bank to prevent completely particularly advanced by their new president.\n\nWolfson worldwide convention against corruption at the United Nation’s (presented 2003 in Mexico)\n\nOEDC convention against the bribery of foreign sovereignty carrier of 1997, in which 34 hands  oneself export countries obligate, the bribery abroad by their export.\n\nConvention of the laws to national right can be accussed in Germany for a bribery abroad taken place and condemned also valuably.\n\nNational (except)\n\nDevelopment of evaluation of the OECD convention in German right and demand of the development and application of anti-corruption laws. Thus TI Germany submitted a detail statement June 2003 for the phase II of monitoring process and fighting corruption conditions.\n\nInfluencing control on the formulation of the tax adjustment law TI pursues the goal that the practice of fiscal authorities follow clear the will of legislator and de-facto-removability of bribe payment is not waited at home and aboard.\n\nSince the beginning of year 1999 opposite TI and TI-Germany the OECD, the European Union and the federal Government was active, in order to reach the export credit and institutions for export insurance of the OECD member states (the ECAS) may not have cover export traders, if they care by bribe payments or corruption for a long time is tried to obtain by clear regulations for the public export credit promotion an internationally effective basis3.\n\nTransparency international’s biggest success has been to put the topic of corruption on the world’s agenda international institution such as the world Bank and the international monetary fund (IMF) now view corruption as one of the main obstacle for development, whereas prior to the 1990’s this topic was broadly discussed. TI furthermore, played a vital role in the introduction of the United Nation convention against corruption and the OECD Anti-Bribery convention4 .\n\nCORRUPTION PERCEPTION INDEX (CPI)\n\nThe Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) besides the world Bank corruption index is the most commonly used measured for corruption in countries worldwide. To form this index, Transparency international complies survey’s that ask businessman and analysists book in and outside the countries their analyzing, their perceptions of how a country is. Relying on he numbers of actual corruption cases would not work since law and enforcement of law differ significantly from country to country.\n\nHISTORY OF CORRUPTION\n\nThe history of corruption is as old as the world because ancient civilization have traces of widespread illegality and corruption thus, lipset and Lenz5 (2000) not that” corruption has been ubiquitous in complex societies from ancient Egypt, Israel and Greece down to the present”. Corruption is also believed to be in any continent, region, and ethnic group. It cut across faith religious denominations and all system and affects both young and old, man and woman alike. Corruption is found in democracy and dictatorial politics feudal, capitalist and socialist economics, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist culture are equally bedeviled by corruption. This does not, however mean that the incidence and magnitude of corrupt activities are the same in every society. Some countries are more corrupt than others. “As George Orwell notes in his read book, Animals farm. All animals are equals, but some animals are more equal than others6.\n\nThough, (corruption) seen as global phenomenon but it is more devastating to the developing economic and to the so-call “Third world”.\n\n However, corruption is pandemic in Nigeria and in many other African and Asian Countries, their leaders as well as the followers are corrupt. The problem of corruption is traceable to the debauchery of colonial rule (Ekeh 1975, 1985 Osaghare 1988) 7\n\nAmong the theories of Africa politics that has help to understand the predicament and more importantly the issue of endemic corruption, include theory of two publics developed by Peter Eke. Prebandalism popularized by Richard Joseph and Gurnal Myrdals soft state thesis. Others have captured Africa as a rentier, patrimonial and neopatrimonial state. These theories are important not only to understand the predicament in Africa countries but also providing explanation for the pandemic corruption ravaging Africa countries.\n\nEkeh (1975, 1985), argued that one most striking impacts of colonialism was the emergence of two public realm. The primordial and civil public realism which related differently with the private realm in terms of morality. For Nigeria, Eke (1975) argued: only right i.e. benefits\n\nare expected from the state by its citizens who own duties or responsibilities to a native sector. The former forms the basis of an amoral civil public realm and the later a public was concerned with illegitimate and exploitative colonial rule and had no moral linkages with the private realms. It was an amoral public realm in which cheating the system was considered a patriotic duty (Ifidon 1996; 162).\n\nLet consider the word corruption and what do we mean by corruption?\n\nPeter (1978) identified three dimensional approaches to the definition. These are definitions based on legal criteria, public opinion and public interest. From the legal perspective, political corruption is connected to any behaviour that violates some formal standard or rule of behaviour set down by a political system for its public officials. For example 8Nye (1967:419) conceives political to mean an act which “deviates” from the formal duties of public role because of private regarding (personal, close family, clique)  pecuniary  or  status  gains; or violates rule  against  the  exercise of  certain  types  of  private  role-\n\nregarding influence”. This definition includes behaviour such as bribery (use to prevent the judgment of a person into a position of trust)’ nepotism (bestowal of purpose reason of inscriptive relationship rather than merit and the misappropriation (illegal appropriation of public resources for private uses. ( Banfield 1961).\n\nAnother classic perception of corruption is that of Rogow and Laswell (1963: 132-133) for them corruption is taken to be a violation of the public interest. The definition is also lacken to ambiquitous because public interest like public opinion is difficult to determine.\n\n          Brinkerhoff (2000:241) see “corruption as subsuming wide variety of illegal, illicit, irregular and/or unprincipled activities and behaviours”. From this perspective, corruption then is importantly a moral, political and legal issue.\n\nIn this context, corruption is a multi-conceptual that has legal, social, political, economic and ethnical connotations. It comes in various forms, it simply conceived in this as misuse, or improper use of power and influence, deliberately and consciously for personal aggrandizement\n\nor group advantage. In this sense, corruption connotes the abuse of public role or resources or the use of illegitimate forms of political power and influence by public or private practice. Conceived in this manner, corruption is inextricably tied (but not limitedly) to politics, more especially i.e. politics defined from Harold Lasswell tradition of “who get what when and how” and perhaps how much. The struggle over resources otherwise known as” National cake: in the Nigeria society has taken a debilitating approach permitting all forms of corruptions. The idea that the “national cake” is meant to be shared rather than baked, by the various ethnic group that constitute Nigeria Federation provides a fertile group for the kleptomaniac elites to siphon the public fund9.\n\n          Corruption has been a major cause of injustice in society, where greedy and selfish people pervert the norms of society, that guider its well-being. Recent world attention on corruption is due to evidence abounding that corruption damaged the fabric of society in many ways. It makes governments and communities uneconomic, unstable and unsafe. Most crisis in Africa is caused as a result of corruption, Nigeria in Particular is embedded by corruption. Bribery which is the most popular form of corruption has rendered government uneconomic and ungovernable. Bribery encourages unfair advantages and renders competition, a features of democratic struggle invalid. By receiving bribes. People in authority abuse trust. In some countries in Africa, bribery is so rampant that it has gain social acceptance as a way of doing business. In other countries like Nigeria bribery has become endemic and a (necessary) way of life, for public officials as a way of earning additional incomes. This has led to extortion of bribes from the public and people need to pay these extortion bribes to pursue business or personal well-being10.\n\nBy far the most destructive form of corruption in Africa is perpetrated by the rich who seek excessive riches and adopt extravagant lifestyle to the extent that it significantly affects the well-being of society.  It  is  this  type of  corruption  that African leaders have  been  identified  with  and  which has worsened their human crisis\n\nsituation;.

Many business have been operated with merely a single entry memorandum record of transactions and others with no records whatever, except possible cheque stubs.  As a result, business decisions are based on quesses and intruition. Ola (1985).\nIn todays economy information and accountability have assumed a larger role in our society.  This is why it is statutory company and allied matte decree (1990), for all registered companies in the country to prepare and present financial statements in accordance to the relevant accounting regulations.\nBusiness organizations have to analyze their financial statements or accounts by way of interpretation, simplification and transaction of facts and data contained in the financial statement.\nThe essence of this is to draw relevant conclusions, make inference as to the business operations financial positions and future prospects of the organizations.\nIn the assessment of the performance of an organization, an imfortant area of management control is post factor assessment of financial results of the organization as a whole, that is the examination in retrospect of the financial effects of earlier decisions to invest.  Management must reoularly commit resources for both long term and short term purposes and because the commitment will always involve risk, or cargul assessment of the anticipated results of any project on the financial position should be made before a decision is taken, and before resources are irrevocably committed.\nA periodic evaluation is needed, after resources have been invested, to report what has been achieved, to examine amount of the profit, or the extent of the loss, and to consider the effect of implementing the plan on the financial statement of the business, in particular to note whether financial stability has been maintained or alternatively the extent to which it has been impaired.  Information on all these aspect of the finances of the business is needed to permit management to assist the quality of past decisions at strategic level and the effectiveness with which they have been implemented.  Finally, it is important that informed base of financial knowledge should be developed from which future activities can be planned.\nAn important purpose of the appraisal of results is to confirm whether or not the project has produced the expected cash flow.\nThe main function of the financial account of a business however is to measure the results in terms of profitability and it is on the basis of success or failure measured in these terms that management will be juged.\nIn carrying out an analysis of accounts, a number of issues must be considered and conclusion formed thereon.\nThese includes:\n1.                  Profitability of the business operation, particularly in relation to the capital employed.\n2.                  Solvency of the firm:  the ability of the business to pay its creditors, the adequacy of its working capital and the current liabilities.\n3.                  the business trend:  the analysis of the point term of business over a time to determine whether profit are rising or falling and the implication for future performance .\n4.                  The financial stability of the business, particular attention being paid to the firm’s limit of borrowing power, available resources to finance expansion and the volume of earnings.\n5.                  the gearing and the cover which is an assessment of the adequacy of profit to meet up with interest payments, pay dividends to share holders and provide sufficient safety to share holders investment.\n1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS:\nIn Nigeria today most business are facing hard times which is a reflection of the bad shape of the economy.  Government on its own has been making different efforts aimed at reviving the economy.  Among the government efforts are the encouragement  of the growth of small and medium term industries and also for people to invest in some of the public enterprises that have been stated for either full or partial privatization or commercialization.\nUnfortunately, business cannot grow reasonably under a crude business practice as most business men and investors in our society are yet to understand the need for financial statements probably, this is one of the reasons why some businesses are operating without even a book-keeper not to talk of an accountant.  Decisions are taken based on intuition dereferences made only to their cash –box perhaps they feel that this is a way of safe wording their business secret.\nSecondly is the problem of loan securing.  Most businesses operate with a very poor capital.  This makes growth difficult, if not impossible.  Instead of growing they are declining as the result of their poor capital base :& so as there is non-existent of financial statements, they are not qualified for bank loan.\nThirdly is the some investors and business operators can not understand the interpretation technique of the financial statements, because of this problem, they try to do without it, as if it its not important.\nFourthly is the problem of high cost of consultancy services.  Since most businesses are small or medium term in size, it becomes hard for them, judging their capital base to rely on the services of the consultancy firms for their financial statements need.  The implication of this is that business decisions are bound on luck even in some cases, people resort to Native sectors to help make their businesses grow.\n1.3              OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\nThe objectives of this study includes the following:\n1.                  To examine the ways the financial statements can help in the growth of businesses.\n2.                  To examine how the financial statement are interpreted.\n3.                  To analyse how the financial statements are used for performance evaluation.\n4.                  To examine the importance of the financial statements for investment purposes.\n5.                  To examine the level of reliance placed on the financial statements by investors.\n1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThis study is very essential to various classes of people in the area of business.\nFirstly, the study will go a long way in helping both the existing and potential entrepreneurs and management of business organization towards the undertaking and the knowledge of the uses of the financial statements for the expansion of their businesses.\nSecondly, this will be an opportunity to the creditors financials and suppliers, to study the usage of the financial statements in estimating the risk of entering into bad debts in their transactions with business organization.\nThirdly, in a free economy oriented society like Nigeria, this study will help investors to know the basic factors in the financial statements that will help them to decide on whether to invest or disinvest.\nFourthly, is the corporate lawyer and Bankers.  By this study they can understand more about the statement of affairs of business entities.\nFinally, the students both the undergraduate and the post graduate students of Business Administration are in better position to benefit not just per academic exercise, but at least, to be able to understand the interpretation of the financial statement.\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE FIRMS UNDER STUDY\n1.5              BONS NIGERIA LIMITED\nThis is a manufacturing company which started with the manufacture of Bons Semolina.

The Hausas of Northern Nigeria were paying taxes, though in kind, to the Emir in return for security and common services. However, with the advent of the colonialists, direct taxation was introduced in 1904 by Sir Lord Lugard, the then British appointed Governor. Its implementation started first in the North and later in the Southern and Eastern regions.\n\nAccording to Ezejelue and Ihendinihu (2006) taxation can be defined as the demand made by the government of a country for a compulsory payment of money by the citizens of the country with the objective of raising revenue, satisfy collective wants of the people and regulate economic and social policies.\n\nAguolu (1999:17) defined capital allowance as expenditures deducted from profits before taxation to reduce the effect of taxation and thus encourage savings and investment. These capital allowances can come in form of expenses on assets, investments and other noncurrent assets/activities of the organization.\n\nThese capital allowances are however backed by various Government legislations. They are granted to enhance the growth and development of industries as well as empowering individuals and corporate taxpayers economically. This work will therefore focus on Capital allowances and their effect on small-scale industries with emphasis on selected small-scale industries in Nigeria, using Rivers State as a case study.\n\nThe modern day taxation and its use as a fiscal policy could be traced to 1926, which was a year of economic depression in Great Britain. During this period, Britain witnessed an unprecedented decline in her overall economic activities resulting to reduction in total earnings, shortage of fund in the private sector and reduced income per capital with attendant low standard of living. The effect of this depression was felt not only in Britain but almost the world over. Governments at this time were trying to revive, rehabilitate and mobilize enough capital to provide for economic and social expenses and to raise the standard of living of its populace. In doing this, various fiscal policies were formulated which include taxation.\n\nAccording to Aguolu (1999: 1); taxation may be defined as a compulsory levy by Government through its agencies on the income, consumption and capital of its subjects. These levies are made on personal income such as salaries, business profits, interests, dividends, discounts and royalties. They are used to provide security, social amenities and create conditions for the economic well being of the society. The main purpose of taxation according to Ola (1998:14) is to raise funds to meet Government’s expenditure and to redistribute wealth and management of the economy.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe objective of granting capital allowances and incentives to small and medium scale enterprises is to enhance their growth and development, thus contributing to the overall economic development of the country. But the objective cannot be achieved in a situation where the would-be beneficiaries are not even aware of the existence of such incentives. Moreover, the few who are aware of these incentives do not even bother to apply for them due to the poor and inefficient tax administration. Therefore, there is the need to proffer solutions to these problems to ensure the growth and development of our economy.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe main objective of this study is to examine the effect of capital allowances on the performance of small and medium scale businesses in Nigeria. Specific objectives of the study are:\n\n1.  To identify capital allowances available to SMEs in Nigeria.\n\n2.  To examine the level of taxpayers’ awareness of the existence of capital allowances.\n\n3.  To examine the effect of capital allowances on the profit after tax of small and medium scale businesses in Nigeria.\n\n4.  To determine the relationship between capital allowances and growth of small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria.\n\n        1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nThe following research questions will be considered in this study:\n\n1)  What are the Capital allowances available to small scale enterprises in Nigeria?\n\n2)  What is the level of taxpayers’ awareness of the existence of these incentives?\n\n3) What effects do Capital allowances have on after tax profits of small scale enterprises?\n\n4)  Is there any relationship between Capital allowances and the growth of small scale enterprises in Nigeria?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES         \n\nIn order to ascertain the effect of Capital allowances on the performance of small-scale enterprises, the following hypotheses have been formulated:\n\n        Ho1:  Capital allowances do not have any significant effect on the after tax profits of small-scale industries.\n\nHo2:   Capital allowances do not enhance the growth of small scale enterprises.\n\n1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe research will be of benefit to the government – policy makers and tax revenue authorities. It will provide a framework for the critical evaluation of tax policies, provides a basis for the modification of tax incentive design and identify loopholes in the present tax system that serves as disincentive to investment.\n\nIt will also benefit other researchers, forming a basis for further research on the subject in future. The study also gives a clear insight into the various ways in which tax policies in Nigeria can be executed efficiently to still favor small businesses and how some taxation policies in Nigeria can be properly tackled. The study also gives a clear insight into the various causes of why small businesses fail in Nigeria as well as the challenges of the tax policies in Nigeria. The findings and recommendations of the researcher will help in building a strong and better tax policy system in Nigeria, if taken seriously by government and the general public. The challenges of taxation in Nigeria are outlined in-order for drastic measures to be taken to tackle these challenges and meet the prospects of the general public so that revenue from tax policy to the government can be increased.\n\n1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study covers various capital allowances in assets such as buildings, vehicles, plants and machineries, and how they affect performance of small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria, using selected small and medium businesses in Rivers state.\n\n1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe only limitation faced by the researcher in the course of carrying out this study was the delay in getting data from the various respondents. Most respondents were reluctant in filling questionnaires administered to them due to their busy schedules and nature of their work. The researcher found it difficult to collect responses from the various respondents, and this almost hampered the success of this study.\n\n1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nCapital Allowance: Thisrefers to sums of money a business can deduct from the overall corporate or income tax on its profits. These sums derive from certain purchases or investments etc.\n\nSME: Small and Medium Scale Enterprise\n\nPerformance: The accomplishment of a given task measured against preset known standards of accuracy, completeness, cost, and speed. In a contract, performance is deemed to be the fulfillment of an obligation, in a manner that releases the performer from all liabilities under the contract\nEFFECT OF CAPITAL ALLOWANCES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES\n",

It is a state of discord caused by the actual or perceived opposition of needs, values and interests.1 It exist whenever incompatible activities occur. An activity that is incompatible with another is one that prevents, blocks or interferes with the occurrence or effectiveness of the second activity.\n\nThe incompabitlity or differences may exist in reality or may only be perceived by the parties involved. Nonetheless, the opposing actions and the hostile emotions are very real hallmark between people in all kind of human relationship and in al social settings. As a result of the wide range of potential differences between people, the absence of conflict usually signals the absence of meaningful interaction2. A conflict can be as small as a perceived disagreement or as large as war. It can originate in the person, between two or more people or between two or more groups. Conflict by itself is neither good nor bad but the manner in which conflict is handled determines whether it is constructive or destructive.\n\nA conflict is different from competition and cooperation because in competitive situations, the two or more individuals or parties have mutually inconsistent goals as either party tries to reach its goals, it undermine the attempt of the others to reach theirs. Therefore, competitive situations will by their nature cause conflict. Conflict can also occur in cooperative situation, in which two or more individuals or parties have consistent goals because the manner in which one party tries to reach its goal may undermine the other individual or party.3\n\nA clash of interests, values, action or directions often sparks a conflict and conflict is also seen as the existence of the clash. The world ‘conflict’ is applicable from the instant the clash occurs. Even when it is described as a potential conflict, it is implying that there is already conflict of direction even though a clash has not occurred. As a result, conflict can occur whenever there is interaction. Leo Otoide describe this situation in the international system thus:\n\nWhen states interact there is competition for power and prestige and in the process, the international system elicits a picture of perpetual conflict, of survival of the fittest, where the desire for power and influence determines the attitudes of states and the course of events.4\n\nConflict occurs in different levels. The first is interpersonal conflict. Interpersonal conflict is when two people have incompatible needs; goals, or approaches in their relationship.5 Communication breakdown is often an important source of interpersonal conflict and learning communication skills is valuable in preventing and resolving such difficulties. At the same time, very real differences occur between people that cannot be resolved by any amount of improved communication. Personality conflict refers to very strong differences in motives, values or styles in dealing with people that are not resolvable. For instance, if both parties in a relationship have a high need for power and both want to be dominant in the relationship, there is no way for both to be satisfied, and a power struggle ensures common tactics used in interpersonal power struggles includes the exaggerated used of reward and punishments, deception and evasion, threats and emotional blackmail and flattery or integration. Unresolved power conflict usually recycles and escalates to the point of relationship breakdown and termination.6\n\nThe next level of conflict is intergroup conflict. It occurs between collections of people such as ethnic or racial groups. It can also be a conflict between departments or levels of decision making in the same organizations. Another common source of inter-group conflict is the competition for scarce resources between groups in a nation or between union and management staff of the same organization.7 One characteristics of intergroup conflict is that group members tend to develop stereotypes beliefs of the opposing group. They also tends to blame them for their problems and lastly, tends to practice discrimination against them.8 These classic symptom of intergroup conflict is especially tenced and prone to escalation and intractability when group identities are threatened.9\n\nAnother level of conflict is multi-party conflict. It occurs in society when different interest groups and organizations have varying priorities over resource management and control as well as policy development. These complex conflict typically involve a combination of economic, value and power sources. This complexity is often beyond the reach of traditional authoritative or adversarial procedures, and more collaborative approaches to building consensus are required for solution.10\n\nThe last level of conflict is supranational conflicts. These are conflicts that involves states or in which one of the parties is a state. There are three common types of supranational conflicts, they include conflict involving maritime boundaries, dispute involving land and investor-state conflict also known as investment treaty dispute.\n\nIn resolving supranational conflict, it is important to bear in mind that unlike other conflicts, it is likely to arise out of a treaty. For example a maritime delimitation disputes may be govern by the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS III) or an investor-state dispute which is guided by the international settlement of the investment dispute convention. The court is also to apply international conventions, international customs and the general principles of laws recognized by the nations or parties in question.11\n\nRegardless of the level of conflict, there are different approaches to deal with the incompabilities that exist between the parties. If conflicts are managed creatively, solutions that are mutually satisfactory to both parties are attainable. It may involve a new distribution of resources or forms of influence than before. Creative outcome are more probable when the parties are inter-dependent, that is each having some degree of independence or autonomy from which to influence one another, rather than one party being primarily dependent on the other.12 Given inter-dependence, three general strategies have been identified that one parties make take towards dealing with their conflict. These include win-lose, lose-lose, and win-win.\n\nThe win-lose approach is a strategy that forced the other side to capitulate. Sometimes, this is done through socially acceptable mechanisms such as majority vote, the authority of the leader, or the determination of a judge. Sometimes, it involves secret strategies, threat, innuendo – whatever works is acceptable that is Mechanuallian principle in which the end justify the means. The value outcome is to have a victor who is superior and vanquished who withdraw in shame.13\n\nThe lose-lose strategy is exemplified by smoothing over conflict or by reaching the simplest of compromises. In neither case is the creative potential of productive resolution realized or explored. This is base on the notion that disagreement is inevitable and thus is the better to split the differences or smooth over difficulties in a painless a way as possible. Each party gets some of what it want.\n\nThe win-win approach is a conscious and systematic attempt to maximize the goals of both parties  through collaborative problem solving. The conflict is seen as a problem to be solved rather that war to be won. This method focus on one problem from the perspective of both parties and the needs as well as constraints of both parities rather short term accommodations. Communication is open and direct rather than selective and calculating. Attitudes and behaviours are directed toward an increase of trust and acceptance rather than an escalation or suspicion and hostilities.14\n\nThere are two methods of conflict resolution – the authoritative and the alternative methods.\n\nThe first approach under the authoritative methods of conflict resolution is the use of power. The stronger side promotes its interest by force regardless of interests of the other parties. There is another case of use of power in conflict resolution. In this case, some issues are won by one side while other issues are won by one other sides, both parties make no agreement but push through their interest forcefully regardless of interest of each other.15\n\nDecision made by authority is another strategic under the authoritative methods of conflict resolution. In this system, an authority interferes in a conflict and makes a decision based on his judgement of what is the best solution for the conflicting parties.16In many cases such solution also satisfy the interest of that authority. This is different from arbitrage. The role of the arbiter is to work as an independent third party, who hear both conflicting sides, finds legally correct solution based on valid legislation and then communicate such decisions to the disputants.17 Lastly under the authoritative methods of conflict resolution is the decision of a court. Under this, a judge or jury decide a solution to a conflict based on evidence supplied by attorneys representing both conflicting sides of the issue. The judge or jury then interpret the law and use it as a basis for their decision which both parities will be forced to respect, the jury is composed of either laymen or professional judges.\n\nFirst, under the alternative methods of conflict resolution is facilitation.18 In this process, a facilitator works as an impartial third party person who helps two conflicting parties direct their discussion in order to reach an agreement satisfactory to both side according to previously agreed rules. The Latin world facilatare means to ease. Therefore, the role of a facilitator is to provide both side with such methods and guidelines for discussion which will ease their communication. In mediation, the mediator is a third party and primarily a facilitator who seeks to established or restore communication between feuding parties. The mediator strives to bring the parties face to face to negotiate and this constitutes a vital objective of his endeavous, the mediator must have good influence, credibility and good standing with the parties. Above all, he must have good diplomatic skill.19\n\nAnother method of conflict resolution is conciliation which is similar to mediation except for the legal distinction that the third party is a commission or an international body whose aid has been sought in finding a solution satisfactory to the disputants.\n\nArbitration is a step further tan a fact finding mission since it involves the practical examination of the issues involved in a crisis and the decision is binding on the parties. Often a tribunal is set up to examine the issues and make recommendation to a superior body.20\n\nAdjudication or judicial settlement is a process of submitting to an international covert for decision. Unlike arbitration, the covert is subjected to no preliminary litigations upon its procedures, evidence to be considered or legal principles to be applied except those stated at the statute by which it was created.21\nCONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA: THE ROLE OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY\n",

Thus it is considered the oldest African independent State except Ethiopia. Liberia is the only state in Sub-Sahara Africa that was never subject to colonial rule1.\n\nBefore the immigration, which led to the creation of Liberia, the largely forested area now covered by the Liberia state was people by various Ethnic groups that form the overwhelming majority of the population today.  Monrovia was founded in 1822 by black America colonists sent by the American colonization society. Monrovia and other settlements founded by the American colonization society were never ruled by the U.S government.\n\nThe American Liberia fought war for nearly a century with indigenous people, whom they called “Aborigines or Tribesmen”.  Among the America Liberians there was a power struggle between the “Mulatoes” or people of partly white birth, of whom president Roberts and Tubman was the leading members and those of pure African dissent2.\n\nIn 1944 William U.S. Tubman (1895-1971) a lawyer and senator, became president.  He held office for 27 years.  President Tubman made considerable progress towards reducing the legal and effective discrimination between America Liberians and “Tribesmen”.  Political rights were extended to the latter.  But under Tubman the supreme power of America Liberia of their few Aristocratic families, and of the True Wig Party (TWP was left unchanged).  There were very few tribe ministers under him.\n\nTubman died in Britain on July 23 1971 he was strongly anti Communist, though he allowed the opening of relations with the USSR in 1956.\n\nOn the death of Tubman, Vice President William Tolbert automatically succeeded him.  He was re-elected in 1975 and 1979.  But announced that he would not stand again in 1983.  President Tolbert frequently showed concern for the ordinary people. Among the many official slogans which were a distinguishing features of his regime was “Mat to Mattresses”3.\n\nIn 1979 Dr Tolbert showed the fairness and sense of justice for which he has come to be reputed by refusing to grant reprieve to two men of top America Liberian elite, son of true Wig Party (TWP) Chairman James Anderson and of former Vice President Yancy Sentenced to death.\n\nFrom 1977 the close relations between Liberia and Sierra Leone were strengthened by the Mano River Union, under which major projects were agreed on to develop closer link.  In 1975 Joined the new Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS).  A Liberian Dr A Romeo Horton was managing Director of ECOWAS fund.\n\nRelations with other countries were little changed under President Tolbert close relations with the U.S.A were illustrated by the big reception given to president carter on his visit in May 1978.\n\nThe 1970 was one such period of economic difficulty it was also a decade that witnessed the initiation of a national discussion of issues of social justice and equality and of the imperatives of democracy.  Inquiring opposition groups emerged to engage the government.  .  The leadership of President Tolbert (1971 – 80) was problematic oscillating between a disposition to change and the maintenance of the status quo.  A political vacuum was created.\n\nOn April 12 1980, a military coup was staged under the leadership of Samuel Doe, and for the first time the indigenous groups were in power.  President Doe filled his ranks with people from his own ethnic group, the Krahns4.\n\nGiven the unprecedented nature of the coup and the excesses of its violence, as well as the unwillingness of the conservative elements of the old order to accept change, there were many observers who concluded that the act was revolutionary and that a profound social transformation would be sent in train.  Others asserted that Liberia has experienced de-colonization from “black colonialism”.  The meaning of this admittedly historic event was that the way was now clear for the replacement of settler minority rule by indigenous majority rule.5\n\nBut such a hopeful prospect was not to be, Liberia was too heavy with history to conform to what has proven to be simplistic assumption about it politics and society.  Following a period of initial uncertainty by an inexperience military government and it civilian political enablers (the movement for justice in Africa (MOJA) and people progressive party (PPP).\n\nThe process of sorting out the imperative of a return to civilian rule was soon under way.  Largely in response to pressure from the U.S government which was bankrolling the military regime in keeping with America Cold War requirement, a new constitution was drafted, approved through referendum, and under it election was held on the 15th October 19856.  There is ample documentation that the elections were rigged and that the incumbent military leader, Doe, who was declared the winner of the presidency actually stole the election.\n\nWith the elections fraud endorsed by the American administration on the protest that such was the way of Africa politics.7.\n\nDeep disappointment set in.  General Quinwonkpa attempted his coup and its failure cost him his life, Brutal and massive repression ensued Liberia of Wimba Origin bore the brunt of Does brutality because of the slaine General Quinwonkpa’s country of origin8. \n\nOn December 24 1989 a small group of rebels attacked the border town of Butuo in Nimba County as a first step towards the overthrow of the Doe government.  The rebels were the National patriotic front of Liberia (NPFL) headed by Charles Taylor.\n\nIn February, a split led by Prince Y Johnson a military veteran and a number of the Gio tribe developed with the NPFL. Declaring that he did not want power.  Johnson formed independent National patriotic front of Liberia and accused Taylor of being a socialist backed by Libya.\n\nAll move to peace talks achieve nothing.  The NPFL vowed there would be no cease fire nor ECOWAS peace keeping in Liberia until Doe resigns9.\n\nDr Amos Sawger former professor of the University of Liberia was elected Interim president.  Taylor (along with other Liberian forces) refused to work with the interim government and continued fighting. Johnson forces captured and killed Doe on September 9, 1990, while paying visit to general Quinoo at Monrovia freepot.\n\nThe initial insurgency developed shortly there after into large – scale gang warfare, where groups fought to control the rich mineral resources of the country.  Such as timber, diamonds, gold and Iron ore.  The warlords used those resources to enrich themselves and the continue access to the resources also enable them to continue waging war.  There were eight main factors involved in the civil war, which came to involve intra fractional fighting and splits with several warring factions, all this added to the complexity of this conflicts10.  However efforts were made to resolve the conflict, and no fewer than fourteen peace agreements were signed in the period 1990 and onwards.  The Abuja 11 peace agreement was the fourteen and was to settle the conflict.\n\nElection followed in 1997 and the former warlord Charles Taylor won over 75 percent of the vote and was elected President of Liberia.\n\nHowever, the period preceding the election was fraught with uncertainty and there have been reports that people were threatened with reprisals if they did not vote for Taylor.  In addition Taylor was in control of the only media station in the country, which made it difficult for the political opposition to make it voice heard.  He was also in a strong army, which gave the capacity to continue war if it were to lose.  One explanation put forward for the massive support given to Taylor in election is that the people of Liberia were war weary after seven years of civil war and gently seeking peace.  It is perhaps telling that Taylor in his election campaign successfully used the slogans “He kill my Ma, he killed my Pa, but I will vote for him11.  While the elections were reported to have been free and fair according to international observers, voices have been raised claiming that the election process was flawed, and in the post civil war period there have been continue allegation of Taylor striking to his practices of warlordism.\n\nAs mentioned above although the civil war ended and Taylor came to power, Liberia continued to experience armed conflict.  Taylor’s AFL are engaged in fighting with the rebel group LURD. \n\nEver since dissident of the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) launched an attack, to topple the government of Liberia, the whole region was again put on edge.  The rebels sprung their invasion from neighbour Guinea, occupying towns and villages in the boarder country of Lofa and giving government forces troops a blood nose.\n\nGovernment of rebel – turned – president Charles Taylor has been faced with growing casualties.  The embattled president called on all able bodied Liberians to take up arms and defend the state against it enemies.  The call was partly headed by Taylor’s loyalist.\n\nThe leader of LURD has been identified as Mohammed Siaboso Jumandy, a Liberian business man whose father is Mandingo and mother Khran, both ethnic groups which are fiercely opposed to Taylor’s regime.  LURD members say Jumandy is the movement chairman12.\n\nTaylor has ruled Liberia with an Iron fist.  His special security services and anti-terrorist unit have terrorized actual and perceived opponents, and many of these cases have been documented by human rights watch and amnesty international. Political opponents have either been killed or forced into exile.\n\nBut the trouble for Taylor was far Fran over.  Apart from the internal conflict that threatens his administration, the Liberian leader was under international to stop his backing of the RUF13.  RUF is a rebel force in Liberia, which traded diamond for weapons and manpower, keep the war going in Sierra Leone.\n\nAnd also there was called for the imposition of travel ban on members of Taylor’s government as well as the freezing of overseas accounts.14\n\nOn August 11, 2003 under intense U.S and international pressure President Taylor resigned office and departed in exile in Nigeria.  On October 11, 2005 presidential and legislative elections and subsequent November 8, 2005 election were held Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.15\nUNITED NATIONS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA",

Economists call these damages externalities because their costs typically fall not on the firms that discharge the wastes but on those that suffer the damages. Consequently, accounting systems don't ascribe these costs to their sources or even record them systematically (Ashford, Ayers and Stone,2000).\n\nIncreasingly, however, companies are being forced to internalize these environmental costs, either through stricter environmental regulations or through liability for damages caused to others. Accurate measurement of a company's true environment-related costs now offers a wide range of benefits: It provides management with a benchmark for tracking performance relative to peers or its own past performance. It can also serve as an external benchmark for investors concerned about the environmental performance of companies as well as their finances (Bartik, 2007).\n\nThis research work therefore examines environmental cost measurement and its effects on investment return in United Cement company, Calabar. This becomes important, because it can serve as a measure of a company's environmental exposure and the financial risk originating in its environmental performance. True cost estimates the firm's emissions and wastes by using the firm's own information sources or others, then assigns each category of emissions a monetary value by multiplying its physical quantity by a notional price based on economic estimates of the marginal damages of an additional ton of emissions (Caves, Christensen, and Diewert ,1982a).\n\n1.2 Statement of the problem\n\nIn order to see if a company is viable as a going concern, environmental costs are vital to know for the long-run. The benefits to preserve the environment in terms of investment returns may be surprising. One of the growing global concerns is the issue of lack of awareness among so many business leaders. A private sector solution may be the best solution on a global scale. Other growing issues of concern relates to inability of companies to measure their cost of waste and land-use change. Ecosystems are vital to the performance of most companies, and integrating the true costs of extracting these services could significantly impact bottom lines in the future.\n\nEnvironmental costs are not always easily seen, but in taking a closer look, the results are scary. It is on this note that have prompted this research which focused on “environmental cost measurement and it effect on investment returns in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar”. \n\n1.3 Objectives of the study\n\nThe main objective of this study is environmental cost measurement and it effect on investment returns in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar. \n\nThe specific objectives of the study include;\n\n(i)                 To determine the benefits of preserving the environment in terms of investment returns in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar. \n\n(ii)               To examine  the effect of cost of waste measurement and land-use change on company’s viability in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar. \n\n(iii)             To evaluate the importance of Ecosystems preservation  to the performance of company’s in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar. \n\n(iv)             To determine the true costs of environmental impact on company’s future investments  in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar. \n\n1.4            Research question\n\n(i)                            To what extent does preserving the environment benefit investment returns in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar? \n\n(ii)                         To what extent does cost of waste measurement and land-use change affect company’s viability in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar? \n\n(iii)                       How does  Ecosystems  preservation impact on the company’s performance in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar? \n\n(iv)                       To what extent does true costs of environmental impact affect  company’s future investments  in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar?\n\n1.5            Research Hypothesis \n\n(i)                            There is no significant relationship between preserving the environment and investment returns in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar \n\n(ii)                         There is no significant relationship between cost of waste measurement, land-use change and company’s viability in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar \n\n(iii)                       There is no significant relationship between Ecosystems  preservation and company’s performance in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar\n\n(iv)                       There is no significant relationship between costs of environmental impact and  company’s future investments  in United Cement Company (UNICEM) Calabar\n\n1.6            Scope of the research area\n\nthe scope of the study focuses on environmental cost measurement and its effect on investment returns, the study area for this research will be narrowed down to United Cement Company, Calabar. This company will be taken into consideration because of its uniqueness as a manufacturing company that emits mush waste into the environment and also because of its easy accessible nature.\n\n1.7         Significance of the study\n\nThis study will be of immense benefits to oil exploring companies, mining industries, manufacturing industries and construction industries to enable them determine adequate measures in measuring the cost of their environmental waste and also understanding the influence its has on future investments. The study when conducted will be of significance to the ministry of environment in both state and federal levels to enable them make policies that will guide and direct the operations of manufacturing, minning and oil exploring companies. The research will  equally be significant because it would provide answers to the effect of environmental cost measurement on investment returns in the financial industry as a whole and also valuable tool for students, academician, institutions and individuals that wants to know more about environmental cost measurement.\n\n1.8            Organization of the study\n\nFor the researcher to achieve the objectives of the study the research was organized into following Chapters in order to relate each one of them to the main study\n\n(i)                            Chapter one: This chapter presents an introduction and background on the subject matter and as well highlight a problem statement, objectives of the study, research questions, research hypothesis, scope of the study, significance, definition of term and historical background of the study area. \n\n(ii)                         Chapter two: This chapter reviewed related works from different scholars and authors pertaining to the subject matter.\n\n(iii)                       Chapter three: This chapter presents the methodology used in the research. Hence the following headings were taken into consideration, the design, population, sample size, method of data collection instrumentation, model specification etc\n\n(iv)                       Chapter four: the chapter highlighted data presentation, analysis and discussion of findings\n\n(v)                         Chapter five: This chapter presents the summary, conclusion and recommendations made in the study as well make necessary suggestions for further studies. It also displayed the list of referenced authors and closes with appendicies.\n\n1.9         Operational definition of terms\n\nCost: Is the value of money that has been used up to produce something, and hence is not available for use anymore\n\nMeasurement: Is finding a number that shows the size or amount of something.\n\nInvestment returns: is the concept of an investment of some resource yielding a benefit to the investor.\n\nEnvironmental cost: This is expenditures incurred to prevent, contain, or remove environmental contamination.\n\n1.10     Historical Background of the Organization under study: United cement company (UNICEM)         limited\n\nThe United Cement Company of Nigeria Ltd (UNICEM) is formed as a private limited liability company under Nigerian law with registered office in Nigeria by Holcim Trading S.A. and Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc.

This is because since the emergence of this area of economic and business knowledge, fraud and all forms of dishonesty and misappropriation of money entrusted to one had obviously to Nigeria banks.\n\nThis defect has been lingering in the minds of honest bank employee and the student majoring into the banking profession too give potential thought as to the near future perfection of the banking and finance as a discipline fraudulent actives in the Nigerian banks have grown so great in strength, rigor and vigor that most of the banks are exposed to great risk of losses inspire of all modern sophistionted security advices employed in the dally operation and function by Nigeria banks.\n\nBanking industry is the bed rock of any developing and developed economy the world over. It is therefore very important to find out any problem that rises to  to disrupt those industries. Every transactions involved in international trade is done through the banks and this is what depicts the direction of any economy all over the world. Industrial development and establishment project financing etc are all done through banks therefore the eradication fraud in banks is the concern of every worthy patriot of this great nation, fraud is an international misrepresentation consentient for the purpose of inducing a mother in reliance upon it to pant with some valuable things, money properties belonging to him or generally to surrender a legal right. Although the existence of fraud in our banks is not our uncommon or unexpected phenomenon. It is worrying because “of all the various problems conformity the Nigeria banking industry today that of fraud is easily the most intractable.\n\nThe banking industry worries more about fraud because of the rather obvious damaging consequences of the acts on the heaths and for the existence of the institution.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Advanced Learner Dictionary of current English the word “fraud” means criminal deception. This is a straightforward definition. The great master dictionary Hamlin Encyclopedia world dictionary defines “fraud” as:” deceit” tricky sharp practice or breach of confidence by which some one who sought to gain unfair or dishonest advantage any deception artifice and trick.\n\nAlso, the term fraud can be defined in so many ways “fraud” in the contemplation  of a civil court of justice may be said to include all acts, omissions and concealments which involve a breach of legal or equitable dusty trust of confidence justify reposed and are injurious to another or by which an under or unconscientiously advantages is taken of another \n\nFinally, Wale Adewuni describe fraud as a conscious premeditated action of a person or group of persons with the inteation of altering the truth and or fact for selfish personal monetary gain. It invoues the use of deceit and trick and sometimes highly intelligent cunning and know-how\n\nThese can emerge as a result of non- strict adherence to documented and established rules and regulation in individual banks and such regulations in individual banks and this has gone a long way in enhancing fraud in our banks and is very bad thing so to say.\n\n  Also, these skilled professionals in the management level of these banks. Lack of inbuilt accountability devices including having regular auditing of accounts of customers these banks do not organize fraud seeming so as to discuses the problems fraud cause them and fine out these people who actually make fraud possible in their banks and the solutions to these problems lack of proper recruitment and training policy on the part of the banks\n\n1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\n         The proposed objective of this project is to determine ways of minimizing frauds in Nigeria commercial bank because fraud has brought about banks failure in Nigerian banking industry. It is time we study fraud and how it can be reduced in Nigeria bank this act tends to make people loose confidence in financial institution in Nigeria. At this point it seems necessary to find solution to this problem that is reduced frauds in Nigeria banks, fraud is an enemy of baking business in Nigeria, fraud is obtainable more especially in banking sectors them any other place. It is the biggest single cause of bank failure therefore it is necessary to find solution to the problem so that we can evaluate the performance of bank in Nigeria when fraud is being reduced in Nigerian banking industry \n\n1.3    PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n(1)                                       To identify the effect of bank fraud on the activities of commercial banks\n\n(2)                                       To identify the loopholes in accounting and audit function that create avenue for the perpetration of fraud in the banks and ascertain the relevance of the emphasis placed on vouchers and withdrawal from customer account\n\n(3)                                       To determine the extent of involvement of bank staff in encouraging fraud in commercial banks.\n\n(4)                                       To survey the nature and form of fraud in our banks\n\n1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n            This project is drawn for all those who may be interested in carrying out further study on frauds in the Nigeria banking institution.\n\nThis study will go a long ways to certify the following:\n\n(i)         STAFF:          Whether there is the need to improve the condition of the worker and whether this well make them not to think of fraud and reject any attempt by outsiders to influence them into frauding their banks\n\n(ii)        CUSTOMERS:         Almost every bank fraud has either direct on an indirect effect on a customers are made to bear the bank when there is a bank fraud\n\nCOMMERCIAL BANK AND MANAGEMENT:\n\nRunning cost increases in fragment occurrence of fraud and, time energies that would be spent improving customer’s services would be expended on preventing fraud.\n\n1.6       DEFINITION OF TERMS USED\n\nFRAUD:                             This means criminal deception or any act of this kind, getting money by deceit is term fraud one who engages in a fraudulent activity is called a fraud stain\n\nBANK:                                   Is a corporation or person or persons who accepts money on current accounts pays cheques on such accounts on demand and collects cheques for customers.\n\nMINIMIZATION:                reduction bringing down some thing down to its lowest level.         \n\nDECEIT:                               Means deceiving, also as it used in this research project it means causing somebody to accept as true something that is false.\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE:                    trade between two different countries e.g. Nigeria vs. Britain\n\nREFERENCE:\n\n 1.

It run over a time series of nine years and examines how fluctuations on exchange rate has made it difficult for the country’s debt services.\n\n            The method use in dreaming these affects is the ordinary least square method of regression Technique. The work shows critically the effects of exchange rate changes on debt services in Nigeria. Through the method used above, the reason for the increase in external debt over the years was discovered. Among them were fared imbalances, fund of Projects that are not feasible, fund of Projects that are not feasible et.\n\n            At the end, these factors were analyzed using the ordinary least square (OLS) regressing techniques whereby a linear model was formulated to analyze individual influences of exchange rate changes on some variables such as the debts service payment etc.\n\nAfter these studies, the researcher recommends that a committee be set up to check excessive borrowings and ensure that borrowed funds are used for projects that initiated the borrowing only investments (project) that are capable of yielding more fund to the government should be pursed.\n\nAlso, the improve debt services in the country.\n\nThe amount of borrowing form outside country should be reduced and the government should learn to use its own resources i.e. borrow from wealthy individuals and private organs within the country.\n\n                                    TABLE OF CONTENT\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTNRODUCTION\n\n1.1              Background of the study\n\n1.2              Statement of problem\n\n1.3              Objective of the study\n\n1.4              Research questions\n\n1.5              Formulation of hypotheses\n\n1.6              Scope band limitations of the study\n\n1.7              Definition of terms\n\nReferences\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.1              Literature review\n\n2.2               Evolution of Nigeria’s exchange rate policy\n\n2.3              Exchange rate regimes\n\n2.4              Commerce of Nigeria’s external borrowing\n\n2.5              Nigeria’s external debt servicing\n\n2.6              Foreign debt management\n\n2.7              Evidence\n\nReferences\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nRESEARCH METHOLOLOGY\n\n3.1              Research design\n\n3.2              Source of data\n\n3.3              Selection of variables\n\n3.4              Estimation procedure\n\n3.5              Methods for evaluation of results\n\nReference\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.1              Presentation of data\n\n4.2              Data evaluation estimation and testing of hypotheses\n\n4.3              Interpretation of data\n\nReferences\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.0       major findings summary and conclusions\n\n5.1              Major findings\n\n5.2              Recommendations\n\n5.3              Summary\n\n5.4              Conclusions\n\nBibliography\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\n            By the year 1970’s and early 1980’s external debt obligation of Nigeria was very significant, but assumed crisis and disagreement in the late 1990’s.\n\n            However, external debt or internal debt obligations results from disagreements between the Fiscal operations of the government when the total expenditure exceeds current revenue for a govern fiscal year. Whenever a county witnesses a budgetary gap, the nation can employ domestic or external borrowing to breach the budgetary gap.\n\n            Borrowing from external sources by the government constituted the external debt of the public sector and the government owned the obligation of debt servings through series of periodic repayment of interest and capital repayment of the debt.\n\n            From the proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP), the external debt outstanding rose, from and average of 7.5 between 1971 and1985 to 91.6 between 1986 and 1994 and it has continues to rise by heaps and bounds every year.  The foreign exchange market to ensure\n\nreasonable stability. The major element of the deregulation  was the re-introduction of the Autonomous foreign exchange market (AFEM). The AFEM is a channel for funding end- users requests for foreign exchange at market-determined rates. The CBN monitors development in the AFEM and take decisions when necessary to keep exchange rates within desired or targeted levels.\n\n            Originally, the Fixed exchange rate of $1.00 = N22.00 was retained for eligible public sector transactions including debt services payment and national priority projects.\n\n             The are-introduction of the usual exchange rate policy is 1995 brought about by the dismal performance of the 1994 re-regulation policy, especially as it regulated to non-oil exports. This new policy was aimed addressing the substantial depreciation of the Naira exchange rate in the parallel market and achieving rate in the parallel market and achieving efficient allocation and utilization of resources. The dual exchange rate was still obtainable until the end of 1998. While the official rate remained fixed at N21.996 to us $ 1.00 and earmarked for selected necessary government transactions The AFEM exchange rate was largely market – determined and the AFEM rate averaged about N83.80 to us $ 1.00 and latter showed a significant depreciation of about 3.1% to N85.54 to Us $ 1.00.\n\n             Since 1998 till date, there has been tremendous changes and fluctuations in the exchange rate of Naira to the Dollar. This has dealt a great blow to the debt service payment of Nigeria go about pleading for debt conciliation and debt forgiveness from the international bodies\n\n1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThis research is designed on the national effect exchange rate in Nigeria became an external debtor in 1958 when Us $ 28 million was contracted for railway construction. This debt however has fully been repaid.\n\n            From 1978 onwards, due to the oil glut, which exerted considerable pressure on government finances, it became expedient to borrow for balance of payments and support of project Financing in Nigeria.\n\n            This necessity led to the formulation of degree no. 30 of 1978 authorizing the federal government to raise external federal government to raise external loans up to maximum of N5billion.\n\n            Consequently, the First major borrowing of US $ 1 billion referred to as the “JUMBO LOAN” was borrowed from the international capital market (1cm) in 1978, increasing the total external debt stock to us $ 2. 2 billion By 1982, the total external debt stock was US 8 13. 1 billion in 1988 and by December 1991 it amounted to US 833.4 billion.\n\n            Consequently, these drastic since 1978 from concessionary loans from the intentional capital market and the decline in export earnings\n\nmade debt servicing burdensome from the 1980’s. The collapse et oil price in 1981 have companioned the problems et an economy that had lost its edibility and led to serious external payments problems, other problems are domestic policy lapses which include\n\n            The unstable and unrealistic exchange rate policies have had serious effects on debt servicing, investment and international trade decisions. Thus, the problem of exchange rate policy to debt services payment is that it increases the debt service payment in arrears, and this results in foreign exchange outflow.\n\nIn 1992, 30% of the country’s annual foreign earnings was used to service the debt the cost of servicing the debt in 1993 was N94.57 billion which represents 84.36% of total expenditure outlay of the government of N112.1 billion (Guardian, Feb 3. 1993). In 1999, $ 1.5 billion was budgeted for external debt service.\nTHE NATIONAL EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON FOREIGN DEBT SERVICE IN NIGERIA\n",

The experience of Nigerians during the first era of bank failures in Nigerian between 1953 to 1959 was such that generated understandable apprehension among the banking public. Unfortunately, the problem has reducing up till now in the Nigerian financial system. Also distress in Nigerian banking system is a phenomenon that must be tackle with every amount of Vigour in order to minimize its occurrence in the economy.\n\nAlthough, Nigerian thought this was a good own for the economy, it soon downed on them that the perceived boom was a mirage and gross mismanagement. The increasing number of distress in the nations banking industry has impacted negatively on the economy by slowing down the tempo of business activities. The courage also effects some government and some healthly banks which have cost some of the confidence which they had enjoyed before the issue of banking distress become pronounced.\n\n1.2                                                              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS\n\n         Financial distress in the Nigeria banking industry will therefore occure when a fairly reasonable proportion of banks in the system are unable to meet their obligations to their customer as well as their owners and the economy as a result of weakness in their financial, operational and managerial condition which have rendered them either insolvent. Also is a situation in which a sizable proportion of financial institutions have liabilities exceeding the market value of their assets.\n\n    A financial institution is said to be in distress where evaluation by the supervising authorities depicts the institution as deficient in the following criteria.\n\n    Weak Management, reflected in the poor credit quality, inadequate internal controls. High rate of frauds.\n    High level of classified loans and advances\n    Gross under Capitalization relation to the level of operation.\n    Illiquidity, reflected in the inability to meet customers cash withdrawals.\n\n1.3                                                              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n       In view of the above problems of distress in the banking industry, this study in word term aims at examining the techniques of managing distress in the banking industry. This objecture in specific terms could be states this.\n\n    To examine debt recovery and cost reduction as a techniques of managing financial distress in the banking industry.\n\n    To also examines bank recapitalization as a techniques of managing financial distress in the banking industry. To examine bank acqusition and merger as technique of managing distress in the banking industry.\n\nAlso to make recommendation on haw to mange financial distress in the banking industry.\n\n       To also examine bank Recapitalization as a technique s of managing financial distress in the banking industry.\n\n    To make recommendation on how to mange financial distress in the banking industry.\n\n4.1                                                                                      RESEARCH QUESTION\n\nThe aim of this study is to examine the techniques of managing financial distress in the Nigerian banking industry. The researcher demand it necessary to formulate the following question.\n\n(i)  “Are Debt Recovery and cost Reduction a good techniques of managing financial distress in the banking industry\n\n(2) “Is bank Recapitalisation a good techniques of managing financial distress in the banking industry?\n\n(3) “Are Bank Acquisition and merger  a good techniques of managing financial distress in the banking industry?\n\n1.4                                                              RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n\n     This study is to examine the techniques of managing financial distress in the Nigerian banking industry. Considering the nature of the subject matter, the researcher made it necessary to formulate the following hypotheisi.\n\n(1)  Ho:            Debt Recovery and cost Reduction are not a good techniques of\n\n                        Managing financial distress in the banking industry.\n\n(2)  Hi: Debit recovery and cost reduction are a good techniques of   \n\n                        Managing financial distress in the banking industry.\n\n      Hi: banking Recapitalization  is a good techniques of managing          \n\n                        Financial distress in the banking industry.\n\n(3)  Ho:            Bank Acquisition and merger are not a good techniques of\n\n            Managing financial distress in the banking industry.\n\n      Hi: Bank Acquisition and merger are not good techniques of\n\n                        Managing financial distress in the banking industry.\n\n1.5                                                              SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\n       This research work which deals mainly in examining the techniques of managing financial distress in the Nigeria banking industry will be of much significance to the readers, it will make them to be aware of the unhealthy conditions being experienced in our banking industry as well as being familiar with the various suggested technique which could be applied to reduces the banking industry out of this distress. It should be noted that a country’s wealth development, and advancement it normally judged by the healthness of it’s banking industry. Also this study therefore sets to as certain the technique of managing distress in the Nigerian banking industry.\n\n    The study will be of immense benefits to business students, other researchers in the field, financial institutions, and regulatory institutions and will obviously add to the pool of knowledge in the field of banking. \n\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n\n1.8     The aim here is to explain all the unique term used here, in order to avoide mis-interpretation as follows:\n\n1)      Recapitalisation:          this refers to the process of injecting more funds into a bank in order to make it carry on profitable business.\n\n2)      Liquidation:    This refers to bringing to an end the operation of a going concern (bank) by the authorized authority.\n\n3)      Insolvert:         Also is refers to ban is inability to meet the needs of its customers in the ordinary course of business.\n\n4)      Fraud:    This can be defined as a conscious and deliberate effort aimed at financial advantage at the detriment of another person who is the rightful owner of the fund.\n\n5)      Mergers and Acquisitions:   This means the crises ridden banks can pull their resources together through mergers.

Nigerian Breweries: more than half a century of efforts to achieve world class status in Africa.\n\nOver a period of slightly more than fifty (50) years, Nigerian Breweries has had success after success and has succeeded in anchoring itself firmly in the Nigerian beer market, the business community and indeed in the very hearts of Nigerian themselves.\n\nThe “Rising Star” or Nigerian Breweries has, for many decades now, been synonymous with success, quality and commitment.  The organization can boast a wide portfolio of brands that cover the three segments of the Nigerian beer market (Larger, Stout and Malt):  Star, Gulder, Heineken, Legan Extra Stout, Maltina, and Amstel malta.\n\nIn 1949, three years after its foundation, the first bottles of star were being filled on the bottling line of the brand new brewery in Lagos. \n\nThree more breweries have been founded since then:  Aba, Kaduna and Ibadan.  Enugu brewery was acquired in 1993.\n\nFor decades, Nigerian Breweries had tow large shareholders, one of which, Heineken had always focused on providing the breweries with technical support.  In year 2000, Heineken seized the opportunity of acquiring a 54.2% majority interest in Nigerian Breweries, a decision which underlined Heineken’s commitment to the African continent.\n\nThanks to the process of democratization that started to emerge towards the close of the 1990s, plus the brewery’s alert anticipation of what would happen in the new situation.  Nigerian Breweries successfully managed to accelerate a growth in sales from 2.5 million hectoliter in 1998 to 5.5 million hectoliter (hi) in 2003.  This was so successful in fact that a luxury problem arose:  the demand for Star, Gulder, and Maltina started to outstrip actual supply.  Nigerian Breweries and Heineken therefore started up the LAKIE output optimization project (Lagos, Aba, Kaduna, Ibadan, Enugu).\n\nAn investment of 280 million euros in new bottling lines and brewing plants substantially increased the capacity of these breweries.\n\nThe experts were more than aware that an expansion of the existing breweries alone would be insufficient to meet the constantly increasing demand for Star and Gulder.  And because of the rose-coloured prospects in the medium term, early in 2001 Nigerian Breweries and large shareholder Heineken decided to build an ultra-modern brewery fitted with the latest innovations and the most up-to-date plant equipment.  A world-class brewery befitting a world-class company.\n\nThe entire brewing community is envious of the new Ama brewery near Enugu.  The construction of a high-tech brewery, in corporating the absolute latest in technological developments and major innovations in a rural tropical environment is a feat which has never before been achieved in the brewery industry.\n\nNigerian Breweries assigned Heineken Technical Services to design and develop the new brewery and to supervise the construction of this 220 million euro (30 billion naira) project.\n\nThere were frowns of concern when the first plans for Ama were presented.  Would it be possible to operate such a high-tech, state-of-the-art brewery in Nigeria?  The start-up phase has proven that it certainly is.  There are two main reasons for Ama’s success.  First of all, Nigerian Breweries invested heavily in the recruitment of young technical professionals straight from technical school and then giving them additional training.  Many key operators and all the managers were sent to Holland and Germany for this additional training, months before the first beer was brewed in Ama.  The others were given the training on recently upgraded equipment in the breweries at Lagos, Aba, Kaduna and Ibadan.\n\nThe second success factor is the actual organizational structure.  A state-of-the-art brewery such as Ama calls for a small number of highly professional employees; employees who perform at their best when working in a hierarchically small operation consisting of only three layers.  Work here is based on Total Productive Management (TPM), which for Nigerian Breweries is a new concept introduced by Wiggert Deelen, the Technical Director.\n\nThe brewery has an initial capacity of more than 300 million litres of beer and can be extended even further.  The average production is in excess of 1.1 million creates per week.  The Ama brewery uses only natural ingredients for the brewing process, the brewing water being pumped up from five wells two hundred metres below the ground.  This is excellent quality water and needs very little correction to make it suitable for brewing.\n\nThe malted barley and hops used are imported from Europe, the malted surghum and maize grits are produced by local farmers, malters and millers.  Ama brewery uses 51,000 tonnes of grain per year, 2,550 truck-loads in all.\n\nThe brewery has one brew-house that produces twelve brews of 660 hectolitres high gravity wort per day.  The brew-house is in operation 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nAfter the boiled wort has been cooled down it is mixed with the yeast and then pumped to the fermentation “celler”.  While the celler is the traditional name for the location where fermentation takes place, in the brewery the 30 fermentation tanks of 5,000 hectolitres each are situated in a building above ground.\n\nThe beer is subsequently transported from these tanks to the brewery’s bottling lines. \n\nHere there are four bottling lines, two of which are reserved for the popular brand, Star, and one for Gulder.  Each bottling line has a filling capacity of 30,000 bottles per hour (60cl bottles).\n\nThe high level automation and the use of ultra-modern technical equipment make it possible for the brewery to also produce Heineken beer.  Preparations were started for the local production of Heineken beer only six months after the first brew had left the production line.\n\n1.2            STATEMENT OF PROBLEM:\n\nHowever, the research will be specifically concentrated on the problems which arise when the brewery sells beer to its customers for the purpose of receiving payment in future.\n\nIn view of these, the following critical questions demand answers:\n\n1.       What effects does credit management have on liquidity position of Nigerian Breweries Plc, Enugu?\n\n2.       Does credit sales reduces liquidity of this brewery?\n\n3.       Does credit sales increase the profit level of the brewery?\n\n4.       Is there any relationship between credit sales and liquidity position of this brewery?\n\n5.       Has the brewery’s credit policy and credit terms any effect on its liquidity?\n\n1.3            RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to find out how effectively and efficiently the Nigerian Breweries Plc has managed its trade credit (selling been on credit to customers) to achieve optimum level of liquidity, which will in turn result in the promotion of the corporate image of the brewery and win the patronage of the public.\n\nThe project also aims at making suggestions on how the brewery, based on research findings, can improve its business through greater profitability and growth can be assured.\n\n1.4            STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS:\n\nIn order to achieve the above objective, the research will make the following hypothesis:\n\n1.       Liquidity of Nigerian Breweries Plc Enugu in a function of proper credit management.\n\n2.       Credit sales do not reduce liquidity of Nigerian Breweries Plc Enugu.\n\n3.       Credit sales increase the profitability of Nigerian Breweries Plc, Enugu.\n\n1.5            SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:\n\nIn carrying out this study, it is intended that it will be of immense help to the accounting staff of Nigerian Breweries Plc Enugu, especially its credit management officers.\n\nThis study exposes the intricacies involved in extending credit to customers.\n\nTo the customers, this study will enumerate the several benefits that can be derived by making prompt settlements of their debts.  This serves as a means of increasing organizational efficiency.\n\nThis study also is particularly important for the financial manager of a small company because a small company has relatively limited access to the capital markets, it relies heavily on trade credits for its short-term financing.\n\nThis study will be helpful guide for him.  Thus any company or individual through this study can have a reasonable knowledge of what credit transactions are all about and how it can be effectively managed to attain the much needed profit maximization.\n\n1.6            LIMITATION AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY:\n\nIn a study like this type, a lot of set-backs are bound to come up, this work is restricted by many variables.\n\nThe greatest identifiable ones are time, finance, respondents and general economic problem.\n\n(1)     Time:\n\nSince the research will be carried out at student’s level, the researcher will have to allot his time such that the demand for their courses will have to be met.\n\nMoreover, since the interview will be conducted during the working days of the work the researcher will have to forfeit some of his lectures in order to successfully conduct the study.  The time that will be lost in terms of lecture missed will be a substantial loss in itself.\n\n(2)     Finance:\n\nInsufficient funds will be another factor inhibiting this research project.  The work will be single-handedly sponsored by the researcher.\n\nAnd as a student, the project will be sponsored from his meager pocket money.  As a result, he may find it difficult to cover some inevitable expenses like transport, stationeries, typing and binding labour and so on.\n\nThis in turn is bound to affect the sample size and the geographical area of coverage of the study.\n\n(3)     Respondent:\n\nThe inability of the officials concerned to produce adequate and relevant information required for the research project has been one of the most frequently encountered constraints by researchers.\n\nApart from the fact that some of the staff that will be required to give data are not technically skilful in the area of study, many of them may think that the researcher is one of government functionaries that come to question their activities or to assess them for tax payment.\n\nThis may be due to the fact that the school authority has been reluctant to introduce the researcher to the establishment formally by issuing identity papers or introduction papers to the students.\n\n(4)     General Economic Problem: \n\nThe last but not the least limiting factor is this work will be the general economic problem facing the entire country as at this point in time when the research will be carried out.\n\nConsidering the above constraints, the researcher will concentrate on few areas of trade credit management that lead to high profitability, optimum liquidity level and efficient utilization of all the brewery’s financial assets.  Such areas include – historical overviews and origin of credit, trade credit and credit management; credit policy; five Cs of credit; effects of credit on liquidity and profitability, and important areas of trade credit management.\n\n1.7            DEFINITION OF TERMS:\n\nHaven going this far, the researcher sees it reasonably enough to define some key terms or phrases intended to be used in this research project as they operationally apply to the problem:\n\nThe terms include:\n\n1.       Trade Credit:\n\nThis is the quantity of goods (beer) the brewery sold to its customers with the purpose of collecting cash in the future.\n\n2.       Credit Management:\n\nThis is the process by which the brewery properly maintains its credit sales so as to achieve optimum liquidity level.  Or, put in this way, credit management is a way of controlling the brewery’s credit granting attitude in order to maximize the brewery’s value of achieving a balance between risk and profitability.\n\n3.       Liquidity:\n\nThis is the volume of cash the brewery has at hand and/or in the bank.  It is the actual total money (most liquid assets) the brewery has as a balance after all expenses (including cost of financial credit) have been made.\n\n4.       Profitability:\n\nThis is the total net profit or gain made by the brewery from its selling activities (both cash and credit sales).\n\n5.       Optimum Liquidity:\n\nThis is the level of cash (at hand and/or in the bank) at which all the brewery’s assets (resources) are efficiently employed and utilized.\n\n6.       Company:\n\nThis is a legal person or entity created by the association of number of persons in accordance with the law for the purpose of a defined objective.\n\n7.       Management:\n\nThis is the process of allocating an organisation’s inputs (human and economic resources) by planning, organizing, directing and controlling for the purpose of producing outputs (goods and services) directed by its customers so that organization objectives are accomplished.\n\n8.       Credit Sales:\n\nThese are sales made by the brewery without immediate payment.\n\nThey are goods (beer) the brewery exchanged for money but with the intention to receive the cash in the future\nTHE EFFECTS OF CREDIT MANAGEMENT ON LIQUIDITY POSITION OF A MANUFACTURING COMPANY",

Taxation in business development and decision is one that established two divides for assessment of subjects. One taxed alongside employment and the other as a body corporate. Those taxed alongside employment pays less, these may influence choice of forms, which may have avoidance connotation. The study evaluates the effect of tax differential on choice of business form of investors. The study reveals that tax differential affect investors decision on choice of Business form and that the existing differential reduces government revenue potential. Segregation of personal income tax between employment and business incomes is recommended. Because of desirability problem revealed in the study, an equal business tax could not be recommended, rather the kind of differential that currently exist under company income tax was recommended. Ii is expected to be applied to all the forms in an equitable manner. The researcher used primary and secondary methods of data collection to gather the needed data. The data obtained through questionnaires were presented in tables and analyzed using the simple percentage. The findings have also shown that factors which militate against successful taxation in business development and decision making are: raising of revenue, redistribution of wealth, management of the economy. The study recommends that Government should help to increase business operation by reducing the high cost of tax in other to increase the economy growth of the nation.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0            INTRODUCTION\n\nThe political, economic and social development of any country depends on the amount of revenue generated for the provision of infrastructure in that given country. Taxes have the characteristic of being a common source of revenue to all countries. It is not dependent on availability of resources like could be said of oil and other minerals revenue Hassett (1992). However, yield differs from country to country or even region to region within a country, depending on nature’s endowment, ability to administer and collect, and the extent to which the revenue from it is required by the government of individual state, among other thing. Taxes that apply to business income fall under direct taxes and under Nigerian Law; it is administer in two forms. According to Auerbach (2002), one is assessing business income to tax only in the hand of the owners of the businesses, which is the case when business is a sole proprietorship or partnership. The other, taxes business income first, taken the business as a person, and later assess the dividend received by owners from the same business's profit to tax. If tax is properly administered generally, the revenue through it can improve greatly and government expenditure needs could be better met. The place of business taxation is particularly important in Nigeria because out of the over twenty million population only a small fragment takes up salaried employment and more are in one trade, business or other crafts Hubbard (2002). All these non-salaried income earners could be classified under sole trade partnership or company, all of whom are not discriminated against in terms of use of government provided amenities, accessibility to labour and capital market and enjoyment of customer-ship. However, one means of generating the amount of revenue for providing the needed infrastructure is through a well-structured tax system. The importance of taxation in the activities of any government cannot be overemphasized. The world over, tax system is one major source of government revenue, however, not every national government have been able to effectively exploit this great opportunity of revenue generation Nzotta (2007:19). This can be attributed to a number of reasons including the system of taxation; tax legislation, tax administration and policy issues; over reliance on other sources of revenue (such as foreign aid and grants), corrupt practice in the system especially as it relates to the system of tax collection and behavoiur of the citizens towards tax payment and ease of tax payment. According to Ogbonna Appah (2012:7), in Nigeria, the level of tax evasion is quite high. The effect is seen in the lack of resources for effective business development and decision. If Nigerian Nation is to make the transaction from perpetually development to a developed nation then they need to be tax compliant. According to Azubike (2009:134) who also pointed out that tax system is an opportunity for government to collect additional revenue from individual and business dealers needed in discharging its pressing obligation. Business development and decision can be considered one of the most important instruments taken by financial managers, for effective business productivity if not the most important one. The business decision making process influence the enterprise affirmation in the business environment and increase its market share Summers (1991:212). It concerns with the issue of capital allocation for fixed assets or financial assets; central place returns to fixed assets, acquired as a result of capital investment. By this decision, financial resources at its disposal are allocated efficiently to the acquisition, construction, modernization of fixed assets and the accumulation of material stocks, in the appropriate volume and adequate structure for its function at the highest parameters. Also, the available liquidities may be placed respecting the efficiency criteria on the capital market, to purchase financial assets. Regardless of the selected variants, the business decision should be subordinated to accomplish the performance objectives at long-term, established by the general policy of the enterprise. In another approach Bucataru, (2002: 22), opined that business development and decisions are those concerning the conversion of capital money in material form such as machinery, equipment, buildings, through operations of acquisition of these assets. Most actions of economic entities are influenced by taxes. In order to obtain an unbiased valuation of business development, it is essential for organizations, especially for those who operate internationally to consider the impact of taxes. However, business decisions are often based on very simplistic tax models. The implementation of these concepts in the finance curriculum enables businessmen to assess the importance of taxes, especially in cross-border investments. According to Schramm (2007:115), it pertinent to attempts to narrow the gap between research and practice by breaking these partly complex models down and by making them more accessible. By reducing the complex reality to its fundamental components, this approach helps businesses to focus on the essentials and to understand the idea behind the complex research concepts. Business decisions in all areas of responsibility have the common goal of maximizing long-term wealth by cash flow enhancement Foley, and Hines (2004). The business decision making involves identifying and analyzing alternative courses of action, including after-tax cash flows. Since the amount and timing of income tax can vary significantly between alternatives, the impact of taxes should always be considered in the decision-making process of all managers in business organizations. Management’s role is to be aware of and apply known tax law, as opposed to interpreting tax law which is the function of independent advisors. All factors that affect profit and cash flows are relevant to a business decision. Income tax would be one of these relevant factors and should be addressed in the same manner as other relevant factors. Including tax implications is not synonymous with tax avoidance. According to Klemm (2002), it is simply the inclusion of a relevant cost and, in fact, the lowest tax alternative may not be the alternative chosen. The management process will be enhanced when the decision maker is aware of the amount and timing of the related tax consequences. The effect of taxes on business development and decision is one of the central questions in both public finance and development. This effect matters not only for the evaluation and design of tax policy, but also for thinking about economic growth Barro V. (1991:45).\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe problems identified with taxation in business decision and development is a situation where two businesses probably, making similar profit from similar turnover that is also a result of equivalent level of investment, pays different amount as tax simply because one is a Company and the other is not, is one. A clear demonstration of inequality is depicted here especially in a situation where there is no discrimination among forms of businesses. Various means of avoiding taxes exists. What this perceivable inequality could lead to is a form of tax avoidance in which case, investors who are conscious of above facts may from the threshold (even with all the capabilities of floating a Company) choose a partnership or sole trade, even if it is glaring that it is not appropriate, because of tax advantage. A second possibility is the fact that existing investors in an organization that has gained reasonable ground may deliberately liquidate and raise partnership business to avoid high taxes.\n\nOBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n1.     To examine effect of taxation on business decision for Economic growth.\n\n2.     To assess the benefit of business decision and development in for effective tax compliance\n\n3.

TIME FACTOR: A study of this nature needs relatively long time during which information for accurate or at least near accurate inference could be drawn. The period of the study was short, time posed as constraints to the research.\n\n2. FINANCIAL FACTOR: The research would have extended the survey to other area at the empirical level, but limitation as included cost of transportation to the source of material and the cost of time setting of the already completed work.\n\n3. LACK OF COOPERATION: Many of the respondents are usually aggressive to relay the issue that borders cooperation among the respondents border.\n\n4.

This study was conducted using the Institute of Management and Technology (I.M.T) Enugu as a case study.\n\n          The instrument used for data collection was the questionnaire and literature review, while a total of four research question were also posed.\n\n          The information collected from the respondents were analyzed using simple percentage method and they were used in answering the research question.The data collected and analyzed showed that enormous consequences were imposed on secretarial education curriculum by constant change in office technologies. The consequences entails the re-training and attending of seminars, conferences and workshop by the teachers/lecturers on the uses and operations of the new office equipment/machines, this is with a view to imparting such knowledge on the student secretaries together with the introduction of some new relevant courses to enable them face squarely the consequences of incessant office technological changes now rampant in the business environment.\n\n          The finding upheld the need for easy introduction of accepted new courses. It was revealed that the staff of the department should be coped by the Polytechnics regulation body, the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) in the curriculum planning.\n\n          Based on these, recommendations were drawn which the researcher feels if followed and adhered strictly to, will always give a good answer to any future consequences imposed on secretarial education curriculum by change in office technologies.\n\n          Since no research work is ever completely concluded because of some certain constraints, some suggested areas for further research were also given.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nTitle page                                                                                i\n\nApproval page                                                                        ii\n\nDedication                                                                               iii\n\nAcknowledgment                                                                     iv\n\nAbstract                                                                                  vi\n\nTable of contents                                                                     viii\n\nChapter one\n\n1.0            Introduction                                                                           1\n\n1.1.

This is because new machines, are threatening to take over the jobs performed by secretaries thereby making them face job hazard of redundancy, retirement and retrenchments and mass unemployment.\n\nPresently, Nigeria is undergoing technological revolutions just like any other developing country of the world.  This technological advancement has actually revolutionized most office activities and procedures.  Until recently, the study of secretarial educations programme in our polytechnics especially in Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu was based mainly on shorthand, typewriting and office practice.  But the activities had greatly changed since supervision of the polytechnics by the NBTE.\n\nThe task and activities these categories of workers in most offices and business circles have also increased tremendously because of the high office responsibilities expected of the secretary to now handle with little or not supervisions,  the scope of the course they now cover before qualification, has also greatly increased.\n\nThey now have to be trained and educated in too many courses and have to acquire more technical skills to be able to handle and manipulate the very modern office automated machines now inherent in most business offices. This will make them to be marketable and employable.\n\nSecretarial profession now has to battle with the skills of handling the electric typewriters, scanners, word processors, the facsimile (Fax) machines, the computer etc.  Will enable her meet up with the increasing demand of collecting, processing, storing and disseminating information as and when urgently required unlike the era of manual typewriters and filing cabinets that waste time.\n\nIt should be noted that these automatic high-technological machines cannot do everything or operate themselves without human aid, thus making the needs and quests for the professionals in the secretarial field necessary.\n\nThe most current and implicating question in the minds of the present day secretarial studies educators and curriculum planners is what to do in order to keep pace with the new technological changes in secretarial office automated equipment. This is because the more knowledgeable the secretaries are in the use of these office automated equipment, the better prepared our country will be to develop technologically.\n\nHence in the opinion of Kanu (1987), there must be positive attitude towards continuous up-dating of knowledge for everyone, especially the secretaries, if this age of technological advancement is to be acquired and improved advancement and inter-personnel skills developed.\n\n1.2            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\nThe incessant changes and advancements in office automation has given rise to an urgent and constant training of the employees who handle and operated these new machines.  It should be realized that most of these new high technological equipment like the computers, which stole into the business offices throughout the world unnoticed are very expensive to acquire and maintain and no organization would like these all cost effective equipment to lie idle, waste or become obsolete within a short period simply because there is no capable hands or professional to handle them.  Therefore, these technological changes therefore represent a very demanding implication on the secretarial education curriculum.\n\nSince a lot of office work is based on the basic knowledge of keyboarding and clerical skills, it becomes apparent that if secretarial education curriculum in out polytechnics is not reviewed, revisited and updated from time to time, to adequately take care of these technological changes, the products turned out with this curriculum might not be able to face challenges they are bound to meet when they are finally employed.\n\nIf therefore, becomes apparent that those concerned with the training and education of secretaries in out polytechnics and other institutions of higher learning should always adjust their curriculum so as to catch up and stay afloat with the incessant technological changes and advancements. The problem then is how far have Polytechnic especially Institute of Management and Technology, Enugu been able to adjust its curriculum to reflect the current development? How far have they been able to purchase the required equipment necessary for the training of Secretaries?  Do they have qualified personnel to handle these equipment?  Are the students being adequately prepared for the business world/  These and many more are what they research is out to answer.\n\n1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe main purpose of this research work is to:\n\ni.                   To find out the consequences of office technologies in secretarial education curriculum in I.M.T., Enugu.\n\nii.                 Find out cause of frequent changes in educational curriculum especially that of secretarial education programme performance.\n\niii.              To ascertain whether these office technologies that are used in different offices today are available in the department of Secretarial Studies of Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu which is actively involved in the training of secretaries\n\niv.              Identify whether the curriculum planners recognized these consequences before going on the drawing board, especially as it concerns Secretarial Duties.\n\n1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n          Technological development has taken a rather tremendous new dimension since the middle of this century.  According to Ndubuisi (1981), since there is need to promote interest in more and advanced technology, provision should also be made for institution and Nation as a whole, curriculum planners and business world.\n\n          By finding out the effects of consequences of office technology on the secretarial educations curriculum in our polytechnics especially the Institute of Management and Technology, Enugu all that are involved in the training of these category of professionals and the curriculum planners, will be able to adjust their curricula and course contents to suit the needs of the expanding technological business world. Their products, the students secretaries would then be prepared well enough to enter the new world of automated offices and still face squarely the challenges inherent in high technological environments without fear of retrenchment.\n\n          The study will among other things, serve as a guide to the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) in determining these new trends that are destined to become an integral part of business studies and include same in the program/school syllabus.\n\n          Finally, the country and the business parastatals will also benefit from this study since the school of business has been producing very proficient and marketable personnel that will stand the vigorous test of time through updated planned curricula, especially in this era of technological advancement.\n\n1.5            RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nIn order to obtain more purposeful and significant results from the data analysis, the following questions will be tested in the course of the study.\n\na.                 What are the consequences of office technologies in the Secretarial Education Curriculum in Institute of Management and Technology (I.M.T), Enugu?\n\nb.                 Is the Institute prepared to meet up with the consequences in training students for today’s and future sophisticated technological office environment?\n\nc.                  What effect have the frequent changes in curriculum brought to the secretarial Studies Department?\n\nd.                 Being aware of the technological changes in the country do you think the frequent changes will have any effect in your career as secretaries?\n\n1.6            SCOPE/DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nAs a result of the broad nature of secretarial education curriculum, the researcher limited this work to office technology aspect of the curriculum.\n\nHowever, the research will concentrate his research work on the Institute of Management and technology Enugu. It is within this precinct that this study is delimited.\n\n1.7            DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nBreeding unemployment Graduates:\n\nTraining and turning-out of graduates who cannot be employed because they lack the required skills for handling and manipulating modern office machines and equipment.\n\nCurriculum:\n\n          Subject/courses included in course of study like secretarial studies or taught in a particular school or college.\n\nOffice Technologies:\n\n          The application of the use of modern office machines and equipment in performing office tasks for quicker and greater productivity.\n\nComputer Literacy\n\n          Being educated or enlightened on the uses, functions an operations of the electronic data processing machine called the computer which is capable of handling, processing, storing and retrieving information at the shortest possible time.\n\nOffice Automation\n\n          The use of different types/kinds of machines aided devices to work in an office in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the employed manpower.\n\nTechnological Revolution\n\n          Drastic change/shift from the use of old fashioned machine and equipment to the recently manufactured (modern) ones.\n\nTechniques\n\n          Methods of getting things done.\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONSEQUENCES OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES IN SECRETARIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN NIGERIAN POLYTECHNICS",

INTRODUCTION\n\n Sincerely, examination malpractice is a canker worm that has eaten deep into the nations fabrics; it has become a menace to the Nigeria society. Presently, our educational system is in shambles this is as a result of inconsistencies and carelessness, non-implementation of educational policies, and corrupt practices in high places. As it stands, perhaps, the most potent threat to our educational system in the country is examination malpractices. This menace has enthroned itself like a king in our various academic institutions. The climax is the constant alarming failure rate recorded in the Senior Secondary Certificate Examinations conducted by the West African Examinations Council and the constant graduation of unemployable graduates from our higher institutions. The malady continues to generate heat among concerned citizens, scholars, governments and the media. Examination malpractices are those illegal actions taken during examination that are against the rules of an examination. Examination malpractice in Nigeria is in diverse dimension spanning from talking in an examination to coming in with books or use of electronic devices like cell phones and gadgets in communication during an examination, more alarming is the constant leaking of examination questions before the scheduled date of the examination. Simply put examination malpractice any form of illegal and unauthorized assistance given to a single candidate or group of candidates in an examination.  Examination malpractice is not a new event in Nigeria, maduemezia (2008) reported that the first examination malpractice in Nigeria was recorded in 1914 during the senior council local examination papers which were leaked before the scheduled date of the examination. Examination malpractice which started on a less pronounced scale only increased geometrically afterwards. Examination malpractice is one of those cardinal factors inhibiting or militating against the growth of education in Nigeria. The rate at which people indulge in this unholy act caused more harm than good in the development of education in Nigeria. This canker worm has led to institutions producing half baked graduates of secondary school leavers.\n\nIf examination malpractice is tackled and defeated or better still reduced to the barest minimum, Nigeria will become a better place where credibility and integrity is respected.\n\n1.1.    Background of the study\n\nIn Nigeria today, it is no longer news that this malady called examination mal practice has become a monster fighting the development of education in Nigeria. The alarming causes and effects of this menace have led us to this research work. They’ve equally been a lot of controversies on the actual causes of examination malpractice, most people believe government should be held responsible while some others are of the opinion that the increasing rate of this unholy act is entirely down to Nigerian students. There is also a major concern of the future of our country if examination mal practice is not defeated; would it spill over to others sectors of the economy if this malady isn’t fought to a standstill? This is one major concern was what led us to this research work.\n\n1.2.    Aims and objectives of the study\n\nThe study is aimed at the following:\n\n·        To find out the major causes of examination mal practice in Nigeria.\n\n·        To find out the major effects of examination mal practice in Nigeria.\n\n·        To recommend ways of eradicating examination mal practice in Nigeria.\n\n·        To know if there is a statistical relationship between examination malpractice, gender and age group.\n\n·        To educate the general public on the causes and effects of examination malpractice.\n\n·        To know if there is a significant relationship between the high level of unemployment and examination malpractice in Nigeria.\n\n1.3.    Significance of the study\n\nThe importance of this study is to know the actual causes and effects of examination malpractice in Nigeria, this would help the general public to declare war on this malady.\n\nA major significance of the study is to know if examination mal practice is sex or age based, that is, is there a significant relationship between examination malpractice, age and sex. Are they correlated or not? Another significance of this study is to know if there is a significant relationship between unemployment and examination malpractice in Nigeria.\n\n1.4.    Scope and limitations of the study\n\nFor the purpose of this study as the topic depicts, the scope of the study will be focused on the statistical analysis of examination mal practice in Nigeria. Another scope of this study is to know if a relationship exists between unemployment in Nigeria and examination malpractice. An equally major scope of this study is to know if examination malpractice is gender or aged based or related. Discovering the major causes and effects of unemployment in Nigeria is equally a scope of this study.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nIt is necessary to mention some of the limitations of this research work. The chief limitation is the difficulty in obtaining relevant information, some information required from respondents in questionnaires were not given by respondents but these missing values were not  statistical significant enough to be noticed.\n\nNotwithstanding, in the highlighted limitation above, it is          hoped that this research will be useful to Nigerians, organizations that may be interested in our research.\n\n1.5.    Definition of Terms\n\n·        Exam: a formal written, spoken or practical test, especially at school or college to see how much you know about a subject or what you can do.\n\n·        Malpractice: careless, wrong or illegal behavior.\n\n \n\n \n\n1.6.    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\nThe research hypotheses are as follows:\n\nHYPOTHESIS 1\n\nH0: there is no significant relationship between examination malpractice and unemployment in Nigeria.\n\nH1: there is a significant relationship between examination malpractice and unemployment in Nigeria.\n\nLevel of significance: 0.05\n\nDecision rule: reject H0 if p-value is less than the level of significance. Accept H0 if otherwise.\n\nHYPOTHESIS 2\n\nH0: there is no significant relationship between age and examination malpractice in Nigeria.\n\nH1: there is a significant relationship between age and examination malpractice in Nigeria.\n\nLevel of significance: 0.05\n\nDecision rule: reject H0 if p-value is less than the level of significance. Accept H0 if otherwise.\n\nHYPOTHESIS 3\n\nH0: there is no significant relationship between gender and examination malpractice in Nigeria.\n\nH1: there is a significant relationship between gender and examination malpractice in Nigeria.\n\nLevel of significance: 0.05\n\nDecision rule: reject H0 if p-value is less than the level of significance.

The purpose is primarily to ensure accountability of government revenue, enhance transparency and avoid misapplication of public funds. The maintenance of a Treasury Single Account will help to ensure proper cash management by eliminating idle funds usually left with different commercial banks and in a way enhance reconciliation of revenue collection and payment (Adeolu, 2015).\n\nSection 80 (1) of the 1999  Constitution as amended states “All revenues, or other moneys raised or received by the Federation (not being revenues or other moneys payable under this Constitution or any Act of the National Assembly into any other public fund of the Federation established for a specific purpose) shall be paid into and form one Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation”; successive governments have continued to operate multiple accounts for the collection and spending of government revenue in flagrant disregard to the provision of the constitution which requires that all government revenues be remitted into a single account. It was not until 2012 that government ran a pilot scheme for a single account using 217 ministries, department and agencies as a test case. The pilot scheme saved Nigeria about N500 billion in frivolous spending. The success of the pilot scheme motivated the government to fully implement TSA, leading to the directives to banks to implement the technology platform that will help accommodate the TSA scheme. The recent directives by President Mohammed Buhari that all government revenues should be remitted to a Treasury Single Account is in consonance with this programme and in compliance with the provisions of the 1999 constitution (CBN, 2015). \n\nThe Central Bank has opened a Consolidated Revenue Account to receive all government revenue and effect payments through this account. This is the Treasury Single Account. All Ministries, Departments and Agencies are expected to remit their revenue collections to this account through the individual commercial banks who act as collection agents. This means that the money deposit banks will continue to maintain revenue collection accounts for Ministries, Departments and Agencies but all monies collected by these banks will have to be remitted to the Consolidated Revenue Accounts with the CBN at the end of each banking day. In other words, Ministries, Departments and Agencies accounts with money deposit banks must be zerorized at the end every banking day by a complete remittance to the Treasury Single Account of all revenues collected. The implication is that banks will no longer have access to the float provided by the accounts they maintained for the Ministries, Departments and Agencies. Difference types of account could be maintained under a Treasury Single Account arrangement and these may include the TSA main account, subsidiary or sub-accounts, transaction accounts and zero balance account. Other types of accounts that could operated include imprest accounts, transit accounts and correspondence accounts. These accounts are maintained for transaction purposes for funds flowing in and out of the Treasury Single Account (Adeolu, 2015).   \n\nFrom the foregoing, it is obvious that the primary benefit of a Treasury Single Account is the mechanism it provides for proper monitoring of government receipts and expenditure. In the Nigerian case, it will help to block most if not all the leakages that have been the bane of the growth of the economy. We have a situation where some Ministries, Departments and Agencies manage their finances like independent empire and remit limited revenue to government treasuries. Under a properly run Treasury Single Account, this is not possible as agencies of government are meant to spend in line with duly approved budget provisions. The maintenance of a single account for government will enable the Ministry of Finance monitor fund flow as no agency of government is allowed to maintain any operational bank account outside the oversight of the ministry of finance. \nAs a matter of fact, deposit money banks stand to lose immensely from the implementation of Treasury Single Account.  This is because of the fact that public sector funds constitute a large chunk of commercial banks deposit.  Indeed, it is estimated that commercial banks hold about N2.2 trillion public sector funds at the beginning of sector quarter of 2015.  The impact of this amount of money leaving the system can be imagined when one considers the fact that each time the monthly federal allocation is released, the banking system is usually awashed with liquidity and as soon as this public sector funds dries up through withdrawal by the states, liquidity tightens again with interbank rates going up.  Of major impact will be the movement of funds of revenue generating parastatals such as the NNPC, out of commercial banks. \n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nAs the Federal government of Nigeria introduces Treasury Single Account, Banks will continue to device means of mobilizing funds from the private sector.  We see a return of the era when women are employed by banks specifically for deposit mobilization and tacitly encouraged to use any means necessary to get funds.  We see increase in deposit interest rates as a major means of inducing customers and most importantly we see a drop in lending and in the profitability of banks, at least, in the short to medium term until they fully come to terms with the impact of the policy and begin to properly position themselves for true banking business.  Ultimately, we see the share price of these banks falling as investors attempt to price in the policy impact. However, the implementation of this programme is a critical step towards curbing corruption in public finance. This is a tool to combat corrupt practices, eliminate indiscipline in public finance and ensure adequate fund flow that will be channeled to critical sectors of the economy to catalyze development. \n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n    To examine the implications of Treasury Single Account on the banking sector in Nigeria.\n    To examine the implications of Treasury Single Account on the economic development in Nigeria.\n    To identify the benefits of Treasury Single Account.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n    What are the implications of Treasury Single Account on the banking sector in Nigeria?\n    What are the implications of Treasury Single Account on the economic development in Nigeria?\n    What are the benefits of Treasury Single Account?\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n    The results from this study will educate the general public on the benefits of Treasury Single Account to the economy of the country. It will also educate on its temporary effect on the banking industry as huge sum of money will be leaving the sector suddenly.\n    This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\nTime constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

The study seek to determine the effectiveness of tax reform policy toward achieving high revenue to government and public utility. It analyses the concept of taxation, types and significance.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe tax system in Nigeria is made up of the tax policy, the tax laws and the tax administration. All of these are expected to work together in order to achieve the economic goal of the nation. According to the Presidential Committee on National tax policy (2008), the central objective of the Nigerian tax system is to contribute to the well being of all Nigerians directly through improved policy formulation and indirectly though appropriate utilization of tax revenue generated for the benefit of the people. In generating revenue to achieve this goal, the tax system is expected to minimize distortion in the economy. Other expectations of the Nigerian tax system according to the Presidential Committee on National tax policy (2008) include;\n\n·                    Encourage economic growth and development.  \n\n·                    Generate stable revenue or resources needed by government to accomplish loadable projects and or investment for the benefit of the people\n\n·                    Provide economic stabilization.\n\n·                    To pursue fairness and distributive equity\n\n·                    Correction of market failure and imperfection.\n\nIn an attempt to fulfill the above expectation, the national tax policy is expected to be in compliance with the principle of taxation, the lubricant to effective tax system. The Nigerian tax system has been flawed by what is termed multiplicity of tax and collecting entities at the three tiers of government levels – Federal, State and Local government (Ahunwan, 2009).\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nAccording to the report of the presidential committee on National Tax policy (2008), “The National tax policy provides a set of rules, modus operandi and guidance to which all stakeholders in the tax system must subscribe”. Tax policy formulation in Nigeria is the responsibility of the Federal inland Revenue Services (FIRS), Customs, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), National Population Commission (NPC), and other agencies but under the guidance of the National Assembly i.e. the law making body in Nigeria (Presidential committee on National tax policy, 2008). Suffice it to say that if there must be any effective implementation of the Nigerian tax system or attainment of its goal, the use of the national tax policy document remain absolutely essential. According to the Presidential Committee on tax policy (2008), “Nigeria needs a tax policy which does not only describe the set of guiding rules and principles, but also provide a stable point of reference for all the stakeholders in the country and upon which they can be held accountable. James and Nobes (2008) decried the inability of tax policy to meet up with efficiency and equity criteria against which it is being judged. It was further noted that tax policy is continually subjected to pressure and changes which most time does not guarantee outcome that are in line with the overall goal (James and Nobes 2008). Unfortunately, most policy changes in Nigeria are without adequate consideration of the taxpayers, administrative arrangement and cost plus the existing taxes. This has in no small measure hindered the effective implementation and goal congruence of the nation’s tax system. Citing (Bird and Oldman 1990), James and Nobes (2008) stated as follows “the best approach to reforming taxes is one that takes into account taxation theory, empirical evidence and political and administrative realities and blend them with good dose of local knowledge and a sound appraisal of the current macroeconomics and international situation to produce a feasible set of proposals sufficiently attractive to be implemented and sufficiently robust to withstand changing times, with reason and still produce beneficial results”.The research seek to investigate the nature of tax reforms and its impact on revenue generation.\n\n1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe problem confronting this research is to determine the nature of tax reforms and its impact on revenue generation in Nigeria, applying a longitudinal analysis.\n\n1.3      RESEARCH    QUESTION\n\n1     What constitute tax reforms in Nigeria?\n\n2      What is the effectiveness of tax reform towards revenue                  generation in Nigeria?\n\n1.4         OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n1            To determine the nature of tax reform in Nigeria\n\n2            To determine the effectiveness of tax reform policy towards     revenue generation to government\n\n1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study shall analyze tax reform policy and determine its effectiveness towards revenue generation to government.\n\nIt shall also serve as a source of information on issues of tax reforms in Nigeria\n\n1.6      STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS\n\n1      H0   Tax revenue generation in Nigeria   is high\n\n        H1    Tax   revenue generation in Nigeria is low\n\n2      H0    challenges to tax revenue generation in Nigeria is low\n\n        H1   Challenges to tax revenue generation in Nigeria is high\n\n3      H0    The impact of tax reform on revenue generation is low\n\n        H1    The impact of tax reform on revenue generation is high\n\n1.7      SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe   study focuses on the appraisal of tax reforms and its impact on revenue generation using a longitudinal analysis\n\n1.8      DEFINITION OF TERMS.\n\nTAX  POLICY  REFORM  \n\nAccording to the report of the presidential committee on National Tax policy (2008), “The National tax policy provides a set of rules, modus operandi and guidance to which all stakeholders in the tax system must subscribe”.

It provides a conceptual and analytical framework of financial information and its role in management decision making. A case study of MTN NIG.  is conducted in the research.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOne of important assumptions in decision making process and improvement economy is existence of quality information. Significant number of this information comes from accounting information systems and from financial statements. Financial statements have to provide realistic and objective picture of realistic business condition of certain company. In other words, auditing of financial statements is understandable, by which accuracy is ensured. In context of consideration of financial statements as a function of decision making it is important to emphasize that different users must know how to “read” those statements. “Reading” contents of financial statements provide whole number of different instruments and analyses procedures for understanding business.\n\nA well-established process of management on the basis of the financial statements and financial information is one of the most significant presumptions of the quality business. Decision making process requires information – financial and non-financial information as well. The most important financial information needed in the process of business decision comes from accounting.\n\nTherefore, we can say that accounting is a service function to management. It, basically, processes or gathers and studies “raw data” and converts them into suitable information in the process of decision making. The basic characteristics of the accounting are:\n\n·                    Gathering, processing and presenting accounting (financial) information\n\n·                    Information considering company’s business\n\n·                    Those directed towards different interested users\n\nAccounting of quality information Significant number of this information comes from accounting information systems and from financial statements.

In that context, we can describe financial statement analysis as the process where we convert data from financial statements into usable information for business quality measurement by different analytical techniques, which is very important in the process of rational management.\n\nTherefore, to know the current level of business quality is very significant in the context of future business management, since we try to ensure company’s development and existence on the market. Financial statement analysis comes before the management process that is before the process of planning which is the component of the management process.\n\nPlanning is very important for good management. Good financial plan has to consider all company’s strength and weaknesses.\n\nThe task of financial statement analysis is to recognize good characteristics of the company so that we could use the most of those advantages, but also to recognize company’s weaknesses in order to take corrective actions. Because of that, we can say that management of the company is the most significant user of financial statement analysis.\n\nThe research intends to investigate financial information as a tool for management decision making with a case study of MTN NIG.\n\n \n\n1.2            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe problem confronting this research is to investigate financial information as a tool for management decision making.\n\n1.3            RESEARCH QUESTION\n\n1                   What is financial information?\n\n2                   What is the source of financial information?\n\n3                   What is the role of financial information  in management decision making?\n\n4                   What is the role of financial information in management decision making in MTN NIG?\n\n \n\n1.4            OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n1                   To appraise the nature of financial information\n\n2                   To determine the nature of  management decision making\n\n3                   To appraise the role of financial information in management decision             making\n\n4                   To determine the role of financial information in management decision          making in MTN NIG\n\n \n\n1.5            SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n1.

The basic characteristics of the accounting are:\n\n·        Gathering, processing and presenting accounting (financial) information\n\n·        Information considering company’s business\n\n·        Those directed towards different interested users\n\nAccounting process contains several phases. Basically, it is a process in which input data converts into output information. If we focus our attention on the most significant part of the accounting (bookkeeping), then we can present the data processing through several phases as it is shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe first data processing phase consists of collecting data about occurred business events. After data collecting comes the second phase of the accounting process that consists of business event analysis, after that recording in journal and general ledger comes.\n\nAt the end of accounting period, just before preparing basic financial statements, we need to check data accuracy in the books since we make financial statements on the basis of those data. Therefore we prepare the trial balance. It represents the recapitulation of all ledger accounts and financial transactions. After all records are coordinated and after we find all data accurate, we have the last phase of the accounting process that refers to preparing financial statements. As it has already been pointed out, financial statements have to satisfy interests of different accounting (financial) information users.\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION AS A TOOL FOR MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING CASE STUDY OF MTN NIGERIA ",

It analyses the concept of bad and doubtful debt and highlight the effect of bad and doubtful debt on the liquidity of banks in Nigeria.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nbad and doubtful debt is used in the banking sector  to refer to the portion of loans, advances and over drafts granted by bank which has proved difficult and seemingly impossible to recover in full from the respective committed customer. Such debt do not emerge instantaneously but rather are a gradual result of errors by lending officers and subsequent improper administrative handling of the facilities among other factors.\nThe commercial banks are in the services industry. They are aimed at providing financial assistance to individuals and corporate bodies without underplaying the importance of profitability to the shareholders and depositors alike. A bank is therefore expected to ensure that sufficient liquidity of funds meet cash demand by its customer at short notices.\n\nThis, in addition to maintaining sufficient profitability hold through proper and efficient management. A business has two basic source of capital:\n\n1.      Owners Capital:That is equity contributed by shareholders (including retained earnings) which is essentially used for he purchase of the initial assets of the business and its initial working capital.\n\n2.      Borrowed Funds: Which refers to external fund required and injected into the business by management subject to the articles and memoranda of Association. It is here that the commercial bank play an important role by granting long and short term loans and advances. It is in the process of granting those loans facilities that error occurs. Losses resulting from such errors will be the focus of this research.\n\n1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThrough the proper use of interest rate banks are able to attract depositors of various terms. Such depositors include, short term deposits ranging from 7 days to 6 months, long term, deposits current account. This is regarded as special borrowing by the bank since the bank of any purpose(s) could use any deposits without recourse to the depositors, and such depositors are only payable on demand or at any agreed date. It is these depositors, which provide the basis for banks lending to various customers. This is subject of the reserve ratio set by the central bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe interest rates charged on loans by banks are usually higher than the rates they pay on deposit and are determined by the federal government. It was the interest rates chargeable and payable on  loans facilities and deposits respectively.\nThe numbers of volume of good loan and advance seriously determine the degree of profitable commercial banks. Consequently, profitable commercial banks have to limit or eliminate the number of bad account in their lending portfolio. It is necessary to note that all funds tied up in bad and doubtful account are not accountable for further onward lending.\n            Also, with the advent of CBN prudential guidelines, non performing loans and advances whose interest have been outstanding on these account are not reflected in the earnings of commercial bank, but charged to interest suspense and charged income when realized. Bad debt is regarded as negative contributors to the profitability of commercial banks. So banks should be expected to be the most relevant to provide for bad debts unless it is unavoidable.\n            Another dimension however is that critics are quick in pointing out that the high bad or doubtful debts figures in final accounts of commercial banks could be realistic. It is also alleged that banks could use such provision to evade tax. It also demonstrate the incompetence of the lending bankers in the management of loan able funds on the other hand, it is held that this provisions shows the level of convenience by the bank officer system. This views was expressed by the president of Association of Shareholders of Wema Bank, Mr. AkintundeAsaw. He alleged that some of the official of Wema Bank acted outside the specified authority and schedule by irregularly approving loans. He therefore gave the bank up to 1990 to recover all irregular loans while assuring that those involved in irregular disbursement of loans  would be punished.\n            The final accounts  of most commercial banks in Nigeria have provisions for bad and doubtful debts of various figures while the funds of the level of such provisions is decreasing in the case of some commercial banks for other, it is increasing.\nThe view of the provisions for bad and doubtful debts by banks in the country has necessitated an in-depth study into the fundamental factors for such losses by the bank. The research therefore seek to determine the effect of bad and doubtful debt on the liquidity asset of banks in Nigeria\n\n1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThe granting of loans and advances by banks constitute a fundamental function aimed at providing funds to customers when needed to execute projects and implement viable businesses and economic activities towards the development of the nation .However it is perplexing to note that volumes of such loans and advances are never recovered due to either poor administrative process of recovery or bad management of such loans and advances by the customers. This as a result leads to bad and doubtful debt, a greater percentage of which are never recovered. The implication is a loss to the bank and a drain on the banks financial resources. The problem confronting this research therefore is to determine the effect of bad and doubtful debt on the liquidity asset of banks in Nigeria with a case study of UBA PLC\n\n1.3      RESEARCH QUESTION\n\n1 What is the nature of bad and doubtful debt\n\n2            What is bank liquidity asset\n\n3            W hat  is the effect of bad and doubtful debt on the bank liquidity asset\n\n4            What is the effect of bad and doubtful debt on UBA PLC liquidity asset\n\n1.4       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n1   To determine the nature of bad and doubtful debt\n\n2        To determine the nature of bank liquidity asset\n\n3        To determine the effect of bad and doubtful debt on banks liquidity asset\n\n4        To determine the effect of bad and doubtful debt on UBA PLC liquidity asset\n\n1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n1  To project the implication of  poor management loans and advances\n\n2    To show the effect of bad and doubtful debt on banks liquidity asset\n\n3    To profer possible measures to reduce the volume of bad and doubtful debt in banks\n\n5        To emphasize the importance of bank liquidity asset for the overall well being of the bank.\n\n1.6      STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS\n\n1   Ho liquidity asset in UBA is low\n\n     Hi liquidity asset in UBA is high\n\n2   Ho bad and doubtful debtinUBA is low\n\n     Hi bad and doubtful debt in UBA is high\n\n3    Ho the effect of bad and doubtful debt  on liquidity asset in UBA is low\n\n     Hi the effect of bad and doubtful debt on liquidity asset in UBA is high.\n\n1.7       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n          The study focuses on the appraisal of  the effect of bad and doubtful  on the liquidity asset of banks in Nigeria with a case study of UBA PLC.\n\n1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nBAD AND DOUBTFUL DEBT DEFINED ;Bad and doubtful debt is used in the banking sector  to refer to the portion of loans, advances and over drafts granted by bank which has proved difficult and seemingly impossible to recover in full from the respective committed customer. \nEFFECT OF BAD AND DOUBTFUL DEBT ON THE LIQUIDITY ASSET OF BANKS IN NIGERIA\n",

The study assesses the performance of the different sectors in the Nigeria economy in contributing to VAT revenue with a view to showcase their effect in economic growth.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTax can be defined as a compulsory contribution to support a government levied on personal, property income, commodities, transactions etc. now at a fixed rate mostly proportionate to the amount in which the contribution is levied (Crowder 1998) as it can equally be confirmed in (Tilley 1981) Oyebangi(2006) identified two major forms of taxes, these are;\n\n1.  Direct Taxes: these are taxes imposed by the government on the income of individuals and companies which are usually paid by the person or persons or whom it is legally imposed. Examples are Personal Income Tax(PIT), Company Income Tax(CIT), Capital Gains Tax(CGT), Withholding Tax, Petroleum Profit Tax(PPT),Educational Tax and  Capital Transfer Tax(CTT). The PIT is imposed on individual earnings, CIT on profit of organizations/corporate bodies, PPT on oil purchasing/ exploration Companies, CGT on profit from sale of capital assets and CTT on the transfer of property inter-Viro and transfer on death. However CTT on profit was abrogated in 1996.\n\n2.  INDIRECT TAXES: these are taxes by the government on goods and services. Indirect Taxes can be avoided because it is payable only if one buys the commodities or enjoys the services in which the tax is imposed and it involves little administrative cost compared to direct taxes. It does not create dis-incentive to efforts used in the case of direct taxes and hence does not affect the economic functions of the tax payers. Examples of indirect taxes in Nigeria according to Oyebanji(2006) are;  \n\n       A.    Import Duties/Tariffs:  levied on goods imported into the country.\n\n              B.    Export Duties: levied on goods produced for export.\n\n      C     Excise Duties: imposed on specific goods produced in the country.\n\n      D.       Consumption Tax: levied on the purchase any commodity or employment of a service.          Examples are sales Taxes and value added Tax (VAT). The characteristics of effect of consumption tax is that it is not included in the price tag by the affected commodity rather it is added as a percentage of the total of invoice in the goods or services rendered.\n\n                      However this research aims to provide a comparative analysis of value added Tax Revenue among different sector in Nigeria. a case study of federal Inland Revenue of Lagos state.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nAccording to Oseregho and Associates as quoted by Aderdi, SannidAdesina(2011),VAT is a consumption tax levied at each stage of the consumption chain and borne by the final consumer of the product or service. Each person is required to change and collect VAT at a flat rate of 5% on all invoiced amounts on all goods and services not exempted from paying VAT, under the value added Tax Act 1993 as amended. Where the VAT collected on behalf of the government (output VAT) in a particular month is more than the VAT paid to other persons (input VAT) in the same month, the difference is required to be remitted to government on a monthly basis by the taxable person. Where the reverse is the case, the tax payer is entitled to a refined of the excess VAT, i.e., no VAT is payable on exports. Also VAT is payable in the currency of the transaction under individual goods or services are exchanged. The precedence for the introduction of VAT in Nigeria was based on the fact that taxation as an instrument of fiscal policy is vital in generating revenue to finance the activities of the government, redistribute income, stabilize the economy as well as stimulate growth and development. The research intends to investigate the performance of different sectors in the Nigerian economy in contributing to VAT revenue using Lagos state Federal Inland Revenue as a case study.\n\n1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nVAT was introduced to contribute to the economic growth of the nation by providing revenue to government to accelerate developments. However this goal is still far from being achieved sector contributions to VAT revenue is pivotal to providing the needed revenue to government to impact on economic growth. Hence the problem confronting this research is to provide a comparative analysis of VALUE Added TAX REVENUE among different sectors in Nigeria with a case study of Federal Inland Revenue Service of Lagos state.\n\n1.3      RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the nature of TAX and its significance?\n\n2.  What is the nature of Value Added Tax?\n\n3.  What is the sectorial contributions of Value added Tax revenue\n\n4.   What constitute the sectorial Analysis of VAT in Lagos state?\n\n1.4      OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n1.  To determine the nature and significance of TAX\n\n2.

Constraints of accounting measurement provide practical guidelines to reduce the volume and cost of reporting accounting information without reducing its value to decision makers. Thus, lending is one of the key functions of commercial banks.\n\nLoans represent investments and usually constitute the largest assets of banks. Both individuals and institutions demand for loan. The households seek lendable funds from bank when the excess of income over expenditure is negative (Mbat, 1995:89). The beauty of this role is that credit control principles are the same whatever industry you work in and you can move into different sectors, with enough experience you could even become a consultant and share  your experience with others. The need for loanable fund is a result of the non-synchronization between receipts and payments during the normal course of business transactions. The bank in granting loans to household, individuals or business firms takes into consideration factors such as liquidity risk, repayment method, and the purpose of such loans (Mbat, 1995).\n\nLoans and advances are mostly short-termed. The quality of loan portfolio depends on credit analysis undertaken by the loan officer. The credit analysis function is to ensure that loan granted has a good qualitative composition. The qualitative element of bank loans include high liquidity quotient, minimum risk, and appropriate maturity structure. These quantitative elements are necessary to guarantee repayment on demand or on maturity. Accounting services are indispensable in any organization. Whether big or small, profit oriented or non-profit oriented, all organization require judicious management of scare researches in order to achieve targeted plans and objectives. Hence, they all need the services of an accountant. Neither a firm of medical doctors nor that of lawyers can obtain a reasonable magnitude of loan from a  bank without being required to present its audited accounts to the bank to analyze its ability to repay the debt. T When credit controls exit, the bank requires effective and efficient management strategies, otherwise, the said loans degenerate into debt. In this study, the main focus is on the management of loans/credit control in commercial bank. In order to facilitate this research, UBA, PLC has been selected for a case study.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\nAs observed above, loan is an investment to a bank. Just like any other investment, there are inherent risks. These risks include the risk of default and inflation or purchasing power risk. Thus, there would be need decisions to be guided by professional advice (Ejiogu, 2002). In agreement with the opinion of Ejiogu above, Edimnce (2004) opine that the accountant as a professional is necessary in loans and credit controls and management. However, Mgbada (2007) question the unique role played by the accountant in loans and credit control and management by saying that banks still achieve better control and management of loans and credit without the services of the accountant. Are accountant necessary in loans and credit controls and management? What role do accountant play in the control and management of loans and credit? This research is designed to answer these questions.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of this research are:\n\n(i)     To examine the role of the accountant in loans and credit      management in UBA Plc.\n\n(ii)    To determine the influence of the role played by the        accountant in loans and credit management in UBA.\n\n(iii)   To examine the relationship between the amount of loan        granted and the management of loans and credit in UBA.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n(1)    Are Accountants responsible for securing the money being     disbursed to customers?\n\n(2)    What are the contributions made by the accountants of UBA towards the enhancement of loans a credit control? \n\n(3)    What are the problems encountered by the accountants of\n\n        UBA while performing their duties of loans and credit control         management.\n\n 1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\n  1.   The role of the accountants does not have any significant       influence on loans and credit management in UBA, Plc.\n\n2.   There is no significant relationship between the amount of loans granted and the management of loans and credit in UBA, Plc.\n\n  3.   Fund diversion does not affect loans and credit management         in UBA, Plc.\n\n 1.6  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n It is hardly an exaggeration that the difference between the success and the failure in the banking industry is in the effective management of loans and credit control. With the research work, it will provide an additional source of secondary data to potential researchers who may come by it. The findings in this study would be used as a blue-print for other researchers on loans and credit controls strategy adjustment and modifications by banks  and other financial institutions that may have access to it.\n\n1.7   SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis research work focuses on the United Bank of Africa (UBA), Uyo branch, Akwa Ibom State. The research work has also x-ray the roles of accountants in loan/credit control and management in the bank stated above.\n\nAlso apart from conducting desk research, the researcher has sampled the opinion of accountants on ways to chockmate their problems.\n\n1.8   LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThe limitations of this study include some of unavoidable constraints and problems encountered in the process. They are as follows:\n\n(i)     Finance: The problem of finance was not left out in the course      of research to this study.\n\n(ii)    Time: Since this study is one of the many courses offered by the researcher, the researcher was constrained by time to carry out an indent research on the study.\n\n(iii)   Non-Challant Attitude of Bank Officials: The reluctance of bank officials to reveal information on the need for this study for fear of breach of duty of secrecy to customers, exposure of banks administrative short-comings.\n\n(iv)   Non-Availability of Records: This one of the most important limiting factors in the course of the study. This includes the problems of easily getting the appropriate data due to bureaucracy which hiders the information flow in the country. \n\n(v)    Ignorance of Respondent/ Borrowers: Most bank customers were semi-illiterates and most often it was difficult the collect adequate data required from them.\n\n1.9   BRIEF HISTORY OF UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA\n\nUnited Bank for Africa (UBA) dates back to 1949 when the British and French Bank Limited (BFB) commenced business in Nigeria following Nigeria's independence from Britain, UBA was incorporated in 1961 to take over the business for BFA.\n\nToday’s United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) is a product of the merger of Nigeria's third and fifth largest banks, namely the old UBA and the former standard Trust Bank Plc, and a subsequent acquisition of the erstwhile continental Trust bank Limited (CTR). Since its historical emergence from the merger of former standard Trust Bank and UBA Plc. The UBA group has positioned itself to be Nigeria's dominant bank and a lending player on the Africa continent.\n\nl.10 ORGANISATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study was organized into five chapters. Chapter one contains the introduction which is made up of the background to the study, statement of the problem, objectives of the study, Research questions, Research hypothesis, significance of the study, Scope of the study, Limitation of the study, brief history of UBA and organization of the study. \n\nChapter two dealt with review of the related literature, while chapter three shows the research methods used in carrying out the design. Chapter four, the data’s collected were presented analyzed and interpreted. Chapter five consists of the summary, conclusion and recommendations.\n\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nACCOUNTABILITY: Responsibility of giving an explanation when need arises to ensure that money and other resource have not been wasted but properly and lawfully used for the benefit and welfare of the owners, (Ekpo: 2002)\n\nCONTROLLER - Chief accounting executive of an organization. The controller is in charge of the accounting department.\n\nCREDIT ANALYSIS: process of determining, before a line of credit is extended, whether a credit applicant meets the firm’s credit standards of those of a leader and what amount of credit the applicant should receive (Ekanem, 2008).\n\nCREDIT MANAGEMENT: Is a term used to identify accounting functions usually conducted under the umbrella of Accounts receivables (Mattila, 2002). \n\nLOANS: Is a credit arrangement a security is pledged and must be repaid with interest over a stipulated period of time (Ekanem, 2008).\n\nOVER DRAFTS: This is a credit arrangement by banks to their customer to withdraw money over and above that what he has in the account.

They argued that economic liberalization in other parts of the world have continued to yield anticipated results, increasing global trade and technological advancements such that by the end of the 21st century some emergent economies have appeared on the global capitalist markets. It is no gainsaying the fact that the likes of Indonesia, China, Japan and Malaysia are now making new waves in the global markets. While this thinking continues about global capitalist development, researches conducted by the United Nations and the World Bank has shown that Nigeria's economic development is routinely constrained by some inherent cultural factors (NISER, 2000).\n\nAlthough Nigeria is rich in human and material resources, its economic and political developments have been fraught with crises since independence in 1960. Indices of the failure of the Nigerian state are today evident in the pervasive cases of hunger, inflation, budget deficits, debt overhang, street begging, prostitution, frauds, high crime rates in major cities, collapse of manufacturing industries, corruption in public service, stagnation in entrepreneurial development and epileptic power supply (Fadeyi and Adisa, 2012). In the face of these crises it becomes difficult for sustainable development to take place in the country (NISER, 2000 and UNDP, 2006). Our interest in this paper is not all the problems measured, but the huge expenditure injected annually into the power sector and its attendant impact on the Nigerian economy.\n\nNigeria’s power sector had operated for several decades as a state monopoly then called National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) until 2005. NEPA controls electricity generation, transmission and distribution facilities with all the profound problems inherent in public monopoly. This over centralization made it impossible for electricity supply to keep pace with the growth in population and economic activities. Nigeria has the biggest gap in the world between electricity demand and supply, providing its population of over 160 million with less than 4000 megawatts of electricity. In contrast, South Africa with a population of less than 50 million people generates more than 40,000 megawatts while Brazil, an emerging economy like Nigeria, generates over 100,000 megawatts for its 201 million citizens (FG, 2013). Indeed, the gap in the power sector has far reaching implications for improving the business climate, sustaining economic growth and the social wellbeing of Nigerians. About 45 percent of the population has access to electricity, with only about 30 percent of their demand for power being met. The power sector is plagued by recurrent outages to the extent that some 90 percent of industrial customers and a significant number of residential and other non-residential customers provide their own power at a huge cost to themselves and to the Nigerian economy. Installed capacity is 8,000 megawatts, but only 4,000 megawatts is operable of which about 1,500 megawatts is available to generate electricity. At 125 kWh per capita, electricity consumption in Nigeria is one of the lowest in the world (AfDB, 2009).\n\n1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE RESEARCH\n\n          Energy is widely regarded as a propelling force behind any economic activity and indeed industrial production. Therefore, high grade energy resources willamplifytheimpact of technology and create tremendous economic growth. High grade resources can act as facilitator of technology while low grade resources can dampen the forcefulness of new technology. Ojinnaka (1998) argued that the consumption of energy tracks with the national product. Hence, the scale of energy consumption per capita is an important indicator of economic modernization. In general countries that have higher per capita energy consumption are more developed than those with low level of consumption.\n\nThe importance of energy lies in other aspect of development - increase in foreign earnings when energy products are exported, transfer of technology in the process of exploration, production and marketing; increase in employment in energy industries; improvement of workers welfare through increase in worker's salary and wages, improvement in infrastructure and socio-economic activities in the process of energy resource exploitation. Thus in the quest for optimal development and efficient management of available energy resources, equitably allocationand efficient utilizationcan put the economy on the part of sustainable growth and development. Arising from this argument, adequate supply of energy thus becomes central to the radical transformation of the nation’s economy.\n\nIn Nigeria, energy serves as the pillar of wealth creation evident by being the nucleus of operations and engine of growth for all sectors of the economy. The output of the energy sector (electricity and the petroleum products) usually consolidate the activities of the other sectors which provide essential services to direct the production activities in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, commerce etc. Nigeria is endowed with abundant energy resources but suffers from perennial energy crisis which has defied solution. The co-existence of vast wealth in natural resources and extreme personal poverty referred to as the “resource curse” or 'Dutch disease' (Auty,1993) afflicts Nigeria. The size of the economy marked by the Gross National Income per capita is put at $1,190 and ranked 162 out of 213 countries in the world development index in 2009 (The World Bank, 2011). On economic growth, the GDP per capita of Nigeria expanded by 132 percent between independence in 1960 and 1969, and rose to a peak growth of 283 percent between 1970 and 1979. The severity of this malaise led to the restructuring of the economyin 1986. In the period 1988-1997 which constitutes the period of structural economic adjustment and liberalization, the GDP responded to economic adjustment policies and grew at a positive rate of 4 percent. In 2006, the real GDP growth rate was 7 percent. The economy when measured by the real GDP, grew by 7.87% in 2010. (National Bureau of Statistics-NBS, 2010 and Central Bank of Nigeria - CBN, 2010).\n\nThe average power per capita (in watts)in USA, Japan,South Africa, China, Indiaand Nigeria were 1,363, 774, 496, 397, 85, and 12 respectively. These roughly correlate with the GDP per capita of the countries in 2008 (The World fact book, 2008). Ironically, while Nigerian energy resources, particularly oil, are exported to other countries; itspeople and economy suffer from severe shortages of the same product. This is manifested by the epileptic supply of electricity and perennialshortage of most petroleum products.\n\nThe survey of literature shows that most empirical studies focus on either testing the role of energy in stimulating economic growth or examining the direction of causality between these two variables. Although the positive role of energy infrastructure on economic growth has become a stylized fact, there are some methodological reservations about the results from these empirical studies. Some authors have used the autoregressive distributed lags bounds test, two-regime threshold co-integration models, panel data approach and multivariate models. A general observation from these studies is that the literature produced conflicting results and there is no consensus on the existence and direction of causality between energy consumption and economic growth. This paper focuses on the causality between GDP and total energy consumption on one part and each of the basic sub-components of energy consumption in Nigeria with a view to finding out if different sources of energy have varying impact on economic growth.\n\n1.2     STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\n          The Nigerian government spend so much, spend high cost of money on the electricity generation and power supply in Nigeria, allocation made to it is relatively equal to the allocation of education which means that much money is put in to electricity. Therefore, this research work will explore, to find out if there is any significance importance to the growth of the economy of Nigeria.\n\nThe epileptic nature of electricity has led to scarcity of petrol and kerosene because the citizens have resulted to using generators and kerosene powered equipment to provide energy for use at homes. Also, import content of our domestic fuel usage has grown over the years to about 75% (International Energy Agency, 2012).This has resulted in the use and overdependence on fuel-wood which has led to deforestation and attendant degradation of the environment and worsening desertification (Babanyara& Saleh, 2010).\n\n1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n          The objective of this research work thus is to investigate whether annual government huge expenditure on the power sector actually worth it by measuring the impact of power supply on key indice of growth in Nigeria. Consequently, the sequence of the research is clear. Following the introduction, section two contains brief review of related literature. In section three, the method of study is unveil. Whilst section four presents and analyses result of findings, section five concludes the research work with brief policy remark.\n\n1.4     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n          This research work covers a limited area or concentration which is on the electricity generation and supply to the nation. This study access the economic growth as impacted by the power generated by the power supply– NNPA.\n\n1.5     RESEARCH QUESTION    \n\n          The research questions will be tailored towards the purpose of the study such that if they are answered, one will clearly realize why model architecture is necessary in the management of staff promotion and remuneration. The questions are the following:\n\n1.     What is the government expenditure on electricity generation per anume?\n\n2.     What are the problems facing the electricity generation in Nigeria?\n\n3.     What possible effects can be made to increase or boost the electricity supply off the country so as boost the country economy too?\n\n \n\n1.6     LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\n          During the course of performing/researching this project work, the researcher encountered a lot of challenges as well as opposition which ranges from financial constraints, time factor. this factors in their own ways, slowed down the speedy progress of this work that resulted to the researcher not being able to finish the research work on time as is required\n\nAlso,  within the area of study the researcher was faced with some other forms of constrains that contributed to the limitation of this researcher work, like accessibility to data, information and facts concerning the present study due to some reasons or the other, some not willing to give out information that it is to be within the workers.\n\n1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nElectricity: is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge. Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction and electric current.\n\nEconomic growth: is the increase in the inflation-adjusted market value of the goods and services produced by an economy over time. It is conventionally measured as the percent rate of increase in real gross domestic product, or real GDP.\n\nGDP: the gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the primary indicators used to gauge the health of a country's economy. It represents the total dollar value of all goods and services produced over a specific time period; you can think of it as the size of the economy.\nTHE IMPACT OF ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND SUPPLY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH",

The research work analyze the purpose, problems, significance and also the questions relating to the importance of value Added Tax as a source of revenue to the government in Nigeria. In view of this, the research work is discussed under five chapters. Chapter one, focuses on the general introduction of the topic under view, stating the questions and hypothesis. Chapter two deals with the review of the related literature, philosophy and the history of VAT in Nigeria, along with some specific government responsibilities, and also general appraisal of VAT administration in Nigeria, scope, nature and operational character. Chapter three is about research methodology, to see the important of Value Added Tax as a source of revenue to the government in Nigeria, the research design is used, data collection instrument and sampling techniques. Chapter four deals with classification of responses, the information gathered from questionnaires and how such information are tested using hypothesis. Chapter five focused on the summary of findings, conclusion, scope and limitations and finally recommendations..\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\n          Taxation is an important factor in Economic planning and also an agent for social change. It is perhaps the last to understand and most unappreciated instrument among other government policies by the citizens, yet they expect government to provide some services. This must probably owing to the fact that most people, particularly in developing countries like Nigeria, have very little knowledge of how the machineries of government operate.\n\n          Thus, the taxman is seen by an average Nigeria as a monster always ready to prey on its victims, or a plague that must be avoided at all cost.\n\n          Benjamin Franklin, Philosopher, observed that “in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes.”\n\n          The certainty of taxes have been established long in Nigeria. Before the arrival of the Colonial Masters, Nigeria had been paying taxes in kind by giving farm products to their rulers and rendering free services such as clearing the bush, digging pit toilets, well e.t.c., for the benefits of the community as a whole.\n\n          Income tax was first introduced in Nigeria in 1904 by the Late Lord Lugard, various types of taxes there after come into being through subsequences government.\n\n          Despite the fact that there are other sources government could generate revenue to fashion a society everyone can be proud of.\n\n          Taxes are not new in Nigeria but Value Added Tax (VAT) is the most recent form of tax known to Nigerians.\n\n          The idea of introducing VAT in Nigeria came from the report of the study groups set up the Federal Government in 1991, review the entire fan system VAT was proposed and a committee was set up by carrying out feasibility studies on its implementation. In January 1993, government agreed to introduce VAT by the middle of the year, it was later shifted to 1st September 1993, by which time the relevance legislature (Decree No 102 of 1993) would have been made and proper ground work done. VAT, which replaces sales tax in Nigeria, is administered by the Federal Inland Revenue Services (F.I.R.S) through VAT directorate in close co-operation with the Nigeria custom services (NcS) and the State Inland Revenue Services (S.I.R.S).\n\n          The rationale behind replacing sales tax with the VAT is in formed by a number of factors and consideration notable:\n\ni.        The base of sales tax in Nigeria s operate under Decree No 7 of narrow. It covers only nine categories of goods plus sales and services in Registered hotels, motels and similar establishments. The narrow base of the tax which negated the fundamental principles of consumption tax which by nature is expected to cut across all consumable goods and services, VAT base is border and included most professional services and banking transaction which are profit generating sectors.\n\nii.       Only locally manufacturer good were aimed by the sales tax Decree 1986, although this might not have been the intention of the law. Vat is neutral in this regard. Under VAT, a considerable part of the tax to be realised is form imported goods. This means that under the new VAT, locally manufactured goods will not be placed at a disadvantages relative to imports.\n\niii.      Since VAT is based in general consumption behaviour of the people, the expected high yield from it will boost from the payer of the tax. In the light of the foregoing, a seminar of this among the people to the effect that government derives the bulk revenue required for meeting its obligation to the people through taxation.\n\n1.1     Statement of the Problem\n\n          The introduction of Value Added Tax into Nigeria tax system was greatly antagonised by its critics, more and more organisations are being a registered person. Every organisation that trades in goods and services for a consideration is obliged to register with the FIRS VAT Directorate. The registration covers all the business activities of the organisation. The following are some of the problems encountered in the introduction of Value Added Tax:\n\ni.        Inaccurate computation of Value Added Tax figures.\n\nii.       Incompliance of infant industries with Value Added Tax Directorate.\n\niii.      Illiteracy of some rural areas about Value Added Tax.\n\niv.      Lack of information on VAT to new industries.\n\nv.       Incomplete information in the tax invoice of a customer:\n\n          With these problems, the VAT directorate found it rather difficult to balance the final account which provides information to other VAT officials. Therefore, there is need for the introduction of Value Added Tax for the progress of modern business organisation.\n\n1.2     Objective of the Study\n\n          The broad objectives of this project work are summarised as follows:\n\n§  To improve the effectiveness of VAT in reducing over dependence on oil sector by the nation\n\n§  To determine the importance of VAT as a source of revenue to the government in Nigeria\n\n§  To ascertain whether the federal Inland Revenue Services can help the profit tempo in the nearest future\n\n§  To rectify the existing lapses in VAT administration so as to minimise the level of tax evasion.\n\n§  To  determine the efficiency of Federal Inland Revenue Services in effective administration of Value Added Tax in Nigeria\n\n§  To ascertain the extent to which VAT can provide revenue to finance basis infrastructure for industrial development\n\n1.3     Significances of the Study\n\n          This research work would serve as a reference to interested parties that is; student, researcher and so on.\n\n          It would also add to the body of knowledge.

The Hausas of Northern Nigeria were paying taxes, though in kind, to the Emir in return for security and common services. However, with the advent of the colonialists, direct taxation was introduced in 1904 by Sir Lord Lugard, the then British appointed Governor. Its implementation started first in the North and later in the Southern and Eastern regions.\n\nAccording to Ezejelue and Ihendinihu (2006) taxation can be defined as the demand made by the government of a country for a compulsory payment of money by the citizens of the country with the objective of raising revenue, satisfy collective wants of the people and regulate economic and social policies.\n\nAguolu (1999:17) defined capital allowance as expenditures deducted from profits before taxation to reduce the effect of taxation and thus encourage savings and investment. These capital allowances can come in form of expenses on assets, investments and other noncurrent assets/activities of the organization.\n\nThese capital allowances are however backed by various Government legislations. They are granted to enhance the growth and development of industries as well as empowering individuals and corporate taxpayers economically. This work will therefore focus on Capital allowances and their effect on small-scale industries with emphasis on selected small-scale industries in Nigeria, using Rivers State as a case study.\n\nThe modern day taxation and its use as a fiscal policy could be traced to 1926, which was a year of economic depression in Great Britain. During this period, Britain witnessed an unprecedented decline in her overall economic activities resulting to reduction in total earnings, shortage of fund in the private sector and reduced income per capital with attendant low standard of living. The effect of this depression was felt not only in Britain but almost the world over. Governments at this time were trying to revive, rehabilitate and mobilize enough capital to provide for economic and social expenses and to raise the standard of living of its populace. In doing this, various fiscal policies were formulated which include taxation.\n\nAccording to Aguolu (1999: 1); taxation may be defined as a compulsory levy by Government through its agencies on the income, consumption and capital of its subjects. These levies are made on personal income such as salaries, business profits, interests, dividends, discounts and royalties. They are used to provide security, social amenities and create conditions for the economic well being of the society. The main purpose of taxation according to Ola (1998:14) is to raise funds to meet Government’s expenditure and to redistribute wealth and management of the economy.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe objective of granting capital allowances and incentives to small and medium scale enterprises is to enhance their growth and development, thus contributing to the overall economic development of the country. But the objective cannot be achieved in a situation where the would-be beneficiaries are not even aware of the existence of such incentives. Moreover, the few who are aware of these incentives do not even bother to apply for them due to the poor and inefficient tax administration. Therefore, there is the need to proffer solutions to these problems to ensure the growth and development of our economy.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe main objective of this study is to examine the effect of capital allowances on the performance of small and medium scale businesses in Nigeria. Specific objectives of the study are:\n\n1.  To identify capital allowances available to SMEs in Nigeria.\n\n2.  To examine the level of taxpayers’ awareness of the existence of capital allowances.\n\n3.  To examine the effect of capital allowances on the profit after tax of small and medium scale businesses in Nigeria.\n\n4.  To determine the relationship between capital allowances and growth of small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria.\n\n        1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nThe following research questions will be considered in this study:\n\n1)  What are the Capital allowances available to small scale enterprises in Nigeria?\n\n2)  What is the level of taxpayers’ awareness of the existence of these incentives?\n\n3) What effects do Capital allowances have on after tax profits of small scale enterprises?\n\n4)  Is there any relationship between Capital allowances and the growth of small scale enterprises in Nigeria?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES         \n\nIn order to ascertain the effect of Capital allowances on the performance of small-scale enterprises, the following hypotheses have been formulated:\n\n        Ho1:  Capital allowances do not have any significant effect on the after tax profits of small-scale industries.\n\nHo2:   Capital allowances do not enhance the growth of small scale enterprises.\n\n1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe research will be of benefit to the government – policy makers and tax revenue authorities. It will provide a framework for the critical evaluation of tax policies, provides a basis for the modification of tax incentive design and identify loopholes in the present tax system that serves as disincentive to investment.\n\nIt will also benefit other researchers, forming a basis for further research on the subject in future. The study also gives a clear insight into the various ways in which tax policies in Nigeria can be executed efficiently to still favor small businesses and how some taxation policies in Nigeria can be properly tackled. The study also gives a clear insight into the various causes of why small businesses fail in Nigeria as well as the challenges of the tax policies in Nigeria. The findings and recommendations of the researcher will help in building a strong and better tax policy system in Nigeria, if taken seriously by government and the general public. The challenges of taxation in Nigeria are outlined in-order for drastic measures to be taken to tackle these challenges and meet the prospects of the general public so that revenue from tax policy to the government can be increased.\n\n1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study covers various capital allowances in assets such as buildings, vehicles, plants and machineries, and how they affect performance of small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria, using selected small and medium businesses in Rivers state.\n\n1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe only limitation faced by the researcher in the course of carrying out this study was the delay in getting data from the various respondents. Most respondents were reluctant in filling questionnaires administered to them due to their busy schedules and nature of their work. The researcher found it difficult to collect responses from the various respondents, and this almost hampered the success of this study.\n\n1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nCapital Allowance: Thisrefers to sums of money a business can deduct from the overall corporate or income tax on its profits. These sums derive from certain purchases or investments etc.\n\nSME: Small and Medium Scale Enterprise\n\nPerformance: The accomplishment of a given task measured against preset known standards of accuracy, completeness, cost, and speed. In a contract, performance is deemed to be the fulfillment of an obligation, in a manner that releases the performer from all liabilities under the contract\nEFFECT OF CAPITAL ALLOWANCES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES 2\n",

Borthick and Clara, (1990) supporting the above, stated that accounting information system is vital to all organizations either profit or non-profit oriented. They further opined that there is need for every organization to maintain accounting information system. In the opinion of Wathana, (2004), accounting information system produces more information to ease operations such as planning and control information and performance evaluation. An understanding of Accounting Information System will therefore foster a better understanding of how businesses and organizations are assisted to operate more efficiently and effectively. Accounting information system has to do with any combination of information technology and peoples’ activities that support accounting operations, management and decision making, though in a narrow sense. In a broader sense however, the term accounting information system is used to refer to the interaction between people, processes, data and technology that are used for accounting duties. It is equally in this wise that O’Brien, (2003) asserted that, the term do not only refer to information and communication technology that an organization uses but also to the way in which people interact with this technology in support of  business activities and processes. Furthermore, accounting information system may be understood from the three words that constitute it (Accounting, Information and System). Wilkinson, (1993) identified three components that relate to accounting as; Information System, Language of Business and Source of Financial Information. Secondly, O’Brien identified information as a valuable data processing that provides a basis for making decisions, taking actions and fulfilling legal obligations. Finally, he stressed that a system is an integrated framework within an entity where the framework is focused on a set objectives. Combining the three, Accounting Information System indicates an integrated framework within an entity (such as business entity) that employs physical resources (material, supplies, personnel, equipment, funds) to transform economic data into financial information for conducting the firms’ operations and activities, and providing information concerning the entity to a variety of interested users (O’Brien, 1993). Thomas and Kleiner, (1995) concluded that the combination or interaction between human, technology and techniques knowledge effectively. This research seeks to conduct an empirical analysis of accounting information system in organizations and examine its values in organizational activities and processes.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nExisting literature have shown that accounting information system when successfully implemented brings about better decision making by managers, more effective internal control systems, enhances the quality of financial reports and facilitates financial transaction processes (Wathana, 2010). However the studies have not shown whether successful implementation of accounting information system can improve performance measures thereby creating a research gap. Moreover the studies have shown a situation or situations rather in Spanish Enterprises, Chinese Enterprises, Indian Firms etc where economies are well developed. The researchers therefore seeks to bridge the gap so created in the field of accounting information system and also determine whether the values of accounting information system identified in earlier studies are applicable to Nigerian situation, a less developed economy.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the effect of accounting information system on financial transaction process.\n\n2.  To examine the effect of accounting information system on the quality of financial reports.\n\n3.  To determine whether accounting information system leads to effective internal control systems.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the effect of accounting information system on financial transaction process?\n\n2.  What is the effect of accounting information system on the quality of financial reports?\n\n3.  Does accounting information system leads to effective internal control systems?\n\n1.5   HYPOTHESIS\n\nHO: Accounting Information System does not facilitate financial transaction process\n\nHA: Accounting Information System does facilitate financial transaction process\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study shall be of immense importance to users of accounting information system such as financial analysis, Financial Accountants, management Accountants, Finance Managers, the Finance General Managers, Chief Operating Officer, Managing Director and Board of Directors within an organization and the Government Agency, External Auditors and Creditors from outside the organization. This will enable them have effective combination of people, Hardware, software, communication network and data resources that collects, transform and disseminate information in an organization hence the emphasis on computer based accounting information system. More so, the study shall be of great importance to students of Accounting and Management as well as other researchers who may be acquainted with the basis of Accounting Information System, its operations and its support for business activities and processes and hence a guide for further investigations.\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis research work is however limited to accounting information system (AIS) as a specialized area in business and non-business applications. Emphasis is more placed on the empirical evidence that exist in the field.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBorthick, C.J. and Clara, K.D.

This study is examining the role that these activities involved in community relations on the corporate image of Shell petroleum Plc, Port Harcourt. Corporate image\" was once an advertising jargon but is today a common phrase referring to a company's reputation. The \"image\" is what the public is supposed to see when the corporation is mentioned. The ordinary man and woman on the street usually have a wry view of community relations, advertising, hype, hoopla, and therefore also of corporate image—and this often for good reasons (Brady, 2005). But a good corporate image is a genuine asset; it translates into dollars at the counter and higher stock valuation.\n\nThe concept is usually associated with large corporations, but small businesses also have a corporate image even if neither their owners nor customers think of it that way. In the absence of active efforts, corporate image \"simply happens\": it is how a company is perceived (Johnson, 2002). Management, however, may actively attempt to shape the image by communications, brand selection and promotion, use of symbols, and by publicizing its actions. Corporations trying to shape their image are analogous to individuals who will dress appropriately, cultivate courteous manners, and choose their words carefully in order to come across competent, likeable, and reliable. In the personal as in the corporate case, the image should match reality (Hayward, 2005). When it does not, the consequence will be the opposite of the one intended. Community relations is no longer an afterthought or corporate window-dressing, community relations, as more chief executives are acknowledging, is now a serious, strategic aspect of business for Nigerian companies, a fundamental ingredient for the health of the enterprise. Competitive business and social pressures are forcing a redefinition of the relationship between company and community. When a company makes a commitment to the community part of its core business strategy, it not only helps attract and retain top employees, but it also positions itself positively among customers and, increasingly, improves its position in the market. Positive, proactive connections to the community can translate into a boost to the bottom line. Leading-edge companies are now seeing that to succeed in a global economy, the corporation has to be more than a preferred shareholder. The broad array of new stakeholders that the enterprise must embrace require a new perspective on corporate governance and behavior (Brady, 2005). Consequently, in addition to becoming the investment of choice, a company must become the supplier of choice, the employer of choice. Several community relations strategies by oil companies have failed to reduce the incidence of violent conflict between the host communities and oil companies in the Niger Delta, Nigeria. Shell is Nigeria’s oldest energy company, and has a long term and continuing commitment to the country, its people and the economy. The largest contribution by Shell companies in Nigeria is through the taxes and royalties they pay as well as its commitment to support and finance community development initiatives in the host communities.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nGiven the pressures that accompany the growing parity in the price of goods and services, companies will achieve an increasing competitive advantage through community relations and social responsibility as an approach of building corporate image. This makes strategic social investment all the more important for global corporations as they seek to establish a consistent image and market presence across the world. However, the researcher is examining the role community relations have played on the corporate image of Shell petroleum Plc, Port Harcourt.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the role of community relations on corporate image building at Shell Petroleum Plc Port Harcourt.\n\n2.  To determine the process of effective community relations.\n\n3.  To identify the factors that determine the corporate image of an organization.\n\n \n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the role of community relations on corporate image building at Shell Petroleum Plc Port Harcourt?\n\n2.  What is the process of effective community relations?\n\n3.  What are the factors that determine the corporate image of an organization?\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n1.  The outcome of this study will be a useful guide for the management of Shell Petroleum Plc Port Harcourt in reorganizing and restructuring their community relations programmes to meet the need of the host communities to enhance cooperation and mutual understanding.\n\n2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.\n\n \n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study on the role of community relations on corporate image building at Shell Petroleum Plc Port Harcourt will cover all the community relations strategies that has been used by shell to facilitate cooperation and mutual understanding between the company and the host communities.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

It transcends beyond the role of rent collector (Li, 1997). Managing a residential property involves establishing goals, objectives and policies and implementation of strategies to achieve those goals and objectives. Singh (1994, 1996) posited that residential property management is an activity that seeks to control interests in property owner and particular purpose for which the property is held. Wong (1999) considers residential property management as the work carried out to manage and maintain the development including its facilities at the level that will retain or enhance the value of the residential property, create a safe, functional and conducive living environment for occupants, keep or restore every facility in efficient working order and in good state of repair, and project a good appearance or image for the development. Ismail (1996) regards residential property management responsibility as including all the necessary making to ensure the economic and physical vitality of residential property assets.\n\nResidential property management is also the management of personal property, equipment, tooling and physical capital assets that are acquired and used to build, repair and maintain the residential property. Property management involves the processes, systems and manpower required to manage the life cycle of all public residential property as defined above including acquisition, control, accountability, responsibility, maintenance, utilization and disposition (Njoku, 2006). According to Ebie (2012), duties involved in residential property management generally will include a minimum of these basic primary tasks\n\n-      The full and proper screening or testing of an tenants/applicant's credit, criminal history, rental history and ability to pay.\n\n-      Lease contracting or accepting rent using legal documents approved for the area in which the property is located.\n\n-      Mitigation and remediation regarding any maintenance issues, generally within a budget, with prior or conveyed consent via a Limited Power of Attorney legally agreed to by the property owner.\n\nThere are many facets to this residential property management, including managing the accounts and finances of the real estate/residential properties, and participating in or initiating litigation with tenants, contractors and insurance agencies. Litigation is at times considered a separate function, set aside for trained attorneys. Although a person will be responsible for this in his/her job description, there may be an attorney working under a property manager. Special attention is given to landlord/tenant law and most commonly evictions, non-payment, harassment, reduction of pre-arranged services, and public nuisance are legal subjects that gain the most amount of attention from residential property managers. Therefore, it is a necessity that a public residential property manager be current with applicable municipal, county, state and Federal Fair Housing laws and practices. In advanced countries, residential property management, like facility management, is increasingly facilitated by computer-aided facility management (CAFM).\n\nHowever, managers of residential properties in Nigeria are faced with various kinds of problems ranging from uncooperative attitude from workers, poor maintenance and environmental condition, security and other basic infrastructures. Some managers in Nigeria have been able to cope with some of these challenges but the researcher will provide an overview about the problem and prospects of residential properties management focusing on Kaduna North Local Government Area.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nAccording to Bello (2008), residential property is more than a mere shelter; it includes all facilities within and around it, embracing a bundle of services which entails both product and process. Management of residential building embraces in all ramifications the maintenance and development process, be it economic, social, physical). In fact, management of these properties has been subject of focus by researcher in recent times based on the cumbersome nature of the process. The problem of poor management of residential properties is a global phenomenon and the severity of the problem differs from one nation to another. However, the researcher is seeking to examine the problems and prospects of management of residential property in Kaduna North Local Government Area.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the problems of residential properties management in Kaduna North Local Government Area.\n\n2.  To analyze the prospects of residential properties management in Kaduna North Local Government Area.\n\n3.  To identify the solution to the problems of residential properties management in Kaduna North Local Government Area.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What are the problems of residential properties management in Kaduna North Local Government Area?\n\n2.  What are the prospects of residential properties management in Kaduna North Local Government Area?\n\n3.

LIVING FAITH CHURCH (WINNERS CHAPEL) AS A CASE STUDY\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n\nA global study and research on Pentecostal churches is an on-going assignment because of its impact on the religious, political and socio-economic life of the people. A survey of the available number of Pentecostal churches in Nigeria as shown that they are emerging daily in the nooks and crannies of the country. The emergence of Pentecostal churches is daily challenging the existing Mainline and Aladura Churches in national development. It has therefore become a fundamental concern for scholars of Church History, History and Sociology in Nigerian Universities to devote much time to study such churches. Essien (1998) opines that \"this situation calls for continuous research of their forms, the socio-religious and economic conditions that necessitate their emergence and their relevance to the social life of their adherents and to the society at large\". This has necessitated the need for this study on the influence of Pentecostal churches on the development of education in Nigeria. In Nigeria, some of the established Pentecostal Churches are Church of God's Mission, founded by the late Arch-Bishop Benson A.Idahosa in Benin City, Edo state, Household of God's Church, being led by Rev. Chris Okotie in Oregun, Lagos, the Redeemed Christian Church of God founded by the late Pastor Josiah Akindayomi and presently under the leadership of Pastor Enock Adejare Adeboye with International headquarters at Mowe, Ogun state. The Deeper Life Christian Church founded by Pastor Williams Folorunso Kumuyi and based in Lagos.Rev.Gabriel Oduyemi's Bethel Ministry at Wonder City, Lekki Peninsular, Lagos, Pastor Patrick Anwuzia's Zoe Ministries, and Pastor Tunde Bakare's Latter Rain Assembly in Lagos, Rev.Tunde Joda's Christ Chapel International, Lagos and Bishop Wale Oke's Sword of the Spirit Church based in Ibadan. Others are the Victory Life Church International established by Pastor Mike Bamidele at Ilesa, Osun state, New Testament Church based in Ilorin and established by Pastor M.R.Popoola, Mountain of Fire and Miracles, founded by Pastor Daniel Kolawole Olukoya with its headquarters in Lagos, the Synagogue of All Nations, established by Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua in Lagos, Rhema Chapel, Ilorin established by Rev.George Adegboye, the Word Assembly being led by Rev Isaac Omolehin and of course the Living Faith Church (a.k.a Winners Chapel) founded by Bishop David Olaniyi Oyedepo. Many Nigerian scholars have researched on Pentecostal churches in the country. For instance, Deji Ayegboyin, Matthews Ojo, Michael Ogunewu, Richard Burgess, Hannah Ishola, and of course Rotimi Omotoye. Generally, Pentecostal churches are \"Christians seeking deeper experience of God beyond regular church attendance. They rely on the new birth and the power of the Holy spirit\" (Ojo, 2004). In other words the churches are seen emphasizing the importance of the Holy spirit in daily worship. This research is focused on the Living Faith Church a.k.a Winner Chapel and its contributions to education development in Nigeria.\n\nPastor David Oyedepo in Ilorin started Living Faith Church with about 48 members in 1980 and within nine months of its existence, membership rose to about 128. He eventually established the Living Faith Outreach Centre in May, 1981.Pastor Oyedepo then relocated to Kaduna. It was from Kaduna that he went to Lagos in September 1989 before he moved to Ota, Ogun state which is now regarded as Cananland and International headquarters of the church. The church has over three hundred branches in Nigeria alone (Opoola, 2010). The church building at Ota is assumed to be the biggest auditorium in Nigeria seating fifty thousand and four hundred congregation as at September 2000. Living Faith Church has however contributed to education development in Nigeria in several ways (Omotoye, 2006).\n\nWestern education was introduced to Nigeria by the Christian missionaries in the 19th century. It was a strategy adopted by the early missionaries to get converts into Christianity. The Living Faith Church went into the establishment of schools early, unlike some other Churches that ventured into education. The Living Faith Church has to its credit a conglomerate of Nursery, Primary, Secondary and Universities. The nursery and primary schools are under the name Kingdom Heritage while the Secondary section is named Faith Academy. These schools are found in all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria. The first University of the Church was named Covenant University and was established in Ota in 2002.The second University was named Landmark and was established in Omu-Aran, the native town of Pastor David Oyedepo in 2010. The Universities as also complemented the efforts of Federal and State Governments in providing admission to many applicants who are seeking admission to the Universities in Nigeria. We also believe that that the missionary orientation of the schools would minimize cultism and moral decadence in the Nigerian Universities.  Apart from providing jobs for teaming Nigerian populace, scholarships are usually provided by Pastor Oyedepo for indigent students, most especially in the Covenant and Landmark universities. He was once quoted saying that \"All school age children, not in school, due to inability of parents, will be fully taken care of by the church\".\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe Pentecostal Churches was introduced at a time when Nigerians were experiencing economic depression, poverty, un-employment, corruption and sicknesses. The education sector is in the poorest state. These are socio-economic problems being witnessed in Nigeria because of bad leadership in the country. The Living Faith Church has been able to provide schools that offer quality education services from Nursery to tertiary level nationwide. The cost of education in Nigeria is very high. Odumuyiwa (2006) observed in his study that the tuition fees being paid in the Christian Universities are too exorbitant and beyond the reach of the common man in the society. He opines \"A situation in which churches establish private universities, charge exorbitant fees should be replaced with technical colleges that can be maintained within the resources of the church. However, this study is examining the influence of Pentecostal churches on the development of Education.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the influence of Pentecostal churches on the development of Education\n\n2.  To examine the educational activities of Pentecostal churches in Nigeria.\n\n3.  To identify the factors that can contribute to rapid development in education in Nigeria.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the influence of Pentecostal churches on the development of Education?\n\n2.  What are the educational activities of Pentecostal churches in Nigeria?\n\n3.  What are the factors that can contribute to rapid development in education in Nigeria?\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n1.  The outcome of this study will educate the general public on the influence of Pentecostal churches on education development in Nigeria.\n\n2.  It will be a useful guide for the management and the authorities of Living Faith Church Worldwide and their academic institutions on how to improve on their services in a bid to contribute to educational development in the nation.\n\n3.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study on the influence of Pentecostal churches on the development of education in Nigeria will cover all the educational activities and contributions of Living Faith Church A.K.A Winners Chapel.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

The major causes of this situation were traced down to poor internal control system which emanated from a lot of factors, part of Horngren (1982) therefore defined internal control as referring to both Administration control and accounting control. Administration control organization showing who reports to who and all the methods, planning and control of operations. Accounting control comprises the methods and procedures that are mainly concerned with authorization of sections, the safeguarding of assets and the accuracy of the financial records. Good accounting control helps maximize profit; they help minimize waste, unintentional errors and frauds.\n\nThis well designed control measure is a step towards the achievement of an organizational accountability which in other words means success of organization. The use of internal control system by government parastatal in Nigeria has been recently on great increase. Internal control has been recognized in the most organization as one of the most essential ingredients, necessary for the survival of the business enterprise and government agencies. Apart from the problem of scarce resources, organizations run a high risk of fraud, errors, miss appropriation of minimize, if not eliminate completely, these risks, by establishing internal control system. For every organization, there are risks that the organizational goals and objectives are not achieved. All efforts aimed at preventing such risks or identifying and correcting such risks are viewed as internal control.\n\nAnthony (1998) defined internal control as “the process by which managers assure that resources are obtained and used effectively and efficiently in the accomplishment of the organization objectives. Garrison and Noreen (2000) suggested a different definition for internal control as follows: “those steps taken by management that attempt to increase the likelihood that the objectives set down at the planning stage are attained and to ensure that all parts of the organization function in a manner consistent with organizational policies. He further defined internal control as those sets of organizational activities which include: planning, co-ordination, communication, evaluation and decision making as well as informal processes aimed at enhancing the efficient and effective use of the organizational resources towards the achievement of the organizational objectives.\n\nAnthony and Govindavajan (2004) identified several aspect or activities of management / internal control namely: planning, coordinating, communication, evaluation, decision-making and influencing. Planning what the organization should do to achieve proper accountability. Planning could be view as budget preparation. With planning the organization decides what to do and the responsibilities of its different members.\n\nKoontz and Donnel (1992) defined internal control as all the measures of a public or private organization that could be said to be strategies of owners and managers to monitor and control the activities within the organization.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nInternal control is management tools that are built into the entity as a part of its infrastructure to help managers and administrators run the entity and achieve their aims on an ongoing basis. Internal control is affected by people: people are what make internal control work. The responsibility for good internal control rests with all administrators and managers. Management sets the objectives, put the control mechanisms and activities in place, and monitor and evaluates the control. Internal control provides reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance; management design and implement internal control based on the related cost and benefits. No matter how well designed and operated, internal control cannot provide absolute assurance that all organization objectives will be realized. However, the researcher is examining  the internal control system in Government parastatals.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the internal control system in government parastatals.\n\n2.  To examine the process of internal control system.\n\n3.  To determine the impact of internal control system on productivity and accountability in government parastatals.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the state of internal control system in government parastatals?\n\n2.  What is the process of internal control system?\n\n3.  What are the impact of internal control system on productivity and accountability in government parastatals.\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n1.  The results of this study will be useful to the managers and administrators in both governmental and non-governmental organizations on the benefit and process of internal control system for organizational effectiveness.\n\n2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study on internal control system will cover the proper process of internal control system that can be used as a tool for the realization of organizational goals and objectives.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

INTRODUCTION\n\nRoad transportation is by far the commonest means of transportation in Nigeria when compared to other means like air, rail and water. The technology has made life easy compared to previous means of transportation such as the use of animals during the pre colonial era. Nigerian economy despite its flaws, has afforded a large number of its populace the means to own cars making road traffic a major problem with grave disadvantages.\n\nIn Nigeria, road accidents have been a disturbing phenomenon that has constituted a menace. It is generally believed but not statistically proven that the rate of road accidents in Nigeria has geometrically increased. Road accidents are caused by various reasons, ranging from carelessness on the part of the drivers to the deplorable nature of our roads. Put differently, Nigerian roads have become killing fields without protection for their users. Travellers heave a sigh of relief if they make their destinations. The worrisome trend has tremendous negative impact on the nation’s health system as well as its social and economic aspirations. It was estimated that the total number of registered vehicles in Nigeria rose between 1990 – 2006 from 700,000 to 6,000,000 (Umar 2010). Despite the happiness this brought and change of quality of family lives associated with owning a vehicle, its possession has made so many families bereaved of their breadwinners or lovely ones due to unprecedented rate of road traffic accidents in Nigeria. According to the Federal Road Safety Commission, not less than 88,520 road users lost their lives between 1991 and 2000 alone, most victims being between 20-40 years.  There is need to view road accident as a very major issue requiring urgent attention aimed at preventing premature deaths, reducing the health, social and economic impacts it portends to the average Nigerian. This disturbing assertion will be the bedrock of our statistical study on road accidents in Nigeria.\n\n1.1      STATEMENT OF GENERAL PROBLEM\n\nIn Nigeria today, the issue of road accidents have become a teething problem. There has been a major problem of the cardinal factors responsible for road accidents in Nigeria. Another problem is to know if accidents in Nigeria are related to sex, age and educational background of road users. There is also confusion as to the major causes of road accidents in Nigeria. The above problems have been our chief motivators in undertaking this statistical research work.\n\n1.2. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study is aimed at establishing the following factors:\n\nTo know if road accidents in Nigeria are gender based, that is, do female road users fall victim of road accidents than their male counterparts?\n\n To equally know if road accidents in Nigeria are age based.\n\n To ascertain if there is a statistical significant relationship between educational background and road accidents in Nigeria.\n\nTo know if record of road accidents in Nigeria has increased or not.\n\nTo educate Nigerians and those interested in this study on the outcome of our research\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3.    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nOne major significance of this study is to educate millions of Nigerians on the main causes of road accidents and ways to prevent or reduce them on our roads. Another significance of this study is to know if the number of road accidents has increased overtime. Thirdly, to know if the reported number of road accidents in Nigeria is gender based and also to know if there is a relationship between educational background and road accidents in Nigeria. We are also interested in knowing the major causes of road accidents in Nigeria so as to educate the Nigeria populace.\n\n1.4.     SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nFor the purpose of this study as the topic depicts, the scope of the essay will be focused on the statistical analysis on the causes of road accidents in Nigeria. To know the relationship between bio- data factors and road accidents in Nigeria, that is, knowing if there is a relationship between age, educational background and gender on road accidents in Nigeria.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nIt is necessary to mention some of the limitation of this research work. One of the major limitations is in the getting relevant educational materials used in the research work. Another  limitation of this research work is the difficulty in obtaining relevant information in that a few of our values were missing but these missing values were not  statistical significant enough to be noticed.\n\nIt is hoped that despite this limitations, the study would still be useful to Nigerians, organizations etc.\n\n \n\n \n\n1.5 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nAccident: an unpleasant event especially in a vehicle, that happens unexpectedly and causes injury or damage\n\nRoad accident: a traffic accident involving vehicles, pedestrians or cyclists.\n\n \n\nRESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\nHYPOTHESIS 1\n\nH0: there is no significant relationship between age and road accidents in Nigeria.\n\nH1: there is significant relationship between age and road accidents in Nigeria.\n\nLevel of significance: 0.05\n\nDecision rule: reject H0 if p-value is less than the level of significance.

Borthick and Clara, (1990) supporting the above, stated that accounting information system is vital to all organizations either profit or non-profit oriented. They further opined that there is need for every organization to maintain accounting information system. In the opinion of Wathana, (2004), accounting information system produces more information to ease operations such as planning and control information and performance evaluation. An understanding of Accounting Information System will therefore foster a better understanding of how businesses and organizations are assisted to operate more efficiently and effectively. Accounting information system has to do with any combination of information technology and peoples’ activities that support accounting operations, management and decision making, though in a narrow sense. In a broader sense however, the term accounting information system is used to refer to the interaction between people, processes, data and technology that are used for accounting duties. It is equally in this wise that O’Brien, (2003) asserted that, the term do not only refer to information and communication technology that an organization uses but also to the way in which people interact with this technology in support of  business activities and processes. Furthermore, accounting information system may be understood from the three words that constitute it (Accounting, Information and System). Wilkinson, (1993) identified three components that relate to accounting as; Information System, Language of Business and Source of Financial Information. Secondly, O’Brien identified information as a valuable data processing that provides a basis for making decisions, taking actions and fulfilling legal obligations. Finally, he stressed that a system is an integrated framework within an entity where the framework is focused on a set objectives. Combining the three, Accounting Information System indicates an integrated framework within an entity (such as business entity) that employs physical resources (material, supplies, personnel, equipment, funds) to transform economic data into financial information for conducting the firms’ operations and activities, and providing information concerning the entity to a variety of interested users (O’Brien, 1993). Thomas and Kleiner, (1995) concluded that the combination or interaction between human, technology and techniques knowledge effectively. This research seeks to conduct an empirical analysis of accounting information system in organizations and examine its values in organizational activities and processes.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nExisting literature have shown that accounting information system when successfully implemented brings about better decision making by managers, more effective internal control systems, enhances the quality of financial reports and facilitates financial transaction processes (Wathana, 2010). However the studies have not shown whether successful implementation of accounting information system can improve performance measures thereby creating a research gap. Moreover the studies have shown a situation or situations rather in Spanish Enterprises, Chinese Enterprises, Indian Firms etc where economies are well developed. The researchers therefore seeks to bridge the gap so created in the field of accounting information system and also determine whether the values of accounting information system identified in earlier studies are applicable to Nigerian situation, a less developed economy.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the effect of accounting information system on financial transaction process.\n\n2.  To examine the effect of accounting information system on the quality of financial reports.\n\n3.  To determine whether accounting information system leads to effective internal control systems.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the effect of accounting information system on financial transaction process?\n\n2.  What is the effect of accounting information system on the quality of financial reports?\n\n3.  Does accounting information system leads to effective internal control systems?\n\n1.5   HYPOTHESIS\n\nHO: Accounting Information System does not facilitate financial transaction process\n\nHA: Accounting Information System does facilitate financial transaction process\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study shall be of immense importance to users of accounting information system such as financial analysis, Financial Accountants, management Accountants, Finance Managers, the Finance General Managers, Chief Operating Officer, Managing Director and Board of Directors within an organization and the Government Agency, External Auditors and Creditors from outside the organization. This will enable them have effective combination of people, Hardware, software, communication network and data resources that collects, transform and disseminate information in an organization hence the emphasis on computer based accounting information system. More so, the study shall be of great importance to students of Accounting and Management as well as other researchers who may be acquainted with the basis of Accounting Information System, its operations and its support for business activities and processes and hence a guide for further investigations.\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis research work is however limited to accounting information system (AIS) as a specialized area in business and non-business applications. Emphasis is more placed on the empirical evidence that exist in the field.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBorthick, C.J. and Clara, K.D.

However, the researcher is identifying market structures and cost theory as a tool by the government to build the country’s economy. Basic types of market structure include perfect competition where many buyers and sellers, none being able to influence prices and oligopoly with several large sellers who have some control over the prices. Others are monopoly with single seller and considerable control over supply and prices and finally monopsony with single buyer and considerable control over demand and prices.\n\nA long line of scholarship posits a causal relationship between the market structure and economic growth. According to this view, well-developed market structures especially those imbued with rights that protect investors do promote the efficient allocation of capital to projects with high rates of return, in turn stimulating savings, investment, and economic growth. Evidence from both single-country and cross-country studies suggests that economies with more developed market structure begin to grow earlier, attain higher growth rates, and achieve higher levels of per capita income than countries with less developed market structures. These findings have prompted researchers to consider more carefully how the market structure affect real economic activity in the long run. For example, in an important study that exploits cross-country and cross-industry differences, Rajan and Zingales (1998) conclude that market structure development helps nations surmount financial and moral hazard and adverse selection problems and hence reduces the costs of external finance to the nations.\n\nMany empirical studies have followed Rajan and Zingales (1998) in exploiting differences across space and time to identify a causal link between market structure and economic development, and recent research has focused on the mechanisms underlying this relationship. A well organi8zed structure are thought to improve resource allocation and fund projects with higher rates of return by efficiently matching the policies of the government and the will of the electorates and by monitoring the progress in economic growth (Kashyap et al., 2002).\n\nThe theory of costs analyses the behaviour of cost curves in the short run and the long run and arrives at the conclusion that both the short run and the long run curves are U-shaped but the long-run cost curves are flatter than the short-run cost curves. It involves a systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives that satisfy transactions, activities or functional requirements for a business. It is a technique that is used to determine options that provide the best approach for the adoption and practice in terms of benefits in labor, time and cost savings etc. cost theory can also be adopted as systematic process for calculating and comparing benefits and costs of a project, decision or government policy. It is often used by governments and other organizations, such as private sector businesses, to appraise the desirability of a given policy. It is an analysis of the expected balance of benefits and costs, including an account of foregone alternatives and the status quo. The researcher is however of the opinion that cost theory will help predict whether the benefits of an economic policy outweigh its costs, and by how much relative to other alternatives.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nEconomic growth can be related to increase in the inflation-adjusted market value of the goods and services produced by an economy over time. It is conventionally measured as the percent rate of increase in real gross domestic product. An increase in growth caused by more efficient use of inputs (such as market structure, capital, population, or territory) is referred to as intensive growth. GDP growth caused only by increases in the amount of inputs available for use is called extensive growth. Generally, accurate application of cost theory and proper market structure identifies choices that increase welfare from a utilitarian perspective. An analyst using cost theory should recognize that perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and benefits is difficult, and while it can offer a well-educated estimate of the best alternative, perfection in terms of economic efficiency and social welfare are not guaranteed. The study examines the use of market structures and cost theory as a tool by the government to build the country’s economy.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the use of market structures and cost theory as a tool by the government to build the country’s economy.\n\n2.  To identify the various types of markets structures and their effect on economic growth.\n\n3.  To determine the effect of cost theory on economic growth.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  How can market structures and cost theory be used as a tool by the government to build the country’s economy?\n\n2.  What are the various types of markets structures and their effect on economic growth?\n\n3.  What is the effect of cost theory on economic growth?\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n1.  The outcome of this study will educate the government and policy makers in charge of the capital market regulation on how the market structure and the cost theory can be used as a tool for economic growth.\n\n2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study on the use of market structures and cost theory as a tool by the government to build the country’s economy will cover all the basic types of market structure and cost theories and their influence on a nation’s economy.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

A considerable cost can be applied to these types of transaction for the translation of financial statements prepared under dissimilar accounting guidelines into a comparable form. There exist a multiple number of accounting systems that create these dissimilarities, because accounting is a language of business that has been created by society to provide information as to the economic health of an entity. Similar to any other language, varying types of “accounting language” are used across different regions of the globe to convey this information.\n\nThe increased frequency of the resulting costs has created a demand for an internationally comparable set of accounting standards. The creation of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) has tried to fulfill this demand. The desire to have comparable standards has thus resulted in the adoption and implementation of, as well as the convergence to IFRS (Gray, 2011).\n\nDespite the push towards convergence of these accounting standards, significant diversity still remains (IAS, 2011). The resulting discussions on how to achieve worldwide accounting convergence oftentimes only involve the differences between specific accounting standards and how to eliminate them. However, in order to know how to eliminate differences one must first fully understand why they occur. One major reason for these differences is culture. Unfortunately, the role of culture is frequently absent from this discussion, regardless of the fact that it is at the heart of many differences that exist between one accounting system and the next.\n\nHowever, culture can be thought of as the collective values of a society that influence its behavior. It is no secret that significant differences in these values exist internationally, and that these differences have a profound effect on all elements of society.\n\nTherefore, accounting, as a societal creation, is influenced by these values as well. Given the goal of internationally adoption and comparability, it is important to explore the effect that culture can have on the implementation of IFRS. This study will present an overview through an examination of IFRS, aspects of its implementation, and the difficulties it faces because of culture to assess the level of implementation and adoption.\n\n 1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThis study is aimed at investigating the impact of cultural factors on the implementation of global accounting standards in Nigeria. The IASB has a goal to develop a single set of principle-based global accounting standards, which is the IFRS. Nigeria has embraced the principle-based regime and its accounting standards have converged substantially with the IFRS. However, research shows that accounting is influenced by the social, cultural and political environment. It is therefore questionable whether the IFRS-based standards can be implemented effectively in a different social and cultural environment. The application of professional judgment is essential in order to operate within a principle-based regime. Therefore, the question is how effectively professional judgment can be exercised in Nigeria. Accounting professionals from different backgrounds may reach different judgments, because professional judgment is often influenced by cultural values.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the impact of cultural factors on the implementation of global accounting standards IFRS in Nigeria.\n\n2.  To examine the level of the implementation of global accounting standards IFRS in Nigeria.\n\n3.  To identify the factors limiting the implementation of global accounting standards IFRS in Nigeria.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the impact of cultural factors on the implementation of global accounting standards IFRS in Nigeria?\n\n2.  What is the level of the implementation of global accounting standards IFRS in Nigeria?\n\n3.  What are the factors limiting the implementation of global accounting standards IFRS in Nigeria?\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n1.  The results of this study will help educate the stakeholders in the business sector, entrepreneurs and the general public on the impact of cultural factors on the implementation of global accounting standards IFRS in Nigeria.\n\n2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study will cover the level of the implementation of global accounting standards IFRS in Nigeria and cultural differences among nations that can influence effective implementation.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Accounting can also be referred to as an information system that measures, processes and communicates financial information about an economic entity (Wikipedia, 2013). Advancements in computer technology have dramatically improved accounting systems and transformed economic life. Computers and other digital technologies have increased office productivity facilitating the rapid exchange of documents, research, collaboration with far-flung partners and the collection and analysis of data. Computer technology gave all sorts of individual economic actors the new valuable tools for identifying and pursuing economic and business opportunities (Ballada and Ballada, 2011).\n\nComputer Technology deals with the application of computers and other telecommunications equipment to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data. This may also be described as anything that renders data, information, or perceived knowledge in any visual format through any multimedia distribution mechanism. Applying computer technology in the context of business, it is designed to help management in their stewardship function, support management in their day-to-day operations and decision making. In 1880, machines where invented to help in the accounting system. As year years passed by, advancements on information technology also transformed accounting systems and its processes. There were many developments in the Accounting System. This is designed to help in the management and control of activities related to the firms’ economic and financial area. Accounting system is essential for majority of the business entities. The advancements of technology have lead in the creation of the computerized accounting system which is commonly adopted by business entities at present. This has created a competitive market. Thus, entities need to improve their systems in order to match their information needs for better decision making.\n\nWith the advent of computer-based accounting system, accountants have to cope with the resulting complexity of the flow of information through the accounting systems. Traditional accounting procedures did not accommodate the sophisticated processing devices that came with the computer-based accounting system. As the design of the computer based accounting system advanced from simple clerical automation to complicated integrated information systems, the accountant could no longer perform his duties around the computer but found it necessary to develop procedures to cope with the new challenges. However, the employment of accountants who does not consider further training on computer-based accounting is threatened. Furthermore, the traditional accountant was not trained in the special languages and devices used in the computer based system.\n\nWith the introduction of computer to many business applications, those business areas that involve repeated tasks which are often monotonous and fallible to human errors (cash, inventory control, payroll and etc) are increasingly being simplified accurately by combining the cost, effectiveness, simplicity of use, efficiency, reliability and accuracy of the computer to obtain, analyze and interpret data information for efficient business decisions. Nigerian business organizations being to grow in size, business operations and processes become increasingly complex, hence computers are being rapidly introduced to cope with the overwhelming demands of business and growth (Dandago and Rufai, 2013). Though the introduction of computer to many facets of business operations is a welcome idea, its use is further implicated on accounting system and as such organizations need to strike a balance between accounting areas to be manually operated so as to control or limit the menance associated with unemployment.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nAccounting procedures are naturally complex and are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and so it becomes more necessary wanting to know how computer technology has helped in resolving this complexity and also to get to know of it holds any greater promise for the future and employment in the field of accounting.  There is the need also to know if it hold any risk of aiding perpetrators of frauds in order to weigh its risks against benefit. \n\nAlmost all accounting duties are done on the computer today and this recent development in the practice of accounting has led to situations whereby organizations hire the services of a computer expert for audit purposes.  The researcher is examining if the knowledge of computer has displaced accountant with a computer scientist thereby creating an employment deficit.\n\n In addition to these problems, the electronic accounting systems are usually designed by systems analyst and programmers who are in most cases non accounts.  This makes the accountant a stranger to the system he is to audit, unlike in a manual system. Furthermore, the accounting information processing procedures are stated in computer programs which are written in special computer languages and stored on machine-sensible medium. \n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the impact of computer technology on accounting system.\n\n2.  To examine the impact of computer technology on employment in the field of accounting.\n\n3.

Background of the study\n\n Educational development in Nigeria has over the period been treated with kid gloves. For a nation to be able to compete favorably with its contemporaries, a lot has to be done and invested in educating its citizenry. For Nigeria as a country to be judged educationally developed, a lot has to be done and this should start from the mindset of our youths as the development of education in Nigeria has to be sustained by this vibrant age grade in other to make a lasting impression on the fabrics of the nation. Educational development in Nigeria has to be a collective responsibility in other to realize this dream. Youths and adults must see it as a tool for economic development which must not be treated with kid gloves. The more interested our future leaders are in educational development the less the illiteracy rate in Nigeria. Over the period, Nigeria has witnessed a slow but steady rise in educational development spanning from the pre-colonial to the post-colonial dispensation. Our students are a principal agent in this onus task of educational development in Nigeria. Nigeria has made considerable progress in the domain of education. The educational system in the country is supervised by the state. There are 27 federal and state-owned polytechnics in Nigeria (Wikipedia, 2012). The first 6 years of primary education are mandatory in Nigeria. \nNigeria is making a steady progress in the development of education. Many universities and schools have been established by the state. However, much still needs to be done.\nPrimary education in Nigeria is in the native language but brings in English in the third year (Akpan 2011). Higher Education has developed considerably over the years, which has resulted in a healthy literacy rate. For educational to be properly developed in Nigeria, our youths especially our undergraduates in the various institutions of higher learning must imbibe the culture or must be willing to give back to the educational sector by going back to the classrooms to assist. Though this may have been partially achieved by the compulsory national service where corp members are being deployed to the schools but this over the period has not yielded its desired result owing to the fact that they do not find the educational system in Nigeria attractive and entertaining. In other to minimize brain drain or capital flight in the educational sector in the country, government has that prerogative to ensure that the educational system is made as attractive as possible as this would help develop education in Nigeria which would in turn help us compete with our contemporaries all over the world.\n\n1.2.  Statement of the general problem\n\nDespite the recent development in the educational sector In Nigeria, some pressing issues have been a re occurring decimal in the problems surrounding educational development in Nigeria. Our youths who should be at the front burner in the nations development of the educational sector has suddenly grown cold in their quest for a better educational system and sector.  The near stagnant nature of the educational sector has had its negative effect on other sectors of the economy. This malady has equally led to the drastic rise in terrorism as witnessed in some part of the country. All these and other unmentioned over bearing consequences has led us to this study in knowing the real causes behind the lack of interest of the youths in helping to develop education in Nigeria.\n\n1.3.  Objectives of the study\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\nØ  To know the relationship between students course of study and their attitude towards educational development in Nigeria.\n\nØ To know the real issues militating against educational development in Nigeria.\n\nØ To suggest ways of improving educational development in Nigeria.\n\nØ To know the mindset of the youths towards the nature of the educational sector in Nigeria.\n\n1.4.  Research questions\n\n1.  Is the educational sector in Nigeria developed?\n\n2.  How important is the educational sector in Nigeria.\n\n3.  Do students generally love to be employed into the educational sector in Nigeria?\n\n4.  Would you willingly want to be a stakeholder in the educational sector in country?\n\n5.  Has the educational sector improved overtime in Nigeria?\n\n6.  What are the ways the educational system can be made attractive to the youths?\n\n1.5.  Research Hypothesis\n\nThe following hypotheses will be tested to guide this study;  \n\n1. H0: there is no significant relationship between the course of study of students and their perception towards educational development in Nigeria.\n\nH1: there is a significant relationship between the course of study of students and their perception towards educational development in Nigeria.\n\n2.       H0: poor educational development does not influence the general economy of Nigeria.\n\nH1: poor educational development influences the general economy of Nigeria.\n\n1.6.  Significance of the study\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\nØ This study will unravel the unique relationship between the discipline of Nigeria’s undergraduates and their attitude or perception towards educational development.\n\nØ This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic\n\nØ This study would also suggest ways of making the educational sector more attractive to youths to help boost its development.\n\n1.7.  Scope of the study\n\n This study is on the relationship between undergraduates’ course of study and their perception towards educational development in Nigeria.\n\n \n\n1.8.  Limitations of the study\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\nTime constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.\n\n1.9.

A recent policy note released by the World Bank says that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are transforming the world of work, creating new job opportunities and making labour markets more innovative, inclusive, and global. ICTs are influencing employment both as an industry that creates jobs and as a tool that empowers workers to access new forms of work, in new and more flexible ways (Samuelson, 2008). The emerging ICT-enabled employment opportunities matter because countries around the world are looking to create more good jobs, which have positive economic and social implications for workers and for society. ICT is critical to Nigeria’s quest to becoming one of the leading economies in the next five years, as spelt out in the Vision 20:2020 agenda. The world is increasingly becoming technology-driven, and ICTs remain a key driver of any economy, as it has the potential to address the rising unemployment trend in the country.\n\nIn a recent report published by the National Information Technology Development Agency, NITDA, it revealed that the ICT sector had boosted the Federal Government’s job creation efforts by creating over 12 million jobs in the past two years. It described this current contribution as an improvement on the job opportunities created by the sector between 2002 and 2012. The ICT sector in Nigeria is currently boosting the federal government’s effort in job creation with the creation on an average of about 12 million jobs from 2012 to date, that is, a significant improvement on the 2.5 million jobs the sector created between 2002 and 2012. This is in addition to contributing about nine percent to the growth of Nigeria’s GDP.\n\nThe Ministry of Labour and Productivity in Nigeria says the Federal Government is set to declare total war on unemployment and joblessness in the country with the use of ICT systems and operations which is aimed at training unemployed Nigerians. Fakiyesi (2010), opine that despite the exploitation of negative aspect of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by a few Nigerian youths, ICT has raised the  economy of the nation, especially the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to 1.62 per cent (Oluleye, 2006).\n\nAlthough he lamented that apart from the improvement on the economy, ICT has also enhanced falsehood, dissemination of harmful information as well as fraudulent activities in the transaction of businesses.\n\nBeing without a job is indeed an enforced idleness of wage earners who are able and enthusiastic to work but cannot find jobs. In societies in which most people can earn a living only by working for others, being unable to find a job is a serious problem. Because  of its human costs in deprivation and a feeling of rejection and personal failure, the extent of unemployment is widely used as a measure of workers' welfare. The proportion of  workers unemployed also shows how well a nation's human resources are used and serves as an index of economic movement (positive or negative) (Ramey, 2008).\n\nUnemployment has call for a greater concern in the Nigeria economy. It has continued to be the major macroeconomic objectives of the government. Unemployment constitutes a series of serious developmental problems and is increasingly more serious all over Nigeria. The major policy of the government and the international agencies is targeted at reducing the rate of unemployment.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nAccording to a Nigerian Communications Commission, one million \"indirect jobs\" have been created by the mobile telephony sector in the past five years (Ramey, 2008). \"This figure indicates that mobile telephony could boost job creation and poverty alleviation if the conditions that would stimulate its spin-offs are introduced and nurtured in a consistent manner.\" About 10,000 \"direct jobs,\" or people employed by the mobile phone operators in Nigeria, have been created by the industry.

School infrastructural facilities have been observed as a potent factor to quantitative education. The importance to teaching with provision of adequate instructional facilities for education cannot be over-emphasized. Pertaining to the teaching of physics in secondary schools, Infrastructural facilities include equipments and materials that are available to facilitate students learning outcome. It includes good buildings for classrooms and laboratories, laboratory equipments, experiment materials/apparatus, books, audio-visual, software and hardware of educational technology; so also, size of classroom and laboratory, sitting position and arrangement, availability of tables, chairs, chalkboards, shelves on which instruments for practicals are arranged (Farrant, 1991 and Farombi, 1998).\n\nAccording to Oni (1992), infrastructural facilities constitute a strategic factor in the functioning of a secondary school system. This is so because they determine to a very large extent the smooth functioning of any teaching and experimental demonstrations and even other extra-curricular activities. He further stated that their availability, adequacy and relevance influence efficiency and high performance. In his words, Farombi (1998) opined that the wealth of a nation or society could determine the quality of education in that land; emphasizing that a society that is wealthy will establish good schools with professional personnel (quality teachers), learning infrastructures that with such, students may learn with ease thus bringing about good academic achievement. Writing on the role of facilities in teaching, Balogun (1982) submitted that no effective science education programme including physics can exist without equipment for teaching. This is because facilities enable the learner to develop problem-solving skills and scientific attitudes. In their contribution, Ajayi and Ogunyemi (1990) reiterated that when facilities are provided to meet relative needs of a school system, students will not only have access to the reference materials mentioned by the teacher, but individual students will also learn at their own paces and there is room and necessary equipment for the teacher for further research and constant practice. The net effect of this is increased overall academic performance of the entire students.\n\nIn recent times, there has been a growing public anxiety about the poor performance of students in Physics in Nigerian schools. Studies showed that large numbers of students seem to learn very little physics at school, learning tends to be by rote and students find learning of Physics to be difficult (Salau, 1996). The quality of the personnels handling Physics in Nigerian schools has also been questioned over time by parents, science educators, and the general public and even by the government (Okebukola, 1997). Physics teaching in Nigerian schools has been criticized because of the poor performance of Nigerian students in Physics relative to their counterparts in other countries. This is evident from the Second International Science Study in which Nigerian students came second to last in secondary science among the participating countries of the world (STAN, 1992).\n\n \n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe current situation of Physics teaching and learning in Nigeria is a concern to all including government and the society at large. Research indicates that many students found Physics as a subject to be difficult, boring and not interesting to them (Salau, 1995, 1996). Large class sizes, inadequate funding, insufficient curriculum resources, poor teaching skills and lack of supports for teachers among other factors further limit the quality of Physics teaching and learning in Nigerian schools (Okebukola, 1997). To solve these lingering problems one needs to develop a realistic picture of what is currently happening in the teaching and learning of Physics in Nigerian schools and also to identify the factors that are limiting the quality of personnel training. Furthermore, one needs to develop a reasonable ideal picture for which the nation can strive towards within the existing resource limitations.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives for this study:\n\n1.  To examine if there is adequate infrastructural facilities for teaching Physics in senior secondary schools in Nigeria.\n\n2.  To examine the quality of personnel teaching Physics in Nigerian senior secondary schools.\n\n3.  To identify the relationship between infrastructure and performance in Physics in senior secondary schools in Nigeria.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  Are there adequate infrastructural facilities for teaching Physics in senior secondary schools in Nigeria?\n\n2.  What is the quality of personnel teaching Physics in Nigerian senior secondary schools?\n\n3.  What is the relationship between infrastructure and performance in Physics in senior secondary schools in Nigeria.\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n1.  The outcome of this study will educate stakeholders in the education sector and the general public on the state of infrastructural facilities and quality of personel available for the teaching of Physics in the Nigerian Senior secondary schools.\n\n2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study will cover the level infrastructural facility and personnel available for teaching Physics in senior secondary schools in Nigeria.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

The study concluded that Entrepreneurship without adequate education, knowledge and skills, usually result in failure. It was therefore recommended that an entrepreneur should be able to know and identify what fields of entrepreneurship industry or project he/she should venture into. Consequently, it was also recommended that the curriculum should indicate different options available for entrepreneurs\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n\nEducation is obviously the basic instrument of economic growth and technological advancement of any society. It is in recognition of this fact that governments commit immense resources to ensure the provision of education for their citizens and also tailored their policies towards ensuring that it is made accessible to the generality of their citizenry (Oyebade et al., 2008). However, business education is an essential element of this general education. It is concerned with the impartation of business orientation and knowledge for personal and national development.\n\nBusiness education involves teaching students the fundamentals, concepts, theories and processes of business. To Okoli (2010), business education is an important part of the general education which emphasizes on skills and competencies acquisition for use in offices and business related occupations.\n\nSimilarly, Nwanewezi (2010) describes business education as encompassing education for office occupations, business teaching, business administration and economic understanding. In all, Abdulkadir (2011) noted that one remarkable important characteristic of business education program is that, its products can function independently as self-employed and employers of labor. To this end, the tenet of business education embraces basic education for teaching career, entrepreneurship, business understanding, office environment and vocational practices.\n\nEducation in this field occurs at several levels, including primary, secondary and higher education, with the greatest activity in the later. However, Igboke (2005) enumerated the following as the objectives of business education at all levels of education:\n\n·        To develop basic skills for personal use in the future\n\n·        To acquire the basic knowledge and skills of business education\n\n·        To relate the knowledge and skills acquired to national development\n\n·        To develop basic skills in office occupation\n\n·        To provide the needed background for teaching in business subjects\n\n·        To prepare students for further training in business studies\n\n·        To provide orientation and basic skills with which to start a life of work for those who may not undergo further training\n\nFor education to really serve as a veritable vehicle for socioeconomic growth and development as well as for the actualization of these lofty objectives of business education in tandem, educational institutions and its systems must function optimally in relation to its set standards.\n\nHistorically, business education did not come about in Nigeria through government, but through the individual initiative of a few Nigerian entrepreneurs. Such individuals were quick to realize the importance of business education not only to their personal, but also to national economic growth and development. As a matter of fact, prior to Nigeria’s independence and 10 years after, business teacher education, like other vocational and technical education disciplines, was not given any thought in Nigerian teacher education curricula. This is not to say that the Colonial educational administrators did not recognize the importance of this form of teacher education. As reported by Ekpenyong (1992), some form of business and technical teacher education programme was introduced in the curricula of Higher College, Yaba (1932-47), and of Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology (1954-61).\n\nBusiness education exposes students to different ways of being innovative, It also facilitates Job Competence, as well as development of understanding for vocational opportunities available in the field of business. Entrepreneurship without adequate education, knowledge and skills, usually leads to failure. Judging by the figures that are coming out of the Education Ministry. In the last few years, at least 60% of graduates are not able to get employment immediately which does not encourage economic growth (Lawal 2005). Because of that, people go into one entrepreneurial venture or another, but unfortunately, they have not been adequately prepared to face the attendant challenges in business. Now it has become necessary to incorporate Business education into the curriculum in order to prepare our graduates for self-employment.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nBusiness Education is a type of training which, while playing its part in the achievement of the general aims of education on any given level, has its primary objective as the preparation of people to enter into a career, to render efficient service and to advance from their present level of employment to higher levels which always have significance effect on the economic development (Osuala 2003). Basic Business Education affords to every individual an opportunity to develop the skills, abilities and understanding that will enable him to handle competently his personal business affairs; to develop an understanding of the vocational opportunity available in the broad field of business and to assume his citizenship responsibilities through enlightened participation in, as well as an understanding and appreciation of the business system (Osuala 2003). Furthermore, Basic Business Education is the broad area of knowledge that deals with the economy. It identifies and explains the role of business as an economic institution and provides content and experience that prepare the individual for effective participation as a citizen and consumer. The researcher is examining the relevance of business education on the economic development of Nigeria.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the relevance of Business education program on economic development of Nigeria.\n\n2.  To examine how the Business education program in Nigeria is operated.\n\n3.  To determine the relationship between Business education program and economic development of Nigeria.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the relevance of Business education program on economic development of Nigeria?\n\n2.  How is the Business education program in Nigeria operated?\n\n3.  What is the relationship between Business education program and economic development of Nigeria?\n\n1.5   HYPOTHESIS\n\nHO: There is no significant relationship between Business education program and economic development of Nigeria\n\nHA: There is significant relationship between Business education program and economic development of Nigeria\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n1.  Results from this study will educate the government of Nigeria, stakeholders in the business sector on the relevance of business education on the economic development of Nigeria.\n\n2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study on a survey on the relevance of business education program to economic development of Nigeria will cover the Curriculum of business education from primary to tertiary education level in Nigeria with the view of identifying the influence on the Nigeria economic development.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAbdulkadir, A.A., 2011. The role of entrepreneurship education in empowering Nigerian youths. Bus Edu.

Nigeria is facing various serious problems which are threats to the Nation economy (Anyanwu, 2004). According to National Financial Inclusion, in the provision of financial services, Nigeria lags behind many African countries. In 2010, 36% of adults – roughly 31 million out of an adult population of 85 million –were served by formal financial services. This figure compares to 68% in South Africa and 41% in Kenya/. This is because formal financial institutions deny the poor in both urban and rural areas access to financial services. In order to breach this gap, Nigerian government established various institutions as well as programmes to enhance the standard of living of people, make poor people self–reliance and turn out more entrepreneurs than job seekers in the country. Some of these programmes includes Directorate of food, Roads and Rural Infrastructure (DFRRI), Better Life/Family Support Programme, Family Economic advanced programme, Peoples Bank and Community banks. These programmes failed to achieve their objectives due to poor implementation, corruption and host of other factors. Government did not relent in their efforts to make financial services accessible to the poor, thus, the emergence of microfinance banks as an alternative credit system for the poor (Helms, 2006).\n\nAccording to CBN (2005), “microfinance is about providing financial services to the poor who are traditionally not served by the conventional financial institutions’. There are three features that distinguish microfinance from other formal financial products. These are:\n\n·        the absence of asset - based collateral;\n\n·        the smallness of loans advanced and or savings collected, and\n\n·        ease of operations.\n\nMicrofinance, according to Otero (1999) is “the provision of financial services to low - income poor and very poor self - employed people”. These financial service s include: small loans, savings, current, financing small business for the active poor both in rural and urban areas of the country.\n\nMicrofinance is a term used to refer to different methods for giving poor people access to financial services. Microfinance is about providing of timely, affordable, diversified, and dependable financial services to the active poor which otherwise would have little or no access to financial services. It is a financial intervention that focuses on the low - income group of a given society.\n\nMany researchers conclude that in most developing countries, the formal financial system reaches to only 25 per cent of the economically active population. This leaves 75 per cent without access to financial services apart from those provided by money-lenders and family. Savings have continued to grow at a very low rate, particularly in the rural areas of Nigeria. Most poor people keep their resources in kind or simply under their pillows because of inadequate savings opportunities and products. Such methods of keeping savings are risky, yield no returns, and reduce the aggregate volume of resources that could be mobilized and channeled to deficit areas of the economy.\n\nThe Microfinance Policy Regulatory and Supervisory Framework (MPRSF) were launched in 2005 and the objectives are to address the prolonged nonperformance of many existing community banks. This lack of performance has been attributed to incompetent management, weak internal controls and high cost of transactions. Other objectives to be addressed by MPRSF are poor corporate governance, lack of well-defined operations, restrictive regulatory/supervisory requirements, and weak capital base of existing institutions. Indeed a huge gap exists in the provision of financial services to a large number of active but poor and low income groups, especially in the rural areas as a result of rigidity operations of formal financial institutions in Nigeria. Problem of funding also militates against the effectiveness of micro finance banks in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, the conventional micro financing in Nigeria aggravates the inequitable distribution of income and wealth in Nigeria. This is due to the fact that while interest rate on both voluntary and mandatory savings for the clients are between 4.5% and 6% per annum. Lending at this rate is taking the rewards of poor and redistributes it to the rich. The poor borrowers must pay the amount through group pressure even if it resort them to another borrowing or selling their properties.\n\n \n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nCBN (2005) maintain that Microfinance banks are aimed at empowerment of the poor and the private sector, through the provision of needed financial services. This empowerment, it is hoped, will enable them to engage or expand their present scope of economic activities and generate employment. Doubts have been expressed about the effectiveness of the operation of the micro finance banks in Nigeria. The general objectives of this study is to find out the constraints that mostly challenged the operations of microfinance bank in Nigeria and to propose strategy that will enhance the elimination of those factors.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the specific objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the mode of operation of microfinance banks.\n\n2.  To examine the operational problems facing microfinance banks.\n\n3.  To identify the factors that can enhance the operations of microfinance banks.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the mode of operation of microfinance banks?\n\n2.  What are the operational problems facing microfinance banks?\n\n3.  What are the factors that can enhance the operations of microfinance banks?\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n1.  Findings from this study will be a useful guide for the government of Nigeria in tackling the operational problems facing microfinance banks with a view providing effective banking services to the rural dwellers.\n\n2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study on the operational problems facing microfinance banks will cover the activities of microfinance banks in Nigeria with a view of identifying the operational deficit.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

The research elucidates critical decision making affecting the organization and consequently necessitating the use of accounting information.It portrays the grave consequences of the neglect and insufficiency of the use of accounting information for decision making.The research therefore depicts a significant dimension of providing an analytical framework of the application of accounting information for decision making.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe imperative of planning with the help of accounting information before the commencement of operations is essential for management to facilitate the decision making process of fundamental issues affecting the survival, wellbeing and growth of an organization.\n\nAccounting information is often regarded as a means to an end, with the ending being the decision that is helped by the availability of accounting information as described by Arneld and Hope(1990). Accounting information helps managers understand their tasks more clearly and reduces uncertainty before making decisions.since profitability have long term effect on the business, it is therefore important to analyze accounting information before making profit decisions (Chong 1996). Similarly,accounting information is recognized as a learning machine that can help to evaluate how objectives might be  achieved by quantifying the financial impact of each alternative available to the decision.(Budugan and Georscu 2009).\n\nAccounting information system is therefore imperative which is the efficient and effective collection and storage of data concerning an organisations financial activities, including getting the transaction data from source documents, recording the transaction in journals and posting data from journals to ledgers. It involve producing managerial reports and financial statements.\n\n1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nDecision making process in the organization is effective with the availability of sufficient accounting information. Accounting information for profit planning usually covers three major elements such as cost information ,marketing and sales information(Admareli, 1991).\n\nAccording to Norton (1997) costing contributes to an understanding of how profits and value are created and how efficiently and effectively operational processes transform input into output.It can be applied to resource, process, product/service, customer, and channel related information covering the organization and its value chain (Metcalfe,1998).Thus the decision making process lies at the heart of accounting information\n\nThe research intend to investigate the use of accounting information for decision making.\n\n1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe problem confronting the research is to investigate the use of accounting information for decision making.The efficiency of planning and decision making cannot be isolated from the availability and sufficiency of accounting information if the organization must survive, grow and operate maximally to make profit and attain its set objectives.\n\n1.3  RESEARCH QUESTION\n\n1        What is the nature of accounting information\n\n2        What is the significance of accounting information in decision making in the organization\n\n1.4  OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH\n\n1        To determine the nature of accounting information\n\n2        To appraise the decision making process of the organisation\n\n3        To determine the use and application of accounting information in decision making\n\n1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study shall profer an analysis of the application of accounting information in the decision making process of an organization\n\nIt shall be a valuable source of information for managers, accountants etc.\n\n1.6  STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS\n\n1        Ho The quality of decision making in the organization is low\n\nHi   The quality of decision making in the organization is high\n\n       2    Ho    The use of accounting information  is  low\n\n              Hi    The use of accounting information is  high\n\n       3 Ho  The effect of accounting information in decision making is low\n\nHi    The effect of accounting information in decision making is high\n\n1.7      SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study focuses on the appraisal of the use of accounting information in decision making.\n\n1.8      DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nACCOUNTING INFORMATION  SYSTEM DEFINED\n\nAccounting information system is therefore imperative which is the efficient and effective collection and storage of data concerning an organisations financial activities, including getting the transaction data from source documents, recording the transaction in journals and posting data from journals to ledgers.

It objectively examines, evaluates and reports on the adequacy of internal control as a contribution to the proper, economic and effective use of resourcesThe essentials for effective internal auditing are:independence;The internal auditor should have the independence in terms of organisational status and personal objectivity which permits the proper performance of his duties staffing and trainingThe internal audit unit should be appropriately staffed in terms of numbers, grades, qualifications and experience, having regard to its responsibilities and objectives. The internal auditor should be properly trained to fulfil all his responsibilities .relationships;The internal auditor should seek to foster constructive working relationship and mutual understanding with management, with external auditors, with any other review agencies and, where one exist, the audit committee ;due care;The internal auditor should exercise due care in fulfilling his responsibilities .planning, controlling and recordingThe internal auditor should adequately plan, control and rec;ord his work .evaluation of the internal control system;The internal auditor should identify and evaluate the organisation's internal control system as a basis for reporting upon its adequacy and effectiveness .evidence;The internal auditor should obtain sufficient, relevant and reliable evidence on which to base reasonable conclusions and recommendations.reporting and follow-up;The internal auditor should ensure that findings, conclusions and recommendations arising from each internal audit assignment are communicated promptly to the appropriate level of management and he should actively seek a response. He should ensure that arrangements are made to follow up audit recommendations to monitor what action has been taken on them .The terms of reference for the internal audit function should be formally confirmed by the organisation and should have proper regard to the contents of this guideline; demonstrable independence of the function is crucial to its effectiveness. For certain public sector organisations the need for an internal auditing function is prescribed by statute and this provides a basis for defining specific standards and guidance for the practice of internal auditing in these organisations.To achieve full effectiveness the scope of the internal audit function should provide an unrestricted range of coverage of the organisation's operations, and the internal auditor should have sufficient authority to allow him access to such records, assets and personnel as are necessary for proper fulfilment of his responsibilities. It is a management responsibility to determine the extent of internal control in the organisation's systems which should not depend on internal audit as a substitute for effective controls. Internal audit, as a service to the organisation, contributes to internal control by examining, evaluating and reporting to management on its adequacy and effectiveness. Internal audit activity may lead to the strengthening of internal control as a result of management response.One of the objectives of internal auditing is to assist management in the pursuit of value for money. This is achieved through economic, efficient and effective use of resources.It is a management responsibility to maintain the internal control system and to ensure that the organisation's resources are properly applied in the manner and on the activities intended. This includes responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud and other illegal acts. The internal auditor should have regard to the possibility of such malpractice and should seek to identify serious defects in internal control which might permit the occurrence of such an event. An internal auditor who discovers evidence of, or suspects malpractice should report firm evidence, or reasonable suspicions to the appropriate level of management. It is a management responsibility to determine what further action to take.Independence;Independence is achieved through the organisational status of internal audit and the objectivity of internal auditors.Organisational status The status of internal audit should enable it to function effectively. The support of management is essential. Internal audit should be involved in the determination of its own priorities, in consultation with management. Accordingly the head of internal audit should have direct access to, and freedom to report to all senior management including the chief executive, board of directors and, where one exists, the audit committee.Objectivity of the internal auditor Each internal auditor should have an objective attitude of mind and be in a sufficiently independent position to be able to exercise judgement, express opinions and present recommendations with impartiality. The internal auditor, notwithstanding his employment by the organisation, should be free from any conflict of interest arising either from professional or personal relationships or from pecuniary or other interests in an organisation or activity which is subject to audit. The internal auditor should be free from undue influences which either restrict or modify the scope or conduct of his work or over-rule or significantly affect judgement as to the content of the internal audit report. The internal auditor should not allow his objectivity to be impaired when auditing an activity for which he has had authority or responsibility. An internal auditor should be consulted about significant proposed changes in the internal control system and the implementation of new systems and make recommendations on the standards of control to be applied. This need not prejudice the auditor's objectivity in reviewing those systems subsequently. An internal auditor should not normally undertake non-audit duties but where he does so, exceptionally, he should ensure that management understands that he is not then functioning as an internal auditor. \n\n1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\n\nDelathe (2012) stated that auditing in the past, have been   considered as a simple administrative procedure comprised mainly of checking accuracy of transactions pre-payment verification and control, counting assets and reporting in past event, a combination of forces, has, in recent time, let to a quiet revolution in the accounting profession, Government, private and public companies are moving towards a higher level of transparency and as such demonstrate accountability and stewardship in the use of resources entrusted  to them.\nReason for Auditing includes,Evaluation and risk management ,Control and Government processes, Investigative and Advisory services .Clement (2012) note that audit system is important for a company because its enables it to pursue and attain its various corporate objectives. Business processes need various forms of interval control to facilitate supervision and monitoring, prevent and detect irregular transaction, measure ongoing performance, maintaining adequate business records and to promote operations productivity, interval Auditors, review the design of the interval control and informally propose improvement and document any materials irregularities to enable further investigation by management if it is warranted under the circumstances.Manguis (2011) observed that auditing helps top management manage corporate affairs, providing guidance on various issues ranging from financial accuracy to interval control to regulatory compliance. They also help department heads indentify tools and methodologies to improve operational activities, putting companies on a more sustainable path. The need for Auditing stems from.Internalcontrol ,FinancialReview,Regulatory monitoring\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe auditing function is often regarded to be an independent process of ensuring an accurate and fair reporting of the financial records of the organization and of the effective use of resources,this however does not exclude it from the corperate objective of the organization.it  is therefore pertinent that the objectivity function of auditing be aligned with the corperate objective  of the organization.The problem confronting this research is to determine the role of the auditor in the achievement of organizational objectives with a case appraisal of Nestle Nig plc.\n\n1.3 RESEARCH QUESTION\n\n1 What is the nature of the auditing function\n\n1        What constitute the nature of  organizational objective\n\n2        What is the role of auditor in the achievement of organizational objective\n\n3        What constitute the role of the auditor in the achievement of organizational objective in  nestle plc.\n\n1.4  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n1 To determine the nature of the auditing function\n\n2 To appraise the nature of organizational objective\n\n3 To determine the role of the auditor in the achievement of organizational objective\n\n4        To determine the role of the auditor in the achievement of organizational objective in nestles plc\n\n1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study intends to provide project the importance of the role of auditors in the achievement of organizational objective.\n\nIt shall also serve as a veritable source of information on the  fundamental issues of auditing\n\n1.6  STATEMENT OF THE HYPOTHESIS\n\n1 Ho  Audit is not given significant attention in nestle plc\n\nHi  Audit is given significant attention in nestle plc\n\n2  Ho Organisational objectives in nestle plc is low\n\n    Hi Organisational Objectives in nestlcplc is high\n\n3  Ho  The role of auditor in the achievement of organisational objective in nestle plc is low\n\nHi  The role of auditor in the achievement of organisational objective in nestle plc is high.\n\n1.7  SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n   The study shall appraise the nature of the role of auditing in the achievement of organisational objective with a case study of nestle plc\n\n1.8  DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nAUDITING DEFINED\n\nInternal audit is an independent appraisal function established by the management of an organisation for the review of the internal control system as a service to the organisation.

Even before the modern concepts of leadership came into being, the apostle of Jesus Christ, Paul in the Pastorals lists the qualifications for church leaders to ensure sustainable growth and survival (Dairo, 2007). These have remained the model for ages. For any church leader to steer the ship of the church successfully, these qualities must be imbibed. But contemporary experience in Nigeria has shown a marked departure from this Pauline list of qualifications for church leaders which has really affected growth and survival of churches. The level of understanding expected from both the leaders and the followers is missing in most cases. This often results in crises within “the body of Christ”.\n\nThere are some common features in various definitions of leadership. It will be presumptuous for anyone to attempt a definition that will satisfy the populace especially regarding church leadership. Leadership is nothing if not linked to collective purpose; and the effectiveness of leaders must be judged not by press clippings but by actual social change, measured by intent and by satisfaction of human needs and expectations which on the long term will be visible on the church growth and development.\n\nOluwasegun (2005) defines leadership as the ability to gain consensus and commitment to common objectives beyond organizational requirements which are attained with experience or contribution and satisfaction on the part of the working group. Leadership could also be defined as the relationship in which one person or the leader influences others to work together willingly on related tasks to attain that which the leader desires. It is a means of direction. Leadership is the ability of management to induce the subordinates to work towards a group’s goals with confidence and keenness. It implies that the leader accepts responsibility for the achievement of the group objectives and it is, therefore, essential for the trust and cooperation from both sides to be evidence all the time (Oluwasegun, 2005). Leadership is an art of getting things done. It can be learnt, improved, developed and perfected. It is the key process of influence and the process always includes a number of key components such as leader and followers, they interact in situations and means of influence which emerge from the leader and from the followers, based on their value system and goals which the leader and the followers seek to achieve (Dairo, 2004).\n\nWith respect to church leadership, it implies that the church leader gives direction, motivates, reprimands and develops a set objective along with his group and resolves individual or group needs within the church. This is perceived as the only way towards the church growth and survival. In the New Testament it was more often used as Christological title for the exalted Jesus. The results of semasiological and lexicographical investigation of secular Greek indicate an extremely polyvalent spectrum of meaning for the word “church leader”, the basis being he who is the first, who stands at the head of, who leads.\n\nAccording to the New Testament, the terms \"bishop,\" \"pastor,\" and \"elder\" are synonymous. Bishop means \"overseer,\" and the elders had the responsibility of overseeing the work of the church (Acts 20:17,28; 1Pet 5:1-3). \"Elder\" is the translation of the Greek word presbytes, which means \"an old man.\" Paul used the word presbytery in (1Tim 4:14), referring not to a denomination, but to the \"eldership\" of the assembly that ordained Timothy. Elders and bishops (two names for the same office, (cf Titus 1:5,7) were mature people with spiritual wisdom and experience to ensure the survival of the church of God. Also, \"pastor\" means \"shepherd,\" one who leads and cares for the flock of God (Vine, 1996:67).\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nAccording to Dairo (2008), many Churches in Nigeria are characterized with false teaching, preconceived ideas and human-formed regulations which have too often undermined the Holy Spirit’s specification and has militated greatly against church growth and survival. According to Apostle Paul, church leader must be kind of man that can carry the followers along. All church leaders may not possess these qualities in the same measure but a leader must have these quality attributes to a degree that is noticeable in his life to ensure sustainable growth. If a man is known to be harsh instead of being gentle, intemperate instead of being temperate, disgraceful instead of being respectable, he has disqualified himself (Bible Org. 2004). The work of church leadership is a noble task. Such an office needs the right kind of people to serve. Accumulation of material wealth, by capitalizing on the “gross ignorance” of the people about the teaching of the Bible on wealth by church leaders as also limited growth and survival of many churches because of the increased awareness of these dubious strategies. However, the researcher is examining the role of church leaders in the growth and survival of a church.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the role of church leaders in the growth and survival of a church.\n\n2.  To identify the functions and duties of church leaders in a church.\n\n3.  To identify the other factors militating against church growth and survival.\n\n1.5      RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the role of church leaders in the growth and survival of a church?\n\n2.  What are the functions and duties of church leaders in a church?\n\n3.  What are the other factors militating against church growth and survival?\n\n1.5   HYPOTHESIS\n\nHO: Church leaders do not have a role in church growth and survival\n\nHA: Church leaders do have a role in church growth and survival\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n1.  Findings from this study will educate the church authorities and the general public in Nigeria on what the church leaders need to do or incorporate into the system to ensure growth and survival.\n\n2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study will cover the activities of churches in Nigeria with special focus on the roles and duties of the church leaders\n\nLimitations of study\n\n1.        Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n2.        Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAbogunrin, S.O (1986). “St Paul’s Conception of Disciplined Leadership in the Nigerian Context” in S Ade\n\nOluwasegun B.A. (2011) (ed.)
