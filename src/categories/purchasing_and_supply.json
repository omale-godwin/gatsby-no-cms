Quality has become an important factor in these. Although ostensibly always. an objective of business is customer in customer terms, because a specific goal in the late 1980’s provide higher quality are recognized as a key element for success, most large operations taking that path have document the success, first they survived the competitors that has set the higher quality levels and now have regained some of their former market.  Total Quality Management is perhaps the leading management approach that compares employed to improve their product and services, quality with the aim of improving typical measures of business performance.  (e.g profit, increased market share reduced cost).  The Japans have capture more than 30% of the American and electronic markets.  It was achieved by offering higher value products.  In response to the boom in the competitor market, many American firms have implemented require the integration of Human resources, production engineering store and purchasing marketing, distribution, and planning is a continuous improvement process; it is much wider than the traditional quality view of incoming inspection and process control.  It means that the entire organization is working as a team including the cooperate top managers and each an every employee, it is on innovative way of thinking that affect the culture, the strategy and technology of company.  The organization needs a holistic approach so that every department in the organization should come together for cost reduction and improve products, approach will reduce cost and quality will be achieve for competitive advantage.</p> <p><strong>1.2Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>This Empirical research has identified some general problems that are associated with Total Quality Management which are listed below. One of the problems is the failure of organization to understand the importance of material quality control and often ignore its application. This has led to the receipt of low quality and substandard lots of materials into the in process, culminating in poor quality out put and increased cost for these organizations.</p> <p>The problem of organization over-relying on suppliers ability as a result of trust thereby falling to check and/or monitor the incoming materials for any possible defect or deviations from specification.</p> <p>Others are manpower related problems were also observed to be a major barrier for achieving a Total quality management program. Most organizations lack the service of specialists to handle materials quality control trained/retrained or lack of proper supervision due to top management neglect.</p> <p>Facilitates related problem in organizations, there are inaccuracies in machineries, tools, fixtures, measuring  instruments etc. that are required in managing quality and total quality control process which can be disastrous for decision making as a result of the unreliable outcomes. The existence of these problems brought about the head for the research work so as to proffer solutions that are workable at the end.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The primary objective of the study is to identify the impact of quality management on production cost of an organization.</p> <p>i)                   To identify the challenges faced by manager in implementing Total Quality Management</p> <p>ii)                To identify the major cost component of Total Quality Management</p> <p>iii)              To identify the contribution of Total Quality Management on material and cost reduction</p> <p>iv)              To identify the method the Nigeria Bottling Company used in storage of raw material</p> <p>v)                To identify the attributes of quality products</p> <p><strong>1.4     Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The study will be of immense benefit to the researcher, the organization under study in achieving its goal and objective, other researcher, and the general public. It is sincerely hoped that the result of the study will be applied in areas that need to be improved in the organization under study. The study will also widen the horizon of the research on the topic under study and it will serve as reference to the researchers.</p> <p>Finally, the research is a pre-requisite for the award of Higher National Diploma (HND) in Purchasing and Supply of Kaduna Polytechnic.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research is limited to the Nigerian Bottling Company Kakuri Kaduna Plant, but the research will look at the entire concept of Total Quality Management as well as the major cost component of production and finally the application of Total Quality Management on material cost of production and finished goods cost.</p> <p><strong>1.6     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>i)                   What are the challenges faced by manager in implementing total quality management?</p> <p>ii)                What are the major cost components of quality management?</p> <p>iii)              What are the contribution of quality management on material and cost reduction?</p> <p>iv)              What method does the organization used in storage of raw materials?</p> <p>v)                What are the attributes of quality products?</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong>     <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Quality: </strong>fitness for purpose at lowest cost</p> <p><strong>Management:</strong> the process of planning organizing coordinating directing and controlling.</p> <p><strong>Effectiveness</strong>: the ability to bring about the intended result in respective of cost</p> <p><strong>Quality management: </strong>this is the overall management function that determines and implements quality policy.</p> <p><strong>Specification:</strong> this is the detailed description of an item<strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Scrap:</strong> this is defect, materials or staffs that cannot be repaired or used</p> <p><strong>Total Quality management: </strong>(TQM) this is a management approach to an organization centered on quality based on participation of all its members of the organization and society.</p> <p><strong>Inspection:</strong> To check incoming materials with specification so as to accept or reject based on evaluation.</p> <p><strong>Performance:</strong> performance means doing a job as per specification with efficient use of resources.</p> <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> the ability to yield an acceptable outcome consistently.</p> <p><strong>Materials</strong>: materials are resource used directly or indirectly to produce or incorporate finish goods.</p> <p><strong>Purchasing</strong>: the management function of  buying the right materials from the right source, at the right quality, at the right price, at the right quantity and purpose as economically as possible. </p> <p><strong>Standard</strong>: A predetermined and accepted way of doing things or the accepted state of thins.</p>\n\nIMPACT OF TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT ON PRODUCTION COST OF AN ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT ON PRODUCTION COST OF AN ORGANIZATION", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INVENTORY PLANNING AND CONTROL ON PRODUCTS AVAILABILITY</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER I: Introduction</strong></p> <p>1.1            <strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>It is a fact in materials management that continuity in production or provision of services on constant flow of required inventory. However, the question confronting the materials management remain, how much shall be ordered when the quality available is less than required to meet production demand or the quantity is less than order point and how best to plan and control the quantity of inventory needed at a given time.</p> <p>The focus of the materials manager is to reduce the two extreme ends of the spectrum, that is excessive (surplus) stock and adequate stock (stockout). The level of stock or inventory to be purchased or carried by an organization will depend on a number of issue, such as level of consumption, bulk purchase, discount, reliable, delivery dates, difficulty in matching supply with demand, speculation (availability or scarcity) and the company’s policy it is this prevailing dynamic circumstance that gives rise to the need for inventory planning for product availability. Inventory planning however, an enormous task that requires an astute combination of intelligence of what is actually happening to demand and that of what we expect to happen (forecasting).</p> <p>A closer look at organization annual balance sheet, it shows that assets account for between 60-70% of materials held in stock; yet proper attention, is hardly given to this aspect of management stacks and left at the mercy of the unqualified individuals.</p> <p>Inventory planning is itself has been explained as the determination of the quantity and quality required of a material, components, points and services ordering, control receiving, inspection and storage of the right material and the efficiency utilization of these materials to achieve organization’s objective. In this study a general understanding of inventory planning shall be considered as well as issue such as inventory control its importance to the organization, stock maintenance, material handling quality control and product availability among others.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>Statement of the Problems</strong></p> <p>Organizations in their effort to satisfy consumers demand for their product needs always to keep stocks of inventory at all times, since no organization can survive without keeping stock and ensuring constant flow. The problem that emerges from this is that of how best to ensure optimum supply without overstocking and understocking. Inventory planning and control is argued to be an effective way of overcoming these two extremes.</p> <p>Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company however has been using these approaches in its effort of maintain stock and constant flow of their products, yet it has continuously experienced acute shortage of supplies. The question that arises here is that, what techniques are employed by the organization’s expediting network in ensuring that products needed arrives on time, and how effective is the inspection techniques of the organizations it is an obvious hat most of the problems that associated with inventory planning is lack of professionalism and misapplication store responsibility that is shortcoming has a big challenges to the entire organization. Above all the study is an to find solution to those problem as it arise.</p> <p>1.3     <strong>Objective of Study</strong></p> <p>i)                   To determine the needs for inventory planning and control.</p> <p>ii)                To determine the techniques used in inventory planning.</p> <p>iii)              To determine how to establish constant flow of material in an organization.</p> <p>iv)              To determine who is responsibility for inventory planning in the organization.</p> <p>v)                To determine the significance of inventory planning in material availability.</p> <p>1.4     <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research is significant in many aspects, first the researcher will benefit immensely as it is a basic requirement in partial fulfillment for the award of Higher National Diploma (HND) in the department of Purchasing and Supply, Kaduna Polytechnic. It will contribute to existing knowledge as student can use it as a reference and understanding of inventory planning of serve as a consultation by other researchers who may likely carry out the same research or part of it work. It is also of the significance to the to the industry under study whom may likely want to carried out similar research.</p> <p>1.5     <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The work will be limited to inventory planning and it effect on products availability, the researcher did not intend to go beyond the department under study, the research will be conducted at KRPC within the following departments, Material Management Department (MMD) operation departments and maintenance department. These are traditional department that usually in needs of material at KRPC located at Kachia Road, Kaduna. The researcher will use 10% of 200 populations across three department to justify her work.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>1.6     <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>          i)       What are the importance of inventory planning and control?</p> <p>          ii)      What are the techniques use in inventory planning?</p> <p>          iii)     What procedures are followed to ensure constant flow of inventory?</p> <p>          iv)     Who is responsible for inventory planning?</p> <p>vi)              What are the significances of material handling in inventory planning?</p> <p>1.7     <strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research is likely to be limited by a number of factors which may combine to negatively affect the outcome. These limitations may be due to weakness of the instruments use for data collection, here the respondents are limited by the structure questionnaires.</p> <p>Again the attitude of the respondents may constitute a limitation as they may feel reluctant to give information they consider sensitive.</p> <p>The research design as well as the statistical tools used also have limitation that may affect the outcome of the study.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>1.8     <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>This aspect were design to explain all the languages and terminology that were use during the exercise.</p> <p><strong>Inventory</strong> – is defined as a list of all physical materials, stock items and equipment that kept in the store.</p> <p><strong>Planning</strong>: It can be explain as a futurist activity that bridges that gap between initiating of an idea and the occurrence of the even itself. It means deciding in advance what to do when, how and by whom, it is therefore form relation of future course of action.</p> <p><strong>Control</strong>: In its simplest form, control is about making sure the objectives of the firm are achieved.</p> <p><strong>Management</strong>: It is the judicious use of personal or organizational resources of the achievement of predetermined goals.</p> <p><strong>Product</strong>: Bundle of an items that provide satisfaction manufacturing output or performed services.</p> <p><strong>Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)</strong>: This is a calculated ordering quantity than organization should order at any point in time.</p> <p><strong>Buffer Stock</strong>: Is a situation where stock (safety) is held to meet unexpected demand.</p> <p><strong>Store</strong>: It can be defined as an isolated place where all kind of working and non working types of material such as equipment, spare parts are kept for safety and onward usage.</p> <p><strong>Stock Control</strong>: Is defined as the means by which material of the correct quantity is made available as at when required with the regards to the economy in storage and ordering cost, purchases price and working capital.</p> <p><strong>ABC Analysis: </strong>Is a system of stock control which basically analyze the stock by their important and value where a smaller volume of material cost and can result into production stoppages.</p> <p><strong>Receipt of Stock:</strong> This is a document or stock receipt which involve all the material and item supplied to the store whether from internal or external supplies.</p> <p><strong>Replacement Issues: </strong>These are issues from replacement items/equipment and suppliers which has been broken or how warned out or gone obsolete.</p> <p><strong>Stock Discrepancies:</strong> This is defined as the disagreement between the physical and stock records.</p> <p><strong>Pre-Production Stock: </strong>This comprise or part and material purchased from outside the organization to be manufactured into products.</p> <p><strong>Post Production Stock:</strong> They can also be described as finished products held either at the factory or at warehouses and distribution centre elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Inventory Control:</strong> This is the presentation of an adequate and balance inventory of material supplied within a minimum invest, so as tor educe storage and handling cost.</p> <p><strong>Provisioning:</strong> It can be seen as the process of determining in advance requirement of material taking into consideration, the amount of stock in hand at any time will be in accordance with the stock control policy.</p> <p><strong>Cyclical Provisioning:</strong> These involve examining either physical stock or stock records for a particular class by commodity at a regular interval and taking simultaneous action or call the items required replacement.</p> <p><strong>Discrepancies:</strong> Discrepancies refers to the difference between physical stock/items and the document records either as a result of surplus or shortage usually after stocktaking.</p> <p><strong>Redundancy:</strong> This is when quantity of an item in stock is more than reasonably necessary to provide an adequate services to production or operations activities in which the excuse is said to be redundant.</p> <p><strong>Obsolete:</strong> This refers to when an item is going out of use but not yet completely unusable.</p> <p><strong>Obsolescence:</strong> When an item is no longer usable by the business concerned because of the change in operational practice or method of production.</p> <p><strong>Material:</strong> These are component spare, raw material are kept in store.</p>\n\nINVENTORY PLANNING AND CONTROL ON PRODUCTS AVAILABILITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVENTORY PLANNING AND CONTROL ON PRODUCTS AVAILABILITY", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>An Analysis of the Procurement Reforms Act as a Tool for Cost Savings and Accountability in KRPC</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In the past, huge sums of government money have been siphoned through the processes  of contract awards. A major thrust of this administration therefore, is the acceptance of Procurement Reforms Act as a tool for embracing transparency, competition, fairness, integrity, openness and value for money in the procurement reforms Act and seek the support of all governance for the implementation of the scheme in various ministries and government parastatals.</p> <p>The researcher intends to analyze on procurement reforms Act as a tool for cost savings and accountability in Kaduna Refining Petrochemical Company (KRPC) considering the several abuses to rules and standards in the award and execution of contracts. These abuses are in the form of over-invoicing, inflation of contract costs, proliferation of white elephant projects, poor project delivery, overpayment as well as manipulations of the processes leading to the award of contracts.</p> <p>The Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company is in the business of refining Crude oil into valuable petroleum and petrochemical products and manufacturing and packaging products efficiently. And the way and manner in which procurement practices are carried out is of great concern to the researcher.</p> <p>The edifice is a process plant designed to run steadily with minimum operating costs so as to make profit. In order to achieve this notable objective, it is imperative that replenishment drives are made to ensure that operational spare parts are readily available in the warehouse.</p> <p>Since over seventy percent (70%) of the company’s expenditure is in the area of materials procurement. It is with this realization in mind that several efforts have been made by both corporate and the subsidiaries management to control and regulate materials management activities, especially in the area of procurement of materials in order to save cost and enhance company’s operations. In this project the terms procurement and purchasing would be used interchangeably.</p> <p>1.1       <strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The researcher developed interest to write on this topic because of personal interest in procurement reforms act and persona interaction with some staff who work in the procurement department under the umbrella of material management department (MMD) in Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company (KRPC).</p> <p>The researcher got an insight into the procurement activities of the company the company and the problems facing them and therefore feels that it would be of great benefit to the company to conduct a detailed study into its purchasing departments with the aim of identifying the problems and after necessary suggestions toward the solution of such problems for effective and efficient operations of the company, Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company (KRPC).</p> <p>1.2       <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The Material Management Department (MM) of the KRPC Ltd operates in an integrated form to make materials available in the warehouses because the spare parts are stored.</p> <p>“JUST IN CASE” for timely maintenance intervention or as the need may arise.</p> <p>However, KRPC has taken a back seat in the implementation of the provisions of the Procurement Refining Act. Also, the statement of the general problem is the non-adoption of the Procurement Refining Act in KRPC Ltd.</p> <p>And over the years there have been incessant cases where critical material needed for maintenance intervention and other requests, are either over-stocked, under-stocked or out of stock. The scenario depicts the existence of procurement deficiencies in the area of planning, replenishing, coding and inventory control which affects plant sustainability in KRPC Ltd. Besides 2008 annual stock taking in KRPC revealed the available materials to the value of N8 billion which could be used for other purposes.</p> <p>1.3       <strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study is geared towards achieving the following objectives:</p> <p>·                    Outline the risks associated with non-implementation of the provisions of the procurement Act in KRPC Ltd.</p> <p>·                    Determine the impact of the non-implementation of Procurement Reforms Act to the organization.</p> <p>·                    Examine the factors responsible for the non-implementation of the Act in KRP Ltd.</p> <p>·                    Suggest or proffer solutions to the problems.</p> <p>1.4       <strong>Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The benefits derivable under this study can be seen below:</p> <p>·                    It serves as a guide for the organization in which the researcher as chosen as a case study i.e. KRPC.</p> <p>·                    It is meant for students for are willing to embark on further studies in this perspective.</p> <p>·                    It is a prerequisite for an award of Higher National Diploma (HND) in purchasing and supply.</p> <p>1.5       <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this research work shall be limited to Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company particularly the department under the umbrella of material management department.</p> <p>The researcher also aimed at analyzing the procurement reform act as a tool for cost savings and accountability in KRPC.</p> <p>Also, comparative notes shall be made where necessary with other department within KRPC.</p> <p>1.6       <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>i)            What are the risks associated with the non-implementation of Procurement Reforms Act in KRPC?</p> <p>ii)          How does the non-implementation of the Procurement At affect the organization?</p> <p>iii)        What are the factors responsible for the non-implementation of the Procurement Reform Act?</p> <p>iv)         What are the remedies for solving these problems?</p> <p>1.7       <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>-      <strong><em>Procurement: </em></strong>Means purchasing and/or supplies.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>Supplier:</em></strong> This is the term used to describe a seller of goods or items in a given place.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>Inventory:</em></strong> This refers to the list of goods or items in a given place.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>Quotation:</em></strong> Is a list showing the prices of items.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>Purchase Order:</em></strong> It is an order in a printed firm to transmit the company’s requirement to supplies.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>Negotiation:</em></strong> Is a term used to arrive at a final and reasonable price.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>Specification:</em></strong> This is the information by the buyer to supplier indicating descriptions dimension and analysis performance of a product.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>Public Procurement:</em></strong> Means the acquisition by means of goods, works or services.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>Efficiency:</em></strong> Means the ability to minimize the use of resources in achieving organization’s objectives i.e. doing the right thing.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>Effective:</em></strong> Means producing the result that is wanted or intended.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>Due Process:</em></strong> Is a mechanism for ensuring strict compliance to rules and procedures that should guide contract award.</p> <p>-      <strong><em>BMPIU:</em></strong> Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligent Unit.

These are expensive problems, they must not only be detected and resolve at the earliest moment, they must be prevented from occurring at all”.</p> <p>Product quality as a strategy for competitiveness has become the focus of going concerns today, be it a manufacturing or a service industry. Be that as it may, quality product or service goal in any organization will be difficult to realize without the watchful eyes of inspection. Materials outsourced or insourced as the case may be either as raw materials, components, spareparts or maintenance repairs and operation items, must be subjected to thorough examination to ensure that they are the right materials of the correct quality according to agreed standards and specifications. This is because the slightest deviation from standards, oversights of any defect in in-coming or insourced materials results to numerous and serious consequences on the life of the organization. As a result of these consequences, organizations are forced to set in place a system to ensure that only materials of quality are allowed to come into the organization. This is achieved always through the mechanism of inspection.</p> <p>The responsibility for inspection in an organization differs from organization to organization depending on the nature, make up and policy of the organization in question. The purchasing or procurement or materials department however plays an important role because they are responsible for the sourcing of the materials used by the organization.</p> <p>Inspection depicts the general idea and concept which signifies the ascertaining and determination of quality or conformity of sourced materials or services to established standards and specification. This, therefore brings to mind the fact that inspection and quality can hardly be discussed separately without reference to one. It is a major tool for the determination of quality. This study therefore, shall focus on specification, standardization, inspection and quality control and assurance.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>1.2     <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Oversights and deviation from  standard for supplied materials due to the inability of organizations to closely inspect these materials remains the bane of most government agencies and parastatals failure. These problems are further exacerbated by the overall management approaches and attitudes to these issues. These has resulted to continued accurate and epileptic power supply in the state which are often blamed on the failure of installed equipments such as transformers and cables.</p> <p>The choice of Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) Kaduna is to examine the issue arising from these. The question that is asked is; what measures are put in place in the organization to determine the needs for materials and specifications? Again, what mechanisms are put in place by the organization to ensure that purchased or outsourced equipment and materials are properly inspected for quality?</p> <p>1.3     <strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>Because of the effect of substandard materials allowed into the organization on the quality of services rendered by the organization, the major objective of the study is built around the determination of the effectiveness of the inspection programs employed by the organization.</p> <p>The study is therefore, aimed at:</p> <p>i)                   To determine if inspection is carried out.</p> <p>ii)                To determine how specification is communicated to suppliers.</p> <p>iii)              To determine how substandard materials are treated.</p> <p>iv)              To determine the method(s) of inspection.</p> <p>v)                To determine the effectiveness of the procedure.</p> <p>1.4     <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of this study is enormous. First, the researcher will be the first beneficiary as it is a prerequisite requirement in partial fulfillment for the award of Higher National Diploma [HND] in the Department of Purchasing and Supply Management, Kaduna Polytechnic, without which the researcher cannot graduate.</p> <p>Secondly, it will serve as a store of knowledge and guide for which future researchers can consult. Students will also benefit as it will help to expand their scope of knowledge.</p> <p>It will also benefit the organization understudied, as they can utilize it to improve or ensure that defective materials, substandard materials do not enter the production process.</p> <p>Finally, the general public will also gain from its depth to utilize against purchases or orders they will place from time to time since everyone buys one material, product or components or parts at times.</p> <p>1.5     <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The focus of this research work is on the effect of inspection on the quality of services in Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), Kaduna, located in the heart of Kaduna, along Ahmadu Bello Way, Central Area Kaduna. The periods of 2009-2012 were considered and concern was given to the Material Management (Purchasing and Store), quality control and the inspection departments of the organization.</p> <p>1.6     <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>i)                   Where in the organization are material supplied inspected?</p> <p>ii)                 How are materials required specified ?</p> <p>iii)              How are substandard materials treated?</p> <p>iv)              What are the methods of inspection?</p> <p>v)                 How effective is the inspection procedure?</p> <p>1.7     <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Supplier: </em></strong>This means a company an organization or an individual that can agree to supply or release goods or services to a buying organization.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Vendor:</em></strong> This is another term for a supplier.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Material:</em></strong> Anything that can be offered to the market for attention, acquisition, use or consumption that might satisfy needs.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Specification:</em></strong> This is a detailed description of materials needed from a supplier, which the supplied item must conform to.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Standardization:</em></strong> This is the process of formulating and applying rules for an orderly approach to a specific activity.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Standard:</em></strong> A standard is the result of a particular standardization effort approved by a recognized authority.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Defect:</em></strong> A defect is where a component does not meet its requirement or specification and needs to be replaced or repaired.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Quality:</em></strong> This is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Inspection:</em></strong> This is the examination of a work product or service or materials to determine whether it conform to standards or not.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Organization:</em></strong> This is defined in this context as a set of processes.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Productivity:</em></strong> This means efficient utilization of available resources at economic cost.</p> <p>Ø    <strong><em>Buyer:</em></strong> This is a person who acquires goods at a particular price without due consideration to the technicalities involved, but rather acquires what he wants.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF MATERIAL INSPECTION ON PRODUCT QUALITY IN POWER HOLDING COMPANY OF NIGERIA (PHCN), KADUNA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF MATERIAL INSPECTION ON PRODUCT QUALITY IN POWER HOLDING COMPANY OF NIGERIA (PHCN), KADUNA", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>EFFECT OF STORE DESIGN ON MATERIALS HANDLING A CASE STUDY OF POWER HOLDING COMPANY OF NIGERIA (PHCN) KADUNA</strong></p> <p><strong>Chapter I:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>A store is an essential limb of an organization. It is the depository of all materials required by the organizations in the organization and supplies materials as an when required. </p> <p>It is important to note that the store is an area of great expenditure in manufacturing and assembling plant. It is true that store function is a major cost centre which make use of 70-75% annual budget of the firm (Dangana 2005) and thus it can affect saving and therefore contribute significantly and therefore contribute significantly to the profit of the organization. </p> <p>However, in today’s highly competitive and globalized business world, store design is of great importance as a substantial number of instances have show that people charge with the function and responsibility of designing and managing the store are given little or no attention in the organization. This may be as a result of poor understanding store design or inappropriate application of it. </p> <p>More so, the variety of items sometimes, store is so large that a planned system is necessary to keep the secured and in order. The stored items should be identified and issues with minimum effort and minimum time. Thus this calls for a store structure suitable to carry on various activities efficiently and productivity and developing a system that ensure safety of men and materials. </p> <p>Most often the design of a store house determiners to a large extent the materials movement pattern and the limited type of handling equipment that can be used. This result in fact that most customers demand for goods and services within and outside the organization are incremental in nature as they opt for speedy, convenient and reliable delivery of materials and service. </p> <p>However, the need to curtail the amount of waste and improve the level of customer’s service within such organization has brought the use of the term store design ad its impact in materials handling. It should also be noted at this junction that any knowledge of how a store should be designed must incorporate the knowledge of how a store should be designed must incorporate the knowledge of how materials would be moved. </p> <p>Therefore, the research work develops the effective utilization of store design and it prospect in the organization with reference to enhancing and ensuring effective materials handling in the organization. </p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>One vital decision that firms make is how to design and where locate their storage facilities. This decision goes a long way in determining the extent to which the firm will achieve its objectives.

They need to be moved and moved to the location they are needed. These goods passed through a long chain and are usually handled by many people, with each contributing to adding value to the product, from point of extraction to the transformation, and eventually consumption. This extraction – transformation – consumption stage is what is referred to as supply function.</p> <p>History has also told us that at a point those activities were undertaken crudely and primitively. No easy access to information. In the organization, sometimes information are passed wrongly between buyer and the supplier on what is to be supplied, where it should be supplied and the time to supply it. But as time goes on man develop methods, technique and technology that allow man make this activity easier and more efficient, which is information technology.</p> <p>Information technology is considered as a pre-requisite for effective control of today’s complex function, indeed a recent study conducted by Forrester Research indicate that US manufacturers are increasingly dependent on benefits brought by information technology to improve supply function agility, reduce cycle time, achieve higher efficiency and deliver products to customer in a timely manner. The implementation of information technology in supply function has also enable firm organization to develop and accumulate knowledge about stores, about its customers, supplier and market demands, which in turn influence performance.</p> <p><strong>1.2            </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Before the introduction of information technology to supply function, the keeping of records (information) manually often resulted in keeping copies of the same document in different places. information is not easily accessible relating to supply function and sometimes information don’t get to the buyer and supplier on time on what is to be supplied and this will tied down activities and it will also affect the organization.</p> <p>Keeping of stock record is manually done which is time consuming, not cost effective, even the calculation of stock level is very, very difficult and at times it causes delay in the delivery of materials. Not only that before the advent of the use of information technology in supply function stock checking and stock taking becomes very difficult which at times lead to discovery of huge number of items. Either going bad or becoming obsolete. Even the location of material and identification becomes very difficult because identifying and location of materials could be time consuming and this could lead to bottleneck. </p> <p>It is with this in mind that researchers will attempt to see how the application of information technology can impact on supply function of Peugeot Automobile of Nigeria (PAN).</p> <p><strong>1.3            </strong><strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>i.                   To identify the impact of information technology on supply function</p> <p>ii.                 To identify the condition under which enterprise resource planning (ERP) can be a critical enabler or severe handicap for superior chain performance.</p> <p>iii.              To identify the basic concept involving in the analysis, design and operation of information system in relation to supply function</p> <p>iv.              To identify the innovative approaches that had been recently developed in relation to supply function. </p> <p>v.                 To determine whether the process is reliable enough in ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in increasing organizational performance.</p> <p><strong>1.4            </strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of this study is to know the impact of information technology in an organization by creating and developing sound management information system to meet organizational goals and objectives.</p> <p>The effective use of information technology offers manager several significant advantages because it is the ability to process large volume of data rapidly. Computer can do much routine clerical works; thus, freeing departmental personnel from many mistakes and repetitive tasks.</p> <p>Information technology offers supply functions executives immediate availability of more complete data and information for use when making purchasing and related materials decisions, because of its fantastic speed. It can also supply management with virtually instant report which might otherwise take an army of clerks month to prepare or update, this will enable the supplier to manage by exemption and do more effective and economical good job and managing the flow of materials throughout operation.</p> <p>Another significance is to look into information technology method of supply function of Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Kaduna with the view of making students for automated system for obvious reasons.</p> <p>The researcher provides valuable suggestion and advice on problem facing the store departments. This will help the organization to adopt a recommended stock control technique to improve service and profit level of the organization.</p> <p>Further more the project is requirement in partial fulfillment for the award of a Higher National Diploma in Purchasing and Supply of Kaduna Polytechnic.

In the private and public sector, their total expenditure is mainly spent on acquiring either materials or facilities or services. There is no way business operations can be effectively carried out without them. Negotiation is vital to organizations so as to reduce cost or minimize cost and to maximize profit.</p> <p><strong>1.1   Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Negotiation as a cost deduction technique in material procurement is for efficiency of any business, and also contingent upon obtaining the right materials and have it available in the right quantity from the right source, at the right price, delivered at the right place at the right time, whereby failure to any of these adds to costs and decreases the profit level of any organization.</p> <p>There has been procurement fraud because of the idea of speed money in the mind of some of the procurement managers or officials who buy materials or items for the organization. Lack of transparency has lead to excess spending, increasing cost of production, losing a lot of money through the inflating of prices, over invoicing and overpayment of materials procured.</p> <p>High cost incurred in material procurement is as a result of procurement manager not doing his home work well that is by planning his objectives and strategy before hand and he enters the session without a positive attitude of success.</p> <p>Lack of knowledge and not been conversant to some guide when negotiating by the procurement manager in respect to issue such as, when to negotiate, the agenda, negotiation technique and behaviour, some attribute of a good negotiator, the team leader to negotiate term of payment not stipulated and followed add to the cost of production. These could also lead to high cost of finished products and make it not to compete well with its competitors in the market, and calls for extra expenses on promotions and advert, renovation and so forth, just to improve sales in order to make profit or keeps the organization living.</p> <p>Hence procurement being a process whereby all classes of resources such as materials, facilities, people required to render services are obtained procurement covers a wider range of supply activities than buying alone. Negotiation as cost reduction technique in materials procurement is embarked on to solve some of the problem earlier mentioned. Negotiation is a very vital and essential technique in every organization in both private and public sector to reduce high cost incurred in material procurement, the role in negotiation and all that it takes to negotiate effectively. The impact expected at the end of these is to minimise cost and maximise profit of the organization, and also to ensure that the end products stand in the competitive market, to satisfy the taste of consumers and promote the standard of living economy and the society at large.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>In both the private and public sectors, between 50% and 80% of their total expenditure is spent on acquiring either materials or services, procurement is thus the biggest item of expenditure of an organization. Excessive costs are incurred when enquiring these materials in private sector about 60% to 75% of company’s procurement (purchases) of materials examples raw material is done by the company agent or foreign officials of the company based abroad , who usually charge certain percentages for their work which could lead to additional cost of production, over-invoicing and over payment. What else can be done, and what other means can be used to acquire raw materials.</p> <p>Further more, when there is a need to render service that is the award of contract we know that every one is interested in buying, although they call it purchasing but it has lead to mismanagement and squandering of funds. What are the procedures, measures technique to ensure that such contract or procurement of materials, goods and services are carried out appropriately and so on.</p> <p>To reduce cost, negotiation is one of the techniques to use, since negotiation is an art of arriving at a common understanding through bargaining on the essentials of a contract such as delivery, price, terms and condition of service, payment. These communication of inter-changing ideas and information as a result of which procurer and the supplier arrived at a mutually acceptable bargain enhance the procurement manager with a positive attitude of success, planned his objectives and strategy before hand.</p> <p>The procurement manager would have to collect and study all relevant facts before meeting the supplier, and then develop an agenda for the meeting to negotiate with the supplier. Adequate arrangement or preparation would be made in respect to the negotiation team, the leader with the technique that would be used to negotiate and when to negotiate will be spelled out.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The objectives of these study is to ensure negotiation technique of communication for bargaining are well understood so that the buying organization and the supplier will arrive at and agreed price, terms and condition of service, payment and so on.</p> <p>To ensure prudence and judicious utilization of the limited resources available in an organization, all procurement undertaken must comply with the principle of openness between the procurer and the supplier, transparency, accountability, competition among suppliers, cost effectiveness and value for money are monitored to enhance profitability of organization. Between the procurer and supplier there should be an understanding which leads to reducing cost involved in competitive bidding.</p> <p>To also make room for meetings in order to attain the desire goal of the organization, and to ensures that suppliers perform according to the terms of the negotiation. </p> <p>This study is specifically designed to: </p> <p>i.             Identify the techniques for negotiation</p> <p>ii.            Identify the strategies for effective negotiation</p> <p>iii.           Investigate the current trend of materials availability in the organization under study</p> <p>iv.          Identify criteria for coordination and management of supplier, that can  ensure cost reduction in material procurement</p> <p>v.            Identify means of constant flow of material negotiated to avoid interruption at the point of production.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>              <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research work would be useful or the beneficiaries of this research work is the management of the organization under study, Nigerian Bottling Company Coca Cola Plc to re-address the way and manner by which materials are procured with regard to cost consciousness    </p> <p>The research work would also be of benefit to private and public procurement entity when negotiating on either organization or government contract. Negotiation is a trick to win supplier’s heart to willingly enter into a business traction and not using authority or power.</p> <p>The research work would add to the findings of the previous and future researchers who intend to study or have studied similar topic and will also help the other incoming researcher to build up on their findings.</p> <p>As a procurement manager the knowledge acquired would be used at the field to practice the profession in acquisition of materials to enhance profitability of the organization.

It deals with the entire process of how prospective suppliers are being surveyed, evaluated and determine policies relating to those who can most suitably meet the requirement of the organization, before they are being considered for a buyer and supplier relationship. However, this assessment is base on a number of essential instrument which price is one of the such.</p> <p>Price in general term refers to the amount offered for the purchase of an item. It can also be value pay for obtaining something, it is quite crucial to purchasing as price play vital role on the product manufacturing and its sales value.</p> <p>Negotiation among other relevant tools in sourcing selection function that purchasing employ in making an organization to actualize their goals to arrive at a most judgment on which suppliers are to be selected.</p> <p>Negotiation usually requires that the buyer have a face discussion with the suppliers in order to arrive at a common understanding on essence of a purchase/sale contact among which is price. Infact, price determination is the main focus of negotiation.</p> <p>In negotiation, to determine purchase price buyers and supplier usually discuss such element, as cost of production overhead market conditions. Speeds needs of the buyer and supplier eventually arrive at a mutual price, that both deliver the best value of item and at reduced cost to the buyer as well as favours the supplier fair interest to ensure a continued supplier-buyer rapport. </p> <p>This study set out to investigate some related problems having to do with purchasing a high item cost also looks at how negotiation as a tool for effective material pricing can be deployed to determine the right price of supply.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Most problems associated with negotiation especially when the issues of price is the pivot, buyers tend to overlook the variables that determine the price itself. This most time leads to arriving at a very high price for the purchase or contract.</p> <p>Moreso, lack of proper planning before approaching the negotiation table is very high fundamental and essential for any successful negotiation. The other negotiation exercise such as source of information and idea delivery time, quality of suppliers, fair and reasonable deal. Hence, since negotiation comes before any purchase or contract, what will happen to purchase without negotiation on specification and at multiple effect on terms of payment etc.</p> <p>Also the negotiation must not over power by one part or one principles, dirty trick all they lead to failure in the objective. One can derive benefit as solving problem source for information learn some experience, quality fair and reasonable price, control and relationship management.</p> <p>1.3     <strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>          The objective of conducting this research among others are as follows:</p> <p>i)                   To identify objective of negotiation.</p> <p>ii)                To identify the approaches of negotiation.</p> <p>iii)              To identify the requirement for negotiation.</p> <p>iv)              To determine the impact of negotiation on material pricing.</p> <p>1.4     <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>In dealing with the research question, the following question will be answered or addressed<strong>:</strong></p> <p>i)                   What are the objectives of negotiation?</p> <p>ii)                What are the approaches of negotiation?</p> <p>iii)              What are the requirements for successful negotiation?</p> <p>iv)              What are the impact of negotiation on material pricing?</p> <p>1.5     <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study will be of benefit to the organization which the study is being carried an investigation, and also it will serve as guide for relevant organization which have similar departments or problems, also it will serve as reference to the similar topic and serve as reference for further studies.</p> <p>Also, it will be beneficent to research in future, the organization also broaden the knowledge of the researcher; it will also assist the research especially in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of Higher National Diploma in Purchasing and Supply, Kaduna Polytechnic.</p> <p>1.6     <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research work will cover carious department with the store function and look at the process at which negotiation and its effect on materials pricing in Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Ltd.

He said, have you heard of the guys that burned up a brand new piece of rotating equipment because it was installed with no oil in it? That little oversight cost  $80,000 for a replacement. When properly lubricated, it would have cost less than $100”. Again, he said, “How about the guys that cut a section out of their raw materials feeder line and then find out the replacement piece was just a little bit too short to fit into the gap? That little mistake cost thousands of dollars in unplanned repairs and potentially hundreds of thousands in lost production”.</p> <p>This brings to mind the two renowned cases in Nigeria of Indomie Instant Noodles Poisoning Crisis of 2004 and Pfizer Poisoning Crisis, Kano 1996. What these organizations suffered in terms of cost, production revenue loss and image can only be imagined.</p> <p>Again, operating in an unstable environment riffed with stiff competition; product quality management has become in more ways than one the life-blood of the organization. Be that as it may, and as strategic as product quality is to success of the organization, it will be near impossible if not impossible to achieve the goals of enhancing, maintain and sustaining product quality without the eagle eye of inspection.</p> <p>Inspection itself is a word with many synonyms, so, whether a writer chooses the word examination, observation, investigation or assessment, it will still be inspection, and sometimes the word testing is adopted depending on what is being inspected.</p> <p>The general idea and concept is to ascertain or determine quality or conformity of materials, products and components to pre-set standards and specification.</p> <p>So, materials outsourced or insourced either as raw materials, components, spare parts or MROs as well as the organizations output are subjected to thorough examination to ensure that they conformed to specifications and standards before they are certify for production or consumption.</p> <p>This brings to bear the subtle but distinct fact that inspection and quality are two inseparable Siamese twin terms, where one can hardly be discussed without alluding to the other. In fact, inspection is a tool often utilized by organizations for the realization of product quality management objectives. Thus, in other to understand the basis for inspection and its role in product quality management drive of an organization, a concise but lucid perspective of specification and standardization, the concept of quality management, quality control and quality assurance will need to be understood as they are interwoven and make it difficult to be discussed one without the other.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the inspection exercise can mean the successor failure of the organization. This is because the slightest oversight of outsourced or and insourced materials and products from specification and standards will often result to the production of defective output with multiple and spiraling effects in multiple fronts with unimaginable consequences for both the organization and consumers.</p> <p>Consequently, no where in the manufacturing industry are those consequences more truer, acute and immediate as in the food and drugs industry.</p> <p>The choice of Northern Noodles Limited Kaduna, in an attempt to examine the role of inspection in the quest for effective product quality management in the food industry was prompted by a few negative indicators which combined to impair on the quality of their products.</p> <p>The issue that arose for this study is asked, whose responsibility is it in the organization to ascertain and certify the compliance of product inputs to pre-determined standards and specifications? Again what measures are put in place by the organization to ensure that defective materials not do enter the production process? It is also asked, what measures are put in place to detect defects even in the production process?</p> <p>1.3     <strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>It is a truism that defective materials allowed to enter the production line can cause the failure of the organization, as quality will be impinged upon eventually, and this will be with great consequences to the organization and society at large. It is therefore necessary that this must not be allowed to occur.</p> <p>The objective of this study is therefore built around the examination of the quality management programs employed by the organization in its drive towards ensuring quality of its outputs. The study in this light is therefore aimed at.</p> <p>i)                   To determine the responsibility for inspection in the organization.</p> <p>ii)                To determine the approach to materials specification adopted by the organization.</p> <p>iii)              To determine the method of inspection adopted by the organization.</p> <p>iv)              To determine the defect preventive measures used by the organization.</p> <p>v)                To determine the control tools used by the organization to ensure quality outputs.</p> <p>1.4     <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research study is of immense importance in many facets. First, it is a requirement in partial fulfillment for the award of Higher National Diploma (HND) in the Department of Purchasing and Supply Management, Kaduna Polytechnic which the researcher stands to receive, and without which he cannot graduate.</p> <p>Again, as a reservoir of knowledge, it will serve as a guide for further study to some future researchers. Students will also benefit, because it will help expand and expose them to the different perspectives on the subject matter. Further, and importantly, it will be a tremendous benefits to the organization under studied; as it will expose them to the dangers embedded in the laxity or casualness given to the inspection exercise by the organization.</p> <p>Finally, the general public will also glean from its sublime significance, since everyone buys in one way or another, and to property adopt the principles and approaches of the inspection exercise in their personal acquisitions.</p> <p>1.5     <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research work is focused on the role of inspection in product quality management drive in Northern Noodles Limited, Kaduna, located along Kachia road, Chikun Local Government Area, Kaduna. The research considered and covered the period from 2011 and 2012.

In such circumstances it would received the required goods or services at all times. Sourcing thus involves much more than simply picking a supplier or contractor for each requirement in isolation. It involves continuing relationships, both with preferred sources which are actually supplying goods and services, and with potential sources which may have been passed over for the present but are still in the running. It involves decisions about how to do business on. For its proper performance sourcing requires supply market research. This is a normal part of procurement and supply work, undertaken informally by buyers when they talk to representatives, visit exhibitions read trade journals and investigate the market before placing  orders. In addition, it is the primary responsibility of purchasing to find out suitable sources of supply and ensure that the right quality and quantity of material is obtained at the right prices, and also spending time and effort in investigating and evaluating prospective supplies and continuously appraising the performance of current suppliers. In such a manner that there will be regular inflow of materials supply to avoid stoppage in production and its attendant costs and for the organization to be able to maximize its customer requirement in order to achieve its profit objective.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>       <strong>Statement of the Problem </strong></p> <p>Apparently in many organizations, it is clear to observed the effect of poor sourcing procedure in the award of contracts to the supplier who are not financially and technical capable of meeting the demand or the need of organization.

Whether or not a code system is at use, this technique should be employed. An efficient code system assists the store personnel in the controlling of the stock and easy identification of materials without wasting time. And vocabulary on the other hand is the transfer to writing of the things which has been recognized.

It is the depository of all materials required by the organizations in the organization and supplies materials as an when required. </p> <p>It is important to note that the store is an area of great expenditure in manufacturing and assembling plant. It is true that store function is a major cost centre which make use of 70-75% annual budget of the firm (Dangana 2005) and thus it can affect saving and therefore contribute significantly and therefore contribute significantly to the profit of the organization. </p> <p>However, in today’s highly competitive and globalized business world, store design is of great importance as a substantial number of instances have show that people charge with the function and responsibility of designing and managing the store are given little or no attention in the organization. This may be as a result of poor understanding store design or inappropriate application of it. </p> <p>More so, the variety of items sometimes, store is so large that a planned system is necessary to keep the secured and in order. The stored items should be identified and issues with minimum effort and minimum time. Thus this calls for a store structure suitable to carry on various activities efficiently and productivity and developing a system that ensure safety of men and materials. </p> <p>Most often the design of a store house determiners to a large extent the materials movement pattern and the limited type of handling equipment that can be used. This result in fact that most customers demand for goods and services within and outside the organization are incremental in nature as they opt for speedy, convenient and reliable delivery of materials and service. </p> <p>However, the need to curtail the amount of waste and improve the level of customer’s service within such organization has brought the use of the term store design ad its impact in materials handling. It should also be noted at this junction that any knowledge of how a store should be designed must incorporate the knowledge of how a store should be designed must incorporate the knowledge of how materials would be moved. </p> <p>Therefore, the research work develops the effective utilization of store design and it prospect in the organization with reference to enhancing and ensuring effective materials handling in the organization. </p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>One vital decision that firms make is how to design and where locate their storage facilities.

As a result of the increase in industries, raw materials became scarce. This made production to be complex. Accounts needed to be prepared and customers needed to be attended to within a short period of time. Alternative sources were required and new product needed improvement and development. With this problem in mind, the material management concept was introduced with the view to solving them in a scientific manner to achieve optimal success and reduce production cost. By the 1950s and 1960s an uneven transition from the old concept of material management as clerical function to a newer function or concept of material management emerged which embraced inventory control, distribution and buying function. By late 1960s material management was recognized as an important function in an organization. Thus, the importance of material management lies in the fact that any significant contribution made by the materials manager in reducing material cost will go along way in reducing production cost and improving the profitability and the rate of return on investment. Today, materials are the livelihood of any industry, no industry can operate without them, they must be made available at the proper time, in proper quality, at the proper place and at the proper price.</p> <p>Material handling is an integral aspect of material management that is concerned with the means by which materials move in the  materials are moved from one stage of processing to the other in such a way that processing, safe movement and use of space is enhanced. Hence, it is also an integral part of a production process which does not really contribute to the value of what is being processed, but an integral part of a production process which does not really contribute greatly to the processing cost. It is for this reason that this research work tends to take a clerical look at the significance of material handling and its impact on production cost.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of Problems</strong></p> <p>As it has been stated earlier, the impact of material handling on the production cost of an organization with particular reference to the PHCN industry, forms the basis of the research. This is not only because materials cost forms the overall 65% of the cost of running any organization according to some research in material management, but also because materials must be moved from one processing stage to another. Thus, there is always the need to effectively manage materials in order to curtail the amount of waste and also enhance maximum service in such organizations. This particularly calls for effective materials handling and maintaining a standard in the cost of production.</p> <p>Another problem is the employment of unqualified personnel to handle the store activities. This problem often results to poor material handling, deterioration, pilferage, theft and redundancy. Now that store operation is beginning to receive attention of those in authority, the necessity to actively coordinate these activities for better performance to create more impact and subsequently more recognition can not be over emphasized. Effective material handling and its prime function is a matter of ensuring that sufficient materials are retained in the store to meet all requirement without carrying unnecessary large stock or too little to ensure efficiency and profitability in PHCN.</p> <p>The researcher also gathers that there has been negligence of the store department and sometime brought under unrelated department which result in poor performance. This scenario depicts the existence of material handling deficiencies in the area of planning, replenishment, recording and inventory control which effect profitability in the organization. </p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The rationale for this study is to examine critically the application and to understand the impact of effective material handling which deals with the inflow and out flow of materials into  within and right through to the consumer of the products in relationship to its operational performance and economic. </p> <p>This study is specifically designed to </p> <p>i.             Investigate the current trend of materials availability in the organization under study.</p> <p>ii.            Establish the effectiveness in the material handling system in PHCN.</p> <p>iii.          Evaluate the impact of deficiencies in material handling system on profitability.</p> <p>iv.          Examine the factors responsible for dismal performance in material handling.</p> <p>v.           Suggest strategies for effective coordination and management of material handling system that can improve and provide constant and uninterrupted flow of materials which will invariably contribute to the profitability level of the organization under study.</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>Significance of  the Study</strong></p> <p>The research work is carried out to be of benefit to individual, organizations and the society in general. Thus the significance of the study are:</p> <p>The project work will be beneficial to subsequent researcher who will want to undertake a research into similar or related fields of study as it will provide them with relevant information on the subject matter.</p> <p>The study will also provide the public with first hand information and knowledge on how stores or materials are managed and control in public establishment with regard to PHCN.</p> <p>Similarly the research work has been undertaken to broaden the knowledge of the researcher and the society on how efficient material handling can contribute to the survival and profit level of an organization with particular reference to PHCN. Therefore the project will highlight the benefit which PHCN and other organization stand to gain if they employ and apply the right material handling system manned by qualified and trained professionals.</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of these study is restricted and confined to the material handling system in public institutions from 2007-2009 with the population of 250 staff drawn from production, materials management, power plant and utility units and a sample size of 50 which represent 20% of the population. </p> <p>The study seek to established the impact of effective method of material handling on the profitability of PHCN putting into consideration the enormous materials that serve as input for the organization. </p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>To measure the impact of material handling to the profitability of PHCN, the researcher has drawn up some research questions which are:</p> <p>i.             What is the rate of materials availability in the organization under study?</p> <p>ii.            Why is material handling system ineffective in PHCN?</p> <p>iii.          What are the effects of deficiencies in material handling system in profitability level in PHCN?</p> <p>iv.          What are the factors responsible for poor performance in material handling?</p> <p>v.           What are the remedies for improving efficiency of material handling system in PHCN?</p> <p><strong>1.7      </strong><strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Stock: </strong>All the tangible asset of a company other than the fixed asset.</p> <p><strong>Control</strong>: Standard set for checking the result of an activity.</p> <p><strong>Profitability</strong>: Adding or bringing to profit of an organization.</p> <p><strong>Stock taking</strong>: This is a complete process of writing the quantity balance of the entire range of items held in stock.</p> <p><strong>Stock Checking</strong>: This is any other check on physical quantity which may be applied either regularly or intermittently.</p> <p><strong>Redundant</strong>: Holding excess stock over normal equipment.</p> <p><strong>Materials</strong>: These are components, spare parts, semi processed goods in an organization. </p> <p><strong>Store</strong>: Is the place where all raw materials, component parts, are held for safe keeping.</p> <p><strong>Stock out</strong>: It is not having the required parts or materials on hand when and where they are needed.</p> <p><strong>Stock level</strong>: Is a predetermined quantity of stock to be held.</p> <p><strong>Obsolete</strong>: When an item is no longer usable by the organization concern because of a change in operational practice or method of production. </p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MATERIAL HANDLING COST REDUCTION EFFORT IN PUBLIC INSTITUTION  (A CASE STUDY OF PHCN, KADUNA)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF MATERIAL HANDLING COST REDUCTION EFFORT IN PUBLIC INSTITUTION  (A CASE STUDY OF PHCN, KADUNA)", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE IMPACT OF MATERIAL MANAGEMENT ON PURCHASING</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.1      <strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>Material Management was first discovered as very important function during the Second World War.

That is given the rapid changes in taste, technology and competition, organization will not rely solely on its existing supplier but look forward to get better sources of materials.</p> <p>An organization can use three ways to minimize cost of sourcing materials, by interviewing her customers, by negotiation with the suppliers, by sourcing for better materials, we mean original material that can go into production and come out with quality product; and in the study, we will be concentrating on material sourcing as a way of increasing an organization’s profitability.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, sourcing for the right material is like human being whose life span has to be treated to keep it working in order to add value, profit to the organization in the view that organization will not die subsequently. The death of organization lays on the fact that proper material are not acquired.</p> <p>In the light of the above, it is necessary for organization will adopt the system of sourcing for materials to develop and grow their profitability, to achieve this successfully, sourcing strategies are required to be adopted, these are right material, right price, right negotiation, right place, right qualities, right quantities, right sources, right time etc.</p> <p>In a nutshell, the study will dwell mainly on the impact of material sourcing to maximize organization profitability. </p> <p>1.2     <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Most organization especially production oriented organization like Nigeria Breweries spent about 60% to 70% of its annual expenditure on the acquisition of raw materials. Some of the major problems confronting any manufacturing industries are: high cost of materials will affect profit margin of the organization and also incompetence of supplies, if the suppliers are not competent in making right qualities supply will become problem to organization in profitability area.</p> <p>High cost involved in sourcing suppliers whole material needed for organization. Improper sourcing policy, sourcing for organizational profitability need to be proper that right material will be supplied.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>1.3     <strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose or objectives of the study is to examine the impact of material sourcing in enhancing the organizational profitability, its importance, how effective and efficient it is to the overall achievement of the organizational goal and objectives. Under the aspect, the researcher hope to realize the following:</p> <p>i)                   To determine the most effective sourcing policies adopted by Nigeria Breweries.</p> <p>ii)                To determine the criteria for selecting supplier in Nigeria Breweries.</p> <p>iii)              To determine the challenges of manager in material sourcing</p> <p>iv)              To determine the impact of material resource on the profitability of Nigeria Breweries.  </p> <p>1.4     <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research work is conducted primarily to meet the requirements of obtaining the award of Higher National Diploma (HND) in Purchasing and Supply in Kaduna Polytechnic, Kaduna abides being an academic research. The study will add to the knowledge of the interested individual or group on the subject matter. </p> <p>The researcher chose this topic to highlight the inherent danger and consequence of adopting poor performance in material delays as problem associated with sourcing with a view of providing solution or applied to sourcing activities in the organization like Nigeria Breweries Plc. It will show the impact in the organization performance and profitability in Nigeria Breweries.</p> <p>Another vital reason of the study is to contribute to the existing literature in the area of sourcing, types of sourcing, sourcing policy, sourcing process etc for future reference. It will enable a layman in the profession to have first hand information on bio sourcing activities is being carried out. Also the students of the department and other department will find this project an important relevant source of literature review in the area of sourcing ‘material sourcing’ further study will suggest ways that the organization can carryout its sourcing efficiently. </p> <p>1.5     <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research will be looking at improve on materials sourcing for organization profitability. This chapter will make use of population size of 100 staff and the research will use the sample size of 20 was adopted from the population of which describe the characteristics of the population.</p> <p>Secondly, this chapter will strict to the procurement, production and administrative department.

This was due to the fact that no serious attention was paid to public service rule. </p> <p>Financial regulations ethics and norms because of selfish reasons. The federal government noted the urgent need to transparency in government procedure so as to be able to move the system forward. Hence, the federal government in 2000 commissioned the world bank to collaborate with some private sector specialist to study financial systems and general procurement related activities in the country. The essence of this request to the world bank is to assist Nigerian government with a process of enthroning efficiency, accountability, integrity and transparency in government procurement and financial management system. </p> <p>It was based on this that the country procurement assessment report was produced through a participatory review approach from key stakeholders including representative from private and the federal, state and local government with assistance from international and national consultants.          </p> <p>1.2            <strong>Statement of the Problems  </strong></p> <p>A diagnostic study conducted in 2001 in to the state of federal government public procurement revealed that Nigeria may have lost trillions of naira over the last two decades because of flagrant abuse of procedures for the award of public contracts, inflation of contracts costs, lack of transparency, lack of competence based competition and merit as the fundamental criteria for the award of public contracts. The finding of the study made it imperative that the country urgently reform its procurements system, if the country is to reduce the large scale corruption and waste that had reduced the efficiency of the Nigeria public sector</p> <p>Most organization lost a lot of money annually through all kind of manipulation of the procedure for the award of contracts and supply of materials. </p> <p>Ministries and government agencies has been facing difficulties in the award of contract due to lack of due process in the agencies. </p> <p>Federal government preferment act on the accountability of procurement officers in public sector is a vital tool in any fine-tuning organization either service or profit oriented organization. But it has been observed that its importance and role which can lead to efficiency had not yet been appreciated in most Nigeria ministries today. </p> <p>1.3            <strong>Objective of the Study </strong></p> <p>The main rational of this study is to appraise the procurement act and its impact on the accountability of officers in public sector.</p> <p>These objectives are as follows:</p> <p>-              To evaluate the procurement act as it relates to providing fair opportunities to suppliers through bidding in a competitive environment for all government business. </p> <p>-              To evaluate the contributions /impact of the act towards reducing and eliminating corruption in the procurement process and earn the respect of the public and supplier. </p> <p>-              To examine the contribution of the act toward Quality control and assurance   </p> <p>-              To evaluate the contributions of the procurement act towards budget monitoring and control.     </p> <p>1.4            <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research work will critically concern with the impact of procurement act on the accountability of procurement officers in public sector which is essential things in the government ministries for the award of public contract.

This is because the quality assurance effort cooperatively mounted by the purchaser and supplier has resulted in outstanding quality performance and reliable supporting supplier generated records. </p> <p>However not all organizations have reached this enviable goal, examining some of the more common ideas surrounding inspection and quality control is useful conversely. Adequate drafting or written of specification of materials to be delivered by suppliers is not always a guaranteed to ensure quality material in an organization there is need for the inspection of materials coming into the organization to ensure that supplier provides materials that conform to the quality expected. </p> <p>The purpose of inspection is to ensure that supplier has delivered item that corresponds to the organizational specification or description of the organizational product or services, their product and services must be watched with care until they have get to prove themselves dependable. </p> <p>Unfortunately, two production methods skills even of established supplier change from time to time. Operators becomes careless, errors are made and occasionally a seller may try to reduce production costs to the point where quality suffers. Thus, for a variety of reasons, if is poor policy for buying organization to neglect inspection methods or procedures. Therefore, the verification of the quality of incoming materials is an important task by any concerned in order to ensure quality materials and also to provide the customer service required level.</p> <p>1.2            <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Apparently, in the market, there had been increased in the number of substandard items or products ranging from organizational goods to the consumers goods, therefore, the reasons for that is total negligence upon inspection which automatically result to many substandard products found way into production process and warrant to poor quality products in the market.</p> <p>In consideration of the money spent on materials acquisition, inspection is very vital. The researcher observed that in many organizations purchasing and supply aim that is responsible for acquisition of materials has not been given the right to exercise their profession that will take care of inspection, for that we can see procurement activities has been snatched from the procurement officers by other officers of different background at all levels, such backgrounds include: account, marketing, human resources, management, engineering, architecture, medical line, even social development.</p> <p>It was also observed that in many organizations the decision for inspection of coming materials into firms has been left to man by the functional staff of many of these firms, which the research believed to be bad practice, because this function is very critical and the decision to inspect materials purchased by many concern should be made by the top management cadre of the organization in order to formulate good policy and strategic decision to enhance quality production.</p> <p>1.3            <strong>Purpose of the Study </strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to examine the use of raw materials inspection and its impact on quality of production in Nigeria bottling company. The study is set out specifically to:</p> <p>                   i.                        To highlight the methods of raw materials inspection and its impact on quality of production in Nigeria bottling company. </p> <p>                 ii.                        To identify the function responsible for inspection in Nigeria bottling company. </p> <p>              iii.                        To identify the extend to which inspection helped the organization in achieving quality production. </p> <p>              iv.                         To determine how quality of raw materials affect production process.</p> <p>1.4            <strong>Significance of the Study </strong></p> <p>This research work is centered on impact of raw material inspection on quality production in Nigeria Bottling Company (NBC) Kaduna plant. Therefore, the research study will be of benefit to the organization and other organizations in Nigeria as a whole. </p> <p>The study will also be of great benefit to students, executives, and also the researcher, management field and entire population. </p> <p>The organization will benefit from the research work, because the study will explain in details the reason why inspection should be taken with utmost consideration and the significance they stand to benefit on inspection, if employed for the control of quality. </p> <p>It will also bring to the executives of the organization notice the function of purchasing and supply management i.e. procurement department. It will also guide to know what inspection is and its impact on ensuring quality in an organization.

The technique certainly has more effect if applied in the right place and at the right time. </p> <p>Apparently in many organization, it is clearly to see organization be it manufacturing holding different number of types, size or grade of a product that can perform the same function, this means duplication of items, the cost of materials is the last remaining cost that is truly variable, a reduction in the cost of material clearly offers on usual opportunity for profit improvement, therefore the need for purchasing to minimize  waste and enhance maximum services within the organization has resulted in the use of variety reduction. Variety reduction can make a substantial savings in inventory by standardizing and rationalizing the range of materials, parts and component kept in store. Variety reduction can be achieved by using, so far as possible, standardized components and subassemblies to make end products that are dissimilar in appearance and performance so that variety of final products uses only a few basic components, variety reduction can also be applied when considering capital purchases, by ensuring compatibility with existing machinery, the range of spares carried to ensure against breakdowns can be substantially reduced also variety reduction can be undertaken periodically to examine arrange of stock items to determine </p> <p>the intended use for each item of stock, how many stock item serve the same purpose, the extent to which items having the same purpose can be gives a standard description, what range of sizes is essential and lastly what items can be eliminated all these are done to ensure effective material control. Therefore, variety reduction can be defined as “the process of reducing the number of types, size or grades of a product that are purchase made or stocked (Hassan 2008 p. 445).</p> <p>1.2             <strong>Statement of Problems</strong></p> <p>Among the objectives of all private sector is to maximize profit and reduce costs. These objectives can be achieved in material control aspect of the organization by imploring a strategy that will help or ensure that the number of types, sizes or grades of a product held in the organization are not duplicated when purchased, this will help in investing minimum cost on materials. But is quite unfortunate that these objectives are rarely achieved as a result of non recognition of the role of variety reduction in an organization as a tool for effective material control.</p> <p>Variety reduction is the process used to describe standardization and simplification where different items that are capable of performing the same function are carried in large quantities, variety reduction is required but hardly did any organization take cognizance of this vital function as a tool for effective material control, as a result many organizations continue to hold materials, parts, items that are similar and capable of performing the same function this affect the material control unit of the organization efficiency be holding excess stock.</p> <p>Variety reduction helps to reduce the number of varieties in the store, it also help to stipulate suitability of purpose, reduce the stock held and its associated cost another importance of variety reduction is to establish datum as a basis for development, but despite all these importance of variety reduction to an organization the researcher observed that most organization lost foresight of this important function that required a proactive approach for better control of materials held in an organization.</p> <p>Also variety reduction assist the organization in avoiding buying different types of item that can serve the purpose, quicker and effective stock taking, reduce obsolete, overhead cost, it also facilitate easier inspection due to product uniformity and easier stock control and less storage space required, in view of all these benefits of variety reduction to an organization, the researcher observed that hardly can any organization show a unit or professionals bestowed with the responsibility of performing this vital function as a result many of these benefits are not derived by organizations.</p> <p>1.3             <strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of embarking on this research work by the researcher is to determine the effect of variety reduction on materials control.</p> <p>Specifically, the research work is set out;</p> <p>-                     To determine the areas covered by variety reduction in an organization is, Nigeria Bottling Company Plc Kaduna.</p> <p>-                     To determine stages of variety reduction that can facilitate the organization’s operational efficiency. </p> <p>-                     To determine if the benefit of variety reduction can minimize cost in the organization.</p> <p>-                     To determine if the reasons for variety reduction can improve quality production in the organization.</p> <p>-                     To determine why variety reduction should be control through                                                    the importance attached to variety reduction.</p> <p>1.4             <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will bring to light the effect of variety reduction on materials control in Nigeria Bottling Company Plc Kaduna plant.</p> <p>The study will also be of great benefit to potential investors, those in academics, other researcher in business management fields and the entire populace.</p> <p>The significance of the research work to the organization is to provide them with relevant information on how important variety reduction is in facilitating organizational efficiency, productivity and materials control and also to change their orientation in terms of how best to manage, maintain and handle their material or inventory level and this will also be applicable to other industries that is into production activities.</p> <p>The study will also be of immense benefit to the potential investors, in the sense that it will provide them with freehand information on how important variety reduction is in promoting material flow. In the academics, the research work can stand as a study material and reference book they can consult to broaden their knowledge on what it meant by variety reduction.</p> <p>The research work will also serve as a reference book to the other researcher on this type of project topic. To the entire populace, come across this research work, the research work will provide them with the knowledge on how important variety reduction is to an organization and it will also add value to their knowledge.</p> <p>The research work is embarked on by the researcher to broaden and ad value to his knowledge on variety reduction on materials control.</p> <p>Lastly, the research work is also a requirement in fulfillment for the award of Higher National Diploma in Purchasing and Supply Department of Kaduna Polytechnic.</p> <p>1.5             <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research work is based on variety reduction as a tool for effective material control.

Stores accounting and safety is one of the important areas of concern in stores management as a result of the need to protect the company’s huge investment is stock. All goods must have value to a company else they should not have been in stock.<br/>According to Morrison (1967:9) if stock is to be adequately safe-guard, it must be properly located in secure building or stock yards to which unauthorized must be made for the custody of store house keys and accounting precautions exercised during non working hours to ensure maximum accounting. Data (1986 :17) states that “ materials must be properly safe-guard and kept under proper accounting and vigilance.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></em><br/>Accounting has been identified as one of the most important activities carried out in any organization. This is because materials is the life blood of an industry.<br/>Materials constitute money and have been bought to meet certain needs, in order to ensure that these materials meet the needs for which they were bought and to avoid unnecessary cash loss arising from losing of materials due to ineffective accounting which therefore, affect the profit margin of the organization with this development every organization has realized the need to invest in accounting. This is so for any profit oriented organization.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>Accounting is one of the most important aspect of store management. Accounting of stores in a broad sense covers not only theft and fraud but it extends to areas of stock deterioration , damage location and special storage requirement. Organization may decide to seek the services of professional accounting outfit that supply a trained team of accounting guards and other personnel to guard against theft.<br/>However, he recommend that the effort time and expenditure of money should be proportionate and relative to the importance of the materials and that of accounting must be commensurate with the benefits which may occur from accounting measures.<br/>The role of store accounting is very important which according to carter and price (1993:10) reflect both the value of stock and its operational role within the organization. They added that stock record becomes meaningless as a means of stock control if stock is lost and not recorded. The calculated level of stock indicated by the stock card will bear no resemblance to the actual stock hold. Production operation will highly be hampered if the stores accounting functions are not properly and effectively carried out. The basis store accounting function is that of holding stock thus the need for proper stock control becomes imperative.<br/>According to Marrison (1987:9) said that stock control involves activities designed towards the effective management and control of all inventory item held in stock. Stock represent a major part of the organizational working capital or money , therefore any stock cost because of theft fraud of damage will have to be replaced which will increase the organization costs and reduce its profit. The value of stock cost every year is impossible to calculate hence, the figure must run into billion of naira to which must be added the loss of profit and revenue arising from production hold ups and lost contracts.<br/>Good store accounting will therefore real definite financial reward for the organization. In occupying out this project therefore, an attempt is being made to pinpoint the factors that hinders them effectively on stores .<br/>Accounting aimed at rendering effective services to the user department and therefore by achieving the organization objectives. Unama Nigeria limited was incorporated in October 1982 as a private limited liability company. The company is located at old Nekede Owerri West Imo State. The company with indigenous and is owned by numerous shareholders including former East Central states, it is a unique joint stock company . it is made up of six departments namely: administration finance, stores, production , maintenance and internal audit departments. The company is a paper co wrapper, waxing , sheeting of papers and production of progress over the years and has now embarked on a programme of diversification and expansion as a result of research an search and finally settled on paper milling. The paper is ideal as for now all papers will produce the types of papers available. The paper is known as bleached kraft” while others are sourced locally such as toilet roll care, tambourines and printing ink. The company has various machines which performs different works example printing machines, cutting machine, waxing machine, sheeting machine, toilet log machines , core making machine and sheeting machine.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>In recent times several companies in Nigerian have reported loss of materials through explosion fire hazard and avoidable accidents. All these hazards have greatly affected operation in these organization . it has further affected staff and management of these organization. In view of the enormous resources in terms of money and materials, lost in such incidents these has been cause for better accounting in the day to day running of industries. Specifically, this study will focus on the following .<br/>The problem of accounting as stores hours. The problem of accounting as per stock yard. Problem of accounting as per stores personnel how stores accounting affect the profit of the organization.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The aim of this study is to identify the stores accounting lapses already existing in the organization and how it affect the profitability of the organization as it concerns the store house method of stores . accounting operation and materials handling . also this study will attempt to find out accounting lapse within the stock yard. It is also the objective of this study to find out the accounting needs of the company particularly as it concern materials and personnel in stores.<br/>Furthermore, one of the objective of this study is to find out stores accounting required for finished goods in the warehouses. These will involve good in the accounting needs of the company with specific reference to the materials stocked by the company such as inflammable materials , example fuel, diesel and alcohol. The study will also cover the area of provision of equipment to safeguard materials such as stock document like ledger, stock cards etc.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>In this study the focus was to establish the role of stores accounting in the profitability of an organization. The population comprises of staff of various section of Unsama paper mill Nigeria. A total of one hundred participants were used. The study looked at the consequences of stores accounting towards profitability of an organization and how stores accounting should be run in order to attract profitability or an organization .</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</em></strong><br/>It is necessary to establish some research question that will serve as a guide to the study.<br/>These question would later be transferred to research hypothesis. The research hypothesis. The research questions are:<br/>To what extent does stores accounting affect the administration of the organization. <br/>To what extent do stores personnel activities affect the growth of the organizations.<br/>To what extent does stores management affect the profit making of the organization.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The result of this study may be of use of the following group of people;<br/>The result will be of help to Unama paper mill to enable the organization know the importance of store accounting and how its enhances the profit of the organization.<br/>It will help to better way of conducting stores accounting and has contributed to the profit making of the organization.<br/>Finally, it is hope that the result obtained from this study shall be of immense benefit to the government and to the literate public who may stumble on this work and this would discover how stores accounting enhances profit making in an organization.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>One of the major constraints of this study was lack of finance to go around collecting data from the respondents. In addition, some workers in the organization were afraid to give accurate information for fear of victimization . again, it was not possible to go through all the document concerned because some documents were classified as secret document and therefore were meant for any other persons consumption. The researcher was disappointed to note the were very few books from which to draw reference.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS</em></strong><br/>1.

Inventory is defined as “An idle resource of any kinds that possesses economic values, and is classified in many ways thus: production inventories like raw materials, parts and components which enter the firm’s product in the production process. MRO inventories that is maintenance, repair and operating supplies which are consumed in the production process but which do not become part of the product, in process inventories, that is semi-finished products found at various stages in the production operation and lastly finished goods which are ready for shipment. <br/>These inventories require high cost and investment commitments. Most businessmen view inventories and their attendant cost as “necessary evil” hence failing to asses carefully the benefits afforded their company or business by the existence of the inventory.<br/>In a manufacturing company where these inventories are handled, the introduction of a well-planned and effective system or means of controlling these inventories is necessary for profitability and accountability to both the management and shareholders of the company whose interest, objective and aims under which the company or business was established must be protected. It is on this basis that the researcher chose the project topic relevant to manufacturing companies in Nigeria and with Akaraka Industries Nigeria Limited in mind.<br/>In choosing this very topic, the researcher is not claiming any authority in the subject matter neither is he of the view that the topic is over flogged by other researchers. Rather, he is of the view that the topic should be related to present day happenings in the economy, an approach he adopted in the project work.<br/>The project work has been divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the introduction of the approach.<br/>Chapter two is a review of related literature on both the general economy and how it has affected the operation of Akaraka Industries Nigeria limited.<br/>Chapter three outlines the methodology and procedure used in gathering the data.<br/>Chapter four deals with analysis of data which simple percentage frequency was used and chapter five is the summary of the work, the conclusion and recommendation. </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>Advancement in all business activities has brought about the need for efficient inventory management and control. For the past decade inventories were handled by a clerk in a routine manner. But in recent times proper attention has been given to it. As a matter of fact, a well planned and effectively controlled inventory can contribute substantially to the organization’s growth and efficiency. Inventory control is a vital element in the management of materials.<br/>However, before delving into this plight, it is appropriate to give the definition of inventory control.<br/>According to Baily [1983:73] inventory control is the means by which materials of the correct quantity is made available as and when required, with due regard to economy in storage and ordering cost, purchase price and use of working capital. It involves the following processes.<br/>[a] Accessing the items to be held in stock <br/>[b] Deciding the extent of stock holding of items individually and collectively.<br/>[c] Regulating the input of stock into the storehouses.<br/>[d] Regulating the issue of stock from the storehouses.<br/>Therefore, through these process, it is possible to adjust continuously the quantity and value of inventory held to confirm to circumstance at all times.<br/>The functionary name given to the activities in the stores is known as inventory control or stock control. The inventory controller or stock controller takes custody of the day to day movement of stocks.<br/>Inventory procedure includes receipt, storekeeping, issue and balance of stocks. In practice, the three major functions involve the overall activities that take place in the stores.<br/>Some of the activities are: communication with other department, identification of stores, receipt and inspection, issue and dispatch, stock records, stores accounting, stock control, stock taking and stock checking, storage of equipment and so on.<br/>Inventory control is the clerical control of the movement of goods into and out of the stores, and of the level of inventories in the stores. Different inventory records are kept to know when inventories fell to minimum, maximum inventory level, and re-order point. The success or failure of any organization depends largely on efficient system of their inventory control, since inventory control is regarded as a procedure in which appropriate system containing information are fed to various department for recording or action.<br/>Actually different systems are operated in different organizations in controlling their inventories. Some of these systems work out well while others failed in their purposes. These systems and other relevant point will be discussed fully in the next chapter.<br/>The researcher could not close the general introduction without giving a brief historical background of the company he is researching on. <br/>Akaraka Industries Nigeria Limited [AINL] was incorporated as a private limited liability company in 1994 under the companies’ allied matters Act of 1990. The company is an industrial/Agro-chemical industry located at Oboama Enyiogugu Aboh Mbaise along Owerri Umuahia road. It has her head office at 186 wetheral road Owerri and her factory at Mbaise in Imo State Nigeria.<br/>It was formed mainly to process solid minerals as industrial chemicals and production started with a capacity of 144 tones per day using two machines at its factory in Mbaise along Owerri – Umuahia road. Each machine has a rated capacity of 3 tones per hour and is capable of pulverizing solid minerals to a more scale of hardness not exceeding 7 and humidity below 6 percent.<br/>The grain size of finished products from the pendulum pulverize may be adjusted in the range of 0.125mm to 0.44mm [equivalent to 120 to 320 mesh per inch] according to customers requirements or specification.<br/>The staff strength of Akaraka Industries Nigeria Limited is about 325 with 75 percent of the total workforce coming from the immediate community.<br/>All raw materials of Akaraka Industries Nigeria Limited are naturally as sedimentary metamorphic and igneous rocks in millions of tones.<br/>Her product range includes:<br/>[i] KAOLIN: Used as filler in plastic, rubber [tyre] and paints manufacture filler in papermaking for making porcelain [crucibles] and ceramics [china wares] and in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.<br/>[ii] CALCITE: Used as raw materials for manufacture of paints, soap, plastic, cosmetics, adhesives etc, as raw materials in the chemicals, glass and cellulosic industry. It is also use for smelting of iron ore and could be crushed and used as granite for roads and concrete as a flux [coke] in melting of iron and melting steel. Manufacture of cement, detergents, soda, lime, glass, artificial fertilizer etc.<br/>[iii] DOLOMITE: Used in the manufacture of paints, toothpaste, cement and lime. It is also used for building, as ornamental stone and as magnesium ore for the production of magnesium.<br/>[iv] DIATOMITE: Used as a filter to remove impurities in breweries and discoloration from liquids as an abrasive to polish soft materials as an absorbent in the production of dynamite when mixed with nitroglycerine.<br/>[v] FELDSPAR: Used in pottery for making porcelain, in making enamel wares, glass, artificial teeth, in the manufacture of fertilizer and for architectural decorations.<br/>[vi] BARYTE: Used mainly in drilling of crude oil and in paint manufacturing. It is also used for pyrotechnics and for protection against x-rays, as flux in brass meeting, as inter filler in the oil cloth manufacture, linoleum paper and plastic, as a weighing material for textiles and leather.<br/>[vii] GYPSUM: Use for manufacture of plaster of Paris [POP] for soil conditioning for cosmetics and pharmaceutical manufacture as a retarded in Portland cement production, as an extender for paint, as a distributor in insecticides and can also be used as filler for paper.<br/>[viii] TALCUM: Used in cosmetics, soap electric cables, ceramics, paints and crayon manufacture.<br/>[ix] AKACLEAN: Used as a souring power<br/>[x] BONACREAM: Used in cosmetics manufacture and for treatment of keloid.<br/>[xi] AKACREAM: Used as after share and for treatment of general skin infection.<br/>The finished products are usually packaged in 50kg bags but can be bagged in jumbo sack if the need arises.<br/>As a result of increased efforts on research and development, the quality of the company’s chemicals ranks the best in the country and very suitable for export.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>Inventory control and stores management functions have not been fully understood and carried out by many manufacturing organizations.<br/>It is this general assumption that made the researcher to take up the study of how Akaraka Industries Nigeria Limited, Aboh Mbaise operate theirs, to see if there is a difference or differences from the general assumption.<br/>The researcher is not just out to identify the problems or differences but most importantly to device alternative source within the organizational constraints and yet accomplish the set objectives.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The researcher’s reasons in undertaking the study of the inventory management and control in manufacturing organizations taking a case study of Akara Industries Nigeria Limited, Aboh Mbaise are numerous.<br/>The choice is aimed at representing all other manufacturing companies and to attribute the findings to other institutions and organizations.<br/>A well-planned and effectively controlled inventory can contribute substantially to a firm’s profit because inventories are the life-wire of all organizations. It is however necessary to visualize the purpose of this research as follows:<br/>1. To ensure correct quality of stock required.<br/>2. To ensure constant supply and flow of material to the operations.<br/>3. To ensure that the materials are available at the correct time they are needed.<br/>4. To ensure a continuous or steady supply of information for control of production about what to produce in order to keep established level of the organization finished stock.<br/>5. Control of obsolescence of stock ensuring that all stocks held by the organization are being used at a regular rate and therefore have not been superseded by a new or redesigned item.<br/>The success of the company as a manufacturing one has a great influence on the researcher to know the secret behind this success, since inventory control is concerned with the success over failure of any company.<br/>The loopholes to be filled in the management of stores and inventory need to be taken care of.<br/>The researcher feels that through this medium he can suggest the right professional techniques suitable for stores and inventory management and control in all sectors of the economy.<br/>Review of contributors towards the situation of the case study will be narrated to see the attitude of the nation and individuals towards this discipline.<br/>Finally this study will help the organization to recognize the problems and how to resolve them.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The researcher found it impossible to cover many manufacturing organization in this study so he focused his investigation on Akaraka Industries Nigeria Limited, Aboh Mbaise, Imo State Nigeria as a case study.<br/>The researcher however bases his findings on this study and would relate them to other industries in the same area of activities.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION</em></strong><br/>The study will center its findings on the following questions.<br/>1. What is the role and place of stores department in the organization?<br/>2. Is inventory well managed in the organization?<br/>3. Are professionals employed to handle stores?<br/>4. What are the receiving and issue procedure employed in the organization or store?<br/>5. What system of inventory or stock control is adopted?<br/>6. How are scraps, waste, obsolete and redundant materials managed?</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</em></strong><br/>In order to achieve the objective of the study, research hypothesis will be developed and used in the analysis of data collected. The research hypotheses are:<br/>1. Ho: The inventory control of the received stock items in the industry is not effective.<br/>HA: The inventory control of the received stock item in the industry is effective.<br/>2. Ho: The inventory control has no significant impact on purchasing performance in Akaraka Industries.</p> <p>HA: The inventory control has significant impact on purchasing performance in Akaraka Industries.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The research will serve as a useful guide to manufacturing organization on effective control and management of inventories which form the life blood of their set up.<br/>The research work will be a reference material for researchers on how to manage and control inventories in an industry.<br/>It is however the researcher’s belief that the information gathered from this research will help the employers and employees of Akaraka Industries [Nig] Ltd to know whether their method of inventory control procedure are effective or not.<br/>The reader might benefit from considering inventory control in manufacturing organizations as he perceives it in his own environment.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The research is limited to Akaraka Industries Nigeria Ltd. It was not easy to get most heads of departments and supervisors on seat while some of those seen were reluctant to open up. Nevertheless, I am grateful to the very few who not only made data available to me but also provide some useful guidelines and critics.<br/>Scarcity of reference materials in the country really affected the smooth work of the project. Most of the text books in the library were out dated so finding and locating items becomes a problem. Materials required from the library were difficult to get, the librarian kept on giving promises of come today, come tomorrow at the end disappointing the researcher.<br/>Unavailability of adequate finance was another major limitation. The researcher could not attain the desired scope and depth as a result of this financial handicap.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</em></strong><br/>1.

Despite, there is also improvement in areas like decision making regarding the stock-taking and ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the organization book and other operation as basic for service to management.<br/>The operation undertaken by special designed staff. Organization stock-taking in Nigeria is mainly concerned with the meaning of organization stock-taking in Nigeria. From the analysis of the above question and interview; it has been statistically established that, there is a positive relationship between the awareness of the organization stock position at all times and the enhancement of managerial decision.<br/>It should be therefore, be identical that the primary responsibility at the impact of stock-taking in an organization with the particular reference to total Nigeria Limited; which deals with the introduction, statement of problems, research question, objectives of the study, significant of the study scope and limitations etc.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION </strong></em><br/>The purpose of this is to look at the need to maintain high standard of audit work. The purchasing may be held liable for negligence because the law requires one purchasing to care, diligence and skill as is reasonably necessary in a particular circumstances, where an organization of person suffers loss or damage as a result of the failure of an purchasing to discharge the fiduciary duty imposed on him by law they may be liable for negligence and an action for negligence may be instituted against him in court of law. To ensure that quality of audit work is still high, he should then establish a means at maintaining the jobs on his behalf. In this case of purchasing and stock-taking practitioners, these are faced with many pressures form clients to maintain their fee levels or even reduce them. This may not be unconnected with the present economic condition in the country, which is hard on almost all business organization, in most companies; unlike the case study of this project “on organization” the stock-taking firms are made to perform both the purchasing and stock-taking functions for the same fee”<br/>In this study, we will discuss the meaning of audit management reason for audit management, its objectives and stage such as planning of audit, recording and control. The purchasing operational standard states that, the purchasing should satisfy him as to the quality of work established adequate control procedures. The control procedure will include proper allocation of staff of appropriate ability, proper briefing of staff and review of the work done by others.<br/>There are also improvement in areas like decision making regarding the assets and ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the organization’s books. Even though it is not the duty of the purchasing to take check, he should satisfy himself as to the validity of the amount attributed to the assets in the accounts which are the subject of the audit in determine the nature and extent of the audits steps necessary for its purposes, it was found that the purchasing examined the system of organization control in order to access its effectiveness relative to the ascertainment and evaluation of stock.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THIS STUDY </em></strong><br/>Stock taking has been traced to the Ancient Egyptian Civilization as demonstrated in their Ancient wall paintings. The utilities of the early purchasing were also recovered in the writing of ancient Roman Empire.<br/>Stock taking came in to existence since men bargain to enter into contractual relationship with one another. This is because there was always the desire to establish the accuracy and reliability if the records and results of such relationships to the satisfaction of all the parties to a contracted relationship would engage a neutral person to check the records of their transaction and real his findings to their learning. This methods is associated social club etc, various effort have these effort were too simple thereby excluding some essential information while others ended up being confusing.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS </em></strong><br/>Another problem encountered in this central on the absence of the organization purchasing. Purchasing in the office due to some circumstances that led outside office due numerous tours their expectation are lectures, cut off. The extensively with issues relating to the history and nature of stock taking, lectures two will discuss mater relating his expected roles in an enterprise where he act as an purchasing. Since our major concern in these lectures is the statutory purchasing matters relating to him are adequately covered by the companies and Allied matters Decree (CAMA) in 1990 is as follows:<br/>First appointment the first director of a New organization can make the first appointment before the first Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the organization where the first Directors made the appointment, the shareholder are at liberty to either ratify the appointment or reject it as the power to appoint the purchasing to resides with the shareholders. But where the shareholder intends to reject a purchasing appointed by the directors, they must given fourteen days noticed to the directors.<br/>Subsequent appointment by this, the purchasing of any organization are appointed are the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to hold offices from the conclusion of the next meeting of the organization.<br/>A retiring purchasing shall be re-appointed to continue in officer without passing any resolution except:<br/>He is disqualified from re-appointment of the Annual General Meeting (AGM)<br/>A resolution appointing another purchasing or dropping the retiring purchasing has been properly passed. The organization has received notice of his unwillingness to continue in office.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTION </em></strong><br/>It is necessary to establish some research question that will serve as a guide to the study. This question would later be transferred to research hypothesis.<br/>The research questions are:<br/>1. To what extent does stock taking affect the administration of the organization.<br/>2. To what extent does stock taking affect the profitability of the organization.<br/>3. To what extent do stock personnel activities affect the growth of the organization.<br/>4. To what extent does stock personnel activities affects the growth of the organization.<br/>5. To what extent does stock management affect the profit making of the organization.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>Purchasing to the case study of this project “Total Oil Nigerian Limited headed in Rivers State”. The continuous growth of private companies in Rivers State of Nigeria and the strategic position. These companies occupy in the Nigerian economy laid the basic foundation for this research work. Opinions expressed by management authorities shown that, the adequate uses of the manpower of an organization are a major contributor to the success of such organization. This work therefore investigates the different leadership styles adopted by the purchasing of the private companies to edict the optimal performance of their work force.<br/>To ensure that the organizational goals and objectives of private companies are attained, purchasing of the various capacities are appointed by they directors of the companies and these purchasing stand in central positions in relation to others members of staff or other employees of the companies. The manages of the companies, who are leader of their work crew, are usually vested with the authority, are their functions and duties which they executive through the organization structure. Leader or objectives of this study refers to appointed purchasing and supervisor, who have been given authority and power to administer with work crew and those. Objectives is to achieve the overall organization in achieving the organization goals, the purchasing of the companies must harness the crew work.<br/>The various leadership style adopted by purchasing in private companies and effect of these style on subordinates performance. The purpose of this study is to examine the various leadership styles adopted by the purchasing in private limited companies and the input of such styles on subordinates.<br/>This study therefore is intended to survey the various leadership styles employed by the purchasing of selected private limited companies in Rivers State and which of these leadership style prove most effective.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The importance of this study is of two field, in the first place, since total oil Nigeria limited is a commercial organization there is a need to know its, organization stock-taking system and how it has helped the efficient of the purchasing records. <br/>Secondary; this study will also add to the advancement of enfoldment in the fields of organization stock-taking in the research of significance, at least the followings areas.<br/>The study will also indicate to sue the audit steps relating to stock-taking observation of the purchasing, which will cover three stages such as:<br/>Before stock-taking <br/>During stock taking and <br/>After stock-taking <br/>The study will be immense academic to students and researcher in purchasing, especially in the area of stock –taking because the guiding will be provide the, with empirical evidence on the issue and a good basic for hypothesis for future studies in this area.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>Since this study had reviewed the organization stock-taking in companies the investigation carried out by the research covered only total oil Nigeria limited, which was used as a case study. The major problem of social research is that of conviction of the officials take as specimen. However, one needs a lot of explanation and persuasion to get the cooperation of such respondents. So, having death with the project and assessed the extend of the work involved in the study, was confronted with such problem ranging from lack of;<br/>The result of this study many be of use of the following group of people;<br/>1. The result will be of help to unama paper mill to enable the organization know the importance stock-taking and how its enhances the profit of the organization.<br/>2. It will help to better way of conducting stock-taking and has contributed the profit making of the organization.<br/>3. Finally, it is hope that the result obtain from this study shall be of immense benefit to the government, and to the literate public who may stumble on this work and this would discover how stock-taking enhance profit making in an organization.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>One of the major constraints of this study was lack of finance to go around collecting data from the respondents in addition, some worker in the organization were afraid to give accurate information for fear of victimization again, it was not possible to go through all the documents concerned because some documents were classified as “secret document” and therefore were meant for any other person’s consumption.<br/>The researcher was disappointed to note the ere very fee books from which to draw reference.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS </em></strong><br/>To ensure a proper understanding of what the terms is all about, some unfamiliar words to those who are not in the same field are defined as they are appear in the project. This is also beneficial to those groups of people who might make this study.

This project work is divided into five chapters, chapter one deals with the introduction, chapter two is a view of related literature on both the general economy and how it has affected the operations of Unilever Nigeria Plc Lagos.<br/>The chapter three outline the methodology and procedure used in gathering the data. Chapter the last chapter five is recommendation summary and conclusion.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></em><br/>The functions of warehouse management is to provide cost effective storage, in a suitable condition for the organization’s products and materials to enhance effective rendering of customer services. The existence of a warehouse is justified by the extend to which it contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of physical distribution functions.<br/>The geographical location of a warehousing operation should be determined by production sites and the physical position of target markets. However, in some developing countries as Nigeria, political conditions have some times over ride economic arguments and facilities such as warehouse, go downs, assembly areas and buying points for the government organization have been sub-optimally sited. Warehouse managers have a number of important challenges which include, determination of most appropriate unit loads optimizing space utilization, reducing the movement of labour, equipment and product/materials to minimum, establishing a safe, secure warehousing environment and keeping cost to minimum.<br/><br/><em><strong>1.1 GENERAL OVERVIEW </strong></em><br/>An earlier resource pack described the decisions that must be taken when a company organizes a channel or network of intermediaries who take responsibility for the management of goods as they move from the producer to the consumer. According to Piasacki (1978), initially a system to control movement and storage of warehouse management system (WMS) is expanding to including light manufacturing, transportation management, order management and complete accounting system. To use the grand father of operation, material requirement planning, (MRP) as a comparison, material requirement. Planning started as a manufacturing environment. What is clear is that the expansion of the over lap in functionality between warehouse management system and other functional area in physical distribution of goods from the producer to the consumer. Even through warehouse management contributes to gain added functionality, the initial core functionality of a ware house management system has not changed. The primary purpose of a warehouse management system is to control the movement and storage of material within an operation and process the associated transactions. The detailed set up and processing within a warehouse management system in my area of case study Unilever Nigeria Plc Aba, varies significantly from one material render to another, however the basic logic will use a combination of item, location quantity, unit of measure and order information to determine where to stock, where to pick and in what sequence to perform these operations.<br/><br/><em><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></em><br/>Manufactures of consumer products different types face the problem of getting their products to various market locations all over the country. The use of warehouses and intermediaries only distribute the products to the near by market place or states. Some rural areas where distributing warehouse could be located have no access roads. Other problems associated with this study are those of ineffective handling and storage of materials (goods) in the various warehouses, poor control of the movement of materials exist both from the manufacturing warehouse and their deport warehouses located at different strategic areas. Another problem is their ability of managing the material goods in the warehouse in order to identity the expired goods and avoid mixing them up with the normal ones. Supply of goods to the various warehouse to meet customer demand are sometimes delay, as a result of poor scheduling of vehicles. The concept of warehouse management system in some organization to day has not being properly implemented to gain the adequate measure of increasing customer service.<br/><br/><em><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>The objective of the study is now apparent having clearly started the problems. Therefore the prime objectives are: <br/>i. To ascertain the reason goods are not available in some warehouse located outside.<br/>ii. To determine the degree of effectiveness and efficiency to which warehouse management approach has been adopted in this industry.<br/>iii. To examine the type of staff involved in the various warehouse management activities in the industry.<br/>iv. To identify the contribution of warehouse management to profit ability of this organization as a whole.<br/><br/><em><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>It is imperative that the importance and validity of this research project be sufficiently stated. The importance of this research study is to provide a comprehensive and in depth study of warehouse management, exploring vast possibility through cost reduction and an avenue to identify various movement and storage at goods that have been practiced in a wrong perspective which have lead to inefficient management of storage and distribution of finished products in Unilever Plc. Furthermore, the study will prove and suggest different methods of developing reliable suppliers of the industry in order to cut short delivery delay as a result of production stoppage. More over, it is the mind of the researcher to highlight the implication of neglecting other functional unit that are related to warehouse such as stock control, purchasing and packaging which contributes adequately towards the achievement of physical distribution objectives.<br/><br/><em><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></em><br/>The research question is formulated in order to give precise direction to readers and other researchers and planners who may wish to research more on this topic and provide a base for the conclusion of this research work.<br/>1. What are the reasons for non-availability of goods in the outreach warehouse?<br/>2. What training scheme are available for warehouse management personnel?<br/>3. How does each warehouse function contribute to cost reduction and crease customer service in the organization?<br/>4. What are the possible methods to apply in developing reliable storage and distribution of goods to customers?<br/>5. How does transportation affects the functions of ware management.<br/><br/><em><strong>1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></em><br/>There are two forms of hypothesis, the null hypothesis (Ho) and the alternative hypothesis (Hi) assumption of the result of research project while the alternative denotes the positive assumption of the result.<br/>1. Ho: Effective warehouse management does not contribute to the profitability of the organization.<br/>2. Ho: Effective warehouse management does contribute to the profitability of the organization.<br/>1. Ho: warehouse management department does not ensure maintenance of goods in the warehouses.<br/>2. Ho: warehouse management department does ensure maintenance of goods in the warehouses.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This study is intended to cover Unilever Plc, Aba, particularly the warehouse department and its relationship with other functional department of physical distribution. The study embraces all the activities that are involved in the warehouse management such as, storage of goods, inventory control, distribution of finished goods, receipt and issuing, transportation of finished goods and other related activities.<br/>The areas of emphasis includes the importance of warehouse management and it contribution to the organization. The research is supposed to cover a wide range of Nigerian organization but due to financial problem, poor response and time constraint the researcher intends to use the notable organization in Nigeria like Unilever Nigeria Plc Aba.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>While carrying out this research, the researcher was confronted with a number of limitations which includes.<br/>1 FINANCIAL CONSTRIANT: This played yet a great part in limiting the researchers strength. With the present state of the economy militated to a large extend to the limitation of this project work, because a lot of money is required for project exercise.<br/>2 DEARTH OF MATERIALS: This project was also affected by in adequate material for research in libraries. This researcher could not go beyond this scope because of lack of adequate secondary data relevant to the area of study.<br/>3 TIME CONSTRIANT: This also created much limitations to the progress of this work. The time allocated for the work was not enough, and the researcher combined course work was not enough and the researcher combined course work with this research. Time sharing therefore become difficult.<br/>4 INADEQUATE INFORMATION: As a result of the situation in the country now, some of the workers do not wish to give the necessary information needed by the researcher for fear of competitors.<br/><br/><em><strong>1.9 OPERATION DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></em><br/>Individuals, association, communities, professional group attach meaning to their works according to their culture professional background. It is for this reason that the researcher make an attempt to clearly define the meaning of some terms use in the study.<br/>1.

PZ was first founded as a trading post called West African Merchants. In Sierra Leone by two partners, George Peterson from England and George Zochonics, from Greece, Peterson and Zochonics started out by shipping palm oil and other produce, such as palm kernels, cocoa, groundnut, and seed cotton as well as animals hides and skins to United Kingdom and bringing back goods from England such as cloths from Manchester. In 1884 Peterson and Zochonics incorporated the company as Paterson Zochonic (PZ). PZ was established in Nigeria by the year 1899 at Lagos later extended to other branches in the states. The company currently manufactures and distribute over 30 brands of products across its global network, such products like soaps and other personal care item, including shampoo, baby powder, detergents and cleaners, olive oil, packaging material, ever pharmaceuticals etc. PZ has maximum number of workers in various branches located especially Aba branch that has qualified staff that facilitates the organizational growth; they also have very good number of vehicle for easy distribution and conveying of the raw material for production. They also have good machine for steady production.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>Containerization is very essential and useful in the selling of industrial goods; hence it is often referred to as the nearest company’s salesman. There are existing problems associated with containerization on transports and distribution of industrial goods and services. Expanding system wide container capacity is extremely difficult. For one container flows involve a series of linked capacity factors derive by different stakeholders such as ports railroads, truck carriers and steamship lines. While on the surface the problem appears to be a direct application of goldratt’s theory of constraints (Goldratt 1997) and (ox 2004) there are complicating factors. Container flows may be identified as the drum (i.e. primary, pace setting) constraints, but their handling involves as series of linked factors controlled by the stakeholders. The further compounding the problems are unpredictable changes in security requirement terrorist activities, military deployment (Thomchick 1993) labour strikes and inclement weath.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>It is necessary to look or to identify the social and psychological past in order to appreciate what we are try to do in the present so as to do better in the future. The study will provide marketing opportunities challenges and prospects that exist for marketer to improve on their packaging through repeat purchases. The aim of this research survey is to:<br/>To examine maximize customer service while minimize.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The study will cover Aba, Abia State, Owerri and all eastern states in Nigeria and all company’s that make use of containerized product like PZ Plc that cover almost Nigerian market with their product. The study also covers their entire product consumer both in urban and rural areas. The study will therefore be limited to Aba consumers market.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION</em></strong><br/>This following are the research question, which this research work is set out to tackle. <br/>Does container have any effect on the buying pattern of the industrial users?<br/>What is the role of container with reference to price, quality and quantity?<br/>How does container affect the decision to buy by the users of PZ Plc product?<br/>Does container series as a competitive tool in the marketing of industrial product?<br/>Can container help to maximize profit in the company?<br/>Does container cost affect the total profit?</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 HYPOTHESIS</em></strong><br/>In conducting this research, the following hypothesis will be tested.<br/>1. Ho: The containerization of a product attract a buyer<br/>2. Ha: The containerization of a product does not attract a buyer</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The research study is very significant in that it will be immense benefit to students in the purchasing and supply management department and interested persons in related fields of study and work who are research minded. The research work indeed vary significant and a treasure chest for the research minded students and scholars because of the comprehensive nature of this investigative survey and realistic write-up. The study will certainly serve as a dependable reference guide for student in the purchasing and supply management department.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The limitation of this study includes:<br/>Inadequate financial and material resources with which to carry out such an elaborate production inability of the respondent i.e. those interviewed to give the relevant information on the variables under study, most importantly insufficient time for thorough work since the researcher still have to attained lectures for the completion of her course work. Lack of knowledge to some that were interviewed and reluctant of some staff to release information and co-operate with researcher.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</em></strong><br/>The definitions of terms for this project are:<br/>1. Containerization: Is an advancement of the concept of unit load. A container is a box with steel framework, a strong floor base, pouched sides and a root. Containers can equally be classified according to their sizes. We have the international standard organization (ISO) standard container of 8x8 fit. Containers vary with respect to length. The lengths are 10ft, 20ft and 40ft are used to suit a peculiar need.<br/>2. The distribution process: Begins when a supplier receives an order from a customer. The customer is not too concerned with the design of the supplier’s distributive system, nor in any supply problems.<br/>3. Order processing: The efficiency of order processing has a direct effect on lead times.<br/>Orders are received from the sales team through the sales department. Many companies’s established regular supply performs satisfactorily. Very often contract are drawn up and repeat orders (forming part of the initial contract) are made at regular intervals during the contract period.<br/>4. Inventory: Is a critical area of (PDM) because stock levels have a direct effect on levels service and customer satisfaction. The optimum stock level is a function of the type of market in which the company operates. Few companies can say that they never run out of stock, but it stock-out “happens regular, then market share will be lost to more efficient competitors”.<br/>Techniques of determining optimum stock level are illustrated later in this chapter.<br/>5. Transportation: Usually represent the greatest distribution cost. It is usually easy to calculate because it can be related directly to weigh or numbers of units. Costs must be carefully controlled through the mode of transport selected amongst alternatives, and these must be constantly viewed. During the past 50 years, road transport has become the dominant transportation mode in Nigeria. It has the advantage of speed couple with door-to-door delivery. The patterns of retailing that have developed, and the pressure caused by coin stock holding indispensable. Where the volume of goods being transported reaches a certain level, some companies as purchase their own vehicle rather than use the service of haulage contractors.<br/>6. Distance: This is the range cover on transportation while container is on shipment.<br/>7. The value of the goods: Freight rate is chargeable according to the value of the goods: this is because valuable item requires extra care attention and protection from damage and loss, hence it attracts higher premium from insurance companies. In the way bill preparation shippers are advised to make a declaration of the value of their shipment valuable items attract higher rate.<br/>8. Condition of the road: The prevailing road condition is similar to that of distance since bad roads know to consume more fuel and lubricants as well as high maintenance expenses. Bad roads attract high freight rates.<br/>9. The nature of the cargo shipped: Some cargoes are known to require the provision of extra-ordinary facilities to make its carriage safe. These goods are hazardous in nature as their carriage but both the vehicle and the operating crew in dangerous position throughout the trip. Some chemicals are corrosive while some are inflammable and require extra handling care and equipment. Freight rate for such shipment are high.<br/>10. Availability of return cargo: Promising a hauler of return cargo can induce acceptability of the contract as this helps in reducing the average operating expenses of each return ship. Availability of return cargo improve the capacity utilization of the vehicle and the productivity of the operating crew. Lower rates are therefore changeable where heavy traffic occurs at both ends of the trip.<br/>11. Availability of competing modes: Freight rates are known to be high where there is no effective competition among the transport modes. In Nigeria, the demise of the railway as a cost effective mode of cargo haulage gave the road trucking power to high rates of shipment at the slightest chances.<br/>12. Promotional rate: Planning to establish a new trucking may attract a low freight rate but the rate must be at a level that will guarantee the covering of the operating costs. The carriers firms normally use the promotional rate to create awareness for their services.<br/>13. Material handling: It is a means of supporting and simplifying production process and efficient distribution.<br/>14. Freight Forwarders: This provides important service in physical distribution and logistics. They do not operate with their own transportation facilities. The consolidate Less Than Car Load (LCL) or Less Than Truck Load (LTL) consignments from various slipper into Car Load (CL) or Truck Load for onward shipping at the benefit of themselves and their client.<br/>15. Carriage of goods: These occur when a company or a person carry goods on behalf of another company or person from one place to another with a consideration of payment for the service rendered. The person or company accepting to carry goods for another is regarded as the carrier and the one whose goods are being carried is the shipper who may either be the consignor or the consignee.<br/>16. Warehousing: Is a large centralized store, usually in a convenient location in relation to the market area to be served. The warehouse is basically designed to bridge any large gap between when goods are produced and when consumers require them.<br/>17. Scheduling: Is the process of effectively planning transport routes so that deliver of the require orders is carried out timely with minimum delays and cost possible.<br/>18. Routing: It involves scheduling vehicles to match as best as possible customers demand for delivery with the availability and capacity of vehicles and taking into account constraint such as early closing days, preferred delivery times, lorry access restriction etc.<br/>19. Piggyback: Here a tractor pulls the loaded trailer from plant to rail loading yard or tactic where the trailer is placed on flat platform of an open coal, which holds several trailers.<br/>20. Fish back (Roll on/Roll off) RORO is similar to piggyback except that it combines the use of truck and water carriers. The main objective is to reduce the extremely high cost of loading and unloading individually packaged items abroad ship.</p>\n\nIMPACT OF CONTAINERIZATION ON TRANSPORT AND DISTRIBUTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF CONTAINERIZATION ON TRANSPORT AND DISTRIBUTION", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This project is made up of five chapters which contains different information about the project. The importance of containerization as a marketing tool was examined with the aim of assessing its contributions towards the purchase of industrial products to carryout research work, a total of one hundred (100) industrial buyers were used as sample while case study was drawn from Okigwe road, Enugu, Agbani.<br/>To gather data, personnel interview and two set of questionnaire were used one for industrial user and the other two staff. In the analysis of the result, percentage was used while chi-square technique is adopted in testing the hypothesis and it was tested at 5% level of significance. The following hypothesis were tested. Containersation of a product attract a buyer, containerization of a product affect’s users decision to buy. In the course of the research, useful findings were made which among others include, using a good colour combination materials and adequate shape and design to attract buyer’s attention. It was also found that containerization play an important role of impact for promotion of product apart from its traditional role of protection. The belief in the container is a silent sales man. Apart fro this, industrial buyers are motivated to and quantity, therefore for a company to achieve it’s goals. Management should give containerization an intelligent leadership and support. Since containers in a dynamic complex and controversial business area. This involve improving their containers policies are properly implemented.<br/>Container or packaging as the name implies has many uses vis, protection, identification, differentiation of a particular brand for storage purpose of the prPoduct.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>Containerization in a modern phenomenon in transportation since its emergence has swept all the modes of transportation and transport vehicles can combine with one another in initiating and completing journeys in cargo transportation.<br/>Containerization is the use of large boxes for packing goods to be transported o long distances in order to facilitate handling and transfer among different vehicles since its emergence in transportation, containerization port authorities’ government/ industrialists.<br/>According to Amanze (1989:24-25) containers help to economies the number of movement and handling required in conveying a given quantity of cargo and ensure generally ‘posses’ three unique features, these are:<br/>a. They are standardized:- They must be of the same size, shape and material so that they can easily be carried by different vehicles in the different modes of transportation in different countries and contents.<br/>b. They are strong and weather proof: Transport containers must be strong or tough and weather proof, so that can withstand the hard conditions as the seas and ports and ensure the safety of the goods they are carrying. For these reasons, containers are made of steel, aluminum or combination of these and other metals which do not rust easily.<br/>c. They are large: Container must be larges that they can be used to carry bulk materials. Where containers are very small. The amount of trans-shipment handling required would be much, thereby defeating the aim of containerization. However containers must not be so large to the extent that they cannot fit into the vehicles used for carrying large cargo in the different modes of transportation.<br/>The use of large containers for want and overseas transportation and distribution of goods began in the early part of the twentieth century. But in 1926 London Midland and Scottish Railways were the first firms to use container whose original business was road haulage started a containership service between New York and Porto-Rico. According to the American container trade journal in edition (1966:11-12), the main brake through in containerization was attained by sea-but in 1966 with the intention to enter the Trans Atlantic trade with containership. This decision seen to have jotted other shipping likes lines from slumber.<br/>Nigerian become involved in containerization revolution in 1968 when the first substantial container vessels landed with over 100 tones general cargo at the Apapa wharf port containerization has also made a significant impact on road and railway transportation since August 1980 when inland containers Nigeria Ltd (ICNC) made its trail-blazing relationship from Lagos kano will a single container within ten days.<br/>The process of containerization has been surged ove the last several decades but Nigeria Ports and their supporting container distribution network have struggled to increase capacity to match this expansion.<br/>This article seeks to review and organize existing container network capacity literature into a taxonomy base on the interrelated stake holders of container flows. The artily first establish the industry capacity influences from stake holders, inducting shippers; port authorities, terminal operations, long shore labour, railroads drayage carriers, intermediaries, ocean carriers, government and local communities. The centralize distribution and activity received cargo that must be sorted before transshipment to the (SSA) supply support activities or owing unit. The majority of cargo will arrive in 20 and 40 foot container: single consignee cargo and ammunition will not pass through the centralized distribution activities but will be throughout to the users.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>Containerization is very essential and useful in the setting of industrial goods; it is often referred to as nearest company salesman.<br/>There are exiting problem associated with containerization on transport and distribution of industrial goods and services.<br/>Expanding system wild container capacity is extremely difficult.<br/>a. For one container flows involves a series of linked capacity factors driven by different stakeholders such as port, railroads, truck carries and steamship lines.<br/>b. While in surface the problem appears to be a direct application of Goldraths theory of constraints.<br/>c. Container flows may be identified as the drum, but their landing involves a series of linked factors controlled by the stakeholders.<br/>d. The further compounding the problems are unpredictable changes in security requirement, terrorize activities military deployment.<br/>e. Updating if list of authorized person in the organization due to constant movement of staff as a result of promotions. Resignation and transforms formal list of person which are able of request stock and sample signature are very difficult to maintain properly and tend to become out of data very quickly.<br/>f. Non employment professional in the organization-the staff employed in the organization have professional who can be light competent in the execution of the job. This is due to the fact there are no employees (ie professional).</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>It is necessary to look or to identify the social and psychological past in order to appreciate what we are trying to do in the present so as to do better in the future.<br/>The study will provide marking opportunities challenges and prospects that exist for marketers to improve on their packaging through repeat purchases.<br/>The aim of this research survey is to:<br/>i. To identify the supplier willingness to meet the need of the customers no matter how urgent.<br/>ii. To examine a variety of option on shipment load carrier.<br/>iii. To examine maximize customer services while minimizing cost.<br/>iv. To determine safe delivery of merchandise.<br/>v. To identify the speed at which others are treated.<br/>vi.

It is equally significant because it will out line the various needs for the impact of containerization in international purchasing comparison with other department can be used to improve the overall organization concept.<br/>It also gathers toward creating sound need for the impact of containerization in international purchasing in Nigerian Brewery Enugu.<br/>This study is significance because it will increase the body of academic knowledge available as a research study. It is also relevant in the sense that it will serve as reference to future researchers on issue connected with the present research problem.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The activities of freighting function in industry among the industry are the same throughout the country. They have problems and objective exception policies and management style which are at individual discretion. Since, the project explores how the needs for the impact of containerization in international purchasing improve the level of productivity in the organization. However, there are a lot of industries in reigned and as a result it will be extremely difficult and impossible for the researcher to study all of them considering the time space given. I decided to use the top company above to enable me carry on in depth study of the organization.<br/><br/><em><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>The limitation of the study includes<br/>i. Inadequate financial and material resources with which to carry out such an elaborate product.<br/>ii. Inability of the product ie those interviewed to give the relevant information on variable under study.<br/>iii. Insufficient time. Since the researcher still had to attend lectures for the competion of this course works.<br/>iv. Natural factor, natural factors like rainfall, sun hampered the researcher’s movement in bid to collect data/information.<br/>v. Unsteady power supply by the power holding company in which questionnaire and respond.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</em></strong><br/>CONTAINERISATION: Is an advancement of the concept of unit load. A container in a box with steel framework, a strong floor base, paneled sides and a roof. Containers can equally be classified according to their sizes we have the (ISO) that is the International Standard Organization. Standard Container of 8x8ff. Containers vary with respect to length. The length are 10ft, 20ft and 40ft are used to suit a particular need.<br/>THE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS: Begin when a supplier receives an order from a customer. The customer is not too concerned with the design of the suppliers distributing system, nor in any supply problems.<br/>ORDER PROCESSING: This is the first in logical process. The efficiency of order processing has a direct effect on lead time. Orders are received from the sales team through the sales department. Many companies establish regular supply performs satisfactorily very often contracts are drawn up and repeat orders forming part of the initial contract are made at regular interval during the contract period.<br/>INVENTORY: If is a critical area of international purchasing) because stock levels have a direct effect on levels of services and customer satisfaction. The optimum stock level in a function of the type of market in which the company operates, few companies can say that they never run out of stock, but if stock outs happens regularly, their market share will be lost to more efficient competitors. Techniques for determining optimum stock levels are illustrated later in this chapter, the key lies in ascertaining the re-order point.<br/>WAREHOUSING: International marketing texts pays more attention to warehousing than do local once. This is mainly because of the relatively longer distance involved in distributing internationally, where it can sometimes days, weeks, month to get to customers. The logistics’ of warehouse can therefore be corresponding more complicated. However, the principles remains the same and indeed the European Union should be viewed as a large home market, currently, many companies function adequately with their own on-site warehouse from where goods are dispatched direct to customers.<br/>TRANSPORTATION: Usually represents the greatest distribution cost, it is usually easy to calculate because it can be related directly to weight or numbers of units-cost must be carefully controlled through the mode of transport selected amongst alternative, and these must be constantly reviewed. During the past 50 years, sea transport has become the dominant transportation mode in international purchasing. The patterns of retailing that have developed and the pressure caused by coin stock holding and short-lead times, have made sea transport indispensable; where the volume of goods being transported reaches a certain level, some companies purchase their ownership, rather than use the service of cargo contractors.<br/>REDUCTION IN CARGO HANDLINGS COST: The use of containers by water vessels for packing cargo has been shown by tenth according to staff (1984:132).<br/>INTERMODAL CO-OPERATION (COMBINATION): The handlings of cargo at ports have been reduced to about one third as a result of the adoption of containerization. This is one of the reasons why Nigerian ports quickly embarked on the construction of special berths for handling container ships, when the concept was proposed to them and after they had studied the result of its adoption in other ports.<br/>FASTER INLAND DISTRIBUTION OF SHIPPED CARGO: International cooperation between ship and road vehicles among ships, railway vehicles and vehicles (fishy back) is made possible (and actually resulted) outing after the adoption of containerization by ports and shipping lines.<br/>FASTER INLAND DISTRIBUTION OF SHIPPED CARGO: Containerized shipped cargos are more easily off- loaded from ships, handled and cleared at port and takes to inland destinations faster than those that are none containerized.<br/>INCREASED SHIPPING TURN-AROUND TIMES: By facilitating handling cargoes at ports, containerization has greatly helped to increase the turn-around time of ships when cargo are containerized, ports handling time is reduced to only about one fifth of that required in the loading and off-loading of conventional ship.</p> <p>FASTER LOADING AND OFF-LOADING AT TERMINALS: Containerized cargoes are normally loaded and off-loaded faster at ports. The use of roll-on, roll off operations makes these even faster.</p> <p>HIGH VOLUME FLOWS AT PORTS AND BETWEEN PORTS: With a drastic reduction in the time needed for handling containerize cargoes at ports and increase in turn-around time of ships, containerization makes possible higher volume of cargoes flow at ports and between ports.</p> <p>CARGO SAFETY: When cargoes are containerized, they are not usually opened a transit terminals or when being unloaded. This reduces the tendency of pilferage. Handling of cargoes is minimized and action of weather on it is also reduced when containerized. All these help to enhance the safety of cargoes on transit and terminals.</p> <p>HANDLING OF CARGOES EASIER: The handling of cargoes is minimized and made more convenient when containerized. It becomes easier to automatic handling and make use of material handling equipment, such as forklift, crane and roll-on roll off devices.</p> <p>INCREASED TURN-AROUND TIMES VEHICLES: The faster handling permitted by containerization helps to quickly free vehicles at terminals and increases other turn-around times.</p> <p>ENHANCEMENT OF VEHICULAR SPACE EFFICIENCY: When containers are loaded on a vehicles its cargo space is utilized more efficiently.</p> <p>FASTER AND CHEAPER INLAND DISTRIBUTION: By reducing the cost and time for handling cargo at terminals and combing the efficiency of different modes of transportation containerization helps to promote faster and cheaper inland distribution of goods.</p> <p>THIN SKINNED CONTAINERS: Are constructed with the sole aim of offering protection against weather and theft they have no insulating effect with regards to temperature control.</p> <p>INSULATED CONTAINERS: They have no real system of temperature control, they are made of thick materials, having some sort of fiber glass or other materials which reduce that loses and gains thus giving perfect protection to cargoes against unfavourable temperature.</p> <p>FRIGERATED CONTAINERS: Are controlled with an inbuilt refrigerator, it is used in the carriage of goods or materials that requires cold temperature while in transit.</p> <p>DIFFICULT IN CARGO INSPECTION: Containerised cargoes are not normally inspected at ports or materials. They are usually pre-shipment inspected. If pre-shipment inspection had not been properly done, there is the possibility that containers might be used to smuggle illegal goods into a country.</p> <p>EXTRA BURDEN OF CONTAINERS: Containers are essentially an added burden to transport vehicle and shipping lines. Apart from adding to the load of vehicles when conveying cargoes, empty containers have to be returned for them to be re-used, these serves as extra burden to transport and their vehicles.<br/>POSSIBILITY OF ROUGH HANDLINGS OF CONTAINERS: Docks workers and others engaged in loading and off-loading contains may rough handle them without knowledge of the fragile nature of their contents.

In other words, an accident is a occurrence which occurs without planning or expectedly. It can also be regarded as an unintended and sudden occurrence which causes damages hurt and cost of life and materials in an organization.<br/>In other hand industrials accident can said to be an accident which occurs in a industrial environment (factor or organization). Unexpectedly which causes permanent injuries and in some cases may result to death of an employee and human being in general. An mishap and sudden occurrence in an industrial site causing cost and hurt to materials equipment and man is an organization. E.g a permanent or temporal. Injury sustained process chemical explosion leading to fire accident hurt on human body resulting from effects of chemical of any types and some fires fall of product/ materials at the process of production etc.<br/>As a result of various accidents in our industrials firms and factories safety practices and rules in an organization are paramount and levels the priority attention of the operational management if firms. To ensure adequate safety and protection of machines, materials and employees in various organization today, training, expositions seminar and symposium have been organized to inform and educate workers and operators to alert on the use of tools equipments etc. to always put on protective wears like overall, safety boots, helmet, glove and so on which will drastically reduces the level of industrial accident in an organization.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF NBC</em></strong><br/>Nigerian Bottling Company Plc is one of the bottling companies that have.

This research exposed the importance of negotiation in an organization and who and when a negotiation should be carried out. For an organization to function effectively and efficiently in this procurement, negotiation is very important to attain it. Without an effective negotiation an organization will not or cannot be able to carryout its buying activities effectively. In purchasing and supply, negotiation is vital because without it, it cannot function effectively. An organization enter into negotiation to get a fair and reasonable price in its buying activities. This project is divided into five chapters, chapter one being the introductory analysis, providing definition and nature of negotiation practice. Chapter two explains different authors view on the subject matter or topic. Chapter three is the research methodology which explains the method the researcher used in achieving her results. Chapter four is the presentation and data analysis. Data are provided in a tabular form and analyzed using simple percentage method. Chapter five is the conclusion which is drawn based on research findings and recommendation are made on how to improve negotiation practice in an organization.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION </strong></em><br/>The basic goals in any industrial activity is the development and manufacture of products that can be marketable at a profit. This goal is accomplished by the appropriate blending of what many management authorities call the five mis-machines, men, material, money and management. Materials today are the life blood of industry, no industrial organization can operate without them. They must be at the right time, in the right quantity at the right quality, at the right price and at the right place. Whether in period of inflation, or price stability or recession, obtaining materials at the right place can literary mean the different between a firms success and failure, hence the right price is prime importance to every organization, profit or non-profit.<br/>Professional buyers, interpret the right price that is fair and reasonable to both the buyers and sellers. Unfortunately no single set of pricing principles or criteria exists for calculating precisely what constitute fair and reasonable. Therefore to obtain the right prices, three basic methods can be used by buyers, these are:<br/>1. Published price list<br/>2. Competitive buying<br/>3. Negotiation<br/>When a buyer is not satisfied with the price after using published price list and competitive bidding he resort to negotiation. <br/>According to Chambers 20th Century Dictionary, Negotiation means to counter the purpose of mutual agreement. The Webster Dictionary defines it as conferring discussion or bargaining to reach agreement in business transaction. In industry negotiation is sometimes confused with happening and rise selling. While in government it is frequently visualized as a nefarious means of a competitive building of awarding contract, surreptitious favour supplies. <br/>According to Oyeoku (1993) negotiation is just but a process whereby a representative of buying organization and the selling organization attempt to reach precise agreement on all terms and conditions which makes a contract come into being. It involves a thorough analysis of all aspect of purchasing rational discussion conferring and bargaining on each aspect and the arrival at a common understanding of what is the best in the interest of both side parties. In successful negation both sides win, the winning are seldom equally divided. Invariably one side win more that the other, this is how it should be in business “superior” business skill meant superior reward. Negotiation is particularly useful though not always fully successful in dealing with sellers who are sore source of supply or with seller controlling multiple source that behave in a monopolistic manner, in case where cost are not reliable determine in advance as in most research contract and in any contract for items that had never been made before, there is no source alternative in negotiation. <br/>The important of negotiation of purchasing is the it is a method used especially were the time of purchasing of materials is too short, the money value involved is too low, the number of bidders is inadequate, they are not willing to compete, specification are not clear but vague, the supplier is a monopolist, where all these situation exist or prevail, the buyer has no alternative than to negotiate, hence negotiation is practical technique arriving at a price to pay for goods and services.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>The Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC) operates Owerri plant since 1982 and it is located in the capital city of Owerri, Imo State in South – East Nigeria. The Owerri plant is responsible for the production of coca-cola, fanta, sprite and Schweppes and distribution of all product categories. The coca-cola first arrived in Nigeria in 195 that same year, the Nigerian Bottling Company Limited (NB) was incorporated to bottle and sell carbonated non-alcoholic beverages. NBC has the sole franchise to bottle coca-cola products in Nigeria. Coca cola was an instant hit with the Nigerian consumer and has remained so over the next six decades, NBC has continued on its journey keeping its promise of refreshing consumes, strengthening its communities, enriching the workplace and preserving milestones along the way.<br/>In 1953 production of coca-cola began at a bottling facility in Ebute-metta Lagos State. The same year the company opened its first bottling place in Apapa. 1960 the year Nigerian gained independence, NBC exceeded the one million case a year mark. 196 commissioned its bottling facility at Ibadan Oyo State and rapidly expanded its operations of the next couple of years. In 1972 it listed its shares on the Nigeria Stock exchange and became a publicly devoted company. 1991 acquired the Eva premium water and Schweppes brands. In 2000 it became a member of the newly formed coca-cola Helleric Bottling Company South Africa (an anchor bottling group with operations in 28 countries worldwide.<br/>2001 commissioned the first ultra modern fully automated NBC plant in Benin. 2003 launched the Five Alive brand. In 2007 launched PET packaging for its sparking drinks category. In 2006 launched the 10 energy drink burn. 2007 launched coca-cola, fanta and sprite. 2008 introduced more environmentally ultra glass packaging of tits returnable glass bottle product segments. 2010 the operations stands at 13 facilities and 59 depots across the country. 2011 the company was recognized for its cooperate social responsibility activities as the most socially responsible company in Nigeria and most environment friendly company at the social enterprise reporting awards. The company obtained Nigeria’s First Food Safety System Certification (FSSC) 22000. <br/>The study on the impact of negotiation in attaining purchasing objective is being continued to the operation of the Nigerian Bottling Company Plc Owerri, Imo State. The bottling company is a public limited liability company. The bottling company Limited operates in 13 plants in Nigeria, they are located at Abuja plant, Benin plant, Apapa, Ikeja, Ilorin, Jos, Maiduguri, Kaduna, Port Harcourt and Owerri plant. The bottling company also have 59 distribution centres in the country. The bottling operations in the regions are major purchases of sugar, bottles, labels, marketing materials and services at same time, they play an active role in local communities with out support and local initiatives. The principle activities of the company are manufacturing and sales of wide range of consumer products.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</em></strong><br/>This entails the problems encountered during the course of this research. It is an attempt to look at the various problems facing the purchasing department in purchasing the right quantity materials at the right place, the problems are as follows:<br/>i. Lack of competent staff: For materials to be purchased at a reasonable price, there is need for competent staff who understand the various methods of pricing. There is lack of good negotiation in the organization, therefore this reduces the success of negotiation. <br/>ii. External circumstances: External forces also contribute the problems of the purchasing department. These are political, economic and social force. <br/>iii. Unreliable suppliers: The reliability record level, this posses problem to the purchasing department.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>The objective of this study is to identify the different methods of pricing and by so doing, state the importance of negotiation as one of the means of arriving at a price to pay for goods and services. It is also to highlight negotiation tactics and how effectively negotiation used in industries to purchase at the right price.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </em></strong><br/>To test this assertion requires collecting response from a group of question, bidden in various part of the questionnaires<br/>a. Do you think purchasing has a role in the area of negotiation?<br/>b. Is purchasing department a separate entity or under another department?<br/>c. If you have no purchasing what department is responsible for purchasing or procurement?<br/>d. Does you organization policy permit the buyer in purchasing decision?</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>The research is on the importance of negotiation to purchase materials, management, however ideas, lectures, notes, data collected from the purchasing and supply department and from experience.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>The researcher encountered a lot of problems in the cause of carrying out this study effectively and efficiently, prominent among them are:<br/>i. Non- disclose of information: some of the staff of Nigerian Bottling Company, Owerri do not find it easy to disclosing their business particulars to aliens. Some of them saw it as a means of dividing their business secrete to outsiders, especially when it comes to finance and some saw it as a away of unmarking their inefficiencies and incapability.<br/>ii. Inadequate finance: The researcher being a students and thus depends on relatives for financial assistance is greatly limited in their finance from the school to the industry under study in order to obtain relevant information needed. This is rather difficult and taking because of the huge transaction fare spent and the risk involved in roads in trying to get in touch with the purchasing managers who seemed not be appointment. <br/>iii. Time constraints: Time contributed more to the problems. The researcher limited time was shared between scrambling from information, her regular pressing lectures and other academic works etc not withstanding these problems, the researcher was successful in getting information.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS </em></strong><br/>1.

The study used survey design technique. The population of the study consisted of 88 staff from the three divisions in the ministry while Yaro Yamene formular was used to determine the sample size. Both primary and secondary sources of data were used while a 2 and 3 item structured questionnaire was the main instrument of data collection, the research questions were analyzed with simple percentage and frequency table while research hypothesis were tested with chi-square method at 5 percent level of significance. The major findings of the study were that the New Act finds it difficult to prevail in practice because of the corrupt system made up of officers who only seek for their self enrichment instead of value for money in the award of contracts and that Act has not been fully implemented. It was concluded that the new Procurement Act has the potentials of transforming the present mishaps in government purchases if fully implemented in practice ands was recommended that the various agencies, ministries, departments and functionaries should embrace the submission of the New Procurement Act and put it into practice for better accountability. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION </strong></em><br/>This chapter which introduces the subject matter of this research work “the effect of the New Public Procurement Act on Government Purchase” focuses on the following sub-headings as background of the study, statement of problem, objective of the study, research question, statement of hypothesis, significance of the study, scope of the study, limitations of the study and definition of terms. These areas are critically x rayed below:</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The government of Chief Olugesun Obasanjo approved the conduct of the Country’s Procurement Report (CPR) between 1999 and 2000. The report made several recommendations resulting in the setting up of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit (Due Process). The administrative implementation of a due process mechanism in the procurement of goods, works and services, and the enactment of the Public Procurement Act 2007, which was passed by the National Assembly in May 2007 and signed into law by Late President Yar’Adua on 4th June, 2007.<br/>Before 2007, there was no statutory provision that directly regulated the award of public contracts in Nigeria and this resulted to an avenue by which government, functionaries rewarded their friends and cronies and by which they too amassed wealth. The extent of corruption in the procurement system and its effect on the economy made the federal government to commission the World Bank in 1999 in collaboration with some private sector specialist, to review the country’s public sector procurement structure, including the existing, legal framework, organizational responsibilities and capabilities and present procedures and practices and how they made differ from formal rules and procedures.<br/>The report of the review was presented with certain recommendations and however, on the 4th of June the then president, Umar Musa Yar’Adua signed into law the new Public Procurement Act (PPA) which is the first procurement law in the country’s history.<br/>However, the Act (PPA) is expected to be binding on all government agencies, ministries, department and parastatals, who engage in government purchase or purchase for public usage, hence the apt essence of this research work.<br/>The Ministry Of Health Owerri dated back to 1976 when Imo State was created. The ministry in 1977 moved to its permanent site in Orlu Road Secretariat Owerri. Today the ministry is operating from the New Secretariat in Port Harcourt Road in New Owerri. The ministry has three divisions namely: Medical division, pharmacy division and public health division. The number one man responsible for policy and decision making as well as all actions of the ministry is the Honorable Commissioner of Health, in the person of Doctor Obi Njoku, the inline of authority is the permanent secretary, Doctor John Ihebrenme. The ministry is divided into eight (8) department namely, public health/primary health care, nursery service, vector control laboratory service, administration and finance planning search and statistic, accounting, drug administration and medical services department. The supply division is attached to the department of administration and financed under the supply section. There are principal store officers, higher store officers, store officers, store keepers and store attendants.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </em></strong><br/>The enactment of the Public Procurement Act (PPA) is a great opportunity for Nigeria to develop as a nation, because national resources will be allocated on just and transparent manner do satisfy the needs of the people and the more towards government accountability will be guaranteed as the people have a role to monitor the use of their resources. However, from the findings at Ministry of Health, it can be generally concluded that the greatest challenges to the Act are:<br/>1. The relevance on the part of the government, its agencies and officials to embrace in totality the full implementation of the Public Procurement Act.<br/>2. Inability of organizations and suppliers to understand the Public Procurement Act 2007.<br/>3. The issue of corruption and politic in government functionaries.<br/>4. The involvement of government in the award of contracts in Nigeria contrary to the procurement law.<br/>5. Lack of proper training and orientation.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>The then president of Nigeria, Alhaji Umar Musa Yar’Adua signed into law the public Procurement Act (PPA) on the 4th of June 2007 with the aim of addressing the inadequacies of the Procurement Practice In Nigeria by ensuring transparency, competitiveness value for money and professionalism in the public sector/government procurement systems. This project has its objective as:<br/>1. To clarify what sound public procurement is all about as contained in the new Public Procurement Act. <br/>2. To determine the challenges facing the public procurement functions in government ministries and departments. <br/>3. To identify the various challenges militating against the implementation of the New Act.<br/>4. To ascertain the extent to which the new public Procurement Act has impacted on government purchase in Nigeria.<br/>5. To indicate the various functionaries and authorities responsible for implementing the new Public Procurement Act in government ministries and departments.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</em></strong><br/>The following questions are to be critically addressed in this project work:<br/>1. What is sound public procurement? <br/>2. What are the challenges facing the procurement function in government ministries and departments? <br/>3. What challenges militate against the implementation of the new Act?<br/>4. What effect has the new Act made since it became a law?<br/>5. Who is responsible for implementing the Act in government ministries and departments?</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS </em></strong><br/>Ho: The new Procurement Act does not have the capacity to transform the procurement functions in government ministries if implemented. <br/>Ho: The New act has not been accorded the necessary recognition for full implementation in government ministries.<br/>Hi: The new act has received enough recognition for full implementation in government ministries.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>The benefits abound in the findings and recommendations of this project cuts across individual corporate bodies, government agencies and departments.<br/>1. The Researcher: The study sieve as a pre-requisite for the award of Higher National Diploma (HND) certificate by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).<br/>2. Other students: This research work will sieves as a source of information (data bank) for some other students who may be embarking on further research on the topic or related topic.

This research project is designed to open up some of the basic elements and aspects of the subject. It is also an attempt to relate materials handling methods employed to the operation of rest of the organization. In an endeavor to remedy this situation, this project has been written to pull together in one thought as many facts on materials handling and its management as possible managers, technicians, driver and aspiring ones to those tasks in this firm (unclear Nigeria plc Aba) will thereby have a foundation job and function of this expensive business. </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <div> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong></em><br/>Material handling is an important part of factory and industrial process. It covers the entire spectrum of function such as waste handling, assembly line management, storage and material transport. Material handling system includes several smaller components that work side by side, to make the every day business more efficient and cost effective. Material handling is a costly operation and therefore the methods and equipment employed should be efficient at all times. As in many other aspect of store keeping the approach depends on nature of the business concerned, the type of materials flocked and the size of the store house. Efficient materials handling is very important in the storehouse and also throughout the production process.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS </strong><br/>The firms are fast springing up in a high rate in Nigerian and the difference in distance and location due to the vast nature of the country. The teething problem of material handling in Unilever Nigeria plc Aba is as follows:<br/>1. Lack OF Finance: Handling of materials in any organization is very expensive in terms of material handling equipment, plant and labour. Therefore it was noticed that in the firm Unilever Nigeria plc Aba. That due to lack of finance the organization cannot handle their material efficiently.<br/>2. Lack OF Material Handling Equipment: The size of wrong materials handling equipment which resulted to double handling of material is a problem in the company due to the lack of a material handling equipment.<br/>3. Lack of Skill and Experience Operator: It was noticed in Unilever that the operators of the various materials handling equipment that are used in the firm are not well trained and they lack the required skill to operate the machines which result to high damage of materials handling equipment.<br/>4. Poor Surface and Road Network: In the Unilever Company, the floor surface and the road network were not properly constructed thereby resulting to water logging in the whole area in the stockyard in the firm. On the other hand, the road network to the storehouse were not properly constructed which cause the double handling of materials from the storehouse to the production center. <br/>5. Poor Maintenance Culture: There are a lot of machines and equipment breakdown in the firm due to the poor maintenance culture in the firm. This is cause by the lack of skill operators that can maintain the equipment and machines.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>It is paramount that every study must have objectives. However, the objectives of the study in Unilever Nigeria: <br/>1. To find out the method of reducing the overall cost through efficient management of material handling equipment.<br/>2. To find out the extent to which efficient materials handling methods adopted in a manufacturing firm have helped to achieve their aims.<br/>3. To examine the caliber of staff operators involved in various activities of materials handling. These activity areas include, unloading, loading, stores production and maintenance.<br/>4. To find out ways of improving co-ordination and more efficient control of various activities that contributes to total material handling management.<br/>5. To know and maintain the contribution of material handling equipment employed to profitability and to the efficient running of the system.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The researcher intends to explain the fact that material handling is expected to provide a reliable bedrock for effective and efficient material control in an organization. In the department of purchasing and supply you must carryout the research work before you have your HND certificate. Furthermore, it is believed that the study will help the firm identify its drawbacks and how to eliminate them which will ultimately contribute to profitability of the organization, there by reducing waste, cost and obsolescence. <br/>The study will also be useful to all purchasing and supply students as it will be a vital academic material handling. This will enable them have a wider knowledge of the important of efficient materials handling in a firm.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong><br/>Base on this project topic and the objectives as stated, the following research questions have been formulated:<br/>1) Does an efficient material handling contribute to the profit of the organization? <br/>2) Can the material handling contribute to efficient operation of production department?<br/>3) Is the material handling equipment used in the organization purchased by qualified technologist? <br/>4) What type of material handling equipment is in use in the organization storehouse?<br/>5) Does total material handing cost affect the unit cost of the product, services and competitive position adversely?</p> <p><strong>1.6 HYPOTHESIS I</strong><br/>Ho: Efficient material handling does not contribute to the profit of the organization <br/>Hi: efficient material handling contributes to the profit of the organization<br/>HYPOTHESIS II<br/>Ho: Material handling does not contribute to efficient operation of production department.<br/>Hi: Material handling contribute to efficient operation of production department.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The research is limited on the activities of efficient material handling in Unilever Nigeria plc. The level of relationship and communication that exist between the firm and its customers and some of the problems the firm encounter in the course of handling.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>In a real sense, this study would have involved the study of some other manufacturing firms, but because of the geographical location of these firms, it was not practicable for the researcher to carryout has research work on these firms. In view of this, the researcher has decided after carefully study the various firm to concentrate on Unilever Nigeria plc Aba. <br/>In addition to the above, there was the problem of finance. The source of income of the researcher is very low, and as such cannot afford the money for all the expenses she/he is to incure. Also the issue of limited time for the research work cannot be over emphasized.</p> <p><strong>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong><br/>Material Handling: this embraces the movement handling and storage of everything within and around an establishment, including raw materials, components and supporting goods regardless of shape, size, form, nature or weight <br/>Packaging Methods: this is an aspect where suppliers should be instructed to pack incoming goods in a convenient manner in such quantities that they may be handled in store with the minimum effort.<br/>Manual Handling: This is the natural way of handling material by hand. The human hand is capable of the almost indefinite variety of grips and postures.<br/>Mechanical Handling: it covers the use of mechanical aid in the movement storage and handling of materials.<br/>Economy of Movement: This is the actions of lifting the goods transporting them and laying them low again.<br/>Lack of Space: This is the most common cause, especially in organizations that have developed and grows over a period of time.<br/>Poor Design: Wrongly designed store house affects the activities in the stores and causes double handling of materials.<br/>Lack of Training: If the stores staffs are not properly trained on how to handle materials, it will also lead to double handling of materials by the staff concerned.<br/>Fork Trucks: these are available in considerable variety, both electric – powered and diesel powered as well as un-powered. They are primarily used for moving goods on pallets.<br/>Pull-Lifts: A land operated chain block at a fired point to lift heavy materials for loading on vehicles or machines.<br/>Electric-Hoists: an electrically operated version of the pull-lift for basically the same purpose<br/>Monorail: a single overhead reail from which a pull-lift or electric hoist is suspended on rollers, to allow loads to be moved to any point over which the monorail passes.<br/>Pumps: tankers are normally felted with pumps which enable them to discharge where ever required.<br/>Conveyors: Where a continuous flow of goods or materials is passing between tow or more fixed points and the cost and utilization of space can adequately be justified, a conveyor may be installed.<br/>Slides and Chutes: They are used for movements of parcels and cartons.<br/>Gravity Roller Conveyors: May be applied where order picking and how are more or less continuous and are concentrated into well defined bin area.<br/>Uses of Motor Transport: Delivery vehicles are used extensively, both within large complexes and for collection and delivery of goods<br/>Material Damage: material damage can be a very expensive business and will undoubtedly reduce the stock life of many materials in the stores.<br/>Material FLOW: Material flow has to be maintained if output and distribution are to e maintained. Materials must be transported from the point of storage to the point of production.<br/>The Cost Factor: the cost factor is vital in terms of operational cost, profit and overall or production handling material in any organization is very expensive in terms of material handling equipment, plant, time and labour.<br/>Training of Operator: to get the best services from any machine and to minimize damage to equipment, buildings and materials, the drivers and others concerned with the operation of any mechanical handling devices.<br/>Overhead cranes: a power driven vehicles which is mounted in a fixed gentry running the whole length of the working area.<br/>Fork Lift Trucks: they are widely used and are available with an even wider range filtering and adoptions pallet loads are of course intended for folk lift movement and it is therefore an advantage if loads are palletized.<br/>Crannies: They also have a wide range of uses in loading and unloading they are particularly useful where large and heavy loads are involved.<br/>Storehouse: When considering the employment of mechanical handling.

Every nation no matter the nature and rate of available human and material resources under its disposal can hardly attain growth and economic development if the small scale business sectors of such nature is neglected or not given adequate financial supports cum other incentives that makes for the survival of these business. Therefore, the study has tried to unfold the fundamental ways through which both the government and every other persons concerned should put hands together towards the encouragement and development of the small scale business which have been argued to provide not less than ninety percent (90%) of the available employment opportunities to any nation that knows the best way to optimally support these neglected sector of the economy. In view of this, the researcher have carried out a detailed survey on this subject with the use of questionnaire, oral interview and close look at the view of other scholars; which serve as immense help to this project. The result of the study was presented and analyzed using tables of the study, recommendations and conclusions were made, the APA style was used in the bibliography.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>Most of the world renowned companies and organizations started as a small scale business with skills and efforts they grew up to the conglomerated and multinational companies of today.<br/>Small scale business occupies a unique position in the economy of any nature and they are the bedrock of any economic development. They constitute of the cornerstone of any competitive economy and by far outnumber the large scale business. Also, they provide large scale business, more fertile ground for creativity and entrepreneurship. Hence, as a result of easy entry into the market, small scale business spring up all the time keeping the competition environment lively, a phenomenon that leads to productivity gains and real economic growth, apart from the fact that they generate employment opportunities, they are closer to the grass root and so on, ginger rural development. They are less capital intensive and do not require gigantic infrastructure for their operation. <br/>Being part of the economic system, small business entities are faced with numerous problems, particularly funding and many ways these are very different from the financial problems on large concern. However, the principles underlying financial decision are similar irrespective of the size of the business, hence, the basic goal so financial management through acquisition, anticipation and allocation of funds equally apply to small scale business.<br/>It is widely known in business circles that small scale business find it difficult to secure funds from financial institutions due to the fact that they have difficulty in meeting the collateral requirement that would qualify them for the financial assistance from the back. This is not withstanding every business whether small or large needs funds. Funds constitutes the life blood of any business while other things follows. <br/>Small scale business serves as an engine room for economic development and government recognize the fact that small business is the second largest employers of labour apart from government. Government is also encouraging the establishment of small scale business by forming such bodies like Small and Medium Enterprises (SME). Government has also provided monetary incentive for small scale industries. As stated earlier, small scale industries play very important roles in the economic development of any country, state or local government. For instance, in any depressed unemployment is the increase, where the available resources are under-utilized and where raw-material supply to our big industries is inadequate, establishment of small scale business is considered as an alternative means of earning a living and providing raw-materials to our big industries. <br/>BRIEF HISTORY OF RENNY’S FAST FOOD <br/>Renny’s Fast Food started as a restaurant in the late 90s. It is owned and managed by Mrs. Ngozi Obiaga as a hospitality industry, being a service provider, it is aimed as providing quality service to its targeted customers. It offers an indoor and outdoor catering services like; weddings, birthdays, chieftaincy coronation etc. Its cooperate headquarter branch is situated at No. 45 Ekwema Crecent Ikenegbu Owerri, Imo State.<br/>Presently, Renny’s Fast Food has a staff capacity of about 65 and has some branches within and outside the state like Port Harcourt and Bayelsa States.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>There is no doubt that small and medium scale enterprises is the principal catalyst of entrepreneurship and it constitute the real fabric of nation’s economy. And to say that the present and future economic advancement of this out great country- Nigeria lies in the dynamics and growth of the Small and Medium Scale (SME) is not an overstatement. <br/>At least, this is the unanimous opinion of an economic conference at the instance of the three bodies; Nigeria Institute of Social and Economic Research (NISER), the national Association of Industries (NASSI) and the Fredrick Albert Foundation in Lagos in 1989. In other words, SMEs constitute a vital force to economic growth and development (Onuoha 1994:1). Economic development is a nation wise problem which the small scale industries are capable of solving effectively these include:<br/>1. Development of raw materials<br/>2. Sourcing of raw materials<br/>3. Providing training places for workers and students on industrial attachment. <br/>4. Problems of capital for large establishment <br/>5. Problems of unemployment<br/>6. Under-utilization of scare resources<br/>7. Lack of linkage effect among several factors in the economy <br/>8. Lack of provision of import substitution goods.<br/>In the light of the above mentioned problems, the fact that small scale business are vital for economic development of any country, state or local government and numerous problems which small scale business are capable of solving motivated me to research or write on this topic.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of small scale business in the economic development with particular reference of Renny’s Fast Food, with the view of achieving the following aims and objectives.<br/>1. Determine the roles which the small scale business have played in economic development. <br/>2. Determine the problems small scale business like Renny’s Fast Food are facing.<br/>3. To identify how to solve those problems.<br/>4. To suggest the future prospect of small business in economic development.<br/>5. To establish linkage between small scale business and the economic development of the state in particular and the national in Diaspora.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</em></strong><br/>The role of small scale business in the economic development of any country needs not to be over emphasized. Small scale businesses are therefore necessary for economic development of any country, state or local government. <br/>Based on the above, a number of research questions as an aid to this study are developed thus:<br/>1. Has small scale business helped the nature in its unemployment problems? <br/>2. Has small service outlets like the Renny’s Fast food played any role in the economic development of the state?<br/>3. Has small scale business played any role in the entrepreneurship development?<br/>4. Has the government done anything to encourage the establishment of small scale business? <br/>5. Do you think this country can do without the existence of the small scale business enterprise?</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>This study is very beneficial to groups of people such as:<br/>1. The small scale entrepreneur as it will help them to know how to solve the economic problems.<br/>2. Student of business studies of higher institutions of learning as this will serve as reference work and guide for further research work.<br/>3. The state government as this will enable them to know the roles in which the small business played in the development of the state. <br/>4. The state government will through this study know the problems facing the small scale business and the suggested solutions.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>This study is directed to find out the roles in which small scale business has played in the economic development of this study. The study is only focused on the small outlet business like Renny’s Fast food which is situated at Owerri Imo State.<br/>This study is expected to cover and serve as a guide in the evaluation of the role played by the small and medium scale business as regards the economic development of a nation, state and even local government.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>While carrying out this research, the researcher encountered lots of nagging problems which affected the progress of the work. Below are some of the problems encountered during the conducting of this research exercise:<br/>- Short period of time: The study was greatly hampered by the short period of time mapped out by the school management for the executive and completion of the exercise. This is not withstanding the ambition of combing the researcher’s academic works like lectures together with this work and must to establish equilibrium. <br/>- Nonchalant attitude of the respondents: Another limitation in the course of carrying out this study was the laziness and nonchalant attitude of the respondents towards the completion of their designed questionnaire.<br/>- Inadequate materials and tools: Lack of literatures, journals and magazines in the polytechnic and other consulted libraries was a constraint to this study though it does not limit the findings of the study because the researcher later find his head above the sea level of the wave.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS </em></strong><br/>Small scale business: This is a type of business that is owned by one or few persons with direct owner influence in the decision making and having a relatively small share of the market and low capital requirement. <br/>Entrepreneur: This is an individual who notices opportunities and take action to mobile necessary resources to produce new improved goods in the environment for a targeted market.<br/>Capital: This is the amount of money required to carry out a particular venture and pay all the financial obligation of the business. <br/>Development: This is the process or the ability to make something to be advance or organize for the benefit of all sundry.<br/>Intrapreneur: According to Gilfford Pinchot 919985) intrapreneur is defined as an entrepreneur within an already established organization. <br/>Business failure: Baumbark (1992:31) defined business failure as a situation where available capital is insufficient to pay all obligations of the business. <br/>Innovation: According to Inegberebor (1989), innovation involves creative response to an investment opportunity by developing a new product, new technology or modification of the existing ones to meet the expectations of the consuming public.<br/>Motivation: Stephen P. Robbins (2010), defines motivation as the willingness to exert high levels of effort toward organizational goals, conditioned by the effort and ability to satisfy some individual need.<br/>Marketing: Kolter (1980:9) defines marketing as getting the right goods and service to the right people at the place at the right time at the price with right communication and promotion.<br/>Management: According to Fedrick Winslow Taylor (1947) Management is knowing exactly what you want men to do and then their seeing that they do it in the best and cheapest way.<br/>Directing: According to Joseph Massie (1994) Directing concerns the total manner in which a manager influences the action of his subordinates. It is the final action of manager in getting others to act after all preparations have been completed.<br/>Controlling: Haiman (1985) defined controlling as the process of checking to determine whether or not, proper progress is being made towards the objective and goals and acting if necessary to correct any deviation.<br/>Leadership: According to Mcshare (2009), leadership is the process of motivating, influencing and directly others in the organization to work productively in pursuit of organization goals. <br/>Environment: Kazmi (2002) described the environment as the aggregate of all conditions, events and influences that surrounds and affect it.</p>\n\nEFFECTS OF SMALL SCALE BUSINESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIAN ECONOMY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF SMALL SCALE BUSINESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIAN ECONOMY", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study is concerned with examination of the role of communication in a supply-chain management, it will help any firm or organization that are still in doubt as to known the contributions of communication, its effectiveness, efficiency of supply-chain management in an organization at large.

They need to know how to talk with others, too”. This assertion of lee (1952) highlight how important communication is in every aspect of life, then how do people view communication? Looking at it ordinarily, people refers to communication as conversation between two or more persons the word communication how ever entails more than this by dictionary meaning, communication has been explained to be “A process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs or behavior” (Webster 1991). This meaning seems to be in agreement with Kwofie (1981) who defined communication as “Any means by which information in form of ideas, protest. <br/>Supply chain management in any organization seeks to ensure that the goods materials are of the right quality, quantity, though at the right price and from the right source and made available for the organization in use at the right time. These five qualities are of great importance to shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited. Little wonder then why any department embarking on a project usually prepare a supply chain requirement planning and make such available to the procurement department well in advance before the commencement of such project or time period the supply chain will be made use of the procurement department which comes under the human resources and services division of the company headed by a deputy general manager (supply chain and procurement) who reports to executive general manager, the department is responsible for the supply’s, distribution and issuing of all operational and administrative supply chain needed for the company’s operations. And for any public liability company like the shell to improve in its supply chain there is need for all hands to be on deck to make positive thought to happen.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>Every organization develops the need for supply chain. This has be made available on timely basis i.e. as and when required by the organization especially to meet up with production schedule. The function responsible for this is termed supply chain management in several organizations. The nature of the product and the complexity of the organization effect the number of product produced and the amount of money available and spent and sizes of products. <br/>Whatever the case may be, the plain fact remains that a huge sum of money is spent on supply chain department of various organizations, it has been discovered that over seventy percent (70%) of the capital of most business organization are tied up on supply chain management have the need for proper control with this in mind, it is necessary to know in a nutshell what supply chain management is Lee JR and Nobler (1977) Define supply chain activities bound by a common idea. The idea of an integrated management approach to planning, acquisition conversion flow and distribution of production materials from the raw materials state to the finished product state”.<br/>Going a little bit further and looking at it from the point of view of Akindele (1952) who defined management as efficient utilization of resources (both human and materials) in order to achieve organizational aims and objectives. He went further to explain that management, as embedded in the above definition, involves the control and effective use of resources, decision making and achieving result through other people. <br/>This being so, we can in one way look at supply chain management (being a management function) from the point of view of the classical management theorists and as such define it as a function involving planning, organizing and coordinating the activities of people in order to achieve result. This could further be interpreted to mean the efficient utilization of resources (human and materials) through supply chain personnel utilizing everything at their disposal to ensure availability of supply chain personnel utilizing everything at their required by their organization. <br/>The history of supply chain management is not just the present day’s affairs it is as old as man and has remained in existence since the earliest days of mankind and civilization. A good example is found in the biblical days of Joseph “The Dreamer” (Holy Bible-Kings James Version 1987) who after interpreting pharaoh’s dream, was put in charge of gathering, storing, issuing and administration of food for several years before and after the famine came into existence in the land of Egypt. He could then be referred to as the first materials manager. In recent years, materials management in many organizations has been given specialized departmental status together with clearly defined responsibilities and authorities. What is observed however is that its (materials management), role in increasingly complex and mass production economy is not fixed. <br/>We therefore see continued innovation in this function towards inter-dependence, there is the need for co-ordination, which could only be achieved free flow of reliable and accurate information transmitted in a timely manner. Between the supply chain management department and all their aims of the organizations, the work of supply chain management depends upon accurate communication especially by whoever does the buying as this involves committing the organization to huge sums of money. The correct spelling and pronunciation are more than important in carrying out management operations. <br/>The role which is (information) plays in assisting the supply chain management team to serve the organization better by making supply chain management team to serve the organization better by making materials available for use as and when needed forms the main them of the study.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </em></strong><br/>One of the major problems facing most manufacturing firms concerns in recent time is the soaring cost of supplying. An attempt to cut down on such costs has sometimes led to the supply of “poor quality” the recent trend however towards cutting down costs and minimizing poor quality is an integrated supply chain management approach through the use of effective communication. To this end, we intend to find out, with shell as a case study.<br/>1. What supply chain management entails and how communication comes into the management of supply’s chain?<br/>2. What has been achieved in the management of supply chain with the aid of communication?<br/>3. What communication problem may be encountered in the supply chain management?<br/>4. How a communication problem is encountered and may be remedied towards attaining set supply chain objective.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY </em></strong><br/>1. The purpose of this project is to look into the special functions of supply chain management and see what role communication plays in the carrying out of these functions with special reference to shell Petroleum Development Nigeria Limited. <br/>2.

Is communication important among Shell Petroleum Development Nigeria Limited the effect on supply chain management.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5A HYPOTHESES TESTING </em></strong><br/>The purpose of hypotheses testing is to enable one making inference about an unknown population parameter. We can define hypothesis as an assumption or statement made well in advance of the observation (or about collection of data) about what can be expected to occur concerning one or more populations under stated or given conditions. <br/>Such assumption might be, true or false. A test performed in order to verify whether a hypothesis is true or flase is called a test of hypothesis. A qualify control manager must determine whether a process is working properly. <br/>Consequently, a statistical hypothesis is formulated for the purpose of rejecting it or accepting it. <br/>These assumptions of statements when accepted to be true they form policy decisions, and laws. The process of testing these assumptions or statement made in well advance of the observation is the hypothesis testing. <br/>NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS <br/>The Null hypothesis is central in research and is the hypothesis that is tested. It is stated in a negative sense (assertion) form by the use of the words “No and “Not”. The null hypothesis is the H0 and its and its alternative is HA (Hi).<br/>The statistical test of the null hypothesis, H0, may suggest the rejection of the H0, at a particular level of significance and degrees of freedom, as the case may be. The rejection of null hypothesis signals an automatic acceptance or non-rejection of the alternative hypothesis, HA. This is because both hypothesis are complementing as a guide to the research to look for an alternative way of demonstrating the relationship between the relevant variable should the null hypothesis fail to be accepted.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5B HYPOTHESIS STATEMENTS </em></strong><br/>Null Hypothesis (H0): That as in all other organizational management functions, communication is important in the supply chain management. <br/>Alternative Hypothesis (Hi): That as in all other organizational management functions, communication is not important in the supply chain management.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>This study will go a long way to help me and other student in quest for knowledge along this line, as well as purchasing and other professions in realizing how important communication is in the supply chain management. Lastly this study will be conducted to highlight the role of communication in supply chain management, it will help shell and other organization that are still in doubt as to the contributions of communication to effective, efficient and timely managing supply chain.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 SCOPE AND DELIMITATIONS OF STUDY </em></strong><br/>This study involves the procurement department, registered suppliers and other departments of shell petroleum development Nigeria limited any generalization of the findings to other population is at best tenuous.<br/>The result of this study is based on one sample of respondents’ behaviors at a specific time, probably at another time using the same instrument; respondent behavior might be different. The assumption that respondents would honestly and accurately answer the survey questions.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>If not that Nigeria is know longer safe for the white men working under oil companies.

Purchasing functions are not only to identify the organization needs, source for suppliers, select suppliers, place order, relieve goods, and deliver it to users department, it also contributes in the achievement of an organization through many techniques in order to make sure that goods produced are purchased at the lowest price that leads to increase in achievement of an organization.<br/>These techniques are value analysis, decision materials are value analysis decision, materials management, suppliers source etc. all these are highlighted in this project.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION </strong></em><br/>In the recent, part emphasis was only on the balance sheet report without cognizance of their factors that made up the inflow and outflow of resources that sustain the body mechanism of given firm. With recent emphasis on cost control in the face of the rising cost of input resources and subsequent spill over of high cost of output. It is very essential to discuss the contribution and roles of purchasing in the achievement of an organization. <br/>After the civil war, the attendant boon in production resulting from the growth of private sector enterprises form Europe and America, began to awaken other management inputs for eventual profit. The reason I based on the sophisticated resources put in by these multinationals into the mechanism of our business sector.<br/>It is imperative to note that the concept of purchasing has been broadened since the turn of the century, to include all those business activities relevant to the securing of materials supplier and equipment as well as services needed by business and industries. Furthermore, the evaluation of right materials has bought purchasing principle and management and its effect on storages high price of commodities and the allied improvisations have cause of problems of the materials and service to intrude into broad rooms of many organizations large or small public or private and even government agencies. As at date, the cost of materials and supplies for industrial and non-industrial purposes accounts for large proportion of the cost of these organization. In most of them, this represents ever 655 of their total expenditure.<br/>Therefore, purchasing is referred to as the department which is concerned with the process of defining the organizations needs selecting suppliers, agreeing terms placing orders, and receiving goods and function which is oriented to providing complete supply function service for user within the organization. English oxford Advanced learners dictionary of current English, third edition, simply defined the world “Purchasing as just buying”. E will however, take purchasing mission to selected of materials or services agreement of process and acquisition items. A well organized purchasing is one of the criteria for a company to minimize cost at the same time increase profit. The contribution of purchasing towards ensuring rapid growth of an organization’s achievement cannot be over-emphasized. It has been sample and proved that, a human in the filed of purchasing easily views purchasing function as more obtaining requisitions negotiating and placing order without the knowledge that purchasing goes beyond this areas of activities. The activities purchasing have the primary purpose apart from procurement of right qualified from the right source at the right price. They distributed these materials or resources to the user department. To do this involves requirement determination, taking procurement decision make or buy decisions bidding, vender selection, negotiation, re-negotiation, awarding of contracts, contracting order processing, expediting, taking delivering, materials handling, storage and distribution within the organization.<br/>For a company to succeed or to achieve it desired objectives, it means that those required to man the materials section of the organization should be highly trained and knowledge in the filed of purchasing. And other materials related functions, in order to harness effectives and efficient achievement to their organization. In view of numerous challenges of the profession requires a caliber of person that can exercise prudence and sound judgement for any naira spent at any given point in time, in order to minimize cost and increase profit.<br/>Sincerely speaking, these cannot be achieved if the buyer is not professional buyer that should adhere, strictly to the ethnics of purchasing profession and techniques or purchasing practice. Quite unlike untrained buyer, a trained and professional purchasing executive is aware that he is bound by the ethnics of the purchasing profession. Therefore, his first and primary obligation is integrity in spending his company’s fund, showing professional competence in representing his organization outside etc. it is in line with this that the researcher tends to study the contribution and roles suing Nigerian Bottling company Plc.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This general induction cannot be concluded without giving a brief description of the company used in this reach.

Many public sectors of our economy have operated over the years but deny the profession the rightful position it deserves. Lack of proper placement of his function in the bands of professional has contributed immensely to the flagrant wastage and unscrupulous diversion of organization fund into private purse, thereby increasing the cost of the overall output variable. It is against this background that efforts should be made to ensure that there is no encroachment of other professionals into the purchasing activities. This is because purchasing as a profession has aims and objectives to be achieved and should not be seen as a gold wine where individuals with little or no knowledge of the principles and practice of the function should encroach for selfish ends. Purchasing role, as a cost conscious department in any organization, ensuring that every purchasing made in the most economic manner so as to offer value for money therefore becomes the fundamental goals of efficient and variable purchasing science. This means that organization that wants to remain in business must purchase materials and components at the lowest cost consistent with quality and service requirements/.

But as a result of time constraint, insufficient resources like finances and data etc. the researcher limited the research work to Lexos paints industries Limited information obtained will be used for generation, for other organization in the industry.</p> <p><strong><em>1</em></strong><em><strong>.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>The researcher in the course of carrying out research work contained some problems which in one way or the other limited the source of carrying the project study further few ones among then include:<br/>1. INADEQUATE FINANCE: Constraints stands as one of the factors that make it impossible for the researcher to go around for this study, considering the fact that the researcher is a student and conserving also the huge transport fare that is involved, it is rather tasking and difficult.<br/>2. TIME CONSTRAINT: The researcher being a student and has a lot of academic work to pursue, instead of examining all the roles of materials management in production activities in most notable industries, the researcher limited his study to Lexos paints industries Nigeria Limited Port Harcourt.<br/>3. NON-RESOURCES: Most of the people interviewed in the course of carrying out this research were ignorant of the subject of the study. They failed to give elaborate information about the organization despite the fat that the information given will be confidential. Books related to materials management was unavailable in some of the library visited by the researcher.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</em></strong><br/>DISPATCHING: This is the selection of assignment of jobs by an individual work centre on the shop floor. A dispatch list is a schedule for a particular center. This can be generated easily by a computer and it’s issued daily showing the priority sequence of jobs to be done at the work center.<br/>MATERIALS MANAGEMENT: Materials management is a concept which being together under one manager the responsibilities principally concerned with the flow of materials into an organization. As such it is concerned with production and control of activities involved in the acquisition and use of all materials employed in the production of finished goods.<br/>PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES: These are activities that goes on in the production department like production planning and control which involves programming and dispatching.<br/>MATERIALS ACTIVITIES: These are activities that have to do with materials, like purchasing, stocking, controlling, distribution and receiving, storage of inventory, packaging and production control.<br/>PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL: This is responsible for producing detailed schedules of part material required to be produced or manufactured in order to realize the out come of the production programmed or sales forecast approved by the management.<br/>PROCESSING: It is a control method used in measuring and feeding back information about various achievement and plan to take corrective action.<br/>STORAGE: This involves the physical handling and housing of parts and materials either as bought or in various stages of manufacture or as a finished product for sale.</p>\n\nROLE OF MATERIAL MANAGEMENT IN PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF MATERIAL MANAGEMENT IN PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This research work is carried out to determine the problems of physical distribution management in a beverage industry. A case study of Nigeria bottling company Owerri.<br/>To achieve this, it is necessary to find out the physical distribution problem in a beverage industry. The study is aimed at.<br/>1. To determine the factors that affect physical distribution in a beverage industries.<br/>2. To determine the activities inherent in physical distribution, its barriers and to identify the factors.<br/>3. To recommend ways and means of improving the physical distribution system.<br/>The data for the study was collected through the use of questionnaire and interviews which was conducted at the premises of the industry. The were analyzed, giving solution to such as suing the right distribution channels and ensuring that product are distributed to where they are highly needed for effective physical distribution.<br/>This work is written in chapters. Chapter one is the introductory part of the work, chapter two takes about the literature review chapter three is the research methodology, then chapter four review the data presentation of the work done and the chapter five is the summary, conclusion and the recommendation of the work.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>According the Kotler (1986:80 distribution channel involves planning, implementing and controlling the physical flow of materials and final goods from point of orign to point of use to meet the needs of customers as a profit.<br/>He went further to say that the major physical distribution cost is transportation, followed by inventory carrying cost, warehousing and or reprocessing, physical distribution management should be broadened to include the distribution cost could be more effectively managed.<br/>There should be an service to get to the final consumer at the right time.<br/>This is because the consumer is the distribution of all production process. The distributors have to date into account the changing panthern of the market and the activity of the competitors. And also the goal which the industry sets to achieve and also determining the product need of consumers before embraking on physical distribution management.<br/>The use of distribution in conveying products to the consumer are an behalf of manufacturers in dealing with their customers. These distributors are also known as the middlemen or wholesales who act as a link between the manufacturers and consumers. One of the problems facing most firms is the physical distribution of product. Because of this reason, a lot of research has been done and most of these researchers tried to find out solution to these problems.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>Because of the competitive nature of every industry, many companies who are unable to cope with the competition have collapsed and foiled.<br/>Distribution is an important aspect of marketing, many industries loose their share as a result of poor distribution management most consumers blame them for high priel because the distribution add cost to the product, buy, clain that there would be no effectiveness and efficiency in distribution of product without the introduction of distributions.<br/>No much has been written or done to know the extent of the influence of distribution in marketing and thereby coming out with possible and workable solution there is therefore, the heed for the researcher to evaluate the distribution channel in marketing of coco cola product in Imo State using Nigeria Bottling company Owerri as a case study. The researcher channels are unnecessary and if some channels or addition should be made.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJEIVE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The specific objective of this study are as follows.<br/>1. To critically examine the distribution channels of Nigeria Bottling Company Owerri.<br/>2. To determine and examine the various channels used in distributing soft drinks in Imo State.<br/>3. To determine the problems encountered in the distribution channel and also to identify the factors that could be responsible for such situation.<br/>4. TO examine the impact of distribution cost to print.<br/>5. To fund and recommend possible solution to the problems associated with the distribution.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>Distribution is not static but change with the changing market but change study is very significant because it exposes the effect of improper choice of distribution channel in the manufacturing industry ike Nigeria Bottling company Owerri.<br/>The total physical distribution concept will assist industries to identify areas where changes have to take place for progress to be made.<br/>This study also aimed at informing the management of the implication of inefficient communication system and exposes the benefits of consumers on the new techniques for the physical distribution channel in a manufacturing industry.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION </em></strong><br/>The research questions are stated as follows<br/>1. Are there effective distribution of soft drink products to customer and consumers.<br/>2. Does your company have an effective transportation system.<br/>3. Does the use of advertising increase the distribution system in your company.<br/>4. Does the conflict between retailer and distributors have effect on your distribution channel.<br/>5. How has physical distribution channel increase your production system.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 HYPOTHESIS</em></strong><br/>The following research hypothesis will be tested.<br/>Ho: There is effective distribution of soft drink product to customers and consumers.<br/>Hi: There is no effective distribution of soft drink product to customer and consumers.<br/>Ho: transportation cost is a limiting factor in the distribution of soft drink.<br/>Hi: Transportation cost is not limiting factor in the distribution of soft drink.<br/>Ho: Conflict between retailer and distributor have effect on distribution channel.<br/>Hi: Conflict between retailer and distributors have no effect on distribution channel.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This research work is limited to the physical distribution management in a manufacturing industry in Owerri with reference to Nigeria Bottling company Owerri plant. The analysis made in this research. Is based on data made available to the researcher by the company’s staffs through questionnaires and responses. The sample size is the selected area. The sample size is the selected area of study and it involves observation, questionnaire and interview.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 LIMIATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>In actual sense, this study should have involved the study of the some of the manufacturing industries, but because of the geographical distribution of these industries, it is not practicable for the researcher to carryout research work on these industries. In view of this, the researcher has decided, after careful study of all the various types of industries to concentrate on the Nigeria Bottling company Owerri .<br/>In addition, there was the problem of time and financial, the time allocated for the completion of this research is very limited as such, the industries in the state.<br/>There was also the problem of compromising attitude of the stated of Nigeria Bottling company especially those at the soft they always very suspicious of the researchers mission.<br/>However, being these constraint, the researcher has made efforts to ensure that she lift no stone unturned in the research for materials and evidence necessary for the purpose of carrying out this research successfully.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</em></strong><br/>The term physical distribution has varied meanings and terms associated with it as understated.<br/>1.

Quality control and inspection, as perceived by its.<br/>American gurns had its origins in mass production and terrorism. At the time Taylor style management was at its climax in the united state and unchallenged even by the behaviour scientists. Quality control as a science has its root in the origins of mass production, notably in the ford motor company. Inspection quality today is markedly different from anything envisaged by its American pioneers.<br/>Quality systems have been evolving rapidly in recent years. Over the past twenty years. Simple inspection activities have been replaced or supplemented by quality control. Quality assurance has along side been developed and refined, and the most progressive companies are now working towards inspection quality management.<br/>This is as a result of:<br/>a. Customers becoming aware that complying with the requirement of a particular quality system is not necessarily a sure-fire guarantee against producing and delivery non-conforming products to the customer. A quality assurance system does not necessarily, of itself encourage a continual improvement approach to quality. It may mean only that an customer satisfaction has procedures in place.<br/>b. The imposition of stringent quality requirements by major customers.<br/>c. The loss of market share to competitors.<br/>d. Increased contact with personnel from Japanese companies.<br/>e. Published case studies, which focus on how companies have set about developing quality control inspection and the benefits of doing so. <br/>f. The teaching of internally respected quality exports such as Deming, fiegenbaun, Taguchi, Jurancrosby and Shingeo, (Dale and Plunketl, 1990)<br/>The concept inspection quality is basically new to managers, its practice therefore limited. The singular concept of quality, control or management, is more common to modern management through varying in definition.<br/>Literature dealing with the concept of inspection quality and till data more and more literature is still being produced as a result of the widest interested in the subject matter of quality control inspection and business process improvement there is therefore so mush literature covering the subject matter and its various aspects. Continuous cost reduction, productivity and quality improvement have proved essential for customer satisfaction to stay in operation it is almost impossible not to see how quality has developed into the most important competitive weapon, many organizations have come to realize that inspection quality management is the way for managing for the future. Although, inspection quality is correct, except, of course by simple coincidence. A need clearly arises to unify certain beliefs, especially as related to quality management.<br/>The concept of customer and supplier is in most customers limited to the interface between the supplier if raw materials to the customer satisfaction and those who take or make use of the output of the organization. This concept is limited in its use it that be the case as evident in the fact that every one in an customer satisfaction is both a supplier and customer to another person in the same customer satisfaction (Oakland, 1993) lack of knowledge of which may frustrate the practice of inspection quality management. Understanding of such quality control inspection principle will make for improved organizational operations or business processes. To what extent are such principle<br/>S understood, accepted and practiced.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>Specifically this research aims at <br/>a, Evaluating <br/>i. the level of awareness of quality control inspection in Michelin Nigeria limited <br/>ii. The level of acceptance of quality control inspection in Michelin Nigeria limited <br/>iii. the extent of practice quality control inspection in Michelin Nigeria limited.<br/>b, Determining, the extent to which the practice of quality control inspection has brought about the achievement of organization objectives.<br/>c, Providing a background for further research in this area, in River State and Nigeria.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH </em></strong><br/>Theory holds that every organization regardly of the industry to which it belongs or the nature to which it belongs or the nature, of its activities can make use of inspection quality management techniques. Other theorists propound that only customer satisfaction with existing managerial problems or ineffective managerial structures needs to adopt quality control inspection.<br/>This research seeks to find out the truth. Inspection quality management is an off-shoot of other or earlier managerial constructs concept and theorists, this is obvious because the concept of quality is clearly now, now but the concept of inspection quality management. It is believed that quality control inspection will then open other chapters in the push for more improved methods of running customers aimed at the attainment of zero error in production. That is, new directions in management theory can be suggested by research, such as this. Although, most theories of quality control inspection are adopted from management theory already in existence, quality control inspection is only interested in refining their practicability to the benefit and or efficient running of the organization. Inspection quality is an approach to management that has evolved from a narrow focus on statistical process control (Spc) to incorporate a variety of technical behaviour methods of made in almost any measure, many of which are not industry specific, examples includes debtorl corditor rations, credit period. Labour turnover, age of employees, training level etc.<br/>Benchmarking is a continuous process of measuring a company’s products, services and methods practices either against direct competition or company known and accepted as leaders (Baridan 1998)<br/>The measure can be internal, unit to unit, competitive, by product function or services, industry leader, comparison with leaders in the industry, generic, comparison of function or process, which are the same regardless of industry. Eg distribution (Baridan).<br/>Benchmarking study are carried out done to find best practice in the critical process deduction from the customers critical success factors or CSF’S (Akinduro 1997).<br/>QUALITY ASSURANCE <br/>This is concerned with the establishment and maintenance of documented procedures designed to ensure that design, development and operational activities result in product or services contracted requirements.<br/>QUALITY CONTROL <br/>This embraces all activities concerned with measurement, data collection and analysis, conducted within the plans laid down by quality which are designed to give early warning or negative trends in processes to be taken before detection work is produced.<br/>STATISTICAL QUALITY CONTROL <br/>This is one and the same with statistical process control. A part of quality control, but including a wide range of technique for the diagnosis, elimination and control of process related problems. The techniques vary from simple to the sophisticated.<br/>INSPECTION (1)<br/>This has to do with the taking of measurement with comparison purposes after the event of production or the completion of services. While it is hoped that someday this activity will be a thing of the past, it will probably be with us for a long while for obvious reasons. However, it should be noted that inspection adds nothing to the value of the product or services, but rather add it’s cost if quality measures are followed strictly, reliance on inspection should almost be eliminated or reduced.<br/>Improving organizational performance</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>Every study has its limitations fall below.<br/>The ideas, which the researcher has established or acknowledged.<br/>Naturally, knowledge of these limitations is essential for an appropriate interpretation of the findings. Devoid of the basic limitation that are general to almost every research such as time, cost of materials, mobility collecting and processing of data, and restrictions related to difficulties in the interpretations of findings as a result of the nature of the characteristics of the population. This research has its own unavailability of related materials, difficult in accessing customer satisfacture records, for example, Michelin for over decades an industry leader in the manufacture of both domestic and industrial size tyres. That was partly as a result of the close guarding of information of any sort or form, which could have given up their technology secrets. Notable among the many limitations that brought about by the external environment. That is the motivations extraneous that may account for any success or failure in implementation and, or execution of quality control inspection in the organization. As mush as possible, the external environment will be checked or held constant to ensure that reliable result are obtained from this study.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 DEFINITION OF TERM AND VARIABLE </em></strong><br/>Inspection quality (TQ)<br/>Quality can best be described as anything that an organization, a society or a community does, which in the eyes of other determines its reputation on a comparative basic with the best alternative.<br/>INSPECTION QUALITY MANAGEMENT (QUALITY CONTROL INSPECTION)<br/>This is a sub-element of inspection quality and embrances the managerial and customer features. It does not include the philosophical or business strategic issues. The word “management” means authoritative control over the affairs of others or an act or instance of guiding or the careful grading of an asset. (ttutetin 1992).<br/>QUALITY CONTROL AND INSPECTION (TQC)<br/>This is the term used in Japan, which frustrates as inspection quality as earlier described. It is a profound concept and goes far beyond the parameters of quality control inspection. This is because the word “control” implies that there is<br/>i. A plan <br/>ii. performance of the plan-doing<br/>iii. Comparism between plan performance checking <br/>iv. Corrective action on the difference.<br/>COMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING <br/>This is the attaining and setting of standards that effectively and eventually becomes targets for all serious competitors in the same or related industries, such comparison of standard can be quality management is for wider in its application than assuring product or services quality. It is a way of managing business processes to ensure complete customer satisfaction at every stage. (lerit, 1994) because customer satisfaction must more from satisfying the customer to delighting the customer.<br/>Customer delight the customer by consistently meeting customer requirements and they achieve a reputation for excellence (Oakland, 1993) All members of the customer satisfaction need to work together on a company wide quality improvement basis to be able to meet this goal. The co-operation of everyone at every interface must be secured to attain this level of perfection changing the life long behaviours of customers and prejudices of an customer satisfaction is not easy. Experience has provide that simply throwing money cannot make significant changes to behaviours and attitudes and training at the problem, something more is required. Dale and Plunkett, 1990)</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </em></strong><br/>It is the purposes of the study to determine if there is a relationship between the knowledge and the practice of inspection quality management. That is while the customer satisfaction may be aware of the concept of quality control inspection, to what extent do they practice quality control inspection and at what levels of the organization. What is the cause of this tend is part of our problem.<br/>The longer a method of operating is in practice the more likely it is either accepted or abandoned based on its merits or demerits. Inspection quality management has not been rejected in theory or in practices since inception, rather improvements are being made intermittently or as the need arises. Having been generally accepted, therefore, what gain have been made by the customer satisfaction that has adopted this new management style. The general view or notion that only customer satisfaction with existing managerial problems can only be accepted to refuted after a rigorous enquiring into why our study customer satisfaction Michelin Nigeria limited, switched to practice inspection question management, and why, along side the gains or benefits desired form the change to inspection quality management.<br/>Many customer satisfaction have their individualized or personalized definitions of quality and these definition often guide the entire organization, research can bring to bear the different definitions adopted or accepted by most manufacturing firms. Inspection quality management however holds a firms definition of quality, that is the conform once to requirement. (Hutching 1992). There is a need to know how if the practice quality control inspection has brought about an improvement in the customers product quality since the user of the product can perceive quality, the same user or customer is better place to define quality for the organization.<br/>(Oakland, 1993) this is because the definition of quality cannot be erroneous while the practice.</p>\n\nROLE OF QUALITY CONTROL AND INSPECTION IN CONSUMER SATISFACTION IN A MANUFACTURING FIRM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF QUALITY CONTROL AND INSPECTION IN CONSUMER SATISFACTION IN A MANUFACTURING FIRM", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This project work was chosen in order to determine the need for the application of value analysis and value Engineering in cost reduction. It will x-ray the gains, benefits and contributions of value analysis and value Engineering in Bottling industries with special reference to Nigerian Bottling Company Owerri. <br/>The topic in question will reveal the methods by which value analysis and value engineering techniques can be applied as well as the contribution of other functional departments in the application of value analysis and value engineering. <br/>It will also identify the factors that are responsible for unnecessary cost of products and the reasons why value analysis programme fail some times. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>Value analysis as an organized study of the function of materials, parts and components involves the critical examination of goods or products, which is aimed at improving its efficiency in use by changes in design, production technique, packaging and other related process whereas value engineering represents the application of value analysis at the preproduction stage. It is purely concerned more of cost-avoidance while value analysis is concerned more of cost-correction. <br/>Value analysis is an organized procedure for the efficient identification of unnecessary cost by analysis of the function i.e. (the property of the product which makes it work or sell). The essence of value analysis, therefore, is first to identify the function of the product and then to examine alternative ways in which this function can be achieved, choosing that which involves the least cost. Value analysis is probably the greatest cost-saving technique used in industries today. It represents a powerful set of tools which can be used by management in controlling material costs. The fundamental objective of value analysis activities is the procurement of materials representing the “Best Buy” in terms of function to be performed. <br/>The general idea behind this is the issue of quality and cost. The main objective of every organization is to make profit, just as a product is purchased to satisfy a particular purpose. For this reasons, it becomes important to correct or even avoid those unnecessary cost elements in a production design. This in essence stimulated the researchers interest most to carryout this research.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </em></strong><br/>Nigeria as a nation is blessed with so many industries whose services the nation cannot do without. These industries are charged with the responsibilities of providing goods and services of high quality standard at a reduced and affordable price for the citizens. Materials in this respect become so vital that no results could be achieved without good procurement procedure. This is essentially as a result of the fact that purchased materials contribute very tremendously to companies profit and profitability. Apparently this stems very sufficiently as a result of lack of recognition being accorded purchasing function by most of these companies. <br/>It is a material fact that a company that buy wisely and economical profits well and therefore less vulnerable to economical doom. Succinctly put by O.K. Oyeoku that “when people put break on improvements in purchasing, they put limit to profitability.<br/>The researcher associates part of the problems with:<br/>1. The organization does not have enough time to examine critically all the possible alternative materials and processes. <br/>2. The organization’s inability to apply a formalized approach to the identification and elimination of unnecessary cost. <br/>3. The materials procured by the organization are very expensive. <br/>4. The purchasing function is not accorded its due recognition. <br/>5. The organization does not have the skills to consider the technical and commercial aspect of conducting a value analysis programme.</p> <p><strong><em>1</em></strong><em><strong>.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>This study is undertaken in order to explore the academic relationship between classroom theory and what is practically obtainable in bottling industry having carefully chosen the project topic. <br/>“The need for the application of value analysis and value engineering in cost reduction” (A case study of Nigerian Bottling Company, Owerri).<br/>1. To investigate those factors that are responsible for unnecessary cost of an item in a bottling company.<br/>2. To identify the gains that can be derived from the implementation of effective value analysis programme in a bottling industry. <br/>3. To investigate what should be the role of purchasing in value analysis in a bottling company. <br/>4. To identify those areas in which value analysis is applicable that will result into cost reduction to the overall goal of the industry. <br/>5. To cause top-management to realize that value analysis should really be everybody’s business. In one sense, maximum potential can be realized from a value analysis programme only if management properly taps these potential resources.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>In view of the huge expenditure on purchase of materials used in industries, it becomes imperative for the implementation of value analysis techniques to reduce cost of production in industries. It is the significance of this study to make a viable and significant rectifications so as to determine alternative ways of obtaining same quality material or item but at a reduced cost.<br/>It is also the significant of this study to arcuse consciousness to the benefits of effective value analysis program in bottling industries. <br/>This project will also show how purchasing as a member of value analysis team involve in value analysis programme. <br/>This project is also aimed to review the way cost is being reduced by the use of value analysis technique in Nigerian Bottling Company, Owerri. <br/>The study is also undertaken in partial fulfillment of the National Board for Technical Education and the Federal Polytechnic Nekede, for the award of HND in Purchasing and Supply. Finally, it will remain as a data bank for future researchers.</p> <p><strong><em>1</em></strong><em><strong>.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong></em><br/>To achieve the objective of the study, the following research questions are necessary notable among them are:<br/>1. Is value analysis an effective technique in respect to cost reduction programme.<br/>2. Does value analysis lead to a drastic cost reduction in products and services in industries. <br/>3. Does purchasing play a major role in value analysis programme. <br/>4. Are those involved in product design, have enough time to critically examine possible alternatives materials and processes.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 HYPOTHESIS </em></strong><br/>Based on the research questions above, the following hypothesis are formulated to be tested.<br/>1. H0: Value analysis is not an effective technique in respect to cost reduction programme. <br/>HI: Value analysis has been known as an effective technique in respect to cost reduction programme. <br/>2. H0: Not every firm requires the application of value analysis. <br/>HI: Every firm requires the application of value analysis.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This study is supposed to cover notable bottling industries, but as a result of the researcher being a student and due to time constraint this research work will be focusing on the very departments in “Nigerian Bottling Company Owerri” that will make impact on the subject matter and these department are as follows: Purchasing, production, Quality and Control, Accounting, Design and Engineering Departments.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The research is handicapped by a number of factors notable among them are:<br/>a. Time factor <br/>b. Finance <br/>c. Insufficient literature materials <br/>d. Poor response <br/>a. Time: Time factor was one of the limiting factors that affected this project work, that is to say, the time within which to complete this work is relatively short and does not allow for a detailed investigation of the facts needed by the researcher.<br/>b. Finance: In a project like this, there are bound to be some hindrances and obstacles posing a threat to the progress of the project. As we all know, money is not easy to come by as the researcher has to limit herself to the available financial resources and has to structurally adjust the project. <br/>c. Insufficient Literature Materials: The greatest hindrance of this project work is the invariability of insufficient literature material for this work to be effectively carried out by the researcher. <br/>d. Poor Response: The response of people during interview was very poor and there were some questions asked and their response could be that they were incompetent to speak on such issues or they would tell you that it is confidential as a result of this information was not let out easily. <br/>There was also the risk of running up and down to collect the necessary data for the project, as they could not be collected once. <br/>Also the condition under which we are subjected to study is very poor and the researcher had to attend her lectures, do her assignment together with carrying out this project work. This did not affect the design of the project itself, rather, some of the figures and facts inside are accurate account based on the best of my knowledge.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS </em></strong><br/>FUNCTIONAL VALUE: Functional value as used is simply that which enables an item or product to fulfill its stated function.

This represents a significant portion of most firms assets and such demand proper management of efficiency and effectiveness and in that light it brings us to the research topic” the role of the application of computer in inventory planning and control in an organization .<br/>The role of computer as a data processing tools in business is today an issue of economic priority in every large and small services business Especially, the business organizations with large volume of data to be processed and produced as information to management for effective and efficient corporate planning and decision making.<br/>This project work has been divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the introduction of the approach, the statement of problems, research questions, objective of the study scope of the study and significance of the study, chapter two is review of related literature both on computer and inventory planning and control in an organization. The next three, outlines the methodology and procedure used in gathering data. Chapter four is where the hypothesis formulated in chapter one are tested, the findings are presented and analysed. <br/>Chapter five is the summary, conclusion and recommendation of the research topic. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>As there are different scholars in computer science, so are there different definitions of computer. The same is applicable to inventory planning and control, however all boils down to the same meaning at least though from different perspectives depending on the understanding.<br/>Iyang (1996:40 defined computer as” an electronic data processing machine capable of receiving, storing, performing arithmetic and logical operations in line with defined instruction, high speed, accuracy and finally transforming the processed data to an output or presenting the data or information in a final printed or visual from”. A computer system could as an “Electro- mechanical machine which receives data instructions, processes them and produce its result as information which are made up of hardware, software, data ware, and human-ware, computer technology is fast revolutionizing the world, Before computer there had been aids to doing such actions as calculation, storing and retrieving information, which were adopted by various organizations. <br/>In the same view, Arnold (1996:221) defined inventory as materials and supplies that a business or institution carries either for sale or to provide inputs or supplies to the production process. All businesses and institutions require inventories which forms the life wire of any organization. Similarly, inventory planning and control for. According to Arnold (1996:223) is responsible for managing and directing inventory from the raw material stage to the customer. Inventory planning and control involves a wide rage of activities like planning, purchasing, storage, usage and control of inventory and for this to be effective, come the use of computer inventory for easy accessibility.<br/>The role computer play in inventory control be over- emphasized. The computer assemblies all pertinent facts about inventory planning and control and bring all these facts up to date. This has been made possible, by the fact that inventory planning and control recognizes that important role computer plays in inventory. Successful inventory planning and control actions are as a result of a computerized inventory system, where all the additions and withdrawals are recorded electronically, so that the computer can trigger the placement of orders to replenish the inventory. Since inventory is necessary for any company dealing with physical products, what it handles large volume of inventory can best be imagined when told like a storey and it beats human imagination when put into use and it is proved. <br/>Brief history of Sam Mbakwe international cargo airport (SMICA). The airport was built but the Administration of late chief Sam Mbakwe. First Civilian Governor of the old Imo State made up of the present Imo, Abia and part of Ebony State. The airport was renamed after late chief Sam Mbakwe as an honour for his contribution to growth of the country and aviation industry Sam Mbakwe international cargo Airport, Owerri was officially commissioned on the 15th July 1994 by the former head of state commander. In- chief of the Armed forces, Federal republic of Nigeria, Late general Sanm Abacha as a passenger airport, recently, it has been re-designated a cargo airport for the importation of cargo in the eastern geo-political Zones of the country by the former president and commander in- chief of the armed forces of the federal Republic of Nigeria, chief Olusegu Obasanjo.<br/>The Airport is managed by one federal Parastatal and three Agencies namely, Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Nigeria airspace management Agency (NCAA) and Nigeria meteorological service Agency (NIMET) . The Airport has as purchasing and stores department where materials of different kinds are purchased and kept for services and which as highly monitored by computer so as to maintain efficient and effective inventory planning and control, it is located at Ngorokpala L.G.A</p> <p><em><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></em><br/>The problem of inventory planning and control has been very daring but it has also been within the past years that this scientific method in computer was introduced in various companies and establishments to promote proper inventory planning and control. The researcher desired to go into the major problems which the establishment have been experiencing before the use of computer was imitated and deduced remedies and solutions in solving these problems. As a result of many operational activities of industries and establishments, they have found the difficult with the surge in business activities. The function of the stores is changing into a more complex one, which emphasized the availability of information at the shortest possible and also the speeding up of time used in rendering certain services. This means that, the use of manual operations could not effectively handle the whole work load and this almost led to a less servicing activities to different operational areas. This also means that materials shortage were delays in stock recording and delivery, at times a complete halt as shortage of material will hit the services operations. Computerization is then seen as answer to those problems facing servicing and manufacturing industries that operates a large system and has the finance and manpower quickly embraced the new technology. <br/>Beside the role of computer in inventory managements face a lot of difficulties due to the following problems.<br/>(a) Inability to determine correctly the exact period of replenishment stock and the economic order quantity.<br/>(b) Inadequate planning and effective control of stock.<br/>(c) Unfavorable internal and external factors which influences inventory planning and control <br/>(d) Inability of the inventory managers to predict with certainty into the future of their customer demand.<br/>(e) Shortage of funds available to business managers and the need to resolve the liquidity and profitability conflict.<br/>(f) Poor accounting documentation of stock <br/>(g) Lack of unskilled personnel to operate the computer system.<br/>(h) Hum Sum of money involved in the purchase of computer system.<br/>(i) Unauthorized persons getting access to the computer system.<br/>(j) The difficulty of correcting errors when they occurs, when the wrong code number is entered the various services rendered in inventory planning and control and how this application has affected output and efficiency.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>What ever be the nature and structure of a country for instance Nigeria, Sam Mbakwe International cargo airport has contributed immensely to the success and development of the country hence international buying and selling via relationship is concern. To this end the objectives of the study are.<br/>(1) To examine the methods and importance of computer application in inventory planning and control <br/>(2) To identify the effects of computer application in inventory planning and control.<br/>(3) To investigate into the uses to increases the efficiency of the store. <br/>(4) To examine the Overview of computer application to the various services rendered in inventory planning and control.<br/>(5) To identify the desirability and effects of computer application in the storage system.<br/>(6) To find how computer application in inventory planning and control will help change the whole concept of inventory.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION</em></strong><br/>One important thing a research of this nature needs to achieve is to empirically prove the subject matter of the study. This is an order to give direction to readers, other researchers and planners so as to elicit what the research is all about. It is therefore becomes necessary to formulate research questions on which the conclusion would be based and are followed. <br/>a. What things can a computer do in inventory planning and control in an organization <br/>b. Why should inventory planning and control in an organization be computerized.<br/>c. Does computer really increase effectiveness and efficient in inventory planning and control in an organization.<br/>d. How should the computer system be operated in inventory planning and control in an organization <br/>e. Does computerization help in reducing the burden of work in your stores?<br/>The above research questions are such which reasonable answers can be elicited at the end of the project.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</em></strong><br/>Hypothesis is a declaration statement of relationship between two or more variables used for better understanding of the problem of the study. That is, it is a statement to be proved or disproved as a result of findings. It is regarded as the core work of the research work. The hypothesis to be tested on is to prove that either, <br/>HYPOTHESIS ONE (1)<br/>Ho: The computerization of Sam Mbakwe international cargo airport has not improved services in inventory planning and control of the establishment.<br/>H1: the computerization of Sam Mbakwe international cargo airport has improved services in inventory planning and control of the establishment.<br/>HYPOTHESIS TWO (11)<br/>H0: The computerization has reduced the burden of work load in stores. <br/><br/><em><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></em><br/>The significance of importance of this study cannot be overemphasized who related to the contributions of airport (establishment) in Nigeria via Sam Mbakwe international cargo airport. The research will serve as a useful guide in determining the relevance of computer application in inventory planning and Control. To this end the significance of the study are as follows: <br/>(1) It helps in determining the role computer plays in inventory planning and control. <br/>(2) It serves as a bedrock of experience and understanding with respect to computer application in inventory planning and control.<br/>(3) It gives/ allows employers and employees an amp time in applying the right system of inventory <br/>(4) It helps students of purchasing and supply as well as the researcher to know the relationship between computer and inventory planning and control</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The scope of this study is very wide if it has to be carried out in all the airport (establishment) in Nigeria. Thus the study will only cover the activities of Sam Mbakwe international cargo airport as it regards to the application of computer in inventory planning and control. The findings may reflect the situation but by and large attempt to find the methods and importance of computer application in inventory planning and control of Sam Mbakwe international cargo airport.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>The Zeal and enthusiasm that the researcher felt in the course of this research was short-lived as a result of certain obstacles which are as follows.<br/>a. NON- RESPONSE<br/>The staff of Sam Mbakwe international cargo airport felt reluctant to give o information to avoid being maneuvered by their federal auditors and even compactors posed a problem and there was no bank where one can easily go for the collection of such information.<br/>B. TIME FACTOR<br/>The time carrying out this research was limited for visits and revisiting to the place of establishment because of the institutions academic system which did not create a particular period for their research work which resulted in the researcher dividing her time between lecturers and research.<br/>c. FINANCE<br/>The cost involved in carrying out this research was exorbitant, coupled with the present economic condition affected the research of the work.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</em></strong><br/>The terms in this study which have unique meaning that could be subjected to different interpretation by different readers of this project are as follows. <br/>(1) HARDWARE: It is the mechanical, magnetic, electronic and electrical devices and components of the compute operating system itself. <br/>(2) SOFTWARE: It provides an interface between the user programmers and operators, the hardware system and the application software.<br/>(3) ACCESSS: Is the process by which information are funds in a storage devices and called up for use.<br/>(4) HUMAN WARE: Is the term used for people who are directly involved in the use of computer.<br/>(5) TURNKEY SYSTEM: Is a system where only the operation peoples ware or users have the code to get in and out of the system.<br/>(6) MASTER RECORD SIZE: Is the quantity to be ordered whether from within or without the source to avoid relevant cost. <br/>(7) UODARE: It is a process of modifying a master record with current information according to a specific procedure. <br/>(8) COMPUTERIZED INVENTORY SYSTEM: is the set of policies and controls that monitors levels of inventories and determine what level should be maintained, when stock should be replenished and how large orders should be. <br/>(9) INVENTORY: this can be defined as stock of raw materials, component parts, fabricating parts or finished goods which are held for several reasons.<br/>(10) INVENTORY CONTROL: This is the supervision of the supply, storage and accessibility of items in order to ensure an adequate supply with excessive or over supply. <br/>(11) INVENTORY MANAGEMENT: Is a major cost centre analysis which must be carefully scrutinized by the firm with a view to employ prudent financial management. <br/>(12) Inventory planning: This is the activities and techniques of determining the desired levels of items, whether raw materials, work in process, or finished products include order quantities and safety stock levels. <br/>(13) Computer: this can be seen as an electronic device which under the control of stored program, accept data through its input devices, <br/>(14) Computer science: is the blending of principles theories and application of the technologies that underlies the access to information<br/>(15) STOCK OUT: This is a situation where the stock position or level is nil.

This work titled ‘’stock control as a management tools for effective and efficient store operation’’ shows that ineffective stock control system has a lot of on the profitability of the organization.<br/>The major aim here is to ensure a continuous and uninterrupted flow of materials in an organization. In order to achieve this, this work was divided into five chapters. The first chapter has the introduction part of the work follow by the statement of problem, objective of the study, the scope, <br/>and significance, limitation of the study and terms of definition. The chapter two talks about the review from contemporary literatures which encompasses the need for stock control, reasons for holding stock, factors affecting the level of stock held, cost associated with stock control etc.chapter three, talk on the research methodology and design. chapter four talk on Data presentation and analysis. Chapter five comprises of the summary, conclusion and recommendation as well as the bibliography.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>Effective and efficient store operation is very closely linked with production and distribution and is a much neglected area of business study. Yet the store function is a vital part of all industrial organization public and private utility organization Federal, state and local Government organization, Armed services, and it must be designed to suit the particular needs of the organization it service.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 INTRODUCTION</em></strong><br/>Having defined a store as any space reserved and equipped for holding materials which are awaiting dispatch to customers for further processing of final consumption in most organization, stores is a place where all types of equipment materials components and supplies needed for production,distribution,maintenance, packaging etc are received. Stored and issued to users. A stock control system needs to be adopted in order to ensure effective and efficient store operation.<br/>In today’s business with competitive market, unstable economic condition, controlling of cost means the difference between profit and loss. The overall business objectives is to maximize profit margin and minimize cost of production, has led many executive to taking steps in all aspect of their business to reduce cost of materials or stocks from a major part of the total investments of an organization. This is mainly due to the fact that no matter the type of business an organization engages in, whether merchandizing or manufacturing, there must be clearly stock of materials to keep the enterprise going. A manufacturing business for instance, cannot exist without raw materials, purchased parts, intermediate parts, sub-assemblies and finished goods ready for shipment and sale.<br/>Stock control concerns not only the individual business but effect the economy of the nation holding stock waiting for a time when they would be used in production. A said earlier it does not immobilize the capital resources, but could generate inventory. Inventory arising from reduction in stock due to a reduction in sale could stir-up a long chain of reaction affecting the whole system. Effective stock control therefore does not only help the enterprise per say, but even influence the whole profitability of the nations economic development.<br/>I have made some attempt in delivery into books and research work done by others to get information on areas the stock controller or manager as the case may be, should be vigilant for him to effectively use stock control as a management tool for effective and efficient store operation.<br/>The first chapter starts with the introduction after which a brief statement of problem, objective of the study, the scope of the study, it significance and also the limitation encountered by the research will be given. Chapter two delivers into the work of other researchers in the same issue known as literature review. chapter three discussed the research methodology, presentation and discussion of findings chapter four gives a data presentation and analysis of data. chapter five gives a summary of the work and conclusions. Then finally the recommendation and appendix, bioliogy and questionnaires. All these are intended to be carryout by the researcher in this work.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>The need for a stock control in the contribution of an effective and efficient store operation can not be swept under the carpet. As mentioned earliest, stock comprises of raw materials components, sub-assemblies, consumable stores, general stores, maintenance materials and spares, work- in- progress and finished salable products, all those items are covered and managed effectively through the use of stock control as a tool. This therefore, raises very important problems that this work is intended to peer into. The problems include identifying the essential issues involved in stock control, how stock control can be made to work out in an organization ,what the monetary contribution of stock control really is, how to avoid an absolute redundant and surplus stock even stock out and then how it can be use as a tool in attaining the organizational objectives.<br/>These issues and many more other issues are what I intended to find solution to during the course at this study. These might be categorized thus;<br/>MAINTENANCE PROBLEMS; what are the things needed to make stock control won-out. What and which type of stock control technique is best suited for a particular industry.<br/>INHERENT PROBLEMS; how can absolute redundant and surplus stock be avoided, if they can be dealt with other problems that might arises from excessive stock includes;<br/>[1] Absorption of capital which would have been utilized in other ventures.<br/>[2] Taking up the whole space in the warehouse or store<br/>[3] Determination of obsolescence<br/>[4] Interruption in production and sales.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>This research project seeks to achieve the following objectives.<br/>[A] To find out whether stock control can control to business survival.<br/>[B] To find out or study the modalities adopted by organizations in achieving it organizational objectives.<br/>[C] To find out the adverse effect of non-application of stock control techniques in an organization. <br/>[D] To find out the solution as to what to do if the organization is not able to apply stock control method for effective and efficient store operation.<br/>[E] To find out the information and advantages of stock control in the attainment of organizational objectives.<br/>[F] To determine the various ways by which stock control can be carried out in the attainment of organization objectives. <br/>[G] To find out the various ways, methods and system by which stock control can be used as a tool for effective and efficient store operation.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The scope of this study embraces all activities of the stock controller in an organization. Furthermore, t6his research project will cover how stock control as a management tool will be used in Nigeria to help the industries and organizations to attain their objectives. It will focus on ensuring that stock control is carried out as a management tool for effective and efficient store operation.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>A naira in the bank is worth two in the inventory and it usually cost more to stock too little than it does to stock too much. Stock control is an important and expensive activity which is often neglected and under rated in many organizations both in the public and private sectors.<br/>It is an area where modern stores management techniques could be used to advantage in reducing cost and ensuring increased profitability for an organization.<br/>In modern supply management stock control is the real control function; it comprises all the basic aims of the store operation. The basic concept of stock control is quite simply, the right material in the right quanlity,of the right quantity, at the right time and place and at the right price. The element of cost in relation to stock control also plays a vital role.<br/>It also supplies a constant flow of material to the operation. It ensure correct quality of stock required.<br/>The importance of this stock control has led the researcher to doing some work in the topic, this study will enable not only those in a more organized business environment but also the small enterprise with, little or no skill in the area of inventory control and management to enable them understand the contribution of inventory in achieving organizational objective.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>So many factors militate against the researcher not be able to carry out fully the research work on the subject as it should have been done. These factors include time; the time allowed for this work was considerably short to enable me cover all the area necessary.<br/>Additionally, the researcher encountered a financial constraint. the finance required to carryout the research work in some area of the state was not much by making it unable for the researcher to accomplish much.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS </em></strong><br/>Certain terms are associated with a good stock control system. They include;<br/>--STORE: it refers to the building set, aside for keeping materials regarding its safety.<br/>_LEADTIME: this refers to the time interval between when an order is placed and the period of receipt of orders.<br/>_WORK- IN- PRORESS: This refers to the semi finished goods. it is obtainable in a situation where a balance flow of production is not possible.<br/>_RAW MATERIALS: this has to do with those items which are transformed into finished goods.<br/>_STOCKS: This refers to the items held in the store.<br/>_INVENTORY: This has to do with a term which Americans use for stock that are kept or stored for use as the need arises. <br/>_OBSOLESCENCE: this refers to the left over of stocks which can not be used immediately in the operation.<br/>_REDUNDANT: this refers to the unwanted materials that are out of use in the store. <br/>_DETORIORATION: the act of worsening the situation of the goods in the store.</p>\n\nSTOCK CONTROL AS A MANAGEMENT TOOLS FOR EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE STORES OPERATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STOCK CONTROL AS A MANAGEMENT TOOLS FOR EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE STORES OPERATION", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The subject matter of this study is the use of tendering and competitive bidding in the public sector procurement. A case study of ministry of works, Imo Srate, Owerri. Among the objectives is stated in chapter one of the study.<br/>In other to attain to the objectives a research questions was constricted to enable the researcher collect relevant information in the subject matter. The researcher reviewer related iterative and some facts drawn from the work in chapter two. Chapter three welcomes the research methodology; the population and size etc. chapter four contains the researcher’s presentation and analysis of data.<br/>Finally chapter five is about conclusion, summary and recommendations. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>The dictionary of purchasing and supply management defines tendering and competitive bidding as offers from tenderness without callous, usually in scaled enveloped delivered by a time and date specified in the invitation to tendering for supply of goods and services.<br/>Uzor (2004:440) in (Lysons 1996:42) defined tendering as a purchase procedure whereby potential suppliers are invited to make a firm and unequivocal offer of the price and terms which on acceptance shall be the basic of the subsequent contract. <br/>Frank Harris and Ronald Mc Caffer defined competitive bidding as an invitation by an organization (i.e the client) to supplier to submit its quotation for a job or services required by the client organization the whose main objective is to determine the performance abilities of the supplier.<br/>Tendering and competitive biding is usually required when an organization or a firm needed supply of certain goods such as furniture, generating set, caterpillars, vehicles, drugs, medical equipment, and computers e.t.c<br/>Tendering is widely used in the public sector to ensure observance of the principles of public accountability. It many also be used by private sector organization more especially in respect of construction and services contracts to obtain prices and terms of the contract. According to Compton and Jessap (1989) such tenders are opened only at the time and data specified by the tender panel of qualified persons who records the necessary details the essence of this research therefore is to examine the use of effective bidding in improving public sector procurement.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</em></strong><br/>The problems of tending and competitive bidding and its implications on public sector procurement has been identified by many as not only enormous but complex now that there is serious needs on the part of our various government to provide more services with little funds and issue of corruption in our “public life” some of the problems are <br/>(i) A great numbers of problems have bedeviled sector tendering which has great affection in the quality of contract entered by the public sector organization. <br/>The entire contract system has gone sour as a result of mis management, corruption mis application of rules and regulation set to be adhered to in contracting for goods and services. <br/>(ii) The negligent on the part of the various authorities to ensure a uniform codes standard of practice and professional ethics of conduct all have made a complete miss of our public sector tendering. <br/>(iii) The out data nature of our financial regulation which guide the operations public procurement as well as public sector tendering in the greatest problem of our public sector tendering and therefore has serious implications on the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector contract management and administration. <br/>(iv) Competitive bidding in public sector procurement usually ends with the lowest price bidder getting the award of the purchasing firm gains a population for negotiation with the towerst bidder after bids are opened. This will make future bidders not to offer their best price initially, believing that they do better in any subsequent negotiation. They will adopt a system of submitting a bid low enough to allow them to be included in any negotiations. But their initial bid will not be as low as when it is anticipated that the award be made to be the lowest bidder without further negotiation. Competitive bidding tends to put great pressure on suppliers to reduce their cost to be able to bed low but profitable prices. This cost pressure may result sacrifice in product quality development efforts and other vital services.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBEJCTIVES OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>In most public establishment there is a wide misunderstanding of tendering and competitive bidding as a tool for public sector procurement.<br/>(i) To examine the use of tendering in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector procurement. <br/>(ii) To find out the reason why there is misunderstanding of competitive bidding. <br/>(iii) Determine whether or not there is need for an independent unit to be created with trained and qualified professional to handle public sector procurement.<br/>(iv) To examine the procedures and processes of tendering and contract awards and the skills of officers involved in public tendering and contract management.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</em></strong><br/>Based on the project topic and objective of the research, the following question were developed by the researcher:- <br/>(i) Does tendering have a role to play in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector procurement?<br/>(ii) What qualifies a bidder to be invited to bid?<br/>(iii) Has there been instances where the lowest bidders are not offered the job?<br/>(iv) Can the current tendering process or procedures as used by the public sector organization eliminate corruption and build accountability and transparently in the public sector?<br/>(v) Are the officers handling tendering in the public sector qualify?</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</em></strong><br/>Based on the research question formulated the following hypothesis are formulated.<br/>HYPOTHESIS ONE<br/>Ho: tendering is an effective tool in public sector procurement<br/>H1: tendering is an effective tool in public sector procurement.<br/>HYPOTHESIS TWO<br/>Ho: There is no effective method the ministry adopt other than competitive bidding<br/>H1: there is another effective method the ministry adopt other than competitive bidding</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The significance of this research work is to help the research or showers to know the significance of this. Study to discover whether there will need for effective and efficient use of tendering and competitive in the ministry. At the end of this work the ministry will be able and capable of ensuring that. There is effective and efficient use of tendering and competitive bidding in ministry. <br/>(i) This research work be beneficial to the ministry of works the researcher himself and also to the public and private organization under study.<br/>(ii) It creates opportunity for unknown contactor or supplier to become known especially when it is successful.<br/>(iii) It makes public accountability possible<br/>(iv) The research work allows keen competition which may produce cheaper tender figure.<br/>(v) It is an opportunity to get genuine tenderers who are actually interested in the project.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This study has been limited to the public sector organizations.<br/>Tendering and competitive bidding has play many role in the management and administration of public sector contract, this study would have covered all the ministries departments, Agencies, Boards even the local government areas in this country but the researcher after due considerations of various variables and implications decide to concentrate on the study of the implications of effectiveness and efficient tendering in the administration and management of contract in the ministry of works and housing, Owerri Imo State. In doing this the researcher concentrated on most of the department and units that have one or other things to do with the subject matter of this study. <br/>These departments or units include administration, engineering, planning, finance of these areas well give a great insight as what takes place in other ministries departments, Board, Agencies etc.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 LIMITION OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>In the process of conducting this study the researcher has confronted with the various problems among them are:<br/>(i) It was not easy for the researcher who had to combine attending lectures in school and other activities in school with the various visits to the ministry during this research work. This in no small way limit the level of investigation, the research intended to carry out. <br/>(ii) Yet another limitation faced by the researcher was financial constraints. This made it impossible for the researcher to make all the necessary visits in order to obtain the right quality and quality of information the research of this nature requires. <br/>(iii) Lastly many officials changes with the management and administration of tendering and competitive bidding and public sector contracts were not keen to give out much needed information by way of documents and forms which were classified as “ strictly confidential” by the government.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 DEFINTION OF TERMS</em></strong><br/>(1) BID: A quotation for a price or other conditions for contracts whether for payment or acceptance. <br/>(2) LEAD TIME: This is the interval between when a need is perceived and the fulfillment or satisfaction of that need.<br/>(3) TENDER: It is the procedure through potential suppler are invited through newspaper and other selected media advertising to make a firm and unequivocal offer of the price and terms which on acceptance, shall be the basis of the subsequent contract in competition with others. <br/>(4) COMPETITIVE BIDDING: This is one of the methods by which the right price can be obtained.<br/>(5) QUOTATION: A formal statement prepared by a contactor/ supplier to his customer that includes cost estimates specification and other key information about an agreement between the two parties. <br/>(6) GOVERNEMNT: An institution with power to govern and direct the affairs of a state.<br/>(7) EVALUATION: The process of finding out and deciding the amount and value of something.<br/>(8) NEGOTIATION: Seeking agreement between the purchaser and the contractor/ supplier on mutually acceptance terms and conditions prior to conclude a contract. <br/>(9) ANALYSIS: The process of breaking components into separate parts or units in order to examine each unit and constitute critically. <br/>(10) CERTIFICATE: Act of licensing by a document formally testing the fulfillment of conditions. <br/>(11) PROCEDURE: A May, system or pattern of performing a work, service, suppliers etc. <br/>(12) PERFORMANCE BONDS: This is an undertaking or security to perform a contract as required and failure to perform as required the client will be compensated by the supplier or contractor. <br/>(13) SPECIFICATION: This is the description of any objective materials or process in sufficient detail requirement of a job/ suppliers or contract which the contractor or the supplier must compile with. It is what the supplier must supply to the buyer as describable by the buyer. <br/>(14) SOURCING: This is a process and procedure used by the buyers to survey, evaluate and determine which supplier that can meet with the best requirement of their organization.<br/>(15) SOURCING POLICY: These are policies developed to guide the purchasing functions in respect of who may be the major sources of the organizational suppliers. <br/>(16) QUALITY: Quality is the fatality of futures and characteristic of a product or a serves that bears in the ability to satisfy a sated or implied needs.<br/>(17) PRICE: This the amount of money for which a thing is offered sold or brought<br/>(18) PRICE ANALYSIS: This is the examination of the sellers price without examination elements of the cost and profit element that make up the price.<br/>(19) FAIR PRICE: A fair price is the lowest price that make it possible for a continuous supply of the right quality materials by the supplier where and when needed.<br/>(20) SELECTIVE TENDER: There a method where only competent suppliers on the approved list of supplies are invited by the buying firm to tender. <br/>(21) FORWARD BUYING: This is a buying practice which embraces the buying of materials in quantity more that it current requirements. <br/>(22) STANDARDIZATION: It is an agreement on definite sizes, design, quality and the like.<br/>(23) CONTRACT: It can be defined as an agreement between two or more persons which is intended by them to have legal consequences. <br/>(24) PRICING: This is the process of determine the price<br/>(25) ORDER: This is an instruction to a manufacturer or trader to supply something</p>\n\nUSE OF TENDERING AND COMPETITIVE BIDDING IN PUBLIC SECTOR PROCUREMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " USE OF TENDERING AND COMPETITIVE BIDDING IN PUBLIC SECTOR PROCUREMENT", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1AN OVERVIEW</strong><br/>the term “total Quality determination ” originated in the united state in the mid to late 1950’s (Hutchims, 1992) the first reference to the term ap[eared in an artice by Dr. A. V. Flegenbawn and again in his “total Quality determination ” Engineering and management” (1961). Total Quality determination , as perceived by its.<br/>American gurns had its origins in mass production and Taylorism. At the time Taylor style management was at its climax in the united state and unchallenged even by the behavioural scientists. Quality determination as a science has its root in the origins of mass production, notably in the ford motor company. Total quality today is markedly different from anything envisaged by its American pioneers.<br/>Quality systems have been evolving rapidly in recent years. Over the past twenty years, simple inspection activities have been replaced or supplemented by Quality determination . Quality assurance has along side been developed and refined, and the most progressive companies are now working towards Quality determination . This is as a result of:</p> <p>a. Organizations becoming aware that complying with the requirements of a particular quality system is not necessarily a sure-fire guarantee against producing and delivery non- conforming products to the customer. A quality assurance system does not necessarily, of itself encourage a continual improvement approach to quality. It may mean only that an purchasing organization has procedures in place.<br/>b. The imposition of stringent quality requirements by major customers.<br/>c. The loss of market share to competitors.<br/>d. Increased contact with personnel from Japanese companies.<br/>e. Published case studies which focus on how companies have set about developing PQD and the benefits of doing so.<br/>f. The teaching of internationally respected quality exports such as Deming, Feigenbaum, Taguchi, Juran Crosby and shingeo. (Dale and Plunkett, 1990).<br/>The concept total quality is basically new to managers, its practise therefore limited. The singular concept of quality, control or management, is more common to modern management through varying in definition.<br/>Literature dealing swith the concept of total quality and till date more and more literature is still being produced as a result of the widest interested in the subject matter of PQD and business process improvement. There is therefore so much literature covering the subject matter and its various aspects. Continuous cost reduction, productivity and quality improvement have proved essential for purchasing organization to stay in operation. It is almost impossible not to see how quality has developed in to the most important competitive weapon; many organisations have come to realise that Quality determination is the way for managing for the future. Although, Quality determination is for wider in its application than assuring product or services quality. It is a way of managing business processes to ensure complete customer satisfaction at every stage. (lerit, 1994) because purchasing organization must more from satisfying the customer to deligliting the customer.<br/>Organizations delight the customer by consistently meeting customer requirements and their achieve a reputation for excellence (Oakland, 1993). All members of the purchasing organization need to work together on a company wide quality improvement basis to be able to meet this goal. The co-operation of everyone at every interface must be secured to attain this level of perfection changing the life long behaviours of customers and prejudices of an purchasing organization is not easy. Experience has proved that significant changes to behaviours and attitudes cannot be made by simply throwing money and training at the problem, something more is required. Dale and Plunkett, 1990).</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>It is the purposes of the study to determine if there is a relationship between the knowledge and the role of purchasing in quality determination . That is while the purchasing organization may be aware of the concept of PQD , to what extent do they practice PQD and at what levels of the organization. What is the cause of this tend is part of our problem.<br/>The longer a method of operating is in practice, the more likely it is either accepted or abandoned based on its merits or demerits. Quality determination has not been rejected in theory or in practice since inception, rather improvements are being made intermittently or as the need arises. Having been generally accepted, therefore, what gain have been made by the purchasing organization that has adopted this new management style. The general view or notion that only purchasing organization with existing managerial problems need to switch to Quality determination can only be accepted to refuted after a rigorous enquiry into why our study purchasing organization Michelin Nigeria limited, switched to practice Quality determination , and why, along side the gains or benefits desired form the change to Quality determination .<br/>Many purchasing organization have their individualised or personalised definitions of quality and these definition often guide the entire organization, research can bring to bear the different definitions adopted or accepted by most manufacturing firms. Quality determination however holds a firms definition of quality, that is the conform once to requirement. (Hutchins, 1992). There is a need to know how if the practice of PQD has brought about an improvement in the organizations product quality. Since quality can be perceived by the user of the product, the same user or customer is better place to define quality for the organization.<br/>(Oakland, 1993) this is because the definition of quality cannot be erroneous while the practice is correct, except, of course by simple concidence. A need clearly arises to unify certain beliefs, especially as related to quality management.<br/>The concept of customer and supplier is in most organizations limited to the interface between the supplier of raw materials to the purchasing organization and those who take or make use of the output of the organization. This concept is limited in its use if that be the case as evident in the fact that every one in an purchasing organization is both a supplier and customer to another person in the same purchasing organization (Oakland, 1993) lack of knowledge of which may frustrate the role of purchasing in quality determination . Understanding of such PQD principle will make for improved organizational operations or business processes. To what extent are such principles understood, accepted and practiced.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Specifically this research aims at:<br/>a. Evaluating <br/>i. The level of awareness of PQD in Michelin Nigeria ltd.<br/>ii. The level of acceptance of PQD in Michelin Nigeria ltd and <br/>iii. The extent of practice PQD in Michelin Nigeria ltd.<br/>b. Determining the extent to which the practice of PQD has brought about the achievement of organizational objectives<br/>c. Providing a background for further research in this area, in River state and Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>1. To what extent has the organizations product quality improved since that practice of PQD .<br/>2. Has there been an improvement in the level of output since adopting PQD .<br/>3. To what extent has the waste level reduced since the practice of PQD ?<br/>4. How was the general efficiency level improved with the practice of PQD ?</p> <p><strong>1.5 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>The following four (4) hypotheses will be tested <br/>i. Ho1: There is no significant difference between the purchasing organization product quality before PQD and during PQD practice</p> <p>.ii Ho2: The is no significant difference between the purchasing organization product quality before PQD and during PQD practice.</p> <p>iii. Ho3: There is no significant difference between the level of waste before PQD before and during PQD practice</p> <p>Ho4: There is no significant difference between the level of efficiency of operations before and during PQD practice</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH</strong><br/>Theory holds that every organization, regardless of the industry to which it belongs or the nature to which it belongs or the nature, of its activities can make use of Quality determination techniques. Other theorist propound that only organizations with existing managerial problems or ineffective managerial structures needs to adopt PQD .<br/>This research seeks to find out the truth. Quality determination is an off-shoot of other or earlier managerial constructs concept and theorist, this is obvious because the concept of quality is clearly now, now but the concept of Quality determination it is believed that PQD will then open other chapters in the push for more improved methods of running organizations aimed at the attainment of zero error in production. That is, new directions in management theory can be suggested by research, such as this. Although, most theories of PQD are adopted from management theory already in existence, PQD is only interested in refining their practicability to the benefit and or efficient running of the organization. Total quality is an approach to management that has evolved from a narrow focus on statistical process control (SPC) to incorporate a variety of technical behavioural methods of improving organizational performance.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Every study has its limitations fall below. The ideas, which the researcher has established or acknowledge.<br/>Naturally, knowledge of these limitations is essential for an appropriate interpretation of the findings. Devoid of the basic limitation that are general to almost every research such as time, cost of materials, mobility collecting and processing of data, and restrictions related to difficulties in the interpretations of findings as a result of the nature of the characteristics of the population. This research has its own unavailability of related materials, difficult in accessing purchasing organization records, for example, Michelin, for over decades an industry leader in the manufacture of both domestic and industrial size tyres. That was partly as a result of the close guarding of information of any sort or form which could have given up their technological secrets. Notable among the many limitations that brought about by the external environment. That is the multivations extraneous that may account for any success or failures in implementation and , or execution of PQD in the organization. As much as possible, the external environment will be checked or held constant to ensure that reliable result are obtained from this study.</p> <p><strong>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS AND VARIABLES</strong><br/>a. Total quality (TQ)<br/>TQ can best described as anything that an organization, a society or a community does, which in the eyes of other determines its reputation on a comparative basic with the best alternative.<br/>b. Quality determination (PQD )<br/>This is a sub-element of total quality and embraces the managerial and organizations features. It does not include the philosophical or business strategic issues. The word “management” means authoritative control over the affairs of others or an act or instance of guiding or the careful guarding of an asset. (Hutehin 1992).<br/>c. Total Quality determination (TQC)<br/>This is the term used in Japan which frustrates as total quality as earlier described. It is a profound concept and goes far beyond the parameters of PQD . This is because the word “control” implies that there is:<br/>i. A plan<br/>ii. Performance of the plan-doing <br/>iii. Comparism between plan and performance checking<br/>iv. Corrective action on the difference<br/>d. Competitive Benchmarking<br/>This is the attaining and setting of standards that effectively and eventually becomes targets for all serious competitors in the same or related industries. Such comparison of standard can be made in almost any measure, many of which are not industry specific. <br/>Examples includes debtor/vreditor ratios, credit period. Labour turnover, age of employees, training level etc.<br/>Benchmarking is a continous process of measuring a company’s products, services and methods practices either against direct competition or company known and accepted as leaders (Baridan 1998).</p> <p>The measure can be internal, unit to unit, competitive, by product function or services, industry leader, comparison with leaders in the industry, generic, comparison of function or processes which are the same regardless of industry. E.g distribution (Baridan)<br/>Benchmarking study are carried out or done to find out best practise in the critical processes deduction from the organizations critical success factors or CSF’S (Akinduro 1997).<br/>e. Quality Assurance (QA)<br/>This is concerned with the establishment and maintenance of documented procedures designed to ensure that design, development and opoational activities result in product or services contracted requirements.<br/>f. Quality determination (QC) <br/>This embraces all activities concerned with measurement, data collection and analysis, conducted within the plans laid down by QA, which are designed to give early warning of negative trends in processes to enable corrective action to be taken before defective work is produced.<br/>g. Statistical Quality determination (SQC)<br/>This is one and the same with statistical process control (SPC). A part of QC, but including a wide range of technique for the diagnosis, elimination and control of process related problems. The techniques vary from simple to the sglisticated.<br/>h. Inspecting (I)<br/>This has to do with the taking of measurement with comparison purposes after the event of production or the completion of services. While it is hoped that someday this activity will be a thing of the past, it will probably be with us for a long while for obvious reasons. However, it should be noted that inspection adds nothing to the value of the product or services, but rather add it’s cost. If TQ measures are followed strictly, reliance on inspection should almost be eliminated or reduced.</p> <p><strong>1.9 REFERENCES</strong><br/>Akinduro i.total quality is coming, where are we now?

The large-scale industries, which were setup, tended to be capital intensive and in appropriate, given the country’s resources endowment. Their capital equipment and technical manpower have continued to be largely imported. As a result, the triple objective of setting up large-scale industries namely:<br/>1. Achievement of high level employment <br/>2. Local sourcing of raw materials. <br/>3. And saving of foreign exchange acquisition materialized. <br/>In response to the weakness of large-scale manufacturing government has sought to promote small-scale industries as a strategy for self-reliant industrialization. In Nigeria economy, attention has been drawn to the fact that small-scale enterprises have received very little attention where as it is providing employment for approximately triple the number engaged in large-scale manufacturing as well as playing their role which is crucial importance to our developing economy. <br/>This is why it is important to reconsider the problem hindering the growth of his sector. Such problems the researcher has classified into managerial and financial inhibitions as well as some of the government policies, which do not favour small-scale industries.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS </strong><br/>For the period under review, the country’s economic objective were centered on reducing the level of important and promoting the expansion of domestic production especially in the small-scale manufacturing sector. <br/>However, small-scale industries in Nigeria today are faced with a lot of problems. <br/>These problems go a long way to hamper their prospects and growth in the country and thereby limiting their potential contributions to the development of the economy. <br/>Such problems are as follows: <br/>a) Many small-scale industries do not possess a visible feasibility study of their projects. <br/>b) There is also the problem of loan misapplication and non-repayment of loans. <br/>c) They keep poor accounting and business records, and <br/>d) Because of the low capital outlay involved, experts are not often employed. <br/>The researcher will therefore, focus attention on the problems and prospects of parts company limited and what the company should do to alleviate these problems hindering it’s prospects and opportunities available to it.</p> <p><strong>1.3 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF AQUA RAPHA INVESTMENT LTD. </strong><br/>The Aqua Rapha (God’s Healing Water) was established on 15 December 2004, by it’s sole owner Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka. <br/>His ability to generate money out of little or nothing and his interest in business as whole made him engage in small business partnership dealing on the distribution of household goods. <br/>The owner made the feasibility study. The report is not too far from what became the reality. The feasibility study was good, only that there were few under and over estimations due to the on-going inflationary trend in the country and reforms in the economic system of the country (NAFDAC).<br/>The factory is located at 9th mile opposite. Ama Brewearer Plc in Enugu State. The factory is located in this area because f it’s proximity to the source of the raw materials for the productions. The major raw materials used in the production of sachet/packaged water are sourced locally. The manufacturer employs the services of different professionals in manufacturing of the packaged water. <br/>These professionals from different field/department work together to ensure the success of desired quantities that will ensure the company’s targets, objectives and goals. The purchasing department plays their roles by getting all the necessary requirements for the production. The factory men will organize the raw materials and use it in production of complete products. After production, they will communicate stores and stores will pack those products and communicate purchasing for sales there by realizing funds what the finance department will keep for the enhancement of the company. <br/>The programme could have taken of long before now, but the company has a serious financial constraint. The availability and cheapness of the major raw materials also effected the choice of products. <br/>Aqua Rapha Investment Company produces packaged water. Its product capacity is at minimum of Eight hundred and fifty (850) bags that contains (20) sachets, per day. Given an effective annual working period of 240 days the output is modestly placed at 203, 760 (Two hundred and three thousand, seven hundred and sixty) bags per year. <br/>The management of Aqua Rapha Investment Company focus attention on the human side of the enterprises. In other words the behavioural aspect of management is primus. The proprietor of Aqua Rapha Investment Company believes that by rewarding workers adequately they tend to work harder and put in their best to achieve the organization set goals.</p> <p><strong>1.4 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The objectives of this study are:<br/>1) To identify and examine the problems militating against the effective operations of small-scale industries via-the case of company in areas of finance, marketing, technical etc. <br/>2) To identify the prospects available to the case company. <br/>3) And to suggest ways or solutions of solving these identified problems.</p> <p><strong>1.5 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS </strong><br/><strong>Hypothesis I</strong><br/>Ho: Aqua Rapha (God’s Healing Water) does not practice purchasing concept. <br/>Hi: Aqua Rapha Investment Company practices purchasing concept.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2:</strong><br/>Ho: Aqua Rapha Investment Company does not carryout purchasing research. <br/>Hi: Aqua Rapha carryout purchasing research.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 3:</strong><br/>Ho: Consumers are not satisfied with the quality of product produced by Aqua Rapha (God’s Healing Water).<br/>Hi: Consumers are satisfied with the quality of product produced by Aqua Rapha (God’s Healing Water)</p> <p><strong>1.6 LIMITATION OF STUDY </strong><br/>Research study in Nigeria is best with a lot of problems, which include mass illiteracy, little supply of reliable secondary data. Prejudice against the researcher themselves. Under secrecy as well as time and financial constraints. Many of these limitations were experienced the course of our study. However, prominent among these limitations were time and financial constraints. As final year student we had too short time at my disposal for the study, as I had to combine it with other academic work. Some problems were therefore encountered in the conduct of the fieldwork and it was not quite easy to arrange for personal interviews with the general manager, proprietor or the production manager of the Aqua Rapha Investment Company. Our insufficient to financial resources was also a major constraints in limiting the scope of field work at Aqua Rapha Investment Company, the National Directorate of Employment as well as the Nigerian Bank of Commerce and Industry Limited (NBCL).<br/>Other limitations of the study and the inherent short comings in the research methodology by employed. These limitations not withstanding, it is believed that the findings and conclusions reached would be useful for better management of Aqua Rapha Investment Company as well as some other related small-scale enterprises in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong><br/>The following terms used in this study should be taken to mean the following:</p> <p><strong>MARKETING:</strong> Purchasing is defined as all-important set of creative human activities aimed at identifying; anticipating and satisfying human needs and wants through exchange as efficiently and as effectively as possible. <br/>Purchasing is located in the realm of human activities; purchasing needs the degree of intelligence possessed only by human being.

One of the most valuable, often the least understood, is their knowledge base. Management is unable to take formed decisions without knowledge and the quality of that organization knowledge, skills, resides primarily in employees but can also be collected in data bases, reports patents, plans, budgets, memoranda and a variety of other documents. The knowledge base covers all aspects of the organizations activities products, technology, human resources, finance, sales and purchasing and is a wasting asset requiring constant dating, improvement and extension to keep abreast with changes in the operational environment.<br/>Nowhere is the need for detailed, accurate and up to date knowledge more evident than in the purchasing function. The markets have two characteristics, which distinguished them from the other environments in which companies operate. They are:</p> <ol><li>In variable dynamic and are tending to become more so in response to increasing pace of technical development, competitive pressure and a continual uplift n customers’ expectations.</li> <li>Change is caused by a wide diversity of factors most of which are beyond the control of any single supplier.</li> </ol> <p>   Purchasing therefore operate in an inherently unstable environment and it is all too easy for companies to lose touch with conditions in the market they service.<br/>Furthermore, in the quest for growth or even to defend existing market positions, the problem tends to be exacerbated by the fact that companies continually need to do something new. They develop new strategies launch new product, target new market and initiate new service packages – all of which push them into increasingly unfamiliar purchasing  territory.  <br/>Purchasing knowledge is created from a number of inputs experience and expertise are critical, as are experimentation and analysis, but the key dynamic ingredient purchasing information derived from sources within the market place itself, notably customers, competitors and distributors. <br/>Purchasing research is the purchasing information. It is defined by the American purchasing association as the systematic gathering, recording and analyzing of about problems relating to purchasing of goods and services. Purchasing research can also be defined Kolter (20003:129) as the systematic design, collection, analysis and reporting of data and findings relevant to a specific purchasing situation facing the company.<br/>Purchasing research is very important to any organization or company because it is through it that we know the feelings, wants, needs, perceptions and preference of customers/consumers knowing that consumer/customer is the focal point of purchasing and every organization or company will always want to satisfy their customers/clients in other to continue in the business. It is a link between the customer and the general public to the individual, organization of the business firm and also identify and define purchasing opportunities, trends, threats and measurements. <br/>Therefore, this study try to find out how purchasing research is carried out in the service industry – people always believe that purchasing research is more suitable in product/goods offering company and it is not well practice in the service industry due to its certain characteristics. <br/>Service can be defined as any act or performance that one party can offer to another that is essentially intangible and does not result in the ownership anything. (Kotter 2003) services have four major characteristics that greatly affect the design of purchasing programs: intangibility, inseparability, variability and perishability. Services also vary as to whether they are equipment based or people based. It requires the client’s presence and differs as to whether they meet a personal need or business need. Services provided differ in their objectives (i.e. profit or non profit) and ownership (as to private or public). <br/>These have made people believe that purchasing research in the service industry – insurance company, has resulted from the growth of purchasing management and purchasing concept. The basic purpose of applying purchasing research is to reduce purchasing management risks and consequently embrace higher purchasing efficiency. Purchasing research is also used in situation of disagreement or uncertainty amongst the purchasing decision or where the available purchasing research techniques will increase the amount or reliability of purchasing information decision in service industry.<br/>There are certain factors in service industry especially in insurance companies that affect the profitability of the firm such as the impact of legislation and tax concession, size and distribution of population, national income, competition, inflation, use f mass merchandising, packaging policy approach etc it is through purchasing research that these problems will be solved and thus bring profit to the company. The success of any business firm depends to a great extent on the efficiency and aggressiveness of the entire purchasing organization operations, and the effectiveness of the management, working together as a team, towards the accomplishment of the specific and broad corporate goals and objectives. <br/>AIICO insurance company a service industry was established in 1963 as a collection centre, and incorporated in 1970, converted to a public liability company in 1989 and was listed on the Nigeria stock exchange with effect from 3rd December, 1990. To date, AIICO has become the highest life insurance in Nigeria and a major underwriter for general insurance business. The company’s success has been the result of its ability to evaluate its potential set realistic goals and take necessary action to achieve them. They have a separate purchasing department and a research department that undertake the purchasing research work. These activities have to a large extent influenced the overall performance of AIICO insurance company Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong><br/>Despite the large market potentials in service industry and its competitive nature in Enugu State, many companies and business still find it difficult to develop an appropriate offering that will serve the market satisfactorily.<br/>ALLCO insurance company faced very stiff opposition from other insurance companies especially other foreign owned insurance brokers and agents at its on set due to fear of the uncertain effects that its entry into the industry might cast on their business prospects, thus were reluctant to assist the company.<br/>Also, the level of insurance awareness in the country is still very low, at present about 10-15 percent of the Nigerian population are insured, unlike developed countries this resulting in low productivity and profitability. <br/>Consequently, there have been allegation of AIICO insurance company not compensating the unfortunate policy holders, all these have resulted in negative attitude towards their services, thus have resulted to loss in profit. This research takes an in-depth look at this allegation and other pro problems in other to proffer an amenable attitude towards AIICO insurance company.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The objectives of this study are to ascertain,</p> <ol><li>What type of purchasing research activities are available to companies especially those activities that AIICO insurance company is interested in conducting? </li> <li>What proportion of purchasing budget is allocated to the purchasing activities in a given period in AIICO insurance company?</li> <li>Whether the company has its own established purchasing research department or if they hire the services of purchasing research consultants.</li> <li>The source of their purchasing data and the method used in analysis such data from which information is derived.</li> <li>Whether purchasing research creates awareness in AIICO insurance company.</li> <li>If purchasing research increases the policy holders in AIICO insurance company</li> <li>Whether purchasing research contributes to increase profit in AIICO insurance company.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   FORMULATION OF HYPOTHESES </strong><br/>The following hypotheses were formulated and tested.<br/>Ho:   Purchasing research does not create awareness of AIICO insurance company <br/>HI:    Purchasing research creates awareness of AIICO Insurance Company.<br/>Ho2:  Purchasing research does not increase the number of policy holders.<br/>HI2:  Purchasing research increases the number of policy holders.<br/>Ho3:  Purchasing research does not increase profit of AIICO Insurance Company.<br/>HI3:  Purchasing research increases profit of AIICO Insurance Company.</p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong>                                                                                         </p> <p>Olakunori (1997:20) defined purchasing research as the planned and systematic investigation and collection of relevant facts, the analysis and interpretation of those facts through objective and verifiable methods, for the purpose of arriving at solution of problems or deducing broad principles or laws”. Putting it another way, the research is a planned process of conducting investigations in other to achieve a determined objectives.<br/>The objective is usually a solution to one or more problem or an addition to current knowledge in particular field. It is against this background that the researcher believes that the study f this nature is necessary. The outcome of this study will provide an adequate understanding on the application of then various purchasing research to service business/industry.<br/>Also this research work will help to ensure an improvement in the quality of service rendered to customers and the public by AIICO insurance company and could as well help the management design strategies and programmes which will enable them to remain competitive. <br/>The research work also helps other service firms to understand more correctly the basic principles of purchasing research and its place in the service business/industry so as to influence future purchasing operations.<br/>Finally, the researcher will benefit immensely in this study because he will learn a lot through the stages of study by passing through all the critical and difficult tasks required in gathering necessary information and the subsequent analysis, interpretation and presentation of the research findings. </p> <p><strong>1.6   THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The study takes a look into the purchasing research activities of insurance firms in service industry. Because of time and other factors involved, the researcher was limited to the study of particular insurance firm known as AIICO insurance company operating at Enugu metropolis. It examines the conduct/operations of purchasing research activities in the industry.</p> <p><strong>1.7   DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong><br/>Purchasing: this is the process of planing and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational goals.

An organization especially a manufacturing in a very competitive needs to examine how it can effectively develop plan and strategies for serving its purchasing.<br/>The aim of any purchasing operation is to make the future happier. But this was not well recognized by most firms initially so job that should be handled by experts in the field of purchasing were given to less qualified personnel’s and in most case this shorten the life of most business. <br/>Planning is the management function of setting target or objective to be achieved and detailing out ways by which the target will be achieved.<br/>Planning is sometime greater than first thinking ahead. In manufacturing organization (Anammco) purchasing planning and control show who is to do the job (qualified purchasing personnel’s) how the qualified purchasing personnel’s will carryout the job and when the job will be done. <br/>Purchasing planning and control share with the others activities of the purchasing mix the distinction in commerce of being a dynamic element in operation of business. The effective of purchasing planning and control in a manufacturing organization enable the organization to absorb possible shock emitting from purchasing environmental change. <br/>The subject matter is chosen by the researcher to explain the foregoing Anamco marketing planning and control in other to know its effectiveness. <br/>According to Adirika (2003, P.11) in this lecture note, “purchasing planning is an exercise of analysis for and to increase the effectiveness of purchasing. Or drawing from the past to decide in the present what to do in further in other to achieve the purchasing objective enterprise efficient effective. <br/>Purchasing planning does not depends on only theory or book knowledge. In other to plan effectively we need to understand and know about our own environment (Macro – and Mirco environment) where the purchasing plan will operate. <br/>For purchasing planning and control to be effective the qualified purchasing personnel that carried out the purchasing and control may consider some element or feature such as time.<br/>Purchasing planning and control will be effective if the plan has a stated time, for completion, the estimate of time may be varied depending on the product or firm.<br/>For purchasing planning and control to be effective the money for material needed for the effective planning must be available and human resources. <br/>The qualified purchasing personnel’s would have a group of consumers or target markets in mind and then position the organization’s or company’s product on this target market or segment. <br/>Purchasing control played a vital role in a manufacturing organization. If all purchasing programme or plan along with other sub function are ideal and well harnessed but lack control it will be likened to driving a well structured comfortable vehicle without a steering on a very busy road.<br/>Control is the vital follow – up process which is complementary to planning while purchasing planning is deciding in advance what needs to be done, how and when it should be done.<br/>As clearly recognized decade ago in an undertaking control consist on verifying whether everything occurs in conformity with the plan adopted, the instruction issued and principle established. It has for object to point out weakness and error in order to rectify them and present recurrence. <br/>Purchasing control as concerned with establishing and maintaining appropriate procedure and apparatus for monitoring and measuring the implementation of purchasing plan and strategies set out to active purchasing objective and taking necessary corrective action.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>It has been said that planning is determining the future ad control what have been planned. <br/>In having good and effective purchasing planning and control in a manufacturing organization, some basic problem confront purchasing management.<br/>One of the problem is availability of funds to the purchasing department, the company may lack adequate finance to carryout set purchasing planning and control effective. The absence of funds at the right time to back the plan means incapacitate by the executive in implementing the plan and ensuring that deviation are connected.<br/>Another problem may be problem of recruitment of qualified personnel to handle the planning and having experience person to execute the set plan.<br/>Frequent change of purchasing personnel may also contribute or improve the effectiveness of purchasing planning and control in a manufacturing organization. <br/>In looking at this, one would want to know the effectiveness of purchasing planning and control in a manufacturing organization how it can be effectively implemented and also the various ways to improve on it effectiveness to achieve organizational goals and objective.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>1) The primary objective of this study is to know the effectiveness of purchasing panning and control in a manufacturing organization (ANAMMCO)<br/>2) This study will enable the research to know some basic problems that develop in the process of having good purchasing planning and control in a manufacturing organization. <br/>3) This study will provide the researcher some solution to the problem and reduce bottleneck in planning process of the particular organization. <br/>4) To know the benefit on good purchasing planning and control in a manufacturing organization. <br/>5) This research can equally serve as a base for further study on topic related to the subject.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong><br/>1) The presence of unqualified purchasing personnel’s makes Purchasing planning and control ineffective.<br/>2) Due to frequent change of purchasing personnel’s, Purchasing planning and control in ANAMMCO becomes ineffective. <br/>Lack of effective improvement and change in Purchasing plans and control doesn’t led to lose of market to other competing firms by Anamco.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The significance of the stud is to draw the attention of other researchers in the field of business especially purchasing to be interested in the conduct of more indept research in the area of the Purchasing planning and control effectively.<br/>The idea will act as a framework ie to put the plan together to direct market managers on how to put the plan together so s to make it effective in formulating good Purchasing planning and control over foreign investor in Nigeria. <br/>The study will also induce business managers, entrepreneurs, purchasing managers, and sales managers to take proper care to develop a purchasing pan and control that will be devoid of the problem identified by the research in the study. This write up is also expected to teach young learners to serve as history for them during their own time of learning.<br/>Based on the findings, the researcher will work within his scope to provide some solution to the research problems and reduce unavoidable ones.</p> <p><strong>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>Planning: Is deciding in the present what to do in the future. <br/>Control: A process of monitoring what has been planned <br/>Strategy: Is the pattern of major objective purpose of goal and essential <br/>Policies and plan for achieving those goal stated. <br/>Effectiveness: To be able to bring about the result intended. <br/>Manufacturing Organization: Those companies that produced good <br/>Either consumer goods or industrial goods for consumption or for further product. <br/>Qualified Purchasing Personnel’s: They are those purchasing that are <br/>Competent in carrying out purchasing activities in an organization.<br/>Goal / objectives: What the company intends to achieve. <br/>Potential Customers: Those people that may be the company’s products <br/>Market: Is the set of all actual and potential buyers of the company <br/>Product <br/>Market Opportunity: Is an area of buyer need in which a company can<br/>perform profitably. <br/>Purchasing Mix: Is the set of purchasing tools that the firm uses to pursue<br/>its purchasing objective in the target market.</p>\n\nEFFECTIVENESS OF PURCHASING PLANNING AND CONTROL IN A MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTIVENESS OF PURCHASING PLANNING AND CONTROL IN A MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Negotiation is seen as a vital element as well as one of the most interesting topic in purchasing and supply chain management. It applied in purchasing so as to arrive at a fair and reasonable business contract.<br/>Consequently, upon recent shortages of materials, high prices and galloping inflation, general unfriendly supply market as well as the get-rich quick syndrome of some supplied it will be suicidal for a business firm and indeed government agencies to ignore negotiation exercise in its purchasing activities making process of planning, reviewing and analyzing used by the buyer and seller to reach acceptable agreement or compromise on all aspects of the business transaction. (Lee <br/>In purchasing of material, some measures of trust exist between the buyer and the seller when negotiation begins identically, there would be equally of information on cost and estimates between parties involved, as a basis for negotiation, but this is rarely attained except in government’s research and development (R and D). The negotiation is thus usually a dialogue between the buyer and seller to produce a contract, which is at least acceptable to both parties.</p> <p><strong>1.1.1 BRIEF HISTORY OF THE COMPANY</strong><br/>The name of the company is Rokana Industries Plc Nekede and it as incorporated on September 1978 as a private limites liability company. <br/>The nature of the business is manufacturing and it was founded by Engr. Charles Ugwu, a British trained industrialist/Engineer in 1978.<br/>The managing-Director is Chief Ekemma Geophry now while Engineer Charles Ugwu is the Chief Executive of the company.<br/>The factory is divided into three basic areas namely: Administration, Marketing/sales and promotion. It has a branch in Lagos as their registered street off 52 Ogundana street Allen Avenue Ikeja Lagos. Over 80% of the raw materials for the production of the product are imported.</p> <p>They also have sales outlets in Abuja, Kaduna, and Lagos. The company is hundred percent Nigerian owned while Union Bank Nigeria Plc own 40% shares of the company product produce.<br/>Rokana currently maintains four existing manufacturing units.<br/>1. The Cosmetic Units: This unit undertakes the production of the tooth paste, baby-care cosmetics, skin lotions, cream and oiltment.<br/>2. The Plastic Units: This unit produces tooth brush, dental stick, plastic folders, plagues for the Areosol production.<br/>3. Aerosol Unit: This unit produces insecticide air fresheners, perfumes, furniture polish, deodrant etc.<br/>4. The LPG Unit: This unit refills domestic cooking gas cylinder, provides unstauncheal gas,as propellant to the aerosol production line.</p> <p><strong>1.5 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>Strictly, this project is a case study of the impact for efficient negotiation in purchasing function in manufacturing company at Rokana Industries Limited Nekede Owerri Imo State.<br/>The impact for efficient negotiation in purchasing function in manufacturing company can not be over stated. This is because when fairly in contract management result from poor negotiation. <br/>The problem of the study therefore are as follow:<br/>1. Firms or organization fair to see the element of pricing and negotiation as a vital element in contract management.<br/>2. Most firms adopt the concept of I will” when you loose attitude this result into poor project execution.<br/>3. Most people involving in purchasing of capital and mangement do not possess the right skill and knowledge of negotiation.<br/>4. The economic situation of the country has serious effect on the quality of negotiation purchasing function in manufacturing company firm attempt.<br/>5. There is no serious attempt on the part of firms to empower negotiation contract managers.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE</strong><br/>In the light of the statement of problem this study aims at achieving the following objectives.<br/>1. To create serious awareness in the mind of firms and their employees on these serious impact for effective contract negotiation, pricing and contract implementation.<br/>2. To make people appreciate the importance of effective negotiation which emphasizes win-win negotiation.<br/>3. To create the necessary awareness on the importance of empowering those who are involved in contract negotiation pricing and management through treating seminars etc.<br/>4. To investigate the impact of the economic on contract negotiation pricing and execution.<br/>5. To see whether negotiation contract management and pricing can be improved through empowerment.<br/>6. To suggest other ways of improving negotiation contract pricing and management.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study would have taking the researcher to all firms that are engaged in contract negotiation, pricing and management in Nigeria but for obvious reason the researcher is constraint to concentrate on the negotiation activities of Rokana industrial limited Owerri. The researcher beliefs that this would give her a fair situation position in other similar organizations.<br/>However, the researcher will concentrate on the following department or units within the organization:-<br/>1. The cosmetic unit <br/>2. The plastic unit<br/>3. The Aerosol unit <br/>4. The LPG unit</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>One important thing a researcher of this nature impact s to achieve is to provide the subject matter of the study. It therefore become necessary to formulate research questions on which the answer would be based and are as follows:<br/>1. Are negotiation and pricing basic element of contract.<br/>2. Is poor contract administration tractable to poor pricing and negotiation.<br/>3. Does your organization attach importance in carrying adequate negotiation before placing orders.<br/>4. Does your organization achieve any efficient age as a result of effective and efficient negotiation via efficient purchasing.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The primary significance of this study is for partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of Higher National Diploma (HND) in purchasing and supply.<br/>The secondary significance is also geared towards exploring the academic relationship between classroom theory and what is practically attainable in industries and government establishment thus the carefulness in choosing the research topic.<br/>The third significance of the project is to help and guide the younger ones on what to do when writing project or carrying out any research.<br/>The fourth significance of the project is to guide industrial purchasing s to effective and efficient negotiation to enable them to obtain the “best buy which is the ultimate goal of the purchasing function.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Infact, there cannot be any successful research of this magnitude without encountering some difficulties. This project work is surrounded by some limitation, which indicated that it was not hitch free.</p> <p>The following were some problem that was encountered in carrying out the following work.<br/>1. Difficulties in securing some vital documents containing some valid information relating to the subject matter of the research.<br/>2. The lukewarm attitudes of some offices who were supposed to attend and give reasonable response. Some of those interviewed failed to give adequate information believing that it will reveal their lapses and loopholes.<br/>3. The degree of time consumed at the expenses of lectures and other important assignments. This cannot be over emphasized.<br/>4. Finally, finance was another constraint for the researcher. Normally, a considerable amount of money for the gathering of information, typing of manuscripts.</p> <p><strong>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>The terms here are some of the terms used in this project work necessary because these terms have their own professional meanings in purchasing other than the grammatical definition.<br/><strong>1.

A clearly defined means for ensuring a better performance or productivity in respective of any business organization is by getting people and organizational subunits to conflict for successful strategy implementation, which involves creativity using an equitable reward mechanism or as deems appropriate.<br/>It is on this note that this had been investigated and identified that no matter how efficient and supplicated organizational machines, tools and equipment, together with it vats financial and materials resources, the relevance and utilize the importance to organizational survival. In an adverse impact resulting from improper conduct posits a cheat to the success any organization. An adequate present of both physical and financial resources does not guarantee economic development.<br/>Hence activities need to be co-ordinate, organized and put into practiced terms by human elements (people) to help an organization to succeed. Human being is the nerve centre of everything if you go deep into any problem, you would get people, organization be it public or private are social system composed of denominator among this categories are people. The human elements is involved in the designing, building down to the operation or organization structure. People are also involves in the department and use of appropriate technology for achieving organization goals and objective.<br/>Similarly, people form different spheres of life directly influence their immediate environment the consequence of which is later translated to either elements is therefore the most important and versatile resources in any consideration, the non-challant attitude of workers is said to have resulted to the low level of commitment in earlier official who have failed to recognize and protect the interest of workers. In accordance with these, it has possibly been argued that if there’s no positive correction between this effort (input) and productivity (output), then there will be no justifiable reason on why employee should take the blame for a decline in productivity. It would be disastrous if we pretend that there are no productivity crises in our country and more dangerous to think that it constitutes no serious threat to our economy, Nigeria’s know to have witnessed series of low productivity within her productive sector compared to other developing country of the world. Since the early 1980’s when Nigeria recorded a massive set back, there has been a down ward trend in productivity ad sloppy economic performance.<br/>With the advent of structural adjustment programme in 1986, the capacity utilization of our industrialization had shrunk to all time low motivation to work, poor work attitude and bad ethics, all these threat together and in an attempt to address the situation had in recent time put the country into a state of choice.<br/>Before 1912, when the trade union was established, there was no trade union in existence to fight for the interest of work shot into performance prior to the emergence and acceptability of the union by management workers began to see the need to fight for concessions from their employers in terms of human treatment encouraged by the struggle and gains or organized labour union other parts of the world. Where this struggle and concession is labour ultimate weapon (conflict).<br/>Conflict is initiated with the intent to marking collective bargaining impactive and involved a temporary refusal of employees to continue which work until management has granted their request. A conflict could be devastating in that, it can couple an economy and command everything or a stand still.

Are these profits made at me expense of the customers or is it as a result of the seminar provided by these banks.<br/>This study attempts to highlight those key factors that different banks managements will consider in their choice of branch locations and customers preferences for their choice of banks to serve them. This will enable banks to focus on the critical factor that affect market preferences.<br/>The study was done using survey research design with questionnaire as due key instrument for collecting primary data. A total of 1000 and 200 bank customer and officials questionnaire respectively were duly completed and analyzed. Based on the analysis of the generated formulated hypothesis were tested at 95% level of significance using 2 test of proportion.<br/>The underlisted constitute some of the major findings of the study, management of Banks have special preference for large markets like Lagos and Aba for their branch locations. Marketing activities of banks in these large markets are directed at protecting and expanding their stream of revenues in these areas. Banks in both markets describe the nature of their banking business in terms of the product/services they offer and their I.T power.<br/>In the light of these findings, the study recommends that, Banks should posses profitable and complete range of product, continuous product service innovations and improvements. Banks should always invest heavily in information technology to remain relevant and profitable. As banks must to open branches in these markets, it is appropriate for banks to make their customer dependent on them and gain their trust and confidence.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The deregulation of the Nigerian economy came into being in 1986. By that time, the banking industry was one of the most vibrant and most sought after by investor in Nigeria. According to Nwankwo (1991:2), the number of commercial and merchant banks rose from 33 (thirty three) commercial banks and 15 merchant banks in 1987 to 65 (sixty five) and 47 (forty seven) respectively in 1991.<br/>The bank industry entered this decade with less caution but aware of global economic changes. According to Clausen (1990:12) the industry entered the new decade well aware that the world was about to change but in retrospect not fully realizing the far- reaching extent of that change nor its velocity and impact. In the ensuring six years the industry was unable to respond rapidly enough to the wrenching dislocation brought by deregulation, fierce new competition and unstable world economy. Crisis erupted within the first quarter of this decade and the condition deteriorated in the following area:<br/>1. The industry was losing money, with not losses in billions since mid nineties.<br/>2. Some of the banks suspended payment of dividends on their common stocks:<br/>3. Some of the banks were facing hostile takeover attempts by the regulatory bodies (NDIC and CBN)<br/>4. Regulatory bodies had directed several banks boards of Directors to redress the worsening capital base and <br/>5. Questions were raised about some of the banks ability to survive independently.<br/>Marketing in the banking industry in Nigeria as we know today, owes much to the survival strategies of some new generation commercial and merchant banks after the banking distress of 1992 through 1996. This development attends the tastes and demands of the society stimulated competition and created selling opportunities and rewards. The banking habits now spread throughout the social classes.<br/>New services have been introduced as the bank met competition, fill gaps in their services range, or try to steal a march on the competition by endeavouring to discover and satisfy the needs of new niche markets. Business customers have also witnessed the wind of change as the banks gained a greater appreciation in its highly profitable corporate markets. Thus, the banks own marketing expertise has been pushed along by competition and a desire to gain market share. It has also been pulled along it’s customers demanding more flexible advantageously priced and comprehensive facilities.<br/>The needs of customers, and prospective ones, cannot be ignored by any bank especially in larger markets like Lagos and Aba environment. Relying merely on selling only those services which are already available is, at best, a short-term expedient, as market attitudes preference, technology and environmental factors are constantly changing.<br/>To survive profit must be earned by banks and part of this process involves containment of cost when seeking the most profitable markets to exploit. Therefore, banks resources must be channeled towards the potentially more profitable “Banking markets” which in turn, necessitates making a choice among larger markets like Lagos, Aba, Kano, Onitsha, Kaduna etc. It is the identification of the right balance of resources that calls for the marketing skills of research, planning and assessment.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Without customers, banks would have no revenues. Marketing is directed at protecting and expanding this stream of revenue. Organization (including banks) regards customers wherever they may be as their single most important reason for existing. They operate in a rapidly changing, regulatory and economic environment. Consequent upon this, it is the job of the marketer to understudy and understand the purchase decision/patterns of these customers who have been known to be difficult and complex in nature. The task become even different in the light of increasing competition, growing customer sophistication, and innovation in an environment of trade liberalization, financial deregulation and internationalization. The problem was further compounded by the recession in the economy, which led to the introduction of S.A.P (1990: 15) pointed out, between 1986 and 1992, there were low capacity utilization in most industries, declining per capita- income and reduced disposable income. The bank sector thus become more competitive and business environment like Lagos, Aba, Onitsha, Port Harcourt, Kano, etc developed peculiar business climates/markets, and attracted a large number of bank branches to their areas. Against this background, it became necessary for us to establish the locational factors that influence banks in the marketing of their financial services, with particular reference to Lagos and Aba markets.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</strong><br/>The objective of this study is to examine the locational factors influencing the marketing of financial services in Lagos and Aba markets. It will seek to do the following:<br/>i Examine if there are locational differences between factors affecting banks preference for Lagos and Aba markets.<br/>ii Consider the factors that determine banks preferences for a particular location in both Lagos and Aba markets.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>For the purpose of this research, the following <br/>Questions will act as guide;<br/>1. Why are banks establishing many branches in Lagos and Aba markets?<br/>2. Do banks through various branches lend more in Lagos and Aba markets and make more profits?<br/>3. Does accessibility to these bank branches influence the patronage of customers in these markets?<br/>4. Is response time to customer’s enquiries and transactions in these areas an important attraction?<br/>5. How important is technology (system support, computer etc.) to the customers in these areas?</p> <p><strong>FORMULATION OF HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>Ho: Banks are not establishing many branches in Lagos and Aba markets;<br/>Hi: Banks are establishing many branches in Lagos <br/>and Aba markets;<br/>Ho: Bank do not lend more in their branches in Lagos and markets and make more profit.<br/>Ho: Accessibilities to these bank branches does not influence their patronage in this bank market;<br/>Hi: Accessibilities to these banks branches influences their patronage in these markets;<br/>Ho: Response time to customers’ enquires and <br/>transaction is not an attraction to bank customers in Lagos and Aba markets;<br/>Hi: Response time to customers’ enquires and transaction is an attraction to bank customers in Lagos and Aba markets.<br/>Ho: Technology is not an important factors affecting customers’ preference in these areas.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This study shall be restricted to Lagos and Aba business/Banking environment Lagos and Aba market were chosen because:<br/>1. The head offices of about 90% of the banks are in Lagos.<br/>2. The banks that do not have their head offices in Lagos, have regional offices and/or head office annexes<br/>3. Many banks have either regional office and / or area offices in Aba.<br/>4. Lagos is the nations industrial capital with over 75% of the more bank users.<br/>5. The under listed 10 (ten) banks (by number of branches), have at least five branches in Lagos and at least two branches in Aba (excluding their cash centers).<br/>BANKS BRANCHES NET WORK RANKING MARKETING SLOGANS<br/>First bank of Nig. plc 319 1 Truly, the first<br/>Union bank of Nig .plc 284 2 Big, strong, Reliable<br/>United bank for Africa 219 3 The wise choice in banking<br/>Afribank Nig. plc 137 4 The one stop bank<br/>Savannah bank of Nig. 87 5 We treat you like a person.<br/>Bank of the North Ltd. 86 6 We earn your confidence<br/>Wema Bank plc 86 7 Reaching for greater heights<br/>Standard trust bank Ltd. 77 8 Vision to become a role model for Africa B12<br/>Habib Nig bank Ltd. 55 9 The bank with a difference<br/>All State Trust bank plc. 47 10 The professional Bank.<br/>Respondents for the study will be drawn from Banks senior officials and individual bank customers and due objectives will be to find out what inform their bank (branch) Locational considerations the under listed have been identified as some of the limiting factors:<br/>1. Bas of Respondents:- The respondents are form different backgrounds with their own prejudices since they have no direct stake in this study. The reliability of data generated from them is suspect and will be fraught with many inconsistencies.<br/>2. Sampling error:- I have only a sample to represent the entire population. The sample was selected using convenience- sampling technique since the sample is just a small representation of the entire population, sampling error is therefore inevitable.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong><br/>This research will attempt to show the locational factors influencing the marketing of financial services in Lagos and Aba markets. Issues to be analyzed will include people banking habits: branch network; technology application; interest rates on Loans; security of funds, response time amongst others. The customers will be classified into 2 (two) broad group for analysis viz corporate bodies, and<br/>i. Corporate bodies, and <br/>ii. Individuals<br/>We shall therefore strive to establish the existence of differences in factors that influence various bank choice of location in Lagos and Aba business banking environment.<br/>Having established the existence of a difference or lack of it. The research will then make suggestions that would help banks price their product better in the Lagos and Aba competitive banking environments, improve on their technology applications, ensure security of customers funds and other general attributes that customers consider vital.</p>\n\nIMPACT OF PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES ON THE MARKETING OF GOLDEN MORN PRODUCTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES ON THE MARKETING OF GOLDEN MORN PRODUCTS", "id": 50}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The Nigeria economy got in power till 1986 a highly regulated economy with local, state and federal government owing a large value proportion of the national economy. <br/>However, with the introduction of Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in August 1986. The national economy was deregulated and most of the control were abolished while the price mechanisms system or the market force system was introduced to determine the price of goods and services. Before the introduction of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), the purchasing industry, like other sector of the economy was owned largely and controlled by the government. <br/>The sector was dominated by those referred to as the Big four i.e. Intercontinental Company, Africompany, UBA and First Company. However with deregulation of the economy brought about the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), many private participants entered the industry. The competition brought by those company offered some basic services some of the service offered by company are receiving deposit of customers, collecting cheques of customers drawn on themselves. From this traditional function developed other services referred to as services purchasing. It is a related purchasing services and now purchasing activities. <br/>A list of services offered by company include acceptance and safe keeping of deposits and other valuable, granting of loans and overdraft to customers, transfer of funds business services foreign exchange services, money creation, cashing credit facility, project financing service funds transfer outside and within Nigeria, letter of credit and foreign currency domiciliary account etc. <br/>Finally, these services benefit both the provide (Company and the receive customers) as well as the economy without them company cannot be in business and the economy will not grow individuals and corporate activities will also be hampered. It is based on these facts that company services become very vital even before the advent of modern purchasing activities. <br/>Paterson Zochoms (PZ) industries limited was incorporated on 4th December 1948, under the name of P.M Nicholas and company limited to take over the soap making activities of Mr. P.B. Nicholas who had some years prior to that data established a factory for that purpose.<br/>Paterson Zochoms itself was incorporated in England in 1884, become a public company quoted in the London and Northern is that o general merchants in activity is that of interest now includes city in Nigeria, Ghana, sierra Leona and textile whole selling in the united kingdom.<br/>In 1957, Mr P.B. Nicholas sold out his interest in the company to P.Z, two years later the company change it name to Alaghon industries limited, and in 1960 adopted the name associated industries 1976, the company change its name to Paterson Zochoms industries limited.<br/>After incorporation in 1948, new factory buildings were erected and modern soap making equipment installed at Aba.<br/>During the years 1967 to 1970, manufacturing operation at the Aba factory was disrupted, and in consequence the company operated in vented premises in Lagos, a factory which enabled it to its customers. The manufacturing buif and equipped factory premises near Logos. The company’s range of products include bar soap and tablet soap perfumery. Cosmetics, confectionery medicaments and pharmaceuticals, all which are distributed throughout Nigeria with butter stock held at strategic centers. The company (P.Z) is well known through its Duck, premier and joy soaps, Rubb ointment, mint super mint pomade, jet hair cream, Venus de Milo rage of cosmetics, Danfulani pomade, Elephant, Apc etc.<br/>All these categories of product must be sold to enable organization attain its objectives that has already been set. It is when consumers are happy with the organization can make the employee happy. The big question therefore is can public relation serve effective as an instrument for attaining the entire corporate objective.<br/><strong><br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong><br/>i.

If a part of human body is not functioning well, then the whole body will suffer the pain. This explains the relationship between the various functional departments of any business organization. If one department is inefficient or not functioning as it should, it will strongly undetermine the efficiency of others. This is why it is very important for all the branches in any organization to be harmonized and galvanized so that they will see themselves as one and aiming progressively to actualize a certain goal.</div> <div>          This is why materials management expert have confirmed it that materials are the heart of any organization, and because no human being can survive without blood, the organization cannot survive without materials, this is why conscious effort has to be made at acquiring materials in a way that will save the organization cost. These materials must be efficiently utilized.</div> <div>          Stocktaking and stockcontrol are those activities performed which are aimed at ensuring the availability of material both in the right quantity and quality. This helps the organization not to witness a stock-out situation or capital tie down inform of heavy stock carrying. And the method that can help in avoiding these two abnormal phenomena is considered to be a good stocktaking and stock control techniques exercise in the organization like the Nigeria Breweries</div> <div><strong>1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></div> <div>          The increasing specialization of industry in recent times has progressively enhance the importance of this topic because of the tendency for firms to concentrate in the manufacturing of their own specialist line and to buy out an increasing proportion of materials either in a semi process condition or in the form of finished parts.</div> <div>          The development of centralized industries, the over-widening range of technical materials and equipment in Nigeria Breweries and the importance to meet up with over increasing quantity of materials serve to emphasize the value of adequate stocktaking procedures.</div> <div><strong>1.2     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>          The main objective of this research work is to lay emphasis on the importance for the need of accurate stocktaking and stock control method.</div> <div>          It will also further classify the importance or benefits acquired from an efficient implementation of coding system. This is carried out with the case study of Nigeria Breweries Plc.</div> <div><strong>1.3     IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>          The importance of this research work is based on improving the techniques of stocktaking and stock control. It will also improve the steps involve in stocktaking.</div> <div>          The study will also enable the reader to know much about stock discrepancies and to improve efficiency and profits through proper stocktaking and stock control.

Such as lowering cost structures, maintaining the product quality of a company, ability to meet customer requirements, and lot of other benefits.</div> <div>This study attempts to evaluate the impact of sourcing in the profitability of company using ZARTECH LIMITED as a case study. It seeks to examine the responses of the procurement department on how suppliers are selected during the process of procurement of materials, which will eventually help to increase the company’s profit.</div> <div>This study drew literature on sourcing strategies and its benefits from several sources. Data were gathered from Zartech limited and also from other sources like internet, text books, journal e.tc. Results of analysis of the data collected show that the company contacted are convinced that sourcing is a necessity for the profitability of any company however they agreed that sourcing strategies should be effectively carried out. Other facts were elucidated by the study but generalization of the study findings cannot be total, due to certain limitations.</div> <div> <div><strong><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></strong></div> <br/> <div><strong><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></strong></div> <div><strong>Over the years, procurement function contains activities that have attracted the attention of many researchers and companies worldwide. However, most studies conducted focused only on the manufacturing industries and associated with functional indicator.</strong></div> <div>          This research presents and discusses some key points and noticed important changes recording the ways business are carried out. In connection with the market worldwide process managerial models have been customer constantly reviewed and improved, as well as new concepts and paradigms, such as the contemporary business and mass customization, have quickly emerged. It is this competitive context that the supply chains management (SCM) should be understood.</div> <div>          A supply chain can be represented by a group of integrated logical process that originates from source of raw materials and comprises several companies, until products are delivered to final customers in form of goods and aggregated services.</div> <div>          In the past, every layman in Nigeria were ignorant of what exactly purchasing and supply is all about. Most people believe that procurement of raw materials is non-task or a non-issue matter.</div> <div>          Foremost, most manufacturing companies of which ZARTECH LIMITED MAYA happens to be one of them, dispose more than half of its income on materials, supplies and services. We would bear in mind that intensive sourcing is the rudiments of purchasing.</div> <div>          Sourcing comprises of the identification or development of suitable sources. Sourcing decision indicates which supplier to patronize. How many suppliers are needed to supply a given item?</div> <div>          How to allocate available business and in what term to do the business, the continuing relationship both with preferred sources which are still in the running although they have been passed over for the present.</div> <div>          For its proper performance, sourcing requires supply market research. This is often undertaken informally by the buyers as part of their buying work, when they interview salesman, visit exhibition, read trade journals, obtain catalogues and research the market before placing an order. It is sometime undertaking formally by research personnel, in a purchasing services section as a support function to the buyers. Supply market research identifies the set of actual and potential supply sources which contribute the market, investigates their capabilities analyses the structural features of the market trends and long term supply prospects, and generally keep on ear to the ground.    </div> <div>          Purchasing does not mean buying raw materials Only, but it involve determining the needs, selecting the supplier (S), arriving at affordable price, terms and condition issuing the contract or order and following basic elements involved in performing the purchasing function which are: Obtain the procurement of materials, goods and services of the right quality, in the right quantity, from the right source at the right price and at the right time.</div> <div>          Infact, purchasing was formally regarded purely as function, where the purchasing department acts on behalf of all department in its organization which requires an item to be purchased, and also hand all contracts and orders between its organization and the supplier.</div> <div>          But now, purchasing is seen as a major impact on profitability. Expediting action in finding better or cheaper new sources of purchasing and quality responsible for the entire ranges of materials and commodities required by the company for efficient maintenance of adequate stock levels at the central store.</div> <div>          From the above introduction, it is clearly shown that it is impossible for any organization to achieve its full goals objectives without a successful sourcing and procurement activities. Therefore, the success of business enterprises greatly depend on sourcing and procurement of raw materials for the organization’s objectives.</div> <div><strong>1.1     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>          The main objective of this studies is to examine the impact of sourcing, as a supply chain function on the profitability of a company and its importance in the manufacturing industries in Nigeria and to identify problems and difficulties in sourcing and procurement of these materials with a view to finding possible solutions to the problem.</div> </div>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF SOURCING AS A SUPPLY CHAIN FUNCTION ON THE PROFITABILITY OF A COMPANY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF SOURCING AS A SUPPLY CHAIN FUNCTION ON THE PROFITABILITY OF A COMPANY", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>          Transportation plays a key role in the development of a nation. This factor has long been seen as a major element helping the Economy to grow rapidly. It has recently been observed that transportation assist other sectors of the economy in carrying out their functions.</div> <div>          In the course of this research work, it was discovered that much needed attention is not been given to transportation. In the course of this research work, NNPC depot is chosen as a case study for the research work.</div> <p>          A theoretical analysis, backed by observations, oral interview at depot and review of so many authors contributed to the successful of this research work after which hypothesis were formulated and tested with response from the sample size.<br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>Development is made possible by many factors. Transport is the leading factor. Economic and social progress can only take place if the determinants of a satisfactory life that is food, health, education and employment are generally available.</div> <div>          In recent years, transport have seen a revolution with the advent of mass air travel, high and rapidly rising of personal mobility based on car ownership as well as public vehicles and restructured distribution channel. All these have encouraged the growth of industries and commerce in a country. This can be summed up in this quote that say: transport provided the formative power of economic growth and the differentiating process” (Voigt 1967).</div> <div>          The Economy is now looking at transportation to provide rapid growth.</div> <div><strong>1.1     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></div> <p>The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) depot Apata was established in 1979. It is controlled by the products and pipelines marketing company (PPMC). This Company is a subsidiary company of the NNPC while NNPC is a Federal Government Corporation. </p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF TRANSPORTATION ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS FROM DEPORT TO SALES OUTLET <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF TRANSPORTATION ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS FROM DEPORT TO SALES OUTLET ", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>          Successful business management rely mostly on well co-ordinated function of activities, these include finance, personnel, production, marketing and purchasing.</div> <div>          All of these functions form this activities that makes up a business organisation, however if one these functions is weak, it will definitely affect the overall efficiency of the other functions. Purchasing which is one of the   business activities is as old as the birth of business enterprise itself and it is considered to be the basic function of activity in an organisation.</div> <div>          Purchasing is the attempt by business organizations to acquire goods or services or materials needed in order to accomplish the goals of the enterprise. This can be viewed from two perspective namely as a function and as a system.</div> <div>          Purchasing as a function is that aspect of business enterprise which ensures the uninterrupted flow of needed materials into the organisation having in mind profitability and economy, while purchasing as a system involves the acquisition of materials, equipment goods and services which are essential for the operations of a business organisation.</div> <div>          Unfortunately, since top management historically had focus on Marketing, Finance, Research and Development and Production, purchasing which is a basic function was not given much recognition, it was seen as a minor function and this led to the recruitment of clerks who were not skilled in the profession as purchasing officers. These created a lot of quality problems to the firms and led to the closure of some, but the Second World War, industrial revolution and the emergence of competition created a problem of scarce resources, then there was the need for tactical purchasing, this was when management started given more recognition to purchasing.</div> <div>          Purchasing simply mean procurement and this include some processes which are sourcing, preparation of purchase order, expediting, receiving and inspection of order, invoice audit and invoice settlement, all of those will depend on the purchase requisition sent by the needing department to the purchasing department.</div> <div>          The purchasing department is the heaviest spender of the organisation resources and contributes directly to the profit of the organisation through purchase discount and  efficient buying.</div> <div>          The purchasing department is charged with the purchasing functions and any purchase made by this department is known as organizational purchasing.</div> <div><strong>1.1     DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS</strong></div> <div>-        PURCHASE REQUISITION: This is a precise document generated by an internal organization to notify the purchasing department of items needed or the items it need to order.</div> <div>-        PURCHASE ORDER: This is a commercial document issued by a buyer (i.e Purchasing department) to a seller (i.e Supplier) indicating types, quantities and agreed prices for products or services the seller will provide to the buyer.</div> <div>-        SOURCING: This refers to a number of procurement practice aimed at finding, evaluating and engaging suppliers of goods and services.</div> <div>-        EXPEDITING: This is a concept in purchasing for securing the quality and timely delivery of goods and services ordered for.</div> <div>-        PURCHASE DISCOUNT: This is an offer from the supplier to the purchaser to reduce the selling price if the payment is made within a certain period of time.</div> <div>-        PROCUREMENT: This concept purchasing mean to obtain or take possession of materials needed for smooth operation.</div> <div><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEMS</strong></div> <div>          Every organization has the challenge of wanting to meet up with consumers expectation by making the product available at the right time and in the right quality while trying to meet up with consumers demand. Some of the areas in which problem have been sought include.</div> <div>i.        How the purchasing department makes contribution to the profit goal of the organization.</div> <div>ii.       How the purchasing department acquires input do they make use of the normal purchasing process or there is a standard set by the organization.</div> <div>iii.      Keeping a perfect working relationship with the other departments and the suppliers.</div> <div>iv.      Is the purchasing department playing any role in quality control?</div>\n\nTHE ROLES AND IMPORTANCE OF PURCHASING AS A BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN AN ORGANISATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLES AND IMPORTANCE OF PURCHASING AS A BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN AN ORGANISATION", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER I: Introduction</strong></p> <p>1.1     <strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Philip Crosby in his book “Quality is free” summarizes the effect of inspection in the following statement:</p> <p>“A prudent company makes certain that its products and services are delivered to the customers by a management system that does not condone remake, repairs, waste or non-conformance of any sort. These are expensive problems, they must not only be detected and resolve at the earliest moment, they must be prevented from occurring at all”.</p> <p>Product quality as a strategy for competitiveness has become the focus of going concerns today, be it a manufacturing or a service industry. Be that as it may, quality product or service goal in any organization will be difficult to realize without the watchful eyes of inspection. Materials outsourced or insourced as the case may be either as raw materials, components, spareparts or maintenance repairs and operation items, must be subjected to thorough examination to ensure that they are the right materials of the correct quality according to agreed standards and specifications. This is because the slightest deviation from standards, oversights of any defect in in-coming or insourced materials results to numerous and serious consequences on the life of the organization. As a result of these consequences, organizations are forced to set in place a system to ensure that only materials of quality are allowed to come into the organization. This is achieved always through the mechanism of inspection.</p> <p>The responsibility for inspection in an organization differs from organization to organization depending on the nature, make up and policy of the organization in question. The purchasing or procurement or materials department however plays an important role because they are responsible for the sourcing of the materials used by the organization.</p> <p>Inspection depicts the general idea and concept which signifies the ascertaining and determination of quality or conformity of sourced materials or services to established standards and specification. This, therefore brings to mind the fact that inspection and quality can hardly be discussed separately without reference to one. It is a major tool for the determination of quality. This study therefore, shall focus on specification, standardization, inspection and quality control and assurance.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>1.2     <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Oversights and deviation from  standard for supplied materials due to the inability of organizations to closely inspect these materials remains the bane of most government agencies and parastatals failure. These problems are further exacerbated by the overall management approaches and attitudes to these issues. These has resulted to continued accurate and epileptic power supply in the state which are often blamed on the failure of installed equipments such as transformers and cables.</p> <p>The choice of Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) Kaduna is to examine the issue arising from these. The question that is asked is; what measures are put in place in the organization to determine the needs for materials and specifications? Again, what mechanisms are put in place by the organization to ensure that purchased or outsourced equipment and materials are properly inspected for quality?</p> <p>1.3     <strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>Because of the effect of substandard materials allowed into the organization on the quality of services rendered by the organization, the major objective of the study is built around the determination of the effectiveness of the inspection programs employed by the organization.</p> <p>The study is therefore, aimed at:</p> <p>i)                   To determine if inspection is carried out.</p> <p>ii)                To determine how specification is communicated to suppliers.</p> <p>iii)              To determine how substandard materials are treated.</p> <p>iv)              To determine the method(s) of inspection.</p> <p>v)                To determine the effectiveness of the procedure.</p> <p>1.4     <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of this study is enormous. First, the researcher will be the first beneficiary as it is a prerequisite requirement in partial fulfillment for the award of Higher National Diploma [HND] in the Department of Purchasing and Supply Management, Kaduna Polytechnic, without which the researcher cannot graduate.</p> <p>Secondly, it will serve as a store of knowledge and guide for which future researchers can consult. Students will also benefit as it will help to expand their scope of knowledge.</p> <p>It will also benefit the organization understudied, as they can utilize it to improve or ensure that defective materials, substandard materials do not enter the production process.</p> <p>Finally, the general public will also gain from its depth to utilize against purchases or orders they will place from time to time since everyone buys one material, product or components or parts at times.</p> <p>1.5     <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The focus of this research work is on the effect of inspection on the quality of services in Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), Kaduna, located in the heart of Kaduna, along Ahmadu Bello Way, Central Area Kaduna.

The general problem was also emphasized on such problems as negligence of management of store activities, construction cost, poor storage design. Also discussed is objective of the study which include, to examine the effect of store design on materials handling to ascertain difficulties associated with store design on materials handling. The significant of the study to the academic, the organization, the entire populace and the researcher is also discussed research question was also derived which include to know if store design have effect on material handling and the difficulties associated with store design. The survey research designed is adopted simple sampling procedure was employed. The researcher used questionnaire, interview and documentary source techniques too retrieve data. The likert four rating scale techniques is adopted to analyse the data. Finding made among which are, that store design have a great effect on materials handling activities in the organization that the organization store design is often faced with difficulties and that engagement of professional will help to curb the difficulties faced by the store design. Also the researcher included that the design of store should be in accordance with the store operational activities of the firms, that the organization placed on importance consideration on store design and lastly amongst recommendation made are, the engagement of professional in the management of he store design activities of the organization, align the store design with the organization activities to effect the effectiveness of the activities and that the top management should give a considerable support to the design of the store activities to ensure its effectiveness.     </p> <p><strong>Chapter I:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>A store is an essential limb of an organization. It is the depository of all materials required by the organizations in the organization and supplies materials as an when required.</p> <p>It is important to note that the store is an area of great expenditure in manufacturing and assembling plant. It is true that store function is a major cost centre which make use of 70-75% annual budget of the firm (Dangana 2005) and thus it can affect saving and therefore contribute significantly and therefore contribute significantly to the profit of the organization.</p> <p>However, in today’s highly competitive and globalized business world, store design is of great importance as a substantial number of instances have show that people charge with the function and responsibility of designing and managing the store are given little or no attention in the organization. This may be as a result of poor understanding store design or inappropriate application of it.</p> <p>More so, the variety of items sometimes, store is so large that a planned system is necessary to keep the secured and in order. The stored items should be identified and issues with minimum effort and minimum time. Thus this calls for a store structure suitable to carry on various activities efficiently and productivity and developing a system that ensure safety of men and materials.</p> <p>Most often the design of a store house determiners to a large extent the materials movement pattern and the limited type of handling equipment that can be used. This result in fact that most customers demand for goods and services within and outside the organization are incremental in nature as they opt for speedy, convenient and reliable delivery of materials and service.</p> <p>However, the need to curtail the amount of waste and improve the level of customer’s service within such organization has brought the use of the term store design ad its impact in materials handling. It should also be noted at this junction that any knowledge of how a store should be designed must incorporate the knowledge of how a store should be designed must incorporate the knowledge of how materials would be moved.</p> <p>Therefore, the research work develops the effective utilization of store design and it prospect in the organization with reference to enhancing and ensuring effective materials handling in the organization.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>One vital decision that firms make is how to design and where locate their storage facilities. This decision goes a long way in determining the extent to which the firm will achieve its objectives.

It can also be defined as the process of management of material which involves purchasing, storage control and transportation.</p> <p>Material management is a relatively new discipline. The 20th century's rapid growth and the significant industrial development has played a major role in the relationship and effective management of the traditional 5Ms which are: Machine, material, men, money and management.</p> <p>The famous industrial revolution made material(s) the largest elements cost in any organization.</p> <p>At the wake of the 20th century many firms had recognized the importance of material, and several material activities like purchasing, ware housing, stock control and distribution carried out by the organization.</p> <p>By the 1950 firms have identified the need for effective coordination or integration of such material activities and material organization tools concept like those of physical distribution movement, logistic movement and material management as a means to check, co-ordinate and control the firm's material activities.</p> <p>Globally, there is no clear definition on the area of material management. According to M.A. Tokunbo (1987) defines it in the context of store and material control as compensation for the effective co-ordination of the principle element.</p> <p>ü    Identifying, classifying and coordination of stocks</p> <p>ü    Provision, inventory control and stress accounting</p> <p>ü    Store house layout and organization</p> <p>ü    In house storage handling and distribution</p> <p>ü    Presentation of materials in store.</p> <p>To these, material management has the duty to apply the most suitable technique in the most effective way to ensure the minimum total cost consistent with providing the service required.</p> <p>The American production and inventory control; society (APICS) defines material management technique and production as the grouping of management function related to the complete cycle of material flow from the purchase and internal control of work in the latter term, traditionally is limited to internal control of production materials.</p> <p>In examining the whole definition one could easily notice that they are not quite different from one another only the way of approach and little difference in terminology. In this respect (material and resource) or material management is not only limited to buying and storing as many view it but involves also purchasing, transport and distribution planning and continuous monitoring.</p> <p>1.1    <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The subject matter of this study is the effect of material management technique on production planning process in United Nigeria Textile Plc (UNT Plc), Kaduna. The research is meant to be of great importance to various enterprise and organization wishing to conduct a detailed study into stores and purchasing material hence, the research aims at identifying the problems associated with efficient operation in an organization, the research is interested in knowing the effect of material management technique on production planning process as practicable in an organization. Due to sophistication in technology coupled with socio-economic and political instability, production processes face complex problems that needs to be addressed by management  ensuring that materials are allocated and used in the most efficient and effective manner.</p> <p> The material management technique on production is also to identify problems by guiding against supb-optimization of the material management techniques in production planning processes, for this the researcher suggests that which will achieve optimal result quickly, cheaper and acceptable.</p> <p>Today materials are the live-wire of every organization be it public or private hence no organization can survive without material, its availability, distribution and transportation and delivery at the right amount and quality is paramount.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>STATEMENT</strong> <strong>OF</strong> <strong>THE</strong> <strong>PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>United Nigeria Textile Plc (UNT Plc), Kaduna. is faced with problems in relation to utilization of the effect of material management being the utmost thing that are needed to be utilized effectively. The problem facing material management especially United Nigeria Textile Plc (UNT Plc), Kaduna. are mainly under stocking or over stoking of material, stock obsolescence breakage and the economic order quantity.`</p> <p>Due to the fact that the impact is to be felt positively in the society by making themselves’ productive in every area of inputs.</p> <p>But despite the effect observed there have been general apathy, ignorance and lack of interest by many people and the government.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Specifically, the aims and objectives of this study are:</p> <p>i.             To assess the impact of material management on organizational performance.</p> <p>ii.            To appraise and further appreciate the significance of material management in a manufacturing industry.</p> <p>iii.           To identify and ascertain some of the problems poised by materials management in Nigerian United Nigeria Textile Plc (UNT Plc), Kaduna.</p> <p>iv.          It is also the researcher's desire that this compilation will be of great help and interest to whosoever uses it to gain knowledge on issues discussed.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>          The following hypothesis was formulated for this study:</p> <p>H0:     Material management does not have any significant impact on organizational performance.</p> <p>H1:    Material Management does have significant impact on organizational performance.</p> <p>1.5    <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>   A research of this nature will be incomplete without highlighting the importance of this study.</p> <p>Firstly, the researcher as a student aspiring to be a material executive in the future sees this study as an opportunity to fully investigate into the field of materials management to see the challenges therein.</p> <p>Secondly, the study is needed as a pre-requisite for the award of the Higher National Diploma in Production and Operation Management (POM).</p> <p>Furthermore, the researcher has also undertaken the study in order to gather necessary information and suggest solution to the problem facing materials management in United Nigeria Textile Plc (UNT Plc), Kaduna.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The subject matter “Materials Management” has an area of coverage within its concept, i.e. theory and practice in the private sector. This would also include purchasing, stocktaking and stock checking of materials. </p> <p>1.7    <strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In carrying out this research, certain problems were encountered which in fact hindered the area of coverage.</p> <p>·                   The researcher faced the problem of sourcing for materials for the project. </p> <p>·                   Time constraint was a factor the researcher encountered. This resulted in the backlog of the researcher’s class work.</p> <p>·                    Lack of textbooks related to the subject matter also contributed to backlog in writing the project.</p> <p>·                   Unco-operative and bureaucratic attitude of United Nigeria Textile Plc (UNT Plc), officials who were reluctant in providing necessary information in writing.</p> <p>·                   Despite all these constraints, the researcher was lucky to gather vital information that made the investigation a success.</p> <p><strong>1.8 HISTORICAL BACKGROUNOF UNITED NIGERIA TEXTILE PLC (UNT PLC), KADUNA.</strong></p> <p>The United Nigeria Textiles PLC, formally called the United Nigeria Textiles Limited (UNTL) is located in Kakuri Industrial Area of Kaduna South Local Government area of Kaduna State.</p> <p>Mr. Cha-Chi-Ming, a Chinese founded it on May 7th, 1964, with some Nigerians and commenced operations in early 1965. The company started operating as a finishing plant, importing policy on backward integration in June 1976, the company immediately acquired and installed its first spinning and weaving facilities to produce its own Grey Baft from locally grown cotton.</p> <p>For its determination to expand its operation the company acquired controlling interest in Zamfara Textiles Industry Limited (ZTIL) in 1976, by this, there is a steady supply of Grey Baft for its highly efficient finishing plant in Kaduna. UNT. PLC is the only factory capable of producing highly sophisticated wax prints in the country and indeed the whole of West Africa.</p> <p>In 1976, fresh idea of another factor was conceived, so in 1977 its incorporated Funtua Textiles Limited (FTL) to produce materials different from the conventional products of Kidnap factory and Gusau factory, the Funtua Textiles United produces high quality bedspreads, pillow cases and cotton/polyester fabrics in various designs and colours.</p> <p>In 1980, the company bought Norspin in Kaduna from its former owners UAC. The name Norspin was changed and its is now a subsidiary company registered as unitex Limited and an associate company named Supertex limited. Unitex Limited is a spinning plant producing yam for the sole consumption of UNT Plc, while Supertex limited is a finishing plant producing wax prints for export to ECOWAS countries and USA with the support and encouragement from business-like partners such as Northern Nigeria Development Company (NNDC), Nigeria Industrial Development Bank (NIDB), New Nigeria Investment Limited (NNIL), Kaduna State Government and the Federal Ministry of Industry. In view of technological advancement UNT. Plc have embarked on basic technological review of its machines and equipment through computerization, restructuring and modernization of its various components units, improved transportation system. It was scientific approaches to solving environmental problems. It is the first mill in Nigeria to acquire and install its own effluent treatment plant for minimizing health hazard and preventing land water pollution.</p> <p>UNT plc is the largest employers of labour among textiles industries in the country and the largest in terms of production capacity. It has a total workforce of 15,000. The total install capacity is for ninety six million meters (96m) finished materials. Currently the company is expanding its factory building to accommodate additional processing machines for its blocked real wax prints and finishing department. The expansion of the finishing department will enable the company to engage in bleaching, dying and finishing of synthetic cotton blend textiles.</p> <p>The aims and objectives of the company are to undertake the production and marketing of textiles commodity. Thus, it is involved by weaving, dying and printing of textile materials which has helped Nigeria in providing employment as well as having locally made textiles materials without difficulties and at cheaper prices compared to imported ones.</p> <p><strong>OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE OF UNT.

It was conducted using Tower Galvanized Products (GTP) Ltd Kaduna. The research work was carried out with the intention of examining the pit falls of manufacturing companies in carrying out necessary management and control of their inventories. For this purpose the study was divided into five chapters. Chapter one introduced the research topic, the objective of the study was also define which include to access and highlight the different methods of inventory, planning and reeducation and the most appropriate one. Chapter two was concerned with the review of related literature and points like objectives of inventory management which include to maintain minimum investment in inventories to maximize profitability were discussed. Chapter three dealt with the methodology used in collecting data. In this chapter the random sampling technique was adopted and questionnaire were used to collect the data. Chapter four has to do with the analysis of the various data collected using the mean. In chapter five, summary of the research work was don and conclusion were drawn to give recommendations in that a manufacturing companies with a view to profit maximization and cost reduction should adopt and maintain an effective inventory management and control system</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        Inventories constitute the most significant part of current events of a large majority of companies in Nigeria and indeed many other part of the world. Because of the large size of inventories maintained by firms, a considerable amount of fund is required to be committed to them. Therefore, the efficient and effective management of inventories becomes imperative in order to achieved unnecessary turnover or to minimized the cost associated with keeping inventories. The neglect of inventory management and control by a firm will amount to jeopardizing its long run profitability and may even cause the firm to fail ultimately.</p> <p>Inventory is defined as the stock of any item or material used in an organization. Therefore, an inventory management is the set of policies and control that monitor levels of inventory and determines the following:-</p> <p>i.      What level should be maintain</p> <p>ii.     When stock should be replenished.</p> <p>iii.    How large order should be</p> <p>However, inventory can include input such as human resources, financial, equipment e.t.c and output such as parts or component.</p> <p>It is possible for a company to reduce its level of inventories to a considerable degree without any adverse effect on production and sales by using inventory planning and control techniques.</p> <p>The reduction in excessive inventory carries a favourable impact on company profitability (Pandey 1999) in doing this however, care should be taken to avoid under stocking which directly affect production causing stoppage, loss of sales, loss of good will. etc.</p> <p>Inventory forms a link between production and sales of a product. A manufacturing company must maintain a certain level of inventory in the form of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods. Raw materials inventory gives the firm flexibility in its purchase, without it, a manufacturing company must exist on a hand-to- moth basis buying raw materials in keeping with its production schedule. Work-in- progress are items of stock that are subjected to further processing to produced the finished product. finished goods inventory allows the firm flexibility in its production scheduling and in its marketing thus there is on incentive to maintain large stocks of all three types of inventory.</p> <p>In an inflationary environment like Nigeria, there is the need to adopt a realistic inventory valuation method in order to give correct value of inventory in the profit and loss account and in the balance sheet which would have otherwise show an appropriate financial position of the organization and thus negating the purpose of accounting which is the provision of accurate financial information to investors, shareholders, management, government and her agencies and other related interested parties in order to assist them in taking decision about the organization.</p> <p>It is in view of this that the need arises for an appropriate management and control measure to maintain the most accurate level of stock that will assist management of the organization carryout business in such a way that it does</p> <p> not portray the organization in bad shape.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The wide distance between the source of raw material and factories in Nigeria today has posed a great problem to management. Thus the management may not predict with certainty to delivery date of materials. How then does the management ensure that there is no hitch and delay in the supply of raw material to satisfy their day to day requirements without necessarily keeping excessive stock of raw materials and finished goods which represent investment from which no return is expected immediately.</p> <p>In line with this, the major problem face by management is the determination of what stock to be kept, when to reorder, of what cost to reorder, what the production level should be, how work in process and stages involved should be controlled, movement of finish goods from point of production into the market. The disadvantages associated with huge investment in inventory (tying down of capital, increase in holding/carrying cost etc) act as a detriment in management in committing huge sum of funds in inventory. Conversely making little investment will be disastrous as it will lead to frequent stock out and consequent disruption of production system and incurring additional cost resulting from frequent ordering.</p> <p>Since no company especially a manufacturing company can operate without keeping stock, it is necessary to check the occurrence of pilferage depletion, damages, breakages, obsolescence etc. among other things.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The primary objective of this research work is to consider inventory control system as described and discussed by different authors. This will be taken as a standard against which the inventory system of the company under study will be appraised to determine its efficiency and suitability in the peculiar environment it operates.</p> <p>The objectives of this study includes:  </p> <p>1.          To determine an optimum level of inventory to be maintain by the company under study.</p> <p>2.          To assess and highlight the different methods of inventory planning, control and valuation and the most appropriate one for a manufacturing company.</p> <p>3.          To highlight the need for and nature of inventory.</p> <p>4.          To make viable recommendations on the basis of the out come of the research.</p> <p>5.          Effect on delivery date with certainty.</p> <p><strong>1.4   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of a proper and efficient inventory control and management cannot be over emphasized. Its effect is not only on the individual company but on the economy as a whole.</p> <p>This study is meant to find solutions to the itching problems of Tower Galvanized Products (TGP) Nigeria limited Kaduna in inventory management and control.</p> <p>The study will also be of immense benefit to the owners and management of the company under study, their creditors and prospective shareholders who might  wish to invest in the company. This is so because managing inventories efficiently and effectively will help the company to avoid unnecessary investment. It helps the management in quick and accurate decision making. It will also help to build-up the goodwill of the current asset of many companies.</p> <p>Finally, the knowledge required from this study will broaden the existing knowledge in this field and aid researcher in applying it to other companies or organizations.</p> <p><strong>1.5   RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>With reference to the statement of the problem highlighted above and considering the scope and limitations of this study the following research questions are formulated.</p> <p>1.     How does the company determine the optimal level of stock to be maintain?</p> <p>2.     How appropriate is the valuation method given the present inflationary situation?</p> <p>3.     What determine the level of control to be maintain on various types of stock?</p> <p>4.     What practical problems are in the ways of progress of inventory management and control in the area under study?</p> <p>5.     How does the effect of large investment inventory affect the management (holding cost).</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is focused on inventory management and control in Tower Galvanize Product (TGP) Nigeria</p> <p>limited, Kaduna during the year 2001-2006 as it affects the full implementation of the basic concepts of inventory management. Associated issues like inventory procurements, storage and physical distribution policy of the company will also be examined.</p> <p><strong>1.7   LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.     Lack of corporation from subjects leading to the use of smaller than the anticipated number this can affect the quality and the generalization of the findings.</p> <p>2.     Inability to use correct data gathering instrument due to ignorance about their availability</p> <p>        3.     Low return rate of questionnaires</p> <p>4.     Using less then fair representative sample due to inability to research subjects.</p> <p><strong>1.8   DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>-       <strong>Inventory:</strong> This is the list of items held in stock by a company at any particular time.</p> <p>-       <strong>Stock:</strong> This consists of all goods and materials stored by an organization. It is a supply of items which are kept for future used.</p> <p>NB for the purpose of this research work, stock and inventory are sometimes used interchangeably</p> <p>-       <strong>Lead time:</strong> This is also known as reorder period or delivery. It is the period of time between ordering and reception of goods ordered for.</p> <p>-       <strong>Re-order level:</strong> This is the point at which it is necessary to initiate purchase requisition for new supply of materials.</p> <p>-       <strong>Minimum stock level:</strong> This is the level below which stocks should not normally be allowed to fall. It can be said to be buffer or safety stock which makes allowances to cover for error in forecasting the lead time or the demand during the lead time.</p> <p>-       <strong>Maximum stock level:</strong> This is the level above which stock should not normally be allowed to rise.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL ON PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL ON PERFORMANCE", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER I: Introduction</strong></p> <p>1.9            <strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study intends to shed more light on the impact of public procurement act on the accountability of procurement officers in public sector in Kaduna state ministry of education and how it contribute positively towards the conservation of resources in a services organization.</p> <p>However, the researcher feel it would be of great importance to conduct a detailed study on the procurement process or system used by the services organization and the impact of federal government procurement act on the accountability of procurement officers in the public sector.</p> <p>Base on wide spread corruption, conducting government business degenerated so much by the year 2000. This was due to the fact that no serious attention was paid to public service rule.</p> <p>Financial regulations ethics and norms because of selfish reasons. The federal government noted the urgent need to transparency in government procedure so as to be able to move the system forward.

That is given the rapid changes in taste, technology and competition, organization will not rely solely on its existing supplier but look forward to get better sources of materials.</p> <p>An organization can use three ways to minimize cost of sourcing materials, by interviewing her customers, by negotiation with the suppliers, by sourcing for better materials, we mean original material that can go into production and come out with quality product; and in the study, we will be concentrating on material sourcing as a way of increasing an organization’s profitability.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, sourcing for the right material is like human being whose life span has to be treated to keep it working in order to add value, profit to the organization in the view that organization will not die subsequently. The death of organization lays on the fact that proper material are not acquired.</p> <p>In the light of the above, it is necessary for organization will adopt the system of sourcing for materials to develop and grow their profitability, to achieve this successfully, sourcing strategies are required to be adopted, these are right material, right price, right negotiation, right place, right qualities, right quantities, right sources, right time etc.</p> <p>In a nutshell, the study will dwell mainly on the impact of material sourcing to maximize organization profitability.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Most organization especially production oriented organization like Nigeria Breweries spent about 60% to 70% of its annual expenditure on the acquisition of raw materials. Some of the major problems confronting any manufacturing industries are: high cost of materials will affect profit margin of the organization and also incompetence of supplies, if the suppliers are not competent in making right qualities supply will become problem to organization in profitability area.</p> <p>High cost involved in sourcing suppliers whole material needed for organization. Improper sourcing policy, sourcing for organizational profitability need to be proper that right material will be supplied.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.3     Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose or objectives of the study is to examine the impact of material sourcing in enhancing the organizational profitability, its importance, how effective and efficient it is to the overall achievement of the organizational goal and objectives. Under the aspect, the researcher hope to realize the following:</p> <p>i)                   To determine the most effective sourcing policies adopted by Nigeria Breweries.</p> <p>ii)                To determine the criteria for selecting supplier in Nigeria Breweries.</p> <p>iii)              To determine the challenges of manager in material sourcing</p> <p>iv)              To determine the impact of material resource on the profitability of Nigeria Breweries. </p> <p><strong>1.4     Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study will add to the knowledge of the interested individual or group on the subject matter.</p> <p>The researcher chose this topic to highlight the inherent danger and consequence of adopting poor performance in material delays as problem associated with sourcing with a view of providing solution or applied to sourcing activities in the organization like Nigeria Breweries Plc. It will show the impact in the organization performance and profitability in Nigeria Breweries.</p> <p>Another vital reason of the study is to contribute to the existing literature in the area of sourcing, types of sourcing, sourcing policy, sourcing process etc for future reference. It will enable a layman in the profession to have first hand information on bio sourcing activities is being carried out. Also the students of the department and other department will find this project an important relevant source of literature review in the area of sourcing ‘material sourcing’ further study will suggest ways that the organization can carryout its sourcing efficiently.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research will be looking at improve on materials sourcing for organization profitability. This chapter will make use of population size of 100 staff and the research will use the sample size of 20 was adopted from the population of which describe the characteristics of the population.</p> <p>Secondly, this chapter will strict to the procurement, production and administrative department. The study will take activities of materials and sourcing of Nigeria Breweries Plc in the last 5 years from 2009 to 2013.</p> <p><strong>1.6     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>          The research question includes:</p> <p>i)                   What are the determining factors affecting sourcing policies adopted by Nigeria Breweries?</p> <p>ii)                What are the criteria for selecting suppliers in Nigeria Breweries?</p> <p>iii)              What are the challenges facing managers in materials sourcing?</p> <p>iv)              What are the factors that lead to impact of material sourcing on the profitability of Nigeria Breweries?</p> <p><strong>1.7     Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>§     <strong>Raw Materials: </strong>Are items, which are to be processed through production process to obtain desired finished goods.</p> <p>§     <strong>Purchasing:</strong> it is the process of ensuring that all the materials required for production made available at the proper time, in the proper quality at a proper place and price.</p> <p>§     <strong>Information:</strong> Data can be interpreted by an individual to provide meaning, a tangible or tangible entity that reduce uncertainty about a state or an event.</p> <p>§     <strong>Sourcing:</strong> The event to which buyers search or suppliers to build long term relationship.</p> <p>§     <strong>Outsourcing:</strong> An arrangement by which one organization provides a service or services for another organization that choses not to perform them in house.</p> <p>§     <strong>Negotiation:</strong> Is the art and science of arriving at a common understanding through bargaining with essentials of a control, such as price, quality, quantity, delivery, time, terms and condition of services.</p> <p>§     <strong>Selecting:</strong> Is the process of selecting the right suppliers to source or outsource.</p> <p>§     <strong>Bid/Tender:</strong> Is an offer made by a supplier, contractor or services provider to a buyer in a response to a direct “written” or indirect “advert” enquiry.</p> <p>§     <strong>Biding/Tendering:</strong> Is a purchasing procedure by which potential suppliers invited without collusion to present to an organization, a firm and clear offer of price, terms and conditions which upon acceptance of contract.</p> <p>§     <strong>Time:</strong> When organization cannot meet up with time or cannot complete the whole task within the specified period, the organization can outsource a part of the product in other to meet up with schedules.</p> <p>§     <strong>Quality Specification:</strong> Is the description of an item, its dimension, analysis, performance or other relevant characteristics in sufficient detail to ensure that it will be suitable in all respect for the purpose it is wanted.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE IMPACT OF MATERIAL SOURCING IN ENHANCING THE ORGANIZATIONAL PROFITABILITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF MATERIAL SOURCING IN ENHANCING THE ORGANIZATIONAL PROFITABILITY", "id": 64}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER I: Introduction</strong></p> <p>1.9            <strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study intends to shed more light on the impact of public procurement act on the accountability of procurement officers in public sector in Kaduna state ministry of education and how it contribute positively towards the conservation of resources in a services organization.</p> <p>However, the researcher feel it would be of great importance to conduct a detailed study on the procurement process or system used by the services organization and the impact of federal government procurement act on the accountability of procurement officers in the public sector.</p> <p>Base on wide spread corruption, conducting government business degenerated so much by the year 2000.

For example: chief\r\n executive financial officers (CFOs), backed by the law of the land, \r\nwill usually stress their responsibility to the stockholders. But the \r\ncompany’s objectives are usually composites of many decisions, resulting\r\n in various cross-functional compromises. So in actual practice the \r\nCFO’s goal is to balance the objectives of a fair return on investment \r\nto stockholders, stable and satisfying employment for employees, \r\nsatisfaction of customers and the community, and so forth.<br/>In setting\r\n procurement’s functional objectives, the Purchasing Manager must be \r\naware of the CFO’s (and accordingly, the company’s) objectives, and \r\nensure consistency in constructing the specific objectives for the \r\npurchasing department. With increased focus on meeting customer needs \r\nmore effectively, many enterprises have begun to evaluate the results of\r\n the entire supply chain in satisfying these needs. This has given rise \r\nto the concept of competition between supply chains rather than merely \r\nbetween companies. Consequently, the importance of supplier \r\ncontributions to enterprise results has further increased expectations \r\nof the supply management organization.<br/>The evolution of purchase \r\nplanning system from a clerical task to a strategic value chain makes it\r\n a means of creating competitive advantages for organizations. \r\nGenerally, this development happens slowly with no previous design and \r\nplan in organizations. Therefore, to mitigate risks of this change and \r\nto increase its effectiveness, this development process should be \r\ncarefully structured and planned. In this paper, in order to achieve a \r\npurchase planning system transformation model, purchasing development \r\nmodels are used as a basic framework. By benefiting of organizational \r\nchange concepts and theories, the reference model has been designed as a\r\n tool to assess the current purchase planning system development \r\nsituation and the potential strategic growth path. Finally, \r\nrelationships between purchasing content change elements development \r\nhave been identified as a departure point to develop the purchasing \r\ntransformation strategy. In the empirical research path, this \r\nexploratory research has an inductive approach and the strategy by which\r\n the research is conducted is grounded theory. Case studies are the \r\nchief tools for data collection and analysis.<br/> TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>GENERAL OBJECTIVE <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUY<br/>LIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>DEFINITION OPF TERMS<br/>CHAPTER TWO LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>INTROPDUCTION<br/>PURCHASE PLANNING CHAIN MANAGEMENT<br/>HISTORY OF PURCHASE PLANNING FUNCTIONS:<br/>THE ROLE, OBJECTIVES AND CONTRIBUTION OF SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES TO CORPORATE AND STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS<br/>THEORITICAL FRAMEWORK<br/>ORGANIZATION TRANSFORMATION<br/>EMPIRICAL LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>CONCEPTUAL ISSUES<br/>HISTORY OF PURCHASING AND PROCUREMENT<br/>FACTORS FOR PURCHASING<br/>CHAPTER THREE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>THE RESEARCH DESIGN<br/>THE QUESTIONNAIRES DESIGN<br/>SAMPLING METHOD<br/>SOURCES OF DATA<br/>DATA COLLECTION METHOD<br/>CHAPTER FOUR PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS OF DATA AND TESTING OF HYPOTHESIS<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>ANALYSIS OF DATA<br/>TESTING OF HYPOTHESIS<br/>CHAPTER FIVE SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>SUMMARY<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>    INTRODUCTION<br/>    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Considering\r\n the increasing significance of purchasing role and with the idea that \r\nthis function has the ability to influence profitability favorably, the \r\nway purchasing function develops within organizations over time has been\r\n a topic of great interest. The evolution of the purchasing function is \r\nwell acknowledged in the literature. Departing from the passive, \r\nre-active clerical viewpoint of the 70’s, the purchasing function has \r\nthe ability to develop itself in a strategic pro-active function \r\ncontributing, as much as other business functions, to the creation of \r\nsustainable competitive advantages (Versendaal et al, 2005).Cavinato and\r\n Freeman (1990) in their studies declared that in today’s changing and \r\ndynamic global markets, organizations stressing on the high quality \r\nproduction must focus their purchase planning on planning, development \r\nand operation. They realized that purchasing groups of many \r\norganizations have been slowly developed without a specific plan in \r\nresponse.<br/>In response to today's unprecedented economic uncertainty, \r\nsupply managers have adopted a \"wait-and- see\" attitude. Many are wary \r\nof spending their company's most valued asset: cash. And since inventory\r\n is cash's evil stepchild, companies continue to aggressively reduce \r\ninventory levels. In fact, current inventory management practices have \r\nregressed beyond \"Lean\" and are anorexic. As a result, popular Christmas\r\n gifts, such as electronics and appliances, may be in short supply.<br/>The\r\n Institute of Supply Management's Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) tells a\r\n strange and interesting story about today's supply chain management. \r\nThe data suggest that today's organizations have deliberately whittled \r\ntheir inventories down to dangerously low levels.<br/>At its surface, \r\nuncertainty is straight forward to manage. Factory physics, the science \r\nof manufacturing, teaches us that manufacturers have three buffers to \r\nmanage variability in their businesses: capacity, time and inventory. It\r\n is clear when looking at the PMI that most companies are using only one\r\n of these buffers: time. ISM reports a long trend of contracting \r\ninventories with little or no noticeable increase or investment in \r\ncapacity.<br/>As a result, lead times for supplies gradually (and now \r\ndramatically) increased in the face of a steady trend of increased \r\ndemand (new orders). The recent and striking increase in lead time is a \r\nreflection that much excess capacity is being put to use, leaving time \r\nas the only remaining buffer. Lead times have ballooned from 10 to 12 \r\ndays to 53 days.<br/>Purchasing is the act of buying the goods and \r\nservices that a company needs to operate and/or manufacture products. \r\nMany people are ignorant of what purchasing is all about. “Purchasing” \r\nis the term used in industries, commerce, public corporations to denote \r\nthe act of and the financial responsibility for procuring material, \r\nsupplies and services. It simply describes the process of buying. \r\nHowever in a broader sense, the term involves determining the needs, \r\nselecting the supplier, arriving at a proper price, terms and \r\nconditions, issuing the contract or order, and following up to ensure \r\nproper delivery. It focus is to purchase or obtain materials in the \r\nright quantity, in the right quality, at the right price, at the right \r\ntime, and from the right supplier and delivering to the right place.<br/>Global\r\n markets are expanding beyond borders and re-defining the way demand and\r\n supplies are managed. Global companies are driven by markets across \r\ncontinents. In order to keep the cost of manufacturing down, they are \r\nforced to keep looking to set up production centers where cost of raw \r\nmaterials and labor is cheap. Sourcing of raw materials and vendors to \r\nsupply the right quality, quantity and at right price calls for dynamic \r\nprocurement strategy spanning across countries.<br/>With the above \r\nscenario you find companies procuring materials globally from various \r\nvendors to supply raw materials to their factories situated in different\r\n continents. The finished goods out of these different factory locations\r\n then pass through different chains of distribution network involving \r\nwarehouses, exports to different countries or local markets, \r\ndistributors, retailers and finally to the end customer.<br/>In simple \r\nlanguage, managing all of the above activities in tandem to manage \r\ndemand and supply on a global scale is Supply Chain Management. As per \r\ndefinition SCM is the management of a network of all business processes \r\nand activities involving procurement of raw materials, manufacturing and\r\n distribution management of Finished Goods. SCM is also called the art \r\nof management of providing the Right Product, At the Right Time, Right \r\nPlace and at the Right Cost to the Customer.<br/>Why SCM strategy is important for an Organization<br/>Supply\r\n Chain Strategies are the critical backbone to Business Organizations \r\ntoday. Effective Market coverage, Availability of Products at locations \r\nwhich hold the key to revenue recognition depends upon the effectiveness\r\n of Supply Chain Strategy rolled out. Very simply stated, when a product\r\n is introduced in the market and advertised, the entire market in the \r\ncountry and all the sales counters need to have the product where the \r\ncustomer is able to buy and take delivery. Any glitch in product not \r\nbeing available at the right time can result in drop in customer \r\ninterest and demand which can be disastrous. Transportation network \r\ndesign and management assume importance to support sales and marketing \r\nstrategy.<br/>Inventory control and inventory visibility are two very \r\ncritical elements in any operations for these are the cost drivers and \r\ndirectly impact the bottom lines in the balance sheet. Inventory means \r\nvalue and is an asset of the company. Every business has a standard for \r\ninventory turnaround that is optimum for the business. Inventory \r\nturnaround refers to the number of times the inventory is sold and \r\nreplaced in a period of twelve months. The health of the inventory turn \r\nrelates to the health of business.<br/>In a global scenario, the finished\r\n goods inventory is held at many locations and distribution centers, \r\nmanaged by third parties. A lot of inventory would also be in the \r\npipeline in transportation, besides the inventory with distributors and \r\nretail stocking points. Since any loss of inventory anywhere in the \r\nsupply chain would result in loss of value, effective control of \r\ninventory and visibility of inventory gains importance as a key factor \r\nof Supply Chain Management function.<br/>    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Strictly,\r\n this project is a case study of the effective purchase planning \r\nmanagement and profitability. The impact for efficient negotiation in \r\npurchasing function in manufacturing company cannot be over stated. This\r\n is because when fairly in contract management result from poor \r\nnegotiation. The problem of the study therefore are as follow:<br/>1.    Firms or organization fair to see the element of pricing and negotiation as a vital element in contract management.<br/>2.    Most firms adopt the concept of I will” when you lose attitude this result into poor project execution.<br/>3.    Most people involving in purchasing of capital and management do not possess the right skill and knowledge of negotiation.<br/>4.  \r\n  The economic situation of the country has serious effect on the \r\nquality of negotiation purchasing function in manufacturing company firm\r\n attempt.<br/>5.    There is no serious attempt on the part of firms to empower negotiation contract managers.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>The following questions regarding the implementation of the Procurement planning guided the study: <br/>1.    Do the Selected manufacturing companies have well prepared Procurement <br/>Plan in place, and adhering to it? <br/>2.    Do various entities in the selected manufacturing companies have active Procurement Committees in place? <br/>3.  \r\n  Have the authorities of the Selected manufacturing companies organized\r\n in-service training for staff involved in logistics management? <br/>4.    Do stocks and stores purchases go through the procurement system? <br/> GENERAL OBJECTIVE <br/>The\r\n main objective of the study was to assess the critical implementation \r\nissues associated with the operationalisation of Procurement planning  \r\nin health entities in the Selected manufacturing companies. <br/>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES <br/>•    To determine the level of compliance of Health facilities in the district with the Public <br/>Procurement plan. <br/>•  \r\n  To assess the involvement of the various departments and units in the \r\nselection of inputs and logistics they require to perform their duties  <br/>•    To find out whether an Annual Procurement plan is prepared and followed for all purchases. <br/>•    To assess the current practices related to stores management. <br/>•    To make policy recommendations to improve current situation. <br/>    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The\r\n primary significance of this study is for partial fulfillment of the \r\nrequirements for the award of Batchelor Degree in Purchase planning \r\nManagement.<br/>The secondary significance is also geared towards \r\nexploring the academic relationship between classroom theory and what is\r\n practically attainable in industries and government establishment thus \r\nthe carefulness in choosing the research topic.<br/>The third \r\nsignificance of the project is to help and guide the younger ones on \r\nwhat to do when writing project or carrying out any research.<br/>The\r\n fourth significance of the project is to guide industrial purchasing s \r\nto effective and efficient negotiation to enable them to obtain the \r\n“best buy which is the ultimate goal of the purchasing function.<br/>    SCOPE OF THE STUY<br/>This research work is on the effectiveness of purchase planning management and profitability.<br/>    LIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>Despite\r\n the limited scope of this study certain constraints were encountered \r\nduring the research of this project. Some of the constraints experienced\r\n by the researcher were given below:<br/>i.    TIME: This was a major \r\nconstraint on the researcher during the period of the work. Considering \r\nthe limited time given for this study, there was not much time to give \r\nthis research the needed attention.<br/>ii.    FINANCE: Owing to the \r\nfinancial difficulty prevalent in the country and it’s resultant prices \r\nof commodities, transportation fares, research materials etc. The \r\nresearcher did not find it easy meeting all his financial obligations.<br/>iii.  \r\n  INFORMATION CONSTRAINTS: Nigerian researchers have never had it easy \r\nwhen it comes to obtaining necessary information relevant to their area \r\nof study from private business organization and even government \r\nagencies. Women in Mina, Niger state find it difficult to reveal their \r\ninternal operations. The primary information was collected through \r\nface-to-face interview getting the published materials on this topic \r\nmeant going from one library to other which was not easy.

This goal is accomplished by the appropriate blending of what many management authorities calls the for (5) m’s which are machine, man. Material, money and management, material organization. No industrial organization can operate without them; they must be available at the right time in the right quantity at the right price and at the right place.</p> <p>Whether in period of inflation, or price stability or recessim, obtaining material at the right price can literally mean the difference between a firms, success and failure. Hence the right price is of importance to every organization, profit or non profit.</p> <p>Therefore to obtain the right price, there are (3) three basic method which can be used by a buyer,</p> <p>These are;</p> <p>1 Published price list</p> <p>2 Competitive bidding</p> <p>3 Negotiations</p> <p>When the buyer is not satisfied with the price after using published price lists and competitive bidding, he resorts to negotiation. According to the chambers 20th Century Dictionary “NEGOTIATION” means to confer for purpose of mutual agreement the Webster dictionary defines it as conferring, discussing or bargaining to reach agreement in business transaction.</p> <p>According to Oyeoku, (1993), negotiation is just but a process whereby representatives of the buying organization and selling organization attempt to reach precise agreement on all terms and conditions which make a contract come into being. It involves a thorough analysis of all aspects of purchasing in each aspect and the ritual as a common understanding of what is best in interest of both parties. In successful negotiation both sides win, the wining are, seldom equally divided. Invariably one side wins more than the other. This is as it should be in business.</p> <p>The importance at negotiation to purchasing is that it is a method used especially where the time of purchasing of materials is too short, the money value involved is too low, the number of bidders is inadequate, they are not willing to complete specification are not clear but vague, the supplier is a monopolist where all these situation exist or pretrial, the buyer has no alternative than to negotiation. Hence, negotiation is a practical technique arriving at a price to pay for goods and services.</p> <p>One the other hand, material management is a total concept involving an organization structure, unifying into a single responsibilities of systematic flow and control of material from identification, the material functions of planning, scheduling, buying, storing, moving and distribution of material are met.</p> <p>The objective is to contribute to increase profitability by coordinate achievement of least total material cost through common responsibility of these knowledge of materials and their uses. The co-ordination of these function into a simple materials management department will no doubt result in the reduction of operating costs.</p> <p>Mobil producing Nigeria unlimited (MPN) is the second largest oil producer in Nigeria. It started operation in the country in 1955 as Mobil exploration Nigeria incorporated. (MEIN) in December 1961 after unsuccessful exploration efforts in the former western and northern regimes, MEIN was granted two offshore oil prospecting license (opis) in the eastern region. In early 1964 MENI made its first discovering. The prospecting license where converted to four oil mining license in 1968 and by the end of that year a total of 50 exploratory wells and 15 appraises wells had been drilled.</p> <p>On June 16, 1969, mobil producing Nigeria incorporated to take over and continue the business of MENI early in 1991. in compliance with the requirements of the new company’s and allied matters decree No. 19 of 1990 company’s name became Mobil producing Nigeria unlimited. (MPN) MPN began producing of crude oil on February 15 1970 in the offshore area of the eastern region.</p> <p>In February, 1985 after 15 years of production, MPN hit ONE BILLION BARREL MAKE made the two billion barrel mark.

Those investments, both in physical infrastructure and in strengthened institutional and human capacities, lay foundations for national development. The quality, timeliness, suitability and affordability of those procured inputs can largely determine whether the public investments will succeed or fail. The Bureau of Public Procurement has established general policies and guidelines relating to public sector procurement, and for supervising procurement implementation as well as reviewing the procurement and award of contract procedures of every public entity to which the Public Procurement Act applies, including certifying all Federal wide procurement (subject to the Bureau’s prior review) prior to the award of contracts. This study therefore, was carried out to examine the impact of Public Procurement Act on the Procurement Process in Nigeria. The descriptive method of data analysis was employed while the hypotheses were tested using the SPSS version 20. They result showed that although there are laws guiding the procurement of public inputs; the laws are weak and ineffective and thus has not made much significant impact on the procurement process.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT </strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1    Background of the study</p> <p>1.2    Problem statement</p> <p>1.3    Purpose of the study</p> <p>1.4    Significance of the study</p> <p>1.5    Study hypotheses</p> <p>1.6    Scope and Limitations of the Study</p> <p>1.7    Definition of Basic terminologies</p> <p>1.8    Organization of Study</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO:</strong></p> <p><strong>REVIEW OF RELATED AND RELEVANT LITERATURE</strong></p> <p>2.1    Introduction </p> <p>2.2    Conceptual Review</p> <p>2.3    Theoretical Framework</p> <p>2.4    Empirical Studies</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>3.0    Introduction</p> <p>3.1    Research Design</p> <p>3.2    Sources of data collection</p> <p>3.3    Determination of Population</p> <p>3.4    Determination of sample size</p> <p>3.5    Instrumentation</p> <p>3.6    Instrument Validation</p> <p>3.7    Adopted Method of Analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION</strong></p> <p>4.1    Introduction</p> <p>4.2    Data Presentation</p> <p>4.3    Data analysis</p> <p>4.4    Data Interpretation</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSION, SUMMARY, RECOMMENDATION </strong></p> <p>5.1    Introduction</p> <p>5.2    Conclusion and Findings</p> <p>5.3    Summary of the Study</p> <p>5.4    Recommendation</p> <p><strong>Bibliography</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Government all over the world has a common purpose which is to care for its citizens. This purpose has been seen by many to constitute the sine-qua-non for the existence of any government. However, the achievement of this objective has been bedeviled by corruptions and irregularities in the activities and business of government (Nwafor, 2013). In order to restore the lost confidence of the citizens on the activities and process of government, policies and enactments such as the Public Procurement Act 2007 was established to curb the excesses in government activities and business with a view to ensuring proper regulation in the procurement process. Also government must ensure transparency and accountability in its dealings both in business transaction and non-business activities (Adewole, 2014). </p> <p>Probity is believed to be the ultimate aim of providing for the happiness and welfare of the citizenry and should be the emphasis in the public life (Fayomi, 2013). Since independence in 1960, Nigeria has passed through military and civilian rule, the military are authoritative and rule with decree and the civilian are less authoritative and govern with the constitution and the laws made by the legislature (Jacob, 2010). Both style of ruling engaged in businesses which the large part is the award of contract (Jacob, 2010). The process of awarding these contracts are usually questionable as most of the rich men and women today became rich overnight upon the execution of government contracts. The irregularities in this process can be said to be the main cause of the underdevelopment in this part of the world. </p> <p>According to Ray (1998) to achieve development, requires making some hard choice, punching and jettisoning old methods of doing things that have contributed to underdevelopment. Prior to 2007, to regulate the award of contracts was difficult as there was no direct statutory provision for it in Nigeria and the result is that the award of contract becomes a means by which the government and the ruling elites reward their friends and cronies and by which they too amass wealth (Jacob, 2010). At this time it was extremely difficult to get best value for money in public procurement practices (Onyekpere, 2009). Federal government of Nigeria under the President Olusegun Obasanjo administration seeing the level of corruption in the public procurement process, commission World Bank to carry out an investigation into Nigeria procurement process. At the end of the investigation, World Bank came up with a report called Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). The report revealed that Nigeria was losing average of $10 billion annually due to various irregularities associated with public procurement and contract awards. As responds to these problems public procurement bill was sent to national assembly under President Olusegun Obasanjo regime and was eventually pass into law under the Umaru Musa Yar’Adua administration (Adewole, 2014).</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The early oil boom for Nigeria in 1970s saw the country rack in so much money which had led to her mismanagement of the resources. There have been existing open abuses to rules and standards in the award and execution of public contracts in Nigeria. These were evident in over-invoicing, inflation of contract costs, and proliferation of white-elephant projects and diversion of public funds through all kinds of manipulation of contract system. The regulatory bodies that were set up to ensure compliance with laid down rules and regulations on procurement and award of contracts in the public sector appeared weak and ineffective. This resulted in a high level of corruption and enormous wastage of public resources, lack of transparency, accountability, fairness and openness. The situation made foreign and even local investors to lose confidence in the Nigerian economy. It must be noted that the prevailing high level of corruption was closely linked up with the public sector procurement systems, and considering that about ten percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) must pass through the procurement systems. It then became imperative that the public procurement systems must be reformed if Nigeria must achieve economic growth and developmental strides in this new millennium. It is on this premise that this study was undertaken to examine the impact of public procurement act on the procurement process in Nigeria public sector.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Objective of the study</strong></p> <p>The study aims to achieve the following objectives:</p> <p>a)   To find out if there are existing laws guiding procurement procedures in the public sector.</p> <p>b)   To determine if the laws guiding the public sector procurement process is effective.</p> <p>c)   To examine the impact of the public procurement Act on the procurement process in the public sector.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Public procurement has everything to do with the public just as its name goes. Its financing is drawn from the tax payers’ money and the oil revenue. Thus, it is necessary that oversight functions are not just carried out alone by those appointed but that the public become aware of what is happening in the public procurement scene. This is to enhance their trust in the agency and their representatives. Furthermore, an understanding of the public Procurement Act and how it works will serve as a tool to checkmate the excesses of the institution. This is why this study is marked significant.</p> <p><strong>1.5   Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The study formulated and developed for testing, the following hypotheses:</p> <p><strong>H0:</strong> The Public Procurement Act is weak and ineffective on the Procurement process in the Public sector.</p> <p><strong>Ha:</strong> The Public Procurement Act is weak and ineffective on the Procurement process in the Public sector.</p> <p><strong>H0:</strong> There is no significant impact of public procurement Act on the Public sector procurement procedure.</p> <p><strong>Ha:</strong> There is no significant impact of public procurement Act on the Public sector procurement procedure.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Scope and Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study specifically takes on the public procurement Act in Nigeria with special reference to the Public sector. There are procurement procedures and Acts in the Private sector but this study is limited to the Public sector. Furthermore, this study adopted the descriptive statistical method whereby the questionnaire was used to elicit responses from the respondents to reach a conclusion. This is a limitation, because, further studies can adopt other methods like the investigative kind of method or the use of unbiased data from the Bureau of public procurement in order to examine the effectiveness of the Act and in extension, the Bureau.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Definition of terms</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this study, some terms were repeatedly used throughout this study and as such its pertinent that we provide clarity to these terms for effective comprehension.</p> <p><strong>Public:</strong> This word in this study refers to the people. The masses or the citizens of a given place.</p> <p><strong>Procurement:</strong> this refers to the action of buying goods, materials or services for the good of the public.</p> <p><strong>Process:</strong> This term refers to the procedure, the pattern, the way whereby a certain action has to be followed to arrive at an expected result. Process here has to do with the adopted pattern for procurement.</p> <p><strong>Public Sector:</strong> The Economy is divided into two sectors. The Private sector and the public sector. The public sector has its objectives targeted on the good of the masses. The sector is not profit-oriented but service-oriented. </p> <p><strong>1.7   Organization of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is segmented into five chapters. This is to enhance comprehension, crate symphony in writing and most importantly abide with the departmental project guidelines. Hence, the first chapter deals with a background to the study; stating the problem, its aims, hypotheses and significance. The second chapter brings a review of the related and available literatures. It recognizes the works of several scholars on the same subject and brings to light their contributions and opinions. This chapter is divided into the conceptual, theoretical and empirical frameworks. The third chapter reveals the methodology adopted for this study. The method and sources of data were highlighted in this chapter as well as the research design. The fourth chapter has to do with the presentation and interpretation of data. This is scientific because our claims have to be backed up by verified facts. The fifth chapter gives us the summary of the entire work in few sentences, draws the conclusion for the study and gives recommendations if any.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE IMPACT OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT ACT ON THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS IN NIGERIA PUBLIC SECTOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT ACT ON THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS IN NIGERIA PUBLIC SECTOR", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Inventories policies in manufacturing companies has been a great assistance towards the attainment of organizational goal which aim not only helping the sustenance of manufacturing industries or setting it on a going concern and thereby fostering long term profitability through one of the problems that indeed usually confront manufacturing companies is how to maintain and value their inventories and by so doing achieve opinion inventory. The importance of inventory policy in the attainment of organizational goals cannot be over emphasized since it has been established to play a1 leading role in the continued efficient and profitability productive existence of any manufacturing organization for that reason, the trust of this research work will be essentially to analyze the importance of inventory policy, its problems and solution and as a tool in the attainment of organizational goal using Nigeria breweries Plc. 9th mile corner, near Enugu as a case study.

Analysis of the data collected will be based on the use of simple percentage. This study will be made up of five chapters. Chapter one deals with the introductory part of the study, chapter two deals with literature review which other people view on the subject matter. Chapter three highlighted the methodology method of data collection, Description of instrument used, chapter four try to show the data analysis and interpretation of data. Chapter five deals with findings, recommendation and conclusions, Bibliography, questionnaire.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/></strong></p> <p>        One of the major assets of any company or business are their inventories and they represent a large proportion of total investment of their business. Inventory constitutes one of the largest controllable assets of a business. Survey carried out by accountant international study group in 1968 shows that inventories generally constitutes after assets, the largest balance sheet item in the financial report of manufacturing and merchandizing firm expressed as a percent of net total assets. Managing assets of all kinds is basically an inventory problems. The inefficiency of an inventory may result in an unbalanced inventory. The firm may frequently be out of stock of certain type of inventory and overstock of other type as follows: Raw materials, work in progress and finished goods.</p> <p>        It is pertinent at this juncture to point out that inventory policy cannot be established by a single executive. A sound inventory policy can be obtained by concerted efforts of the films executive committee. This is because production, marketing, financial and purchasing department all have a stake in inventory policy is to be adopted by any organization is as complex as it is important. There is a optimum level of investment for any inventory be it cash, physical plant and other inventories. A mistake in inventory policy may result in either too large or too little of being kept. If production and delivery of goods were instantaneous there would be need for inventory policy except as hedge against changes.</p> <p>        Inventory must be maintained so that the customers may be saved immediately or at least quickly enough so that he does not turn to another source of supply. On the other hand, production operations cannot flow smoothly, without having inventories of work in progress direct materials, finished parts and supplies.</p> <p>        For the purpose of this study, it is necessary to distinguish between inventory records and control and correct stores cards whose balances and physical counts are in agreement. There may be efficient requisition purchasing receiving and material handling. But despite all these thing and diligent employees the inventory control will be inadequate, clerical efficiency therefore is not in arrangement only major duty as inspection can attain inventory control. The major inventory problem is to maximize profitability by balancing inventory investment against what is required to sustain operation.</p> <p>        The problem of inventory investment policy to non-profit organization like hospitals armed forces e.tc. and profitability can take the form of minimizing cost in these organization inventory control and record will not be needed and or applied unless there is a sound inventory policy. The big question asked by a number of businessmen and executive faced with the dilemma and frustration of attempting to maintain stable production operation, provide customers with adequate service and keep investment in stocks and equipment at reasonable levels.</p> <p>        Why are we always out of stock? How often should we re-order or how should we adjust production when sales are uncertain? What capacity level should we set for operation? What do we plan as production and procurement for seasonal sales?  The idea of inventory involves the difficult of determining how big inventory should be. To some people, inventory should be just big enough but what is ‘BIG ENOUGH’. The problem is made more difficult because each individual within the management group tend to answer his questions from his or her own point of view. He or she fails to recognize cost outside his frame work and thinks of inventory in isolation from other operations.</p> <p>        It is unfortunate that business executive are more to view inventories with dislike as an opportunity unnecessary drain on resources, something that one has been able to eliminate, but hardly a “productive” asset like a new machine or tool. They fail to realize that inventories are so productive in earnings as other types of capital investment. They serve as lubrication and spicing for production distribution system keeping it from burning out  or breaking down under external shocks. All organization to survive in this complex system, it must operate efficiently and inventory policy and management will hold to achieved this by resulting in relatively high utilization “ratio” how to write absolute and deteriorated inventories and few instances of work stoppage or cost of sales due to stock out. All these contribute to high profit margin high total assets utilization, high rate of return on investment and a strong stock price.</p> <p>        The need for a proper inventory policy cannot be over emphasized. It could be seen with various benefits associated with sound inventory policy. Good inventory and management achieve the aim of making inventories act as cushions for absorbing planning errors and unforeseen fluctuations in supply and demand and facilitating smooth production and marketing operation.</p> <p>        Furthermore, inventory has help in isolating or minimizing the interdependence of all parts of the organization so that each may work effectively by manufacturing or purchasing many parts and such assembles to be stored and used s needed.</p> <p>        In the light of the above, it should be seen that a good policy helps in attainment a required amount of sales and this sales turnover help in achieving profit maximization which of course is the aim of most organization. inventory policy can be used by organization of all sizes. A proper inventory is the first in achieving organization goal but often policies taken by organization are dangerous that doubt arises of whether there is any policy by organization are dangerous that doubt arises of whether there is any policy at all.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>It has always been asserted that inventory policy involved control, planning and investment and maintenance of inventory for the successful production sales and adequate and prompt service to customers. There is further assertion that without a solid and proper inventory policy, a company cannot be able to achieve aims to which they are set up.</p> <p>        Despite this assertion, the researcher observed that many productive companies have no proper inventories policy and maintaining huge profit. The researcher further observed that these companies have no definite policy for maintaining adequate inventory policy to which the organization is set up.</p> <p><strong>Sub Problems</strong></p> <p>        With the introduction of structural adjustment programs SAP the cost o acquiring money is very high. This has made manufacturing part of the company investment which is being in inventory be it raw materials, spare parts, and finished goods. In recent times, it has been found out that there has been an increased profit through high sales with increasing cost of carrying cost management is watching purchasing decision more closely and one cannot afford to let materials or inventories remain idle in the store house.</p> <p>        The emphasis now was in the integrity function of materials management and taking account of the value of money. More so, inventory policy is to maximize profitability in balancing inventory investment against what is required to sustain smooth operation. The executive of most manufacturing companies view inventory management a times as unnecessary drain on resources which should not be given much more time. Their problem being that forget that the most neglected inventory are also the most expensive to keep in stock.</p> <p>        This negligence has led to some manufacturing companies to be closed down like African Breweries Ibadan and a lot more.</p> <p>        The arbitration imperfection and indiscretion of the management personnel charged with responsibility of inventory planning and control cannot be overlooked. The fund invested in inventories could be used in making investment in other areas that will yield quicker and greater returns and enable the company to enjoy the benefits of time value of money.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJETIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The research work is to examine the unfulfilling attitude influencing size and structure of inventories to be held and the best planning and control methods to be used by the organization.</p> <p>        An organization that takes a good inventory policy has made a step towards achieving its aims and objectives and such could be seen a prudent organization. The types of inventory policy taken its accuracy and time taken to formulate this policy is a prove of good planning, responsiveness to responsibility, and so depends on efficient and effective organization. This study therefore tries to discuss</p> <p>a.   The difficulty of finding the proper cost to be assigned to the maintenance of inventory as well as other matters which influences the establishment of an adequate inventory policy.</p> <p>b.   The problem of re-ordering and production scheduling as it affects inventory policy.</p> <p>c.   The crash seasonal and similar problems as they relate to a rational programme of inventory and production planning with the major problem of forecasting and control included in the total approach to inventory policy in as it relates to the business.</p> <p>d.   This study is also aimed at ascertaining the method of formulating inventory policy in organizations, the levels of inventory stock held and the possible ways of eradicating disappointment from suppliers to customers.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        Lesser attention has been paid to the formulation of inventory policy while more attention has been paid to its management. Efficiency is the key word of all organization be it manufacturing, merchandizing and so on which are both small scale and large scale. A well established inventory policy enables the organization to enjoy multiple effects of its merit. The importance of this study is to provide guideline that will help both effective and efficient. This invariable creates an opportunity for a more co-ordinate work and profit maximization since the satisfaction of most management is that they succeeded in using minimum cost to maximize profit.</p> <p>        To the stores or production manager as he may be called who is responsible for the stores production department and who is responsible and accountable for the inventories. This study will provide the necessary equipment needed for planning, control and procurement of inventories according to “Hongreen” two limits must be imposed in controlling inventory levels because there are two danger points that management usually wants to avoid, the first danger that of inadequate inventories, disrupts production and may lose sale. The second danger excessive inventories introduced unnecessary carrying cost and obsolescence risk.</p> <p>        In the light of the above it is hoped that this study will help eradicate or minimize the incidence of the above with the current emphasis of small scale manufacturing industries, this study will be of immense help to the public and any person who have the intention of indulging in some small scale business. </p> <p>        Others who will benefit from this study are future researchers and fellow students who may pick up this work from the library. Since researcher could not have ordinary gone into this work, as it will be considered invaluable, this work exposed him to things that could have escaped his notice. Employees in training and development courses in stores management for this position of stores work helpful. It is also helped that managers also found this public organization as well as the government and individuals will find this work as an assistance in their daily transaction.</p> <p><strong>1.5 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Policy: </strong>The term policy covers the objects of business and the principle upon which it is conducted.</p> <p><strong>Inventory Control</strong>: Is the controlling of physical qualities of actual things found in the stores at any time.

Ltd. The scope of this research work covers every activity which has to do with negotiation problems, background to the subject matter, rationale for the study and the limitations of the study. The research reviews the related literature about the topic under discussion by gathering from distinguished authors and scholars, facts and opinions the finding of this study through the administration and oval interview of some employees of the company, revealed that effective negotiation lead to cost reduction and also contributed to the company’s profitability.</p> <p>Finally, based on the findings a number of recommendations were made that Asaba Tex Nig ltd should ensure that all staff should under g professional training in the field. Also the company should amend their policy and responsibity for transportation and inspections during negotiation because this is not a good policy. The seller is suppose to be responsible since in is the one to sell his products to the organisation.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/></strong><strong>INTROUDUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is natural for any company that engages in buying and selling to use negotiation techniques in its buying strategies.</p> <p>Negotiation is an important aspect of purchasing and supply. Negotiation in purchasing is the process, which provide a legitimate and ethical means for the buyer and the seller through give and take, or eliminate unjustified or unnecessary increment n cost.</p> <p>It should not be construed as a means of stripping the trend or a fair profit or an opportunity for extracting unreasonable concession. In reliability the most successful negotiations are those which produce result to satisfy both side and which to provide the framework long-term mutually beneficial relationship. In my own understanding Negotiation is nothing but an act and science for arriving at common understanding through bargaining on the essential of contract in purchasing context.</p> <p>Negotiation technique varies from one company to another depending on the type and policy of that company.</p> <p>In most companies and organizations today materials are consideration as vital tools to the success operations.</p> <p>The purchasing of materials take a lion share of the financial budget in a trading period almost 75% of the Asaba textile mill total expenditure goes on material procurement. This makes prompt negotiation a function of purchasing. This project work is a case study of Asaba tex Nigeria limited. I have chosen Asaba for two reasons.</p> <p>First, it is a manifesting company and they have acquired a lot of knowledge about purchasing function secondly, so that I can critically examine how they carryout local and international negotiation practices in the company and its effect on profitability. </p> <p><strong>(ii)        HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>Asaba Textile mile was income prorated on June 18th 1964. The name of the company at that time was Midwest textile mile limited and was the brain child of the partnership of the Midwestern region government and continue card and company ltd of Hamburg, western Germany with 90% and 10% share holding respectively. The authorized and fully paid capital of the company is N2.5m.</p> <p>Location. Asaba textile mile is situated at Asaba on the west bank of the legendary Rive Nigeria. The choice of the form as location of the mill was on double influenced by the fact of the being new river water is crucial to mills therefore this proximity to the river is a good insurance since public water supply is erratic. Locating the mill at Asaba.</p> <p>Also ensured proximity to the bustling  town of Onitsha just across the river.</p> <p>Onitsha has about the largest industrial market in the country.</p> <p>Raw materials and spare parts for the mile machinery are usually available there. Quite importantly too, there is a large market for the dispose of finished textile product. Though incorporated in 1964, production did not start until 2nd October 1965.</p> <p>Incidentally the disastrous Nigeria civil war started barely a year after this and the company was heavily damaged as a result of the ravages a cropping blow I its infancy. The period during which it had operated before the war broke out was far too short to establish a convenient system of production so that in reality it was faced with having to make a fresh start in 1970 when the war ended.</p> <p>Saddled with burden of damaged infrastructure, shortage of water, capital and the resultant low out put, the company plodded on for thirteen years after  that with little to show for the share holders aspirations.</p> <p>In those times production level was at an all – time low of about 4000 metres daily, and to survive we had to lean heavily on the Bendel state Government congresses. With the inception a new brand of directors under V. Okia – Anie however, administrative and operational strategy was over handed, a new energy injured, many forereaching decisions taken in chiding the agonizing one of pruning staff strength by 50% to reduce overheads.</p> <p>Immediately production level increased from dismal ranges of 4000 meters daily, giving the company the impetus to short repaying most of their loans and subventions.</p> <p>On 7th April 1987 a new board of directors under the chairmanship of it, COLEBOMA (rto) was sworn in to run the company. The high production level has been maintained so that today the mile Tums out between 10,000 – 12,000 meter daily. The buoyancy resulting from the production level has made it possible for the new board to reabsorb 140 previously rethreaded workers. The company looks at the further with great expectation hope and determination to keep the customers satisfied.</p> <p><strong>PRODUCTION PROCESSES</strong></p> <p>The mill is equipped with facilities for a full production circler. This means that the mill is capable of taking all production steps necessary to: </p> <p>(1)    Spin raw cotton limit into yarn </p> <p>(2)    We have the yarn to produce grey baft.</p> <p>(3)    And consequently bleach engrave and print the grey baft into the finished product we see in the market.</p> <p>There are four departments that handle start the production of those fine quality prints that the company is increasingly being noted for. The departments are.</p> <p>(A)             Wearing:- In this department, the yarn that has been turned out by the spinning department is woven into grey baft by our export team of weavers the machine with which this process is carried out is know as pirn chancing hoom, of which the mill presently has over five hundred. </p> <p>(B)              Engracing: Engracing the designs that have been chosen for particular prints into the grey baft is carried out by this department.</p> <p>(C)              This is done by the use of copper rollers and screens though the company turns out its own design, the customers can as well bring forward their own specifications for engraving.</p> <p>Finishing: This department processes the cloth with chemicals dyeing, printing and finishing and then making it into the attractive quality production level is encouraging and the incessant demand for the company’s product is an attestation to their high quality. This is a far – cry from the period of how production before 1983 when as we had said production as how as 4,000 meters daily and the company had to spend heavily on government publication Today we an able to say that things have definitely taken a tune for the better and we would like you to depart of that rejuvenation.</p> <p>At the moment, the mill has the capacity to produce African prints, dress prints and poplin. However every effort is being made by the management to polyester garments and other more sophisticated textile products as may be demanded by the market.</p> <p>A good management and a good staff are pre – requisites to a successful industrial growth. A company cannot do without its management neither can it so without its staff. These two aims of the organization, proceeding from their positions of individual strength must mutual dependence. The Asaba textile mill stridently pursues an industrial utopia whereby cordial relation &amp; between management and staff make them partners in progress and not adversaries. It as a result of that pursuit that production levels have been high and sustained in recent times, making possible the re-absolution of 146 previously retrenched staff of the company since last year.    </p> <p>The broad of directors had also established a gratuity / retirement scheme for all categories of staff by arrangement with Bended  insurance company limited. There was no such scheme. It therefore highlights the board’s relentless pursuit of avenues of achieving industrial accord.</p> <p>The staff union exists in the company, which serves as a medium for exchange of views, which may be conveyer to the board if necessary.</p> <p>4% is the capital of the company, reserved for staffs that wish to be shareholders.</p> <p>ASABA TEXTILE MILL AND THE FUTURE OF THE TEXTIE INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA.</p> <p>With the ban on importation of textile into the country, a new horizon opens to genuine textile  mills with the sort of production capacity which Asaba textile has. Since Nigerians must now buy locally – produce textile the market possibilities for a competitive company become bright. However this security of the competing mills in the country to ensure that quality of is a priority.</p> <p>Production will go a long way to re-assure skeptical consumer who have been used to foreign importer one. This is why Asaba textile mill spares on efforts to ensure that the consumers get real nature satisfaction.</p> <p>With the relative industrial superiority of Nigeria on the west Africa sub-region, mark possibilities could quite likely arises in other countries of the sub-region it was partly in recognition of the quality of the company production to popularized the products in the sub-region, that the red. Government especially selected Asaba textile mill represent Nigeria in Sitha– 986, a textile exhibition organized by the European economic community (EEC) at Abidjan,             Cotedevoire.</p> <p>Response to the company’s product was good and far reaching connection.</p> <p>It may be said in conclusion that the future generation will go far in the national textile industry in general and particularly for Asaba textile mill Ltd. Which is very mindful of its risibility in terms of quality to customers.</p> <p><strong>SYSTEM  DISTRBUTION.</strong></p> <p>The company sells its designs to its numerous customers on a cash and carry basis. As the demand far the company’s products steadily increases, it is not only necessary, but fair that special preference be given to customers of Delta state origin in the event of short supply.</p> <p>This is not to say, however that sufficient preference is not made to customers from other parts of the country.</p> <p>Asaba textile mill has customer, who are categorized according to their respective turnovers.</p> <p><strong>1.2              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The chosen research topic in negotiation as a cost reduction tool in material purchase. A case study of Asaba textile mill Nigeria limited Delta state.</p> <p>It came about as of careful observations made by the researcher on the ways business organizations in the manufacturing sector of our economy have been operating.</p> <p>This makes procurement important, which definitely affects an organization profit position. Most industries produce at a very high cost due to high price of material in taken but thy sell only at production cost without making profit in order to meet competition and remain in business.</p> <p>Presently, text tile industries are becoming increasingly sophisticated with difficult product appearing Daily in our market.</p> <p>These are locally made in Nigeria and have to be sold along side with imported wax product. All are competing for almost the same products.</p> <p>The relevance of negotiation is a cost reduction tool on materials purchase in textile industries is that sales revenue is generated after sales.</p> <p>However, the firm can still make profit by ensuring proper negotiation on all materials bought from numerous suppliers source both locally and internationally from forgetting it can be seen that for textile industries and Asaba Tex which is a new textile to survive in this present business environment and economy, it needs a clear understanding and effective application to techniques in all its purchases.</p> <p><strong>1.3     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In 184 the company started experiencing problems  as a result of level of production in the company till 1987 when the company was short down.</p> <p>Bendel state was divided into Edo and Delta state, and assets were share including government parastatals. At the end of the sharing processes, Asaba textile mill was share to Delta state.</p> <p>In 1994, when Aiecdr Ibrahim Kefas was the military Administrator of the state all government owned Para stators including the textile mills were sold and church Gate Nig Limited took over the management of the company with state government controlling 20% shares.</p> <p>In Nigeria economy is currently undergoing quite a number of problems.</p> <p>Principal among these are. The depreciation of the naira and the invariability of foreign  exchange, these combine to affect business positively or negatively.</p> <p>The textile industries have also added responsibility to the present government policy of producing locally. Chemical cottons tools and equipment. In order to discouraged importation which is due to the current exchange rate in the exchange market. The textile industries is now competing with imported wrappers like Hollandaise, English wax and many others, which are either the same high quality.</p> <p>From the above it can be seen that only efficient and innovative firms can survive and satisfy its customers.</p> <p>This makes life difficult for manufacturers who are now forced to be more scientific in order to obtain results, which  can be efficiently merged with the organization goal.</p> <p><strong>1.4              RATIONAL OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The work will provide opportunity for the researcher to compare the theoretical aspect of the importance of purchasing with the practical aspect of it.</p> <p>The study will also be of a benefit to the researcher because it will widen her knowledge on negotiation as practiced in a company as opposed to what is written in textbooks. Also it is a pre-requisite for the award of Higher National Diploma (HND) in purchasing &amp; supply. For the company, it will serve as a reference text and provide probable suggestions to identified problems.  </p> <p>Finally, it will be a benefit to future researchers since almost all aspect of negotiation will fully discussed in this study, hence it will serves as a base for future studies.</p> <p><strong>1.5              DEFINITIONS OF TERMS.</strong></p> <p>Negotiation: This is the process of planning receiving and analyzing used by the buyer and the seller to reach an acceptable compromise in an aspect of business transaction such as price delivery, specification, terms of payment etc. also it is the act of attiring at a common understanding between the buyer and the seller through bargaining on essential of the contract:</p> <p>Purchasing:- This term is also here as the process of buying in the market. But in a broader sense, it is a professional term used when buying goods and services by an industries, commerce and co-operation by a professesional buyer </p> <p>Haggling:- Since negotiation is sometime mistaken to means the same thing as haggling it is good at this juncture to point out that haggling means arguing about price.</p> <p>Expediting:- it is also referred as follow up.</p> <p>Supply: This is the process of obtaining by legal means materials supplies, services and equipment required in the operation of organization.</p> <p>Specification: This is the process of defining an item in terms of it brand or trade name chemical analysis sample standard, performance or any other relevant characteristic suitable in all aspect for the purpose for which it is intended. </p> <p>Bargaining: Is an agreement to discussion in order to arrive at a compromise. </p> <p>Competitive Bidding: Is calling for bids and evaluating the bids to arrive at the best price.</p> <p>Both side wins something. Invariably one side wins, more than the other, this is how it should be in business, superior skills mentis superior records.</p> <p>HEINRITZ AND FARREL (1981, P.265) define negotiation as the act of arriving at a common understanding through bargaining on the essential of contract such as delivery terms, specification, price and others terms. Because of the interaction of these factors and many others, it is a difficult act and requires the exercise of judgment, fact and common senses. The effective negotiation must be a real shopper, alive to the possible of bang aiming strength. A negotiation knows where to be firm or make pessimistic concession on prices and other terms.    </p> <p>            According to Baily and farmer (1981, P.237) negotiation form substantial part of the jobs of most purchasing people with any measure of responsibility. Like sales men, buyer needs to be proficient in such skills as asking good question listening, interpreting, terms in negotiation pre – planning a negotiation ensuring that what is agreed is implemented. They need to be able to analyses and interpret information, and be aware of dangers, making unwarranted assumptions, since negotiation is an interpersonal process, they need to understand something about human behaviors, needs and motivations and the need to develop interactive skills.</p> <p>WESTING J.HC 1976, P-198) commented in established concerts sources of supply that have proved satisfactory in quality, services and prices have been developed over the years. These sources tend to be regularly utilized when the sources are found to be lighter in price or to offer delivery terms that are nor as desirable as those offended by a completion, the buyer will frequently negotiate, with the regular success for better price and delivery terms.</p> <p>            Negotiation may be conducted with the suppliers, sales men or they may sell or buy. It permits a more personal approach to the problem of agreeing on the terms of sales than does the formal invitation method.</p> <p>LYSON (1989,P.208) defines negotiation as any form of verbal communication in which the participant seek to exploits the relative strength of the respective bargaining position to achieve exploit or implicit objectives within the overall purpose of seeking to resolve the identified areas of disagreement.</p> <p>According to UGBANA (1987, 9.102) negotiation is seen as the art and science of arriving at a common understanding through bargaining on the essentials of a contract since as delivery price terms and conditions of services within the purchasing context.</p> <p>It is essentially a technique of communication of interchanging ideas and information as a result of which buyers and sellers arrives at a mutually acceptable bargain. To be successful the purchasing manage should do some home work well by planning his objectives and stages before hand entails the session with a position attitude of success, collecting and sending all relevant facts before the meeting and developing on agenda for the meeting.</p> <p>Since the essential element in negotiation is bargaining between individuals. The process involves personalities, human motive people strength and weakness and a great deal of psychology.</p> <p>Again Baily (1987, P-197-198) asserted that the scientific aids of operations research the elaborate calculations and the expensive computer hard with supplier after the fact  .</p>\n\nNEGOTIATION AS A COST REDUCTION TOOLS IN MATERIALS PURCHASES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NEGOTIATION AS A COST REDUCTION TOOLS IN MATERIALS PURCHASES", "id": 72}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The subject matter of this study is to carefully evaluate the use of tenders in the public sector procurement.  In a bid for better understanding of public procurement as to the Nigerian content backed by the Nigerian procurement Act of 2007. This research work will be focusing on the Bureau for public procurement (BPP) Lion building Enugu as a public sector as a case study. This research work will also take a close look at the various terms that are associated with public procurement. The objectives of this study is to closely examine the evaluation of the use of tenders and  tendering in improving efficiency and effectiveness in the public sector, public sector contract management and public sector administration. In other to attain to the set objectives of this study, research questions were carefully constructed to enable the researcher collect relevant data/information on the subject matter. Attempts were also made to review related literature and opinions of professionals, experts and consultants especially on the following areas. Meaning of tenders and tendering, evaluation of tenders and tender in the public sector purchasing, tendering documents, pre-qualification for tenders and tenders board. During the field work, all collected data will be presented, analyzed and discussions were held on some of the findings and conclusion was made. Based on the conclusions recommendations were made in assisting the development of the public sector tendering and if carefully followed it will ensure accountability and also reduce the rate of frequent abandonment of contracts after contractors has been fully mobilized.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION         </strong></p> <p><strong> 1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Tender to a layman means many things such as to pamper a child, something that is young and so on. But in this context, tender is defined as “An offer made in writing by one party to another to execute certain supply contract/commodity slated at a stated cost”.</p> <p>        Tendering is the process of making an offer, bid or proposal or expressing interest in response to an invitation or request for tender.</p> <p>        The dictionary of purchasing and supply management defines tender and tendering as offers from without callous, usually in sealed envelope, delivered by a time and date specified in the invitation to tendering from supply of goods and services. Uzor (2004:440) in CIPS, tendering can be defined as the public release by an organization of the requirements of goods or services for a project in order to allow formal bids to be made to supply the goods or services. Lyson (1996) also defined tendering as a purchase procedure whereby potential suppliers are invited to make a form and unequivocal offer of the price and terms which on acceptance shall be the basis of the subsequent contract.

The public sector management has in their part made numerous contributions to effective and efficient management of contract in the public sector. Several restrictions has been made to see that tenders and tendering are dully observed. For instance, no contract work involving construction shall be considered by tenders board unless for the reasons as:</p> <p>(a)        The land has been acquired and the topography map on soil tested except where it has been approved by the Architect and it is not necessary. The document relating to the land, the survey map, the soil, test report or certificate of example by the architect should then pay off contract document to be presented to the board.

This goal is accomplished by the appropriate blending of what many management authorities call the five mis-machines, men, Material money and management, material today are the life blood of industry. No industrial organization can operate without them. They must be at the right time, in the right quality, at the right quantity, at the right price, and at the right place.<br/> Whether in period of inflation, or price stability or recession, obtaining materials at the right place can literally mean the difference between a firm’s success and failure. Hence, the right price is prime importance to every buyer and seller. Unfortunately no single set of pricing principle or criteria exist for calculating precisely what constitutes a fair and reasonable price. Therefore to obtain the right prices, three basic methods can be used by buyers.<br/>These are:-<br/>a. Published price list<br/>b. Competitive bidding<br/>c. Negotiation.<br/>When a buyer is not satisfied with the price after using published price list and competitive binding in resort to negotiation.<br/> According to the chamber century dictionary “negotiation means to confer the purpose of mutual agreement.<br/> The Webster dictionary defines it as “conferring discussing or bargaining to reach agreement in business transaction.’ In industry “Negotiation” is sometime confused with happening and dieseling while in government it is frequently visualized as a nefarious means of avoiding competitive bidding and of awarding large contracts to favored suppliers.<br/> According to Oyeoku (1993) Negotiation is just but a process whereby a representative of buying organization and the selling organization attempt to reach precise agreement on all terms and conditions which makes a contact come into being. it involve all aspect of purchasing rationed discussion, conferring and bargaining on each aspect and the arrival at a common understanding of what is the best in the interest of both parties.<br/> In successful negotiation both sides win, the winnings are seldom equally divided. Invariably one side wins more than the other. This is how it should be in business”. Negotiation is particularly useful though not always fully successful, in dealing with seller controlling multiple source that behave in a monopolistic manner, in cased where cost are not reliable determine in advance, as in most research contracts and in any contract for items that had never been made before there is no alternative to negotiation.<br/> The important of negotiation of purchasing is that it is a method used especially were the time of purchasing of materials is too short the money value involved is too low, the number of bidders is made adequate, they are not willing to compete, specifications are not clear but vague, the supplier is a monopolist, where all these situation exist or prevail, the buyer has no alternative than to negotiate. Hence, negotiation is a practical technique arriving at a price to pay for goods and service.<br/> On the other hand, materials management is a total concept involving an organizational structure, unifying into a single responsibility the systematic flow and control of materials from identification of the reed through customer delivery. Through negotiation, the materials functions of planning, scheduling, buying, stiring, moving and distributing of material are met. The objective is to contribute to increase profitability by co-operation of this function into a simple material management department with no doubt result in the reduction of operating cost.<br/>1.1. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Mobile producing Nigeria united (MPN) is the second largest oil producer in Nigeria. It started operation in the country in 1955 as Mobil exploration.<br/> In June 16, 1969, mobile producing Nigeria limited (MPN).MPN began producing crude oil on February 15, 1970 in The offshore area of the eastern region. The areas are now in Akwa Ibom state.<br/> In February 1985, after 215v years of production MPN hit ONE BILLION Barrel mark. Ten years latter, specifically in may 1995, MPN made the TWO BILLION BARREL mark. In April 1991, MPN struck another land mark when along with its joint venture partner, the NNPC, it signed loan agreements for about 900 million us dollar with international lenders to develop and produce its 800 field condensate reserves, estimate at about 500 million barrels.<br/> The company’s overall construction towards the country’s economic and social development has followed closely in the wake of its production growth. It was in recognition of this contribution that it won together with its parents and sister companies. Mobile oil cooperation and mobile Nigeria plc, the 1985 honor award of the Nigeria., America chamber of commerce. MPN was also the first cooperate citizen to win the honor award of the society of occupational health physicians of Nigeria (SOPNON).<br/> In 1989, MPN won the energy press award for making notable contributions to the growth of energy journalism in Nigeria and for peace setting relationship with the media. NNPC mobile joint ventures also assist in various community development project and participates in the cultural life of the host community.<br/> In 1993 MPN initiated the four year community action programs for community and has enhanced the company’s relationship with the communities. Mobile has contributed to the development of human resources in Nigeria it currently.

It is an attempt to look at the various problems facing the purchasing department in purchasing the right quality materials at the right price. In some of the organizations, their tactic has given rise to a lot of problems. The negligence arises as a result.<br/> LACK OF COMPETENT STAFF<br/>For materials to be purchased at a reasonable price there is need for competent staff who understands the various methods of pricing. There is lack of good negotiation in this organization; therefore, this reduces the success of negotiation.<br/> EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES<br/>An external force also contributes the problems of the purchasing department. These are political, economic and social force.<br/> UNRELIABLE SUPPLIERS<br/>The reliability record level, this poses problem to the purchasing department.<br/> 1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>The purpose of this research is to look at<br/>a. The different method of pricing are published price list, competitive bidding and negotiation.<br/>b. The importance of negotiation against the other method of pricing.<br/>c. The bargaining strategies used by the industries and how effective they are used.<br/>d. The effect of the non-used of negotiation in the purchasing of goods.<br/> 1.4    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The objectives of the study are to identify the different methods of pricing and by so doing state the importance of negotiation as one of the means of arriving at a price to pay for goods and services. It is also to high-light negotiation tactics and how effectively negotiation is used in industries.<br/> 1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>To test this assertion requires collecting response from a group of question, bidden in various parts of the questionnaire.<br/>1.

It is by it’s nature of service” function oriented to providing a complete supply service for users within the organization.<br/> Purchasing according to Oyeoku (1993) is referred to as function of business that enters into contracts with the organization suppliers and the final places orders with them. Where the function of procurement is emerged with that of store, the receive and pay for the goods and service in other to received on behalf of the organization. purchasing can also be define according to oyeoku (1993) as the act of accomplishing through identifying and comparing the suppliers as well as their supplier  that are  available to organization through the process of negotiation with the sources available to  them with sole intention of arriving at an agreed term in order to limit cost and  improve the organization profit.<br/> According to Lyson (1984) he defines organizational purchasing as that function that is responsible for obtaining by purchase, equipment, material, lease or other legal means, supplies and service required by an undertaking for production use.<br/> In this definition, the word purchasing has been used in an economic sense of definition the function of creating utilities goods and service that satisfy human wants.<br/> Purchasing does not confined to manufacturing output but also applied to even distributing, and services organization.<br/> The importance of efficient purchasing  to manufacturing  organization cannot be over- emphasized, ‘that is’ it is to created efficient supply of  equipment, fuel raw materials, component, power and other consumable service for use by industries.<br/> Long ago buyers where employed to buy production material without a proper research on market to obtain the right quality at the right price, and with a high increase of profit to organization.<br/>Today purchasers are trash to have organization need in an efficient economical and wiser from for equipments to organization. This approach was only successful when services or goods are not many substitutes, when there was an abundant material and when many managers took resources for granted.<br/> According to Baily (1987) organizational purchasing is the  process by which organization  define the needs for  goods and services, and  compare  the supplies and suppliers available for them, and  arrive at agreed terms of trading and make contracts and place orders, also accept, revise and pay for the goods and service supplied.<br/> The numerous diverse item that are constantly needed and when the quality of material influences the cost of manufacturing the final product, then an organization  purchaser function becomes particularly very important and this demand close attention.<br/> Therefore manufacturing organization should realizes the fact that the buyers is the custodians of organization purser and hence economists are derived purchasing provide direct saving on cost and contribute to cash increase flow<br/> According to the institute for supply management purchasing is defined as a major function of required material service and equipment.<br/> 1.2         HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY AREA<br/>A case study of Nigeria bottling companying coca-coca plot 82 industrial layout transamdi PH  The Nigeria bottle company also know as coca-coca situated at 82 plot industrial layout transamdi (ph) manufacture  training of soft drink generally called coca-coca product and produce Eva water ,the soft drink are in both cans and bottle. the company are manager by professionals and expertriates with wealth of experience, the class range of the company is from professional to the casual workers, the product from the company have been approved by NATIONAL AGENCY FOR FOOD,DRUGS ADMINISTRATIVE AND CONTROL(NAFDAC) the company have varieties of  product in the Nigeria market.<br/> 1.3    STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>In recent years, it been notices that purchasing has not been accorded the statue which it deserve in organization.<br/> The major problem lies on the fact that in an organization everybody wants to buy in purchasing decision.

The pres¬ent study focused on improvements in internal materials handling management, approaching the case of a large company in the automotive industry. Materials handling is intrinsically associated with production flow. Because of this, it has direct influence on transit time, resources usage, and service levels. The objective was to evaluate, in a systematic way, the impact of implemented changes in ma¬terials handling management on the internal customers’ perceptions of cost, safety in service, service reliability, agility and overall satisfaction. A literature review preceded a case study in the company’s manufacturing unit and the questionnaires were completed by 26 employees directly involved in the process. Analyzing the answers, it was possible to suggest that internal customers understood that the new materials handling management system enlarged service agility and reliability and reduced costs, which caused an improvement in overall satisfaction.<br/>  CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>There is a strong concern to adjust the supply system in a company (Machline, 2008) to achieve a higher service lev¬el internally and to the outside customers. This brings to a higher operational level and even a possible differential when compared with the other competitors (Milan, Paiva &amp; Pretto, 2006; Paiva, Carvalho Jr. &amp; Fensterseifer, 2004).<br/>Materials handling management is among many factors that contribute to improve a company’s performance. The Materials Handling Industry of America [MHIA] defines materials handling man-agement as “Material Handling is the movement, storage, control and protection of material, goods, and products throughout the process of manufac¬turing, distribution, consumption and disposal. The focus is on the methods, mechanical equip¬ment, systems and related controls used to achieve these functions” (mhia.org/learning/glossary). Then it is observed that handling is broader than simple materials movement, although both terms are sometimes used as synonyms. The relevance of materials handling stems from the intrinsic relationship that it has with production flow. When it presents an imbalance, there is forma¬tion of extra stock or rupture in supply. When the flow does not have enough velocity, transit time is long and the system is not capable of serving the customers when they need it.<br/>It is well understood that material handling im¬provement may have positive effects over produc¬tion. However, it is not only production, but the way the employees see the new situation. When the per-ception is favorable, the benefits are possible; if not, behavioral issues can emerge. Evaluations are im-portant when interventions into the work environ¬ment are implemented. The present work is specifi-cally related to materials handling management. By means of effective materials handling management, the company’s operational performance may im¬prove (Chopra &amp; Meindl, 2001; Rosenbloom, 2003) aiming to satisfy the customers or meet their expec¬tations in terms of their needs, desires and demands (Oliver, 2010; Stock &amp; Lambert, 2001).<br/>The case study related in this work was performed in an automotive industry located in the northeast-ern part of Rio Grande do Sul State of Brazil. It was founded more than 50 years ago and is classified as a large-sized company since it has more than 2000 employees. This region contains a cluster of indus-tries of metal-mechanic, automotive and metallurgi¬cal sectors that in its majority belong to production chains which demand a high internal performance level from their partners.<br/>The company in question, after analyzing produc¬tion flow as a whole, identified that among other measures it would be necessary to improve mate¬rials handling management in the manufacturing process. This was motivated by the observed de¬lay in forklifts service and their high maintenance cost. Forklifts were used both for parts handling and transportation and to assist in tooling changes, which many times resulted in excessive setup time leading to production delays. Changes were made in the materials handling process to address these concerns.<br/>The main objective of this case study was to evalu¬ate internal customers’ satisfaction levels after the change. In order to do this, it was necessary to iden¬tify the factors that explain overall satisfaction; to do it, open-ended questionnaires were applied. The re¬spondents – 26 people directly linked to daily mate¬rials flow – were requested to identify the attributes and unfold them into sub-factors which represented the internal process in more details. The identified attributes were cost, safety in service, service reli¬ability and agility. After this step, a second question¬naire with close-ended questions was applied to the same respondents in order to evaluate performance satisfaction at each factor and sub-factor and also overall satisfaction. The questions requested the re¬spondent perception about the improvement – per¬ceived or not – after the interventions.<br/>The collected data were analyzed with multiple re¬gressions. Data analysis indicated that the factors agility, service reliability and cost are able to explain overall satisfaction. In addition to that the satisfac-tion level of most of internal customers with the new materials handling management system is equal or even superior when compared to the previous one.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The first sub-section describes the situation prior to the intervention, identifying the problems that were found. The second describes the factors that moti¬vated the change. The third describes the changes and the situation after its completion. Besides vari¬ables and sub-variables, customers’ overall satisfac¬tion regarding the implemented changes was also evaluated.<br/>1.3 SITUATION PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION<br/>This study was conducted in the manufacturing sec¬tor of an automotive company. The manufacturing sector is responsible for almost all of the supply of assembly lines, including the components that go through a pre-assembly process before proceeding to final product assembly. In this sector are concen¬trated cutting and bending tools and dies required for components manufacturing to assembly lines. The whole process runs with the aid of forklifts. Of¬ten, the setup time is equal to or higher than the time needed for parts manufacturing. This situation, cou¬pled with the cost of downtime, demonstrates the importance of the tooling exchange process.<br/>Besides helping in the execution of setups and carry¬ing out internal transport managed by an electronic scoreboard installed in the factory roof, forklifts also performed activities for transporting materials be¬tween pavilions. When executing this last activity, the forklifts often travelled on uneven roads, which caused great bouncing, burdening maintenance cost for equipment wear or premature breakage.<br/>Often, when a forklift leaves its workplace to transport a container between pavilions, delays in machines’ setups are generated, causing unnecessary costs and stress on the forklift operator. The operator could do little besides feel forced to increase the speed during the route, creating risks of accidents with personal in¬jury and / or materials damage. This activity as well as the studied process relate to Goldratt’s Theory of Constraints (TOC) to seek bottlenecks and reduce or eliminate them (Goldratt; Cox, 2004).<br/>Although there were enough forklifts to meet the demand from the manufacturing sector, many times it was not possible to meet immediately the manu¬facturing needs due to reasons like long distances to travel and frequent maintenance due to excessive use of the equipment. This directly affected internal customers’ satisfaction.<br/>The presented problem was: how to increase inter¬nal customer satisfaction, while stabilizing or de-creasing forklifts’ maintenance cost?<br/> 1.4 CHANGE MOTIVATORS<br/>Due to development of new markets, manufacturing demands for a large variety of components and final product assemblies increased. This demand growth led to speed increases and changes in how materials and tools were being handled and transported in or¬der to monitor manufacturing requirements.<br/>With these changes and demands for manufacturing to attain the company’s goals, there was also pres¬sure for growth and lack of tolerance with forklift operators, since the work did not always run quickly and with quality. Additionally, forklift maintenance costs were increasing, demanding sometimes exces¬sive spending that jeopardized the budget. The dis¬satisfaction and demotivation of forklift operators was notorious, and an increase was also noticed in the number of collisions between the equipments. Finally, boxes and containers were unsatisfactorily stored in the hallways together with the machines to attempt to reduce production interruptions.<br/>1.5 THE CHANGES AND THE SITUATION AFTER THE IMPLE¬MENTATION<br/>One suggested solution was to rent two forklifts as a way to solve the problem. But this only served to soften it, and brought a larger cost to the company. It was realized then that it was not the quantity of equipments that was going to solve the problem but the way material handling was being executed in re¬lation to the necessity of the presented changes.<br/>From this observation, processes and material flows were mapped and separated in two ways: (i) verti¬cal movements which make greater efforts and little ground movement; and (ii) horizontal movements that rely on traction to travel longer distances, in¬cluding transport out of the work units.<br/>Another proposed solution was to use a tractor tow¬ing small “wagons”, forming a kind of train. Ballou (1993) states that this approach is more economical for larger volumes that must be moved over long distances along the same route.<br/>Several cargo (pallets) units were constructed with special wheels, fitted with suspension coupled to support the material weight and traverse the gaps between the pavilions. Afterwards, several “cages” were made to be used for holding the parts that go through the processes of bath and painting. More robust containers for heavier and less delicate parts storage were also constructed.<br/>The next step was to create spaces (pit stops) for pallets with their mobile parts on each workstation. In order to the truck driver to know when he could transport material, it was necessary to create an iden¬tification system. It was decided that every time that the operator finished the process in his station, he would put on the packaging a green sign indicating that the container would be ready to be transported to the next production step. The truck driver, when removing a filled container, should replace it with an empty one in the vacant post.<br/>Tests were conducted with a timetable for the train passage, but this alternative did not meet the need for flexibility in case of emergencies (pieces to tech¬nical assistance and replacement of damaged mate¬rials in the assembly process).<br/>It was then decided to set a path that would follow the manufacturing process sequence. To inform the train operator of some urgency, a mobile phone was given to him. Thus, the supervisor could commu¬nicate with the operator instantly when there were critical parts and / or components to be collected.<br/>After the changes were completed, it was necessary to evaluate their impacts. This study evaluated inter¬nal customers’ satisfaction level with the new mate¬rials handling and transporting configuration.<br/>1.6    ORGANIZATION FOR EFFECTIVE MATERIALS HANDLING<br/>Good materials handling practice is the responsibility of all members of the manufacturing team, form the top management down to the trucker working in the aisle of the plant. Very few other elements of manufacturing activity must be so carefully considered by each function in the manufacturing organization. Optimum effectiveness of materials handling procedures can only be attained if each individual recognizes and plays his part. Education and training in materials handling are prerequisite to minimum materials handling costs. Responsibilities assigned such a staff group may well include:<br/>1. Determining all new methods for the handling of new materials or products and selecting the equipment to be utilized.<br/>2. Conducting research in materials handling methods and equipment.<br/>3. Conducting education and training for all manufacturing personnel in good material handling practices.<br/>4. Establishing controls of current materials handling costs by analysis of costs and comparison to budgets of either unit or total materials handling costs.<br/>5. Initiating and conducting a continuing materials handling cost-reduction or cost improvement program.<br/>6. Determining measurements for effectiveness of materials handling that can become the yard – sticks for progress in this activity.<br/>7. Developing and conducting a preventive maintenance program for all materials handling equipment.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF MATERIALS HANDLING<br/>In a broad sense, materials handling includes all movement of materials, in a manufacturing situation. It has been defined by the Materials Handling Division.<br/>American Society of Mechanical Engineers, as follows: “Materials handling is the art and science involving the moving, packing, and storing of substances in any form.”<br/>This is an all inclusive definition and can include fluids and semi-fluids, as well as discrete items. For the sake of simplicity, we shall limit our discussion in this chapter to the movement of discrete items, such as gears, tires, castings, and boxes. Similarly, we shall consider only the movement of materials within the plant or storage areas.<br/>Movement of materials between plants- particularly when common carriers are used – is generally considered a problem in traffic and is frequently handled by a separate traffic department.<br/>1.8    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The present study had as its objective to evaluate, in a systematic way, the impact of the implemented changes in materials handling management on the internal cus¬tomers’ perceptions at the manufacturing department in Marcopolo S/A. unit located in Caxias do Sul – RS.<br/>To reach this objective, the following specific objectives were established:<br/>(i) describe the changes in material handling processes at the company;<br/>(ii) evaluate inter¬nal material handling flow in manufacturing, verifying the improvements; and<br/>(iii) Analyze internal custom¬ers’ satisfaction levels relative to the new system.<br/>(iv)   The simplest solution to the materials handling problem- “No movement, no cost” is hardly practicable for a complete manufacturing process. It is basically sound approach when one is attempting to improve a complete production cycle and when the number of handling can be reduced. It is also a good solution in the making of heavy industrial equipment.<br/>(v)    In the latter situation it is often more feasible to bring the tools and workers to the product than to transport the product to the machine or work area.<br/>(vi)   In addition to the objective of reducing the overall costs of materials handling by reducing the number of handling involved, the following may be considered as objectives of the engineer in his or her approach to this problem.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF EFFICIENT MATERIALS HANDLING IN A MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF EFFICIENT MATERIALS HANDLING IN A MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION", "id": 76}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ROLE OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION IN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIA:<br/>CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research work was designed to survey the role of transportation and communication to the economic development of Nigeria. In carrying out this researcher visited Oredo Local Government Area to carry out research about topic considered. Interviewed and questionnaire were used to collect data and these were analyzed in form of table, figure and using percentage. Therefore, from the data collected  and analyzed it was observed that transportation have contributed a lot to the economic development of Oredo Local Government Area, it was also reveal that transportation has employed over eighty (80) percent of the individual in Oredo Local Government Area and this is a good economic benefit to the people it has created job opportunity for. Based on the finding, the following recommendation were made, the government should improve on the repair of road nationwide most especially in Oredo Local Government Area. Also, in the area of power supply, which is necessary for every modern society, it will be very important to improve on the distribution to enhance effective communication in the city and also improve the business communication. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Introduction<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Research question<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Limitation of the study<br/>Literature definition of term<br/>CHAPTER TWO  <br/>Review of related literature<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Design of the study<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample of the study<br/>Sampling techniques<br/>Instrumentation       <br/>Validation of instrument<br/>Method of data collection<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR          <br/>Presentation of data and discussion of result<br/>CHAPTER FIVE  <br/>Summary<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>REFERENCES     <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE       <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>        The role of transportation and communication cannot be over emphases in the economic development of Nigeria, because the fundamental purpose of transportation and communication and their various needs in the form of material facilities and service. However, transportation and communication facilities are vital infrastructure of a modern economy transportation system comprises of several models including road, rail, water ways etc. and communication system includes post office, courier service wireless, and electronic media. According to a report from environmental news on Nigeria transportation and communication, Nigeria transportation network was one of the best in Africa in 1990, featuring an existence system of paved high way, rail road, airports and ports. During the oil boom of the 1990s, however, most government funds era-marked (assigned) for transportation were applied to the construction of new roads and maintenance of existing facilities was ignored. As a result the transportation system was plague with congestion and a deteriorating infrastructure. Like many economic activities that are intensive in infrastructure, the role of transportation sector is an important component of the economy impacting on development and the welfare of population. When transportation system are efficient, they provide economic and social opportunities and benefits that results  in positive multipliers effects such as better accessibility to market employment and additional investments, when transportation system are  deficient in terms of capacity or reliability, they can have an economic cost such as reduced or missed opportunities. Transportation also carries and important social and environmental load which cannot be neglected thus, form a general stand point, the economic impact of transportation can be direct and indirect. The direct impact is related to accessibility change where transportation enables to save time and costs. Indirect impact is related to the economy multiplier, effect where the price of commodities goods or services drop and /or their variety increases. (News watch Nigeria social infrastructure Edo State.<br/>        On the other hand, according to Wikipedia, transportation links together the factors of production in a complex wed of relationship between producers and consumers, the outcomes is commonly a more efficient division of production by an exploitation of geographical comparative advantages as well as the means to develop economics of scale and scope. The productivity of space, capital and labour is thus enhanced with efficiency of distribution and personal mobility. It is acknowledge that economic growth is increasingly linked with transportation developments, namely infrastructures but also managerial expertise is crucial for logistics.<br/>        Moreover, the article published by environmental news, on Nigeria’s transportation and communication stresses that early modern communication took place in three modes, spoken words manuscripts writing especially letters and prints, oral communication was the oldest of these three and in many orays, early modern society was still primarily on oral society. Although literacy increased enormously during this period, most people, especially among the lower classes, possessed limited reading and speech for preserving and transmitting information. Furthermore, as a result of a major expansion of one of the best domestic Tele communication system in sub-Sahara Africa in 1990, about 11,000 telephones were put in places in Nigeria at the end of the 1980s about one third of the were in the capital. Also a domestics satellite system with nineteen ground stations, along with coaxial cable and a micro wave network linked all major urban areas most localities could received at least one of the society-five amplitude modulation (AM) radio stations, more than a dozen cities had frequency modulation (FM) radio stations short wave broadcasts from six transmitters were directed at remote rural areas, broad cast were in English, Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo and twelve other languages. Most urban areas also had television service.<br/>        In 1990, the country had an estimated ten million radio and ten million televisions. However, international telecommunication were modern and provides the high quality links to the rest of the world, in coordination with international telecommunication Satellite Corporation (intelsat), Atlantic Ocean and India Ocean satellite, three ground stations made live television broadcasting, and direct telephone dialing was possible between Nigeria was the terminus of an undersea coaxial cable linking the West Africa countries with France and capable of carrying nine hundred and sixty simultaneous long distance telephone calls.

Inventory constitutes one of the largest controllable assets of a business. Survey carried out by accountant international study group in 1968 shows that inventories generally constitutes after assets, the largest balance sheet item in the financial report of manufacturing and merchandizing firm expressed as a percent of net total assets. Managing assets of all kinds is basically an inventory problems. The inefficiency of an inventory may result in an unbalanced inventory. The firm may frequently be out of stock of certain type of inventory and overstock of other type as follows: Raw materials, work in progress and finished goods.<br/>        It is pertinent at this juncture to point out that inventory policy cannot be established by a single executive. A sound inventory policy can be obtained by concerted efforts of the films executive committee. This is because production, marketing, financial and purchasing department all have a stake in inventory policy is to be adopted by any organization is as complex as it is important. There is a optimum level of investment for any inventory be it cash, physical plant and other inventories. A mistake in inventory policy may result in either too large or too little of being kept. If production and delivery of goods were instantaneous there would be need for inventory policy except as hedge against changes.<br/>        Inventory must be maintained so that the customers may be saved immediately or at least quickly enough so that he does not turn to another source of supply. On the other hand, production operations cannot flow smoothly, without having inventories of work in progress direct materials, finished parts and supplies.<br/>        For the purpose of this study, it is necessary to distinguish between inventory records and control and correct stores cards whose balances and physical counts are in agreement. There may be efficient requisition purchasing receiving and material handling. But despite all these thing and diligent employees the inventory control will be inadequate, clerical efficiency therefore is not in arrangement only major duty as inspection can attain inventory control. The major inventory problem is to maximize profitability by balancing inventory investment against what is required to sustain operation.<br/>        The problem of inventory investment policy to non-profit organization like hospitals armed forces e.tc. and profitability can take the form of minimizing cost in these organization inventory control and record will not be needed and or applied unless there is a sound inventory policy. The big question asked by a number of businessmen and executive faced with the dilemma and frustration of attempting to maintain stable production operation, provide customers with adequate service and keep investment in stocks and equipment at reasonable levels.<br/>        Why are we always out of stock? How often should we re-order or how should we adjust production when sales are uncertain? What capacity level should we set for operation? What do we plan as production and procurement for seasonal sales?  The idea of inventory involves the difficult of determining how big inventory should be. To some people, inventory should be just big enough but what is ‘BIG ENOUGH’. The problem is made more difficult because each individual within the management group tend to answer his questions from his or her own point of view. He or she fails to recognize cost outside his frame work and thinks of inventory in isolation from other operations.<br/>        It is unfortunate that business executive are more to view inventories with dislike as an opportunity unnecessary drain on resources, something that one has been able to eliminate, but hardly a “productive” asset like a new machine or tool. They fail to realize that inventories are so productive in earnings as other types of capital investment. They serve as lubrication and spicing for production distribution system keeping it from burning out  or breaking down under external shocks. All organization to survive in this complex system, it must operate efficiently and inventory policy and management will hold to achieved this by resulting in relatively high utilization “ratio” how to write absolute and deteriorated inventories and few instances of work stoppage or cost of sales due to stock out. All these contribute to high profit margin high total assets utilization, high rate of return on investment and a strong stock price.<br/>        The need for a proper inventory policy cannot be over emphasized. It could be seen with various benefits associated with sound inventory policy. Good inventory and management achieve the aim of making inventories act as cushions for absorbing planning errors and unforeseen fluctuations in supply and demand and facilitating smooth production and marketing operation.<br/>        Furthermore, inventory has help in isolating or minimizing the interdependence of all parts of the organization so that each may work effectively by manufacturing or purchasing many parts and such assembles to be stored and used s needed.<br/>        In the light of the above, it should be seen that a good policy helps in attainment a required amount of sales and this sales turnover help in achieving profit maximization which of course is the aim of most organization. inventory policy can be used by organization of all sizes. A proper inventory is the first in achieving organization goal but often policies taken by organization are dangerous that doubt arises of whether there is any policy by organization are dangerous that doubt arises of whether there is any policy at all.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          It has always been asserted that inventory policy involved control, planning and investment and maintenance of inventory for the successful production sales and adequate and prompt service to customers. There is further assertion that without a solid and proper inventory policy, a company cannot be able to achieve aims to which they are set up.<br/>        Despite this assertion, the researcher observed that many productive companies have no proper inventories policy and maintaining huge profit. The researcher further observed that these companies have no definite policy for maintaining adequate inventory policy to which the organization is set up.<br/>Sub Problems<br/>        With the introduction of structural adjustment programs SAP the cost o acquiring money is very high. This has made manufacturing part of the company investment which is being in inventory be it raw materials, spare parts, and finished goods. In recent times, it has been found out that there has been an increased profit through high sales with increasing cost of carrying cost management is watching purchasing decision more closely and one cannot afford to let materials or inventories remain idle in the store house.<br/>        The emphasis now was in the integrity function of materials management and taking account of the value of money. More so, inventory policy is to maximize profitability in balancing inventory investment against what is required to sustain smooth operation. The executive of most manufacturing companies view inventory management a times as unnecessary drain on resources which should not be given much more time. Their problem being that forget that the most neglected inventory are also the most expensive to keep in stock.<br/>        This negligence has led to some manufacturing companies to be closed down like African Breweries Ibadan and a lot more.<br/>        The arbitration imperfection and indiscretion of the management personnel charged with responsibility of inventory planning and control cannot be overlooked. The fund invested in inventories could be used in making investment in other areas that will yield quicker and greater returns and enable the company to enjoy the benefits of time value of money.<br/>1.3 OBJETIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>        The research work is to examine the unfulfilling attitude influencing size and structure of inventories to be held and the best planning and control methods to be used by the organization.<br/>        An organization that takes a good inventory policy has made a step towards achieving its aims and objectives and such could be seen a prudent organization. The types of inventory policy taken its accuracy and time taken to formulate this policy is a prove of good planning, responsiveness to responsibility, and so depends on efficient and effective organization. This study therefore tries to discuss<br/>The difficulty of finding the proper cost to be assigned to the maintenance of inventory as well as other matters which influences the establishment of an adequate inventory policy.<br/>The problem of re-ordering and production scheduling as it affects inventory policy.<br/>The crash seasonal and similar problems as they relate to a rational programme of inventory and production planning with the major problem of forecasting and control included in the total approach to inventory policy in as it relates to the business.<br/>This study is also aimed at ascertaining the method of formulating inventory policy in organizations, the levels of inventory stock held and the possible ways of eradicating disappointment from suppliers to customers.<br/>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        Lesser attention has been paid to the formulation of inventory policy while more attention has been paid to its management. Efficiency is the key word of all organization be it manufacturing, merchandizing and so on which are both small scale and large scale. A well established inventory policy enables the organization to enjoy multiple effects of its merit. The importance of this study is to provide guideline that will help both effective and efficient. This invariable creates an opportunity for a more co-ordinate work and profit maximization since the satisfaction of most management is that they succeeded in using minimum cost to maximize profit.<br/>        To the stores or production manager as he may be called who is responsible for the stores production department and who is responsible and accountable for the inventories. This study will provide the necessary equipment needed for planning, control and procurement of inventories according to “Hongreen” two limits must be imposed in controlling inventory levels because there are two danger points that management usually wants to avoid, the first danger that of inadequate inventories, disrupts production and may lose sale. The second danger excessive inventories introduced unnecessary carrying cost and obsolescence risk.<br/>        In the light of the above it is hoped that this study will help eradicate or minimize the incidence of the above with the current emphasis of small scale manufacturing industries, this study will be of immense help to the public and any person who have the intention of indulging in some small scale business.<br/>        Others who will benefit from this study are future researchers and fellow students who may pick up this work from the library. Since researcher could not have ordinary gone into this work, as it will be considered invaluable, this work exposed him to things that could have escaped his notice. Employees in training and development courses in stores management for this position of stores work helpful.

Organizational purchasing started in Nigeria Seriously after Independence. Before Independence, the Industry was mainly administrative and not manufacturing, manufacturing firm started shortly after Independence in Nigeria in earnest.<br/>Purchasing department was developed immediately in Industries an assigned with major roles such as:<br/>1.                  Finding and approving suppliers<br/>2.                  Ensuring delivery at the right time<br/>3.                  Warning of delays<br/>4.                  Verifying invoices<br/>5.                  Organizing all discussion with suppliers.<br/>6.                  Speculative buying<br/>7.                  Advising on prices and<br/>8.                  Acting as a window on the world<br/> These major roles cannot be achieved except purchasing principles and practice are fully employed.<br/>Many industries failed because ethical and social responsibilities of the purchasing practice for buyers in industries were ignored. The theoretical discussion of ethical and social responsibilities naturally prescribes the behaviour that is appropriate or expected of purchasers. But the pertinent or crucial question is whether in reality purchasers are adhering ethically and socially responsible? Are purchasers attaching importance to the satisfaction of industries in acquisition of material and enhancing high level of productivity? How far in reality are buyers being ethically and socially oriented in their purchasing activities?<br/>Looking at Nigerian industries, therefore, we observed the prevalent tensency among some of the purchasing officers who embezzle money in their purchasing activities as against the interest of their company’s use. This selfish attitude causes a lot of problems for the industry if they are not honest in discharging their responsibilities.<br/>The purchasing principles are yet to be adopted or practiced by some Nigeria’s business enterprise. There are a lot of things being practices which negates the purchasing ethics. Ethical and social responsibilities of the purchasing practice in industries are desperately needed in Nigeria and should be adhered to or practiced by purchasing officers, especially in this era of grave economic and social ills prevalent in many transactions in Nigeria business. There are a lot of vices being committed by purchasing officers who do not have purchasing orientation. For instance, we have the following unethical practices in Industries.<br/>1.                  OVER INVOICING: This unethical practice is similar to commercial bribery. In this case a purchasing officer asks the supplier to inflate the invoice value of the order place for his company use.<br/>2.                  BRIBES, GIFTS OR KICK BACKS: In some organization purchasing officers demand bribes, gifts or kick-backs from suppliers and sales managers.<br/>3.                  POOR QUALITY OF MATERIALS: In some organization purchasing officers embezzle money in their purchasing activities as against the interest of their company by buying poor quality materials for the company’s use.<br/>All the foregoing practices constitute unethical behaviour. Unethical behaviour can be described as anything on the part of the purchasing officerswho betrays the confidence their employers and consumers repose on them. This unethical acts have anti-social affects on the products by Nigerian industries.<br/>Unethical acts run counter to objectives of purchasing officers to abide by the codes of conduct of the organization or professional body.<br/>The researcher therefore, focuses his study on how ethical and social responsibilities of the purchasing practice for buyers in industries can improve the level of productivity and the general standard of the industries performance and to erase the notion that purchasers are failures and further project the ethical and social conduct expected of a professional buyer in industries.<br/> 1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Golden Guinea Breweries Plc, have their major roles which cannot be achieved except purchasing principles and practice are fully employed. In many organization the need for ethnical and social responsibilities of the purchasing practice for buyers in Industries can easily be identified. This is because the Industry, we observed the prevalent tendency among some of the purchasing officers who embezzle money in their purchasing activities as against the Interest of the company’s use. Besides, for further experience on the job, which will attract more advancement and responsibilities. Infact ethical and social responsibility is important that without it the industry will suffer from managerial obsolescence.<br/>Golden Guinea Breweries Plc being a production firm has purchasers, stores managers etc. It is a state government owned enterprise established to meet the industrial and social needs of the state to a large extent, it has been striving to achieve these goals, although there is still room for improvement to this and there fore, the background of the study is aimed at the finding out how effective the ethical and social responsibility could help in achieving this goal.<br/>1.2              THE RELEVANCE OF STUDY<br/>Purchasing provides services on which most economic activities depend. The extent and efficiency with which such services are provided vary among industries.<br/>The need to keep pace with rate of development in the modern world and enjoy the economic blessings engendered in industries have led the researcher to investigate how ethical and social responsibilities of purchasing can improve the level of productivity in industries.<br/>The research is also geared towards creating a sound ethical and social responsibilities of the purchasing function in Golden Guinea Brewery Industry. Also, this work is aimed to expose purchasers in carrying adequate purchasing practices free of unethical practices in Industry. The researcher went a step further to investigate and recommend corrective measures for adoption.<br/>1.3              THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The activities of purchasing practice in industry among the industries are the same throughout the country. They have problems and objectives, except in policies and management style which are at individual industries discretions, since this project explores how ethical and social responsibilities of purchasing practice improves the level of productivity in industries. However, there are a lot of industries in Nigeria. And as a result it will be extremely difficult and impossible for the researcher to study all of them considering the time given.<br/>The researcher, decided to use Golden Guinea Brewery Plc Industry to enable him carryout an in-depth study of the organization.<br/>1.4              THE OBJECTIVE OF STUDY <br/>The main objective of this researcher project is to investigate into how ethical and social responsibilities of the purchasing practice at Golden Guinea Brewery Plc can improve the level of productivity of the establishment.<br/>It is also a pre-requisite for the award ordinary National Diploma and this will go a long way to serve as a source of reference to students and lecturers alike in institutions of higher learning.<br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE ETHNICAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

project work for “Supply market” of Ukpon Esan otherwise known as “IGBU Cloth”.  This work is being carried out at a place known and called Ogwa in Esan West local Government Area in Edo state.<br/>However, Esan West Local Government Area is within the middle belt Zones of Nigeria, blessed with natural endowments among which are fertile land for agriculture practice, good rivers for fishing and so forth and so on.  Politically, Esan west Local Government Area has about ten (10) words which Ogwa happens to be one.  Originally Upkon Esan is not its name because it is not only in Esan that this Cloth is been weaved but for the fact that Esan dominates in the making of this Cloth called “IGBU” and prominence too, this Cloth has today assumed the name of the town Ukpon Esan.  But locally, the Cloth is properly called IGBU (Ukpon Esan).<br/>Other villages, towns in Edo State have known their own in this Cloth making infact, virtually all Ekpoma towns and villages.  Furthermore outside, this Cloth is done in other States like ijebu Ogun State, Kogi Ilorin and Okene in kwara State, Asaba in Delta State, sokoto, Kano, Ikot Ekpene in Akwa Ibom and other Countries, but Esan method is unique.           <br/>This  research work  will x-ray how this cloth is being weaved in Esan and supplied to market such as Uromi market, Ebelle market, Ugun market, Igueben market and Ogwa market all in Esan Local Government Area and to other parts of the country, Even beyound.  This is as a result of the benefit derived from the Cloth marking (weaved), while some are enumerated below.<br/>(a)       It serve as a source of revenue generation to the town and local council.<br/>(b)      it serve as a source of income to the created employment.<br/>(c)       It creates employment.<br/>(d)      Above all, it increases our local source of generating income and also contributing in the gross domestic product (GD P).  Some essential information is extended to the wavers as an education which leads to <br/>(1)       Better knowledge of varieties and supply requirement.<br/>(2)       Better knowledge of coming together as Co-operative unions.<br/>(3)       Better knowledge of sourcing for raw materials.<br/>1.1       HISTORICAL BACKGROUND<br/>Ogwa is in Esan West Local Government Area in Edo State of Nigeria.  It is located about hundred (100) kilometers to the South West.<br/>Upkon Esan is commonly known amongst Nigerians, mostly in the Western part of  the Country as “IGBU Cloth”, Upkon Esan is an old as the town itself.  The Origin of Upkon Esan Cloth is surrounded in mystery.  In short, it is not quite clear how it all stated.  This domestic Industry came into existence and flourished during the expansion of palm Oil and kernel trade in the Niger Delta.<br/>The history of Upkon Esan Cloth is not complete without mentioning some outstanding personalities and development of this industry.<br/>(1)       Mrsigni- whose distinctive design gave many IGU Cloth their particular character.  She worked in secret to prevent others from copying her ideas, when she left her loom, she placed spells on it, to deter the inquisitives.  She introduced weaving with Cotton and designing with silk.<br/>(2)       Imade was another woman who deserved to be mentioned story had it that she saw designs in dreams so that when she woke up, she incorporated those designs in her weaving.<br/>(3)       Omozie Akenbor who specialized in IGBU pattern should not be left out.<br/>(4)       Osamudiamhine Epke was also an expert in the design known as Oyegbe.  As far back as 1960, Chief O.J. Omozapka exhibited IGBU Cloth in U.S.A.   After a very successful IGBU Cloth exhibition by late Chief Oboh.  This two exhibition gave real boast to the industry Ukpon Esan cloth is woven entirely with machine span yarn from the Northern part of Nigeria, mainly Kano.  The colourful designs are made with imported rayon and silk thread.<br/>ESAN WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE<br/>Esan West local Government is the closest among other tier of government to the people and it carries out the minimal function like<br/>(a)       primary Education<br/>(b)      Primary health Care<br/>(c)       Maintenance of rural roads within the communities.<br/>Nigeria as a colonized Country, had independence from the great Britain in the year 1960 adopted the British system of democratic government, which reflected the local government structure.  The local government setting has a sizable share of employment of men and materials in the National Gross Domestic Product (G N P).<br/>Similarly, Esan West local government which is in the state called Edo was created in 1991 with its headquarters located at Esan.  The local government comprises of some notable towns and Villages like:<br/>1.      Ogwa<br/>2.      Ebelle<br/>3.      Ujoba<br/>4.      Ugui<br/>5.      Igueben<br/>6.      Uromi<br/>7.      Epkoma<br/>8.      Irruwa<br/>ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE ESAN WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA:<br/>At the top of the local government is the Executive Chairman, followed by Vice chairman.  The political executive group called the “Supervisors”, the law making unit- “Councilors” and the career Civil Servants.<br/>There are more than five departments in the local government, these are<br/>Personnel<br/>Health<br/>Works<br/>Agriculture<br/>Finance<br/>Each of these departments is supervised by a head of the department on appointment / rant from the Local Government Service Commission.  The executive chairman is in – charge of matters that may affect both the council and the community at large.  The Secretary becomes the liaison officer between the chairman and the general Councilors drawn from various words that make up the jurisdiction of the local government area.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>History is replete with facts and figures that little attention has been paid for promoting weaving (IGBU Cloth) industry in the Country at large and esan West Local Government precisely by the government.  Nigeria need to diversify her economy especially now that the country is facing series of problem as a result of over dependent in oil<br/>On weaving industry, there is poor infrastural facilities that hinder IGBU Cloth in Esan West Local Government. Example<br/>(a)       There are no particular market for IGBU Cloth.<br/>(b)      Lack of basic education to our local illustrate weavers on how to modernise the weaving and tools.<br/>(c)       Lack of government subsides and incentive to our local weavers and establishment of a modern/ working Corporative Society.<br/>(d)      The idea of prohibiting men to weave<br/>(e)       There is this believe that outsiders are not taught how to weave.  Even if they do, the skill will not be retained after sometimes because of the myth<br/>In the light of these disturbing constraints, this research work titled “Supply market” in Esan West local government ( A case study of IGBU Cloth weaving and supply in Epkoma market, Uromi market and Ebelle market tries to proffer ways of.<br/>(1)        Strengthening the standard and the level of market in Ogwa and Ebelle market in Esan west local government.<br/>(2)        Strengthening the method of procuring raw materials<br/>(3)        Good negotiation and purchasing techniques as to the production and supply of IGBU Cloth in Ogwa market.<br/>(4)        Finally to reduce supply bottle necks.<br/>1.3       NEED FOR THE STUDY<br/>The need for the study cannot be over emphasized.  The researcher’s aim is also to enrich herself and the people of this local government on the need to practice or learn Cloth weaving (Upkon Esan cloth) especially now that Nigeria must diversify her economy as a means of alleviating poverty and better standard of living for the people.<br/>1.4       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY.<br/>The purpose of this study is to examine how the total well being of the people can be improved through Ukpon Esan cloth weaving busy.<br/>From all that have been written above, it is the aim of this study to see and advance how Ukpon Esan cloth is been produced and supply in the market within and outside this local government.<br/><br/>\n\nSUPPLY MARKET\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF UPKOM ESAN (IGBU CLOTH) IN ESAN WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE.\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SUPPLY MARKET\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF UPKOM ESAN (IGBU CLOTH) IN ESAN WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE.\r\n", "id": 80}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF LEASE AS A MEANS OF PROCUREMENT IN MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED COMPANY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The essence of this research work is to investigate carefully the effects of  lease as a means of procurement in manufacturing organizations. Some selected companies were used as a case study like the studio press Nigeria plc at Lagos and Aluminum extrusion industry plc. While carrying out this research work the researcher reviewed the extent to which some firms have availed themselves to leasing and the effect of lease in tackling the logistic and financial problems of these firms. It was also carried out to examine the problems associated with leasing. To really investigate on this work, an elaborate literature review was carried out and some forms of questionnaire were issued out. The researcher choose a sample of forty eight (48) respondents within two areas of concentration using the stratified random sampling method. Based on the respondents answers to the questionnaires a study was guided by some given hypothesis which were later tested using a distribution called chi-square (X2) method. Some findings were derived from the tested hypothesis, one of them is that leasing is more profitable than outright purchase. Based on these findings recommendations were made and conclusion drawn.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction                                                      <br/>1.1    Background of the study                               <br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem                             <br/>1.3    Objectives of the study                                <br/>1.4    Significance of the study                                       <br/>1.5    Formulation of Hypothesis                             <br/>1.6    Scope and Limitation                                    <br/>1.7    Company Profile Studio Press                                <br/>1.8    Definition of Terms                                              <br/>References <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Literature Review                                                <br/>2.1    Evaluation and Historical Background of <br/>Leasing in Nigeria                                                <br/>2.2    Constraints to the development of leasing       <br/>2.3    Nature of Leasing                                                <br/>2.4    Types of Leases                                          <br/>2.5    Advantages and Disadvantages of Leasing       <br/>References <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    Research Methodology and Design                 <br/>3.1    Sources of Data                                          <br/>3.2    Questionnaire Design                                   <br/>3.3    Population of the Study                                        <br/>3.4    Sample size of the population                                <br/>3.5    Method of Analysis                                               <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Presentation, analysis of data and test of hypothesis<br/>4.1    Data Presentation                                                <br/>4.2    Test of Hypothesis                                               <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0    Summary of findings, recommendations and conclusion<br/>5.1    Summary of Findings                                   <br/>5.2    Recommendations                                               <br/>5.3    Conclusions                                                <br/>Bibliography<br/>Appendix<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>        Purchasing as a management function deals with the procurement of raw materials, components parts, equipment (heavy and light) and services required by an organisation to be used for production purposes. Organizations material procurement modus operandi can take various forms like hire purchase, out right purchase and leasing etc. this depends largely on the companies financial status. In the past many organizations that are financially distressed adopt lease as a means of procuring capital equipments.<br/>        Leasing started is far back hundred years before Christ (Stanley L.M.C Michael and Paul T.O Kege; 1959 p1); for centuries the lease was used almost exclusively in connection with agricultural land. According to Busko (1959:24) many of the commercial buildings constructed during the period of early Urban development  were build on land that was made available under long term lease. However with the emergence of the industrial revolution and the urbanization movement which followed it, lease has broadened beyond its initial bound.<br/>        Today leasing has dominated all facets of Nigerian economy as an alternative to purchasing of capital goods.<br/>        Indeed today, it is difficult to find a capital goods which is not made available through leasing. This growth has been accompanied by a fundamental change in the nature of the lease transaction. It is no longer soley means of acquiring properties which are not available by other legal means but has now become an important means of financing. Most importantly, lease is a contract between a lessor and a leasee for the hire of a specific asset (Ami 1922:13). It is a legal agreement or transaction by which the owner of land building or a piece  of equipment agrees to let another person have the use of it for a certain period of time for a fixed amount of money leasing in effect is the performance of a lease transaction. The separation of ownership from the users is central to the whole concept of leasing. Under this agreement, the user (lesee) pays to the owner (lessor) an agreed sum of money at stipulated period during the life of the lease. The installmental nature of this payment, therefore makes it possible for lessee to operate a better cash flow system which ensure that at no time is much capital tied down to a particular equipment.<br/>As a result of the introduction of the second tier foreign exchange market (SFEM) and the substantial devaluation of the Naira in 1996 prices escalated. Creditors because more reluctant to lend for fear of liquidity and when they were willing to lend high interest rate was charged in addition to straight collateral requested as security. Under this circumstances, most companies had problems findings their purchases as well as carrying out certain project.  Consequently, they relief on leasing as the alternative sources of findings project with huge capital out lay. Before this time, most companies preferred to what until they could save towards purchasing them.  However, as of today, business enterprise are now more interest the use of or access to a capital asset to a capital asset or facility rather its ownership as was the case in the pre-sap era (Egbuna, 1995 p.33).<br/>In fact the manufacturing companies have embraced lease financing as a viable option to other types of financing. This is manifested in the volume of lease transaction by manufacturing companies. The sector has the highest volume of lease transaction amounting to N1.443236b of the total N4.170411b?<br/>LEASE STATISTICS (1992 – 1996)<br/>Value of assets to sectors (000)    2007<br/>N    2008<br/>N    2009<br/>N    2010<br/>N    2011<br/>N<br/>Manufacturing     1,443,236    1,606-8,295    343,250    478,534    758,312<br/>Transport    447,745    502,765    175,768    181,800    239,612<br/>Agriculture    325,633    365,647    126,433    272,537    394,727<br/>Oil and gas    1,221,124    1,471,177    301,529    312,662    426,650<br/>Government    203,520    223,529    98,445    95,720    139,720<br/>Others    529,153    594,176    301,560    362,856    374,856<br/>Total    4,170,411    4,765,589    1,356,075    1,704,109    2,324,877<br/>   Source: Field survey, 2012<br/>        The upward trend in lease financing is thus assured as w begin a gradual movement towards a credit economy and acceptance of lease financing by the business community. And coupled with the deregulation in the economy, the number, volume and value of lease is bound to increase further in the future as capital asset financing has now been accepted as a viable and useful form of financing the acquisition of capital of capital assets and expansion. Leasing thus has and will improve the production capabilities of the country as investors and/or entrepreneurs engaged in activities at a scale above that which available funds permit.<br/>        However, in its original concept, lease contracts allowed the lessee to use the asset without transferring ownership from the lessor over the years, the concept of leasing has been broadened in such a way that the lessor  may acquire ownership of the assets at the end of the lease on very favourable or nominal terms in order words, these leases have sometimes become a form of deferred purchase. In these cases, although the contract is legally a leas, it is in substance equivalent to a purchase which the purchase price being paid in installments <br/> 1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          It is fundamental concept in business that finance is the life wire of every business.<br/>        Ever before our political independence and until the beginning of 1970’s, never has there been witnessed any level of business activity. In our economy to warrant leasing at any appreciable scale as it is today. During the early 70’s, the period now referred to as the “petro dollar” era, our local currency was valued. The level of business activity then was relatively low and the naira high in value that quite a number of firms purchase rather than lease most of their operating equipments. Following the drop in the price of crude oil and subsequent decline in the value of our currency, Nigeria realized the need to properly harness her industrial economy through perfectly mobilizing resources in the area of manufacturing, distribution and above all in project financing. But insufficient capital with which to purchase equipments has posed a serious problem to this view. Leasing therefore, becomes the only way out.<br/>        In the more developed countries of the world, leases account for a very significant proportion of capital investment (United Nations 1984). The extent to which this is obtainable in Nigerian industries is yet to be determined. Therefore, it is pertinent at this time to ascertain the degree to which we have availed of this facility and the overall effect it exerts in addressing the very problems of logistics experience in supplying.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY           <br/>        The purpose of this research work is to undertake a survey of some firms in parts of Nigeria and to achieve the following:<br/>(i)                  Study the extent to which these firms have availed of leasing.<br/>(ii)                 Examine the effect this has so far in solving the logistic and financial problems in these firms.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The study will serve as a data of information that would assist firms that embark on lease to appreciate the company’s position financial and otherwise.<br/>(i)                  It will also provide basis for firms in structuring their lease.<br/>(ii)                 The government, equipment leasing association of Nigeria (ELAN) and other interest groups in supplying their businesses to the business sector.<br/>(iii)                In addition, the study when completed will serve as a valuable contribution to the body of knowledge and at the same time serve as a source of useful reference for further research work.<br/>1.5    FORMULATION OF HYPOTHESIS<br/>        The notion that lease is unavoidable in business cannot be over emphasized, thus to ascertain the validity of the above statement, the following statements will be tested to prove the various impact of lease in business.<br/>H0:    Leasing does not have positive impact on firms.      <br/>HI:    Leasing does have positive impact on firms.<br/>H0:    Firm does not engage more in leasing rather than outright purchase.<br/>HI:    Firm engage more in leasing rather than outright purchase.<br/>1.7    COMPANY PROFILES STUDIO PRESS (NIGERIA) PLC.      <br/>        The company was incorporated on 9th July 1965 as a private company to produce exercise books. On incorporation the capital was N80,000 divided into 31,000 ordinary share of N2 each and 9,000, 6% preference share of N2 each. The ordinary share were owned equally by a Nigerian and German who founded the company. The preference shares were then held by Deutsche Gelleschanft for wirtchaftiche-zusammenarbelt (Eritiocklungsgesellschaft) a development bank wholly owned  by the Federal Republic of Germany.<br/>        The factory was established on a site of approximately 0.41 hectres at 30. Henry car street, Ikeja, where production of exercise books began. In 1966, the main market for the books developed in the then Eastern Region of Nigeria but with the outbreak of the civil war, that market was adversely affected. As the financial situation of the company deteriorated, it was decided by the two founders to sell their interest in the company to the following:<br/>(1)        CFAO (Nigeria) Limited.<br/>(2)        Ernst Kleft Druchken (Klett) a large and reputable printing publishing house in West Germany.<br/>(3)        Interpart Gesellchaft fur International Beteiligungun Mbtt and CO KG (Interpart), a printing consultancy company also in West Germany.<br/>(4)        DEG (a development bank wholly owned by the Federal Republic of Germany.<br/>In 1970, it was decided that diversification was necessary and manufacture of light cartons and packaging materials was introduced. This area at the activities grew steadily and in 1975 it was decided that the production facilities for exercise books be dropped and to concentrate on packaging.<br/>        In 1976, a two phase development programme was embarked upon at a cost of approximately N2.4 million. The second phase of this programme was completed in 1979 and running in of new machine commenced in March 1979. Recognizing the significant growth of consumers packaging in Nigeria and the need to enhance working capital of the company and further replace and modernize plant and machinery, the company in 1979 decided to comply with the Nigerian enterprise promotion degree of 1977. The company offered to the public for subscription 2,694,000 ordinary shares of 50k each. This was fully subscribed. Thus the company assumed the status of public limited liability company with a share capital of N2,245,000 representing 4,490,000 ordinary share of 50k each.<br/>        The company in September, 1989 offered to the public for subscription of further 5,510,000 ordinary shares 7.50k each. The proceeds from the second offer was used in the planned expansion of acquiring gravure machine and a new site at plot B Israel Adebajo close Ikeja. The company therefore moved to the new premises in 1982. Business grew rapidly over the years and in July, 1991, the company at a general meeting. Increased the authorized share capital from N60,000,000 to N42,000,000.<br/>        In 1995, the company again increased the authorized share capital to N60,000,000 and went forward immediately for a rights issues to the existing shareholders. A four colour ultra man 6 machine was also purchased in 1995 to further increase capacity and ensure improved quality and delivery time to our value customers. The company in the same year acquired an ink factory (chemical technology) which now provides all the ink requirements of studio press (Nigerian) plc. There is a plan now to modernize the ink factory and improve the facilities in order to meet the requirements of the external market.<br/>        The corporate policy guidelines of the company are laid down by the company’s board consisting of a chairman, managing director and three other members.<br/>Aluminum Extrusion Industries Plc<br/>        Aluminum extrusion industries plc was incorporated on 26th October, 1982 and carries on the business of manufacture and sale of all types of extruded aluminum products. The company is located at km 4, Atta –Amaimo Road, Inyeshi and is registered as a public limited liability company under the provisions of the companies and allied matters decree 1990.<br/>        Nigeria citizens and associations hold 30% of the share capital while the balance is hled between the Imo state Government, Abia state government and Tower Aluminum (Nigeria) plc. The company has a technical and management services agreement with comcraft management services S.A. A company which also provides Tower Aluminum (Nigeria) plc with similar management services.<br/>        However, the company’s corporate policy decisions are taken out of the board level while routine operational decisions are taken at the divisional/department levels.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>A lease: A lease is a contractual agreement between an owner (the lessor) which conveys to the leassee the right to use the leased asset for an agreed period of time in return for a consideration, usually payments called rents (SAS, 11).<br/>Logistic Activities: Supplying logistics is the planning, <br/>organizing and controlling of all more store activities that facilitate product flow from the point of raw materials acquisition to the point of find consumption as well as the attention information flows. Activities involved in this regard includes transportation, inventory management, warehousing as well as material handling and acquisition. All these logistics activities entails the use of certain equipment for performing profitably by firms.<br/>Operating Lease: This is one in which the lessor, while <br/>giving the lessee the use of leased property, retains practically all the risks, obligations and reward of ownership (SAS, 11).<br/>  <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF LEASE AS A MEANS OF PROCUREMENT IN MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED COMPANY\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF LEASE AS A MEANS OF PROCUREMENT IN MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED COMPANY\r\n", "id": 81}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN APPRAISAL OF THE EXTENT OF PURCHASING DEPARTMENT’S INVOLVEMENT <br/>IN INTERNATIONAL BUYING IN AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTIONS.<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURE I.I.T.A, IBADAN)<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE      <br/>1.0              Introduction<br/>1.1       Background of the study<br/>1.2              Statement of problem<br/>1.3              Objective of the study<br/>1.4              Significance of study<br/>1.5              Research hypothesis<br/>1.6              Limitation of the study <br/>1.7              Definition of terms.<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0              Literature review<br/>2.1       Purchasing (What is Entails)   <br/>2.2              Types of purchasing<br/>2.3              Meaning of International Buying <br/>2.4              Reasons for growth international buying<br/>2.5              Purchasing through agencies<br/>2.6              Pre-knowledge of international buying<br/>2.7              Problems of international purchasing<br/>2.8              Pre-shipping Arrangement<br/>2.9              Understand industrial buying<br/>2.10          Industrial buying process<br/>2.11          Who is involved in the buying process<br/>2.12          The purchasing professional  understanding buyers motivation <br/>2.13          Negotiation.<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0              Methodology<br/>3.1       Area of study<br/>3.2              Sample frame<br/>3.3              Sample size and procedure<br/>3.4              Instrument for data collection<br/>3.5              Method for data collection <br/>3.6              Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0              Analysis and Interpretation of data<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0              Summary of Findings, Recommendation and Conclusion.<br/>5.1       Recommendation<br/>5.2              Conclusion<br/>5.3              Bibliography<br/>5.4              Research Questionnaire<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0              INTRODUCTION<br/>Often a purchaser tries to survey and search for the most satisfactory<br/>source of procurement.   Many are due to discovery that no competent and effective supplier could be found.   However, due to this circumstance, a purchaser may resort to buying internationally after realizing that local could not meet organizational requirement, may be owing to the fact that local that the source is substandard or insufficient to size –up with production demand for such materials needed.<br/>            However, most countries depend, to some extent, on importing raw materials from overseas, buying from abroad is more difficult than buying locally from  indigenous market because of difference in culture, language, currency e.t.c.<br/>Despite all these problems purchase of raw-materials, capitals goods, etc, still depend on sourcing internationally to meet domestic needs.  No single nations can claim to be self-sufficient and as such, the concept of comparative advantage makes it possible for nations without required or not enough raw materials and /or finished goods, to import such from other nations.<br/>Therefore, International purchasing is the sourcing and purchasing of goods and services form a neighboring kind across the boundaries of the buyer’s country.   Subsequently, the following reasons prompt the urge to buy from abroad.<br/>1.       Local Capacity may be inefficient to meet demand importation becomes the only source to make up such lapses.  For instance, the consumption of  rice in the Nigeria market is something to study despite the large quantities produced by domestic individuals the market consumers still scramble for foreign rice.<br/>2.       Specification may not be available domestically. No one country commands monopoly on new technology.  A company may be in need of items with special specifications that can only be found in a foreign market.<br/>3.       Cost benefits;  Generally, off share sources have been able to offer Nigeria buyers lower prices on manufactured goods because of law labour, material and overhead cost, the costs may be cheaper because of better improved productivity, better plant or other facilities.<br/>4.       Quality;  This factor constitutes one of the reasons for sourcing oversea.  Quality in this sense should be regarded as the  inherent priority of the materials as distinct from those available domestically.<br/>5.       Maintenance of alternative supplier may improve supply security by having a second source in a different country.  This helps to maintain continuity in supply of materials for production to be hitch-free. In the light f the above, the purchasing department serves as a means of contributing to the attainment of the  general objective of any profit oriented organization as well as success oriented ones.   Materials command  about 60% of company’s expenditure and so stands a circle chance of determing the success or failure of the whole organization. The purchasing department process all the materials needed to be used in production process at all time.  Therefore, it is the purchasing department that goes into the international market to buy when these materials are lacking or inadequate in the domestic market<br/>1.1       BACK GROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The international Institute of Tropical Agriculture (I.I.T.A) was found in 1967.    The Federal government of Nigeria provided land grant of 1,00 hectres Institute.  The provided land area carries on it, the institute’s offices, workers residential building and experimental form.<br/>The institute is governed by an international board of trustees.  The staff include nearly 200 scientists and professional staff from about countries all over the world, who work at the Ibadan Campus.   The international institute of Tropical Agriculture is one of the thirteen non-profit making international research centres in the world and it’s supported by the consultative group on international agricultural research (CGIAR) to run it’s programme body was set up in 1971.  The purpose research effort is to improve the quality of and annual production in developing countries.<br/>Also the goal of the (I.I.T.A) is to increase productivity of key crops and to develop substantial agricultural system that can replace bush fallow or slash and burn cultivation in the humid and sub-humid topics.<br/>In the international purchasing, there are difficulties in dealing with sources oversees which is not encountered in the domestic setting.  Additionally these prevailing circumstance have prompted this research work to shade more light on the extent of purchasing department involvement international buying.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>The main objective of this study would be to identify and establish the impact that the purchasing department contribute in the display of witness in the procurement of nationals internationally in the operation of the international of institute of Tropical Agriculture.   In the history of industrial function in the achievement attained as a result of constant improved product design.<br/>            The inability of the purchasing department to adequately perform its function could be attributed to the following lapses.<br/>1.         Wrong purchasing policies<br/>2.         Lack of skilled and professional purchasers<br/>3.         Lack of skilled necessary incentive to inspire the purchasing functions to high level efficiency.<br/>4.         Lack of effective Co-ordination of efforts of different department in the organization.<br/>Having considered these problems and probably their various  effects, the researcher would wish to analyse and their after effects and give recommendation for improvement.<br/>1.3              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY.<br/>The following are the objectives of this research work analyzed and discussed step by step.<br/>1.           To unveil the plague that is covering the functions needed to be performed by the purchasing department, so that the material required by the entire organisation can be made handy-ready.<br/>2.           To enable the researcher offer positive can problems encountered in PM-pointing at the impact of purchasing department involvement in international procurement.<br/>3.           To design a workable solution to the problems of buying and storage of goods that will conform to standard and specification as given various department under an establishment.<br/>4.           To provide suggestions to the management of I.I.T.A towards solving of problems of filling the position of purchasing department with qualifies incompetent and constrained personnel.<br/>Apart from the proceeding objectives, the primary national extends to meeting the pre-requisite for the partial fulfillment of the award of the Higher National Diploma (HND) in institute of Management and Technology I.M.T Enugu.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Particularly the purchasing department involvement in international buying will be extensively discussed and the definition of the word ‘purchasing internationally will be viewed along side with the different types of purchasing activities that are usually obtainable in I.I T.A for instance, there s local purchase f material domestically.<br/>The role of purchasing department to meet organization aim is very essential and this will be focussed on this work of research.  Another area to be covered in this  project will also include the relationship that exist in the organization between purchasing department and others<br/>Therefore, the purchasing functions include the placing of orders, progressing, inspection, and inventory and stock control.   It will also embody all details that are needed to be know before is supporting the idea  that the purchasing function is having a great impact and role to play in achieving the aims and objectives of the organization.<br/>The research will be limited only the case study chosen which is the international Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) .<br/>1.5              RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>This is an intelligent quests postulated for the purpose of assisting the researcher in directing his thoughts towards preferring solutions to purchasing problms.   As stated earlier in the proposal, the tentative quests will be split into two;  <br/>a.       The null hypothesis which represent the negative aspect and <br/>b.      The alternative hypothesis which represent the positive view.<br/>Ho:  Purchasing department involvement in international buying does not  <br/>         contribute to high productivity and successful operations in the<br/>         international institute of Tropical Agricultural.<br/>Hi;  Purchasing department involve in international buying contributions in<br/>        the high productivity and successful operations in the international <br/>        institute of tropical Agriculture.<br/>1.6              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.        Advice Note: document sent by supplier to a consignee in advance of delivery.   Some times it moves with the consignment.<br/>2.        Bill of Lading; This document is similar to deliver note used in shipping. A copy of it is rationed by the senders, a copy held by the master of the one also for the consignee.  It is a memorandum contact of contract of carriage.<br/>3.        Bill of Material;  This is a list if material including component parts , specifying their quantity and characteristics requires to produce a particular product.  The bill of lading or parts list is commonly used in fabrication orientated organizations.  When the engineering department list of all materials require for the job is compiled, sent to the purchasing department for necessary action.<br/>4.        Average Stock: this is the arithmetic average of a set of materials.  For instance, the average monthly inventory can calculated by adding the month-end inventories for a year and dividing such by twelve.<br/>5.        Consignment Note:  A note accompanying consignment of goods indicating quantify, descriptions and other physical feature of the cargoes.<br/>6.        Carrier:  This is a company offering the services of transportation of good from one place (the origin) to another (the destination).<br/>7.        Consignor: The organization sending the consignment.<br/>8.        Cost insurance and freight:  this is a type of  contract whereby the cost, insurance and freight rates are quoted together by senders.  Thus, the seller or the exporter is responsible for cost shipment, insurance and freight rates. <br/>9.        C x F (cost and freight):  This is similar to CIF except that buyer will pay the insurance charges.<br/>10.    Demurrage:  This is the sur-charge paid shipping company by the inner beyond the agreed charge. It is imposed against <br/>11.    Duty: payment made to the government either for import or export.<br/>12.    Freight:  is a traffic term used to denote the shipping changes for cargo transportation, it can also refer to the consignment as well as transportation function.<br/>13.    Free on Board :  This is a contract in which goods are delivered to the ship (on board) at the expense of importers or exporter.<br/>14.    Proof of Delivery:  This document is like a delivery note, signed by the consignee that safe delivery has been performed. <br/>15.    Port of entry;  This is the country’s port i.e the port through which consignment would enter the country of the destination.<br/>16.    Sourcing;  This is that part of procurement function concerned with investigation, identification and development of sources of supply for organization requirement.<br/>17.    Allocation:  sometimes, portions of materials available in the store are reserved or earmarked for specific requirements.  It is then said to be allocated to those requirements<br/>18.    M R P (Material requirement Plant)in this system, the BOM (Bill of Materials) is listed in the product structure format and shows how the product is fabricated and assembled i.e it would indicated what raw materials are used to make the components, how the components would come into the production of sub-assemblies and finally how the sub assemblies would form in sequence into an assembly.  This usually done by showing the BOM in a Multi-level format.<br/>19.    Bonded warehouse: A ware-house were goods on which exercise<br/>      duties have not been paid , are stored,<br/>20.     Bought-out items: These are materials not manufactured by the organization, but purchased and used with or without further processing in assembling the finished products.<br/>21.    Buffer stock:   A certain quantity of materials are kept in the store to cover variation in demand delay in supplier.  It is the average stock on when the replenishment supplies arrives. This is also called the “safety stock” reserve stock, insurance stock minimum stock.  Buffer stock and active stock are the two components in an inventory.<br/>22.    Covert Emptor: This is a creak phrase that implies let buyer  beware.   The buying is purchasing at own risk.<br/>23.    Codification;  A form of identifying a materials by the use of numerals, letters symbols or a combination therefore for the purpose of establishing, in a systematic manner, the unique and complete identify of an individual item and also of bringing out it’s similarity with others materials.<br/>24.    Component inventory:  This term included any inventory item used to make another item.  For instance, a raw material, a part or a sub- assembly is used as a component to make another product and there by becomes a component inventory.<br/>25.    Consignment stock:  Im normal cases, goods are paid for on delivery or after a define credit period.  In this case, the goods supplied by the seller are kept in the buyer’s establishment and paid for only after they are sold or after they are used.<br/>26.    Container:  This is a dervice in which goods carried e.g a railway container, a barrel, bottle carbon, etc are types of container.<br/>27.    Dependent demand:  a material becomes dependent when it’s needed for the manufacture of a higher level demand. A component is a dependent  item for making a sub-assembling and it’s demand becomes dependent, as a separate part in after sales services. In inventory classification, therefore, dependent demand should be separated from an independent demand (sales as a service part)<br/>28.    Dispatching:  This refers to the selection and assignment of jobs by an individual work centre on the shop floor.  A despatch list is a schedule for a particular centre.  This can be generated easily by the use of a computer and issued daily showing the priority sequence of jobs to be done at the work centre.<br/>29.    Distribution resources Planning (DRP) MRP was originally developed as a way to order materials to start shop floor assembly operations.  However, distribution centres (in warehouses locations caring) finished goods inventory.   DRP takes care of this requirement in the sense that it is a means of determing how much inventory of different items are required by the distribution centres when adding these figures to the production requirement to make up total requirements.<br/>30.    Continuous Inventory Control:  This is the checking of inventories (materials usage) in the stores on a continuos basis throughout the year instead of once or twice a year.  A few selected items are checked each week.  It is also called perpetual stock taking the alternative procedure is annual stock-taking.<br/>31.    Discount:  An allowance granted by vendors to buyers these are various types of discount, which include cash discount, trade discount quantity discount cumulative purchase discount. e.t.c.<br/> <br/>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE EXTENT OF PURCHASING DEPARTMENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL BUYING IN AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTIONS.\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURE I.I.T.A, IBADAN)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF THE EXTENT OF PURCHASING DEPARTMENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL BUYING IN AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTIONS.\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURE I.I.T.A, IBADAN)\r\n", "id": 82}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>INVENTORY POLICY AS A TOOL IN THE ATTAINMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF NIGERIA BREWERIES PLC, ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Inventories policies in manufacturing companies has been a great assistance towards the attainment of organizational goal which aim not only helping the sustenance of manufacturing industries or setting it on a going concern and thereby fostering long term profitability through one of the problems that indeed usually confront manufacturing companies is how to maintain and value their inventories and by so doing achieve opinion inventory.

Inventory constitutes one of the largest controllable assets of a business. Survey carried out by accountant international study group in 1968 shows that inventories generally constitutes after assets, the largest balance sheet item in the financial report of manufacturing and merchandizing firm expressed as a percent of net total assets. Managing assets of all kinds is basically an inventory problems. The inefficiency of an inventory may result in an unbalanced inventory. The firm may frequently be out of stock of certain type of inventory and overstock of other type as follows: Raw materials, work in progress and finished goods.<br/>        It is pertinent at this juncture to point out that inventory policy cannot be established by a single executive. A sound inventory policy can be obtained by concerted efforts of the films executive committee. This is because production, marketing, financial and purchasing department all have a stake in inventory policy is to be adopted by any organization is as complex as it is important. There is a optimum level of investment for any inventory be it cash, physical plant and other inventories. A mistake in inventory policy may result in either too large or too little of being kept. If production and delivery of goods were instantaneous there would be need for inventory policy except as hedge against changes.<br/>        Inventory must be maintained so that the customers may be saved immediately or at least quickly enough so that he does not turn to another source of supply. On the other hand, production operations cannot flow smoothly, without having inventories of work in progress direct materials, finished parts and supplies.<br/>        For the purpose of this study, it is necessary to distinguish between inventory records and control and correct stores cards whose balances and physical counts are in agreement. There may be efficient requisition purchasing receiving and material handling. But despite all these thing and diligent employees the inventory control will be inadequate, clerical efficiency therefore is not in arrangement only major duty as inspection can attain inventory control. The major inventory problem is to maximize profitability by balancing inventory investment against what is required to sustain operation.<br/>        The problem of inventory investment policy to non-profit organization like hospitals armed forces e.tc. and profitability can take the form of minimizing cost in these organization inventory control and record will not be needed and or applied unless there is a sound inventory policy. The big question asked by a number of businessmen and executive faced with the dilemma and frustration of attempting to maintain stable production operation, provide customers with adequate service and keep investment in stocks and equipment at reasonable levels.<br/>        Why are we always out of stock? How often should we re-order or how should we adjust production when sales are uncertain? What capacity level should we set for operation? What do we plan as production and procurement for seasonal sales?  The idea of inventory involves the difficult of determining how big inventory should be. To some people, inventory should be just big enough but what is ‘BIG ENOUGH’. The problem is made more difficult because each individual within the management group tend to answer his questions from his or her own point of view. He or she fails to recognize cost outside his frame work and thinks of inventory in isolation from other operations.<br/>        It is unfortunate that business executive are more to view inventories with dislike as an opportunity unnecessary drain on resources, something that one has been able to eliminate, but hardly a “productive” asset like a new machine or tool. They fail to realize that inventories are so productive in earnings as other types of capital investment. They serve as lubrication and spicing for production distribution system keeping it from burning out  or breaking down under external shocks. All organization to survive in this complex system, it must operate efficiently and inventory policy and management will hold to achieved this by resulting in relatively high utilization “ratio” how to write absolute and deteriorated inventories and few instances of work stoppage or cost of sales due to stock out. All these contribute to high profit margin high total assets utilization, high rate of return on investment and a strong stock price.<br/>        The need for a proper inventory policy cannot be over emphasized. It could be seen with various benefits associated with sound inventory policy. Good inventory and management achieve the aim of making inventories act as cushions for absorbing planning errors and unforeseen fluctuations in supply and demand and facilitating smooth production and marketing operation.<br/>        Furthermore, inventory has help in isolating or minimizing the interdependence of all parts of the organization so that each may work effectively by manufacturing or purchasing many parts and such assembles to be stored and used s needed.<br/>        In the light of the above, it should be seen that a good policy helps in attainment a required amount of sales and this sales turnover help in achieving profit maximization which of course is the aim of most organization. inventory policy can be used by organization of all sizes. A proper inventory is the first in achieving organization goal but often policies taken by organization are dangerous that doubt arises of whether there is any policy by organization are dangerous that doubt arises of whether there is any policy at all.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          It has always been asserted that inventory policy involved control, planning and investment and maintenance of inventory for the successful production sales and adequate and prompt service to customers. There is further assertion that without a solid and proper inventory policy, a company cannot be able to achieve aims to which they are set up.<br/>        Despite this assertion, the researcher observed that many productive companies have no proper inventories policy and maintaining huge profit. The researcher further observed that these companies have no definite policy for maintaining adequate inventory policy to which the organization is set up.<br/>Sub Problems<br/>        With the introduction of structural adjustment programs SAP the cost o acquiring money is very high. This has made manufacturing part of the company investment which is being in inventory be it raw materials, spare parts, and finished goods. In recent times, it has been found out that there has been an increased profit through high sales with increasing cost of carrying cost management is watching purchasing decision more closely and one cannot afford to let materials or inventories remain idle in the store house.<br/>        The emphasis now was in the integrity function of materials management and taking account of the value of money. More so, inventory policy is to maximize profitability in balancing inventory investment against what is required to sustain smooth operation. The executive of most manufacturing companies view inventory management a times as unnecessary drain on resources which should not be given much more time. Their problem being that forget that the most neglected inventory are also the most expensive to keep in stock.<br/>        This negligence has led to some manufacturing companies to be closed down like African Breweries Ibadan and a lot more.<br/>        The arbitration imperfection and indiscretion of the management personnel charged with responsibility of inventory planning and control cannot be overlooked. The fund invested in inventories could be used in making investment in other areas that will yield quicker and greater returns and enable the company to enjoy the benefits of time value of money.<br/>1.3 OBJETIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>        The research work is to examine the unfulfilling attitude influencing size and structure of inventories to be held and the best planning and control methods to be used by the organization.<br/>        An organization that takes a good inventory policy has made a step towards achieving its aims and objectives and such could be seen a prudent organization. The types of inventory policy taken its accuracy and time taken to formulate this policy is a prove of good planning, responsiveness to responsibility, and so depends on efficient and effective organization. This study therefore tries to discuss<br/>a.   The difficulty of finding the proper cost to be assigned to the maintenance of inventory as well as other matters which influences the establishment of an adequate inventory policy.<br/>b.   The problem of re-ordering and production scheduling as it affects inventory policy.<br/>c.   The crash seasonal and similar problems as they relate to a rational programme of inventory and production planning with the major problem of forecasting and control included in the total approach to inventory policy in as it relates to the business.<br/>d.   This study is also aimed at ascertaining the method of formulating inventory policy in organizations, the levels of inventory stock held and the possible ways of eradicating disappointment from suppliers to customers.<br/>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        Lesser attention has been paid to the formulation of inventory policy while more attention has been paid to its management. Efficiency is the key word of all organization be it manufacturing, merchandizing and so on which are both small scale and large scale. A well established inventory policy enables the organization to enjoy multiple effects of its merit. The importance of this study is to provide guideline that will help both effective and efficient. This invariable creates an opportunity for a more co-ordinate work and profit maximization since the satisfaction of most management is that they succeeded in using minimum cost to maximize profit.<br/>        To the stores or production manager as he may be called who is responsible for the stores production department and who is responsible and accountable for the inventories. This study will provide the necessary equipment needed for planning, control and procurement of inventories according to “Hongreen” two limits must be imposed in controlling inventory levels because there are two danger points that management usually wants to avoid, the first danger that of inadequate inventories, disrupts production and may lose sale. The second danger excessive inventories introduced unnecessary carrying cost and obsolescence risk.<br/>        In the light of the above it is hoped that this study will help eradicate or minimize the incidence of the above with the current emphasis of small scale manufacturing industries, this study will be of immense help to the public and any person who have the intention of indulging in some small scale business. <br/>        Others who will benefit from this study are future researchers and fellow students who may pick up this work from the library. Since researcher could not have ordinary gone into this work, as it will be considered invaluable, this work exposed him to things that could have escaped his notice. Employees in training and development courses in stores management for this position of stores work helpful. It is also helped that managers also found this public organization as well as the government and individuals will find this work as an assistance in their daily transaction.<br/>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Policy: The term policy covers the objects of business and the principle upon which it is conducted.<br/>Inventory Control: Is the controlling of physical qualities of actual things found in the stores at any time. It is no procurement policy and procedure which supply livestock and pricing procedure which clear out dead stock.<br/>Work – In – Progress: this is the materials that are still in process of production.<br/>Raw Material: material available to be used in the production process.<br/>Finished Goods: complete product ready for sales, shipment and consumption.<br/>Profit Maximization: this is the maximization of total policy<br/>Wealth Maximization: this is the maximization of earnings per share which will maximize stockholder welfare.<br/>Planning: Planning is an intellectual demanding process. It requires that we unconsciously determine the action and base our decision on purpose, knowledge and consider estimate. <br/>Inventory: this is the total firms investment in work in progress, raw materials and finished goods.<br/>  <br/>\n\nINVENTORY POLICY AS A TOOL IN THE ATTAINMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NIGERIA BREWERIES PLC, ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVENTORY POLICY AS A TOOL IN THE ATTAINMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NIGERIA BREWERIES PLC, ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 83}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE REASON FOR EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING OF STORES PERSONNEL IN AN INDUSTRY<br/>A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE INDUSTRY, ENUGU<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            It has been observed, that the problem is not the number of stores personnel employed in the organization or the sophisticated nature of the store equipment available, but the management of both the human resources and the option utilization of these equipment for the efficient and effective satisfaction needs the corporation.<br/>            This study as conducted by the researcher trial and development of store personnel, the problems of prospects.<br/>            This innovation brings assessment of all the items held in stock as well as the stock.

The new employee’s to company may have potentials but often this must be developed and refined. The nature of the store function is changing which in turn requires a developing set skills on the part of purchasing personnel. Training and development of staff then very crucial for effective performance of work.<br/>            However, stores management goes further in scope, aid operation and equally the function of the overall purchasing stores operations. The main purpose of stores management is to provide a service to all other department in organization and to enhance efficiency in order to provide the required service to all other department in organization and to enhance efficiency in order to provide the required service as economically as possible.<br/>            Efficient training and development of store personnel contributes effective to the success of most organization hence, the need for trained staff cannot over emphasis thus the stores is an area for the company as inefficiency its management could compel a company or corporation to fold up.<br/>            It is therefore vital and important for the public and private sectors to know that there is need for the adequate training and development of the store personnel.<br/>            The researcher has taken time to finding out why both private and public sector of the economy need store department and to know what leads to neglect or inefficiency. In any case, this work will not be see as an ‘Encyclopedia of stores organization training and development that is to contain all, but an attempt has been made here to provide a brief insight to readers, managers, students, professional men and women in purchasing and supply what training and development of store personnel means. The training and development should be arranged in such a way as to create harmony. Understanding and sound internal relationship so as to achieve the expected goal of the company.<br/>            The researcher is also to examine the way in which the learner may best be able to acquire such skills and knowledge. This process by which the organization import these skills and knowledge which are required in a particular job is called “training”.<br/>            Training and development are closely related to personnel selection and other personnel function in the activities that complement each other in the interest of achieving an effective and satisfied work force.<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY      <br/>            To meet the challenges of satisfaction of human and industrial needs through the creation of goods and  services, the management intensifies recruitment exercise and training programs on-the-job training for new employee’s was encourages while so engineering staff were sent oversees on staff training.<br/>            The Emenite industry Enugu participated in seminars and workshop organized by Etex group companies in European and Eternit limited, Sapele Nigeria. The highlight of this emphasis on high level manpower development was the creation let a training department.<br/>            Then, come the historical background of Emenite Industry Enugu, it was formally owed by TONAS ALBASTOE of England in 1961, but due to marketing threats of its competitiveness, it was sold to Etex world in 1988 where its name was given as EMENITE LTD because it was situated in the Emene residence’s industrial layout of Enugu state, now in Enugu central local government area, it was through the effort of late Etienne vander rest of eternic France that this was successful. They engage in production of AC pipes, Emcei flat sheets, pressure pipes, standard corrugated sheets, garden furniture and Etex plastics.<br/>            The corporation has its commercial area office at Sapele, Lagos and Enugu. They have a straight line organigram structure of management where purchasing department takes the responsibility of all industrial buying and solely on centralized buying. But the purchasing department lies with other department in their decision making in other to achieve the correct specification of materials standard and quality assurance. All their material bills are in sequence with the prosecution planning scheduling based on their corporate budgeting.<br/>            In other to limit the study on area of stores management they has technical stores, raw material store and finished good stores. And every stores personnel is trained based on nature and scope of his reasonability in the store. This makes to bring the work to a pattern. There functions are as follow:<br/>-               Quality control activities<br/>-               Holding, controlling and issuing stocks<br/>-               Control of Store house, material handling functions<br/>-               Clerical administrative of stores operation<br/>-               Training stores personnel<br/>-               To ensure that all material/items receive and issued for production are properly accounted for.<br/>  1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            The problem of training and development of store personnel have been identified as enormous. A through look at the present staffing of stores department of Emenite industry Enugu, shows that a huge sum of money is being lost every year due to lack of experience stores personnel the company is yet to be convinced of the need for stores management function. Thus, they assign their responsibility to unqualified or unskilled personnel who cannot cope with the present complexity of modern business, thereby running down the organization. My investigation revealed some anomalies in view of that. In summary, they have the following problems.<br/>-               Lack of encouragement to take course and training such as ones organized by the Nigeria Institute of purchasing and supply management (NIPSM)<br/>-               Examine the ways of improving staff performance by encouraging staff development.<br/>-               Lack of finance to avail ability of materials for the training programmes.<br/>-               Examine the opportunities that exist for their advancement and promotion.<br/>-               Material are not kept in the care of professional qualified personnel.<br/>It is these problem that made the researcher to take up this study with a view to determine what can be done to correct or improve the situation and encourage the training and development of stores personnel.<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>            Over the years the stores department functions has advanced greatly as result of the scope and serious of the research that has been carried out on the application of these techniques in that field. Subsequently, professional on the principle techniques and practice of stores management emerged, being developed and reviewed in line with current developments in the society technology field to make for more efficient performance.<br/>            This research work therefore has the objective of highlighting the neglected but important benefits  of prudent store management, and the contribution it can make in the revamping of our ailing national economy specifically, the research has the following objectives:<br/>-               To determine also the degree of interference (if any) by the top management on the operation of the store.<br/>-               To determine through the analysis, the degree of its need in the organization if the store full short in standard of work provided to determine whether the education/ professional qualification of the stores staff is the actual cause.<br/>-               To determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the stores management function Emenite industry.<br/> 1.4                        RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>1.                  How will you access the role of stores personnel in the organization.<br/>2.                  What are the various steps involved in training of stores personnel in the organization<br/>3.                  Are there any relationship between stores function and other departments in the organization?<br/>1.5       HYPOTHESIS <br/>Ho:      Stores personnel has no significant roles in the organization.<br/>Hi:       Stores personnel ahs significant role in the organization.<br/>Ho:      There is no defined procedure in training of stores personnel in an organization.<br/>Hi:       There is defined procedure in training of stores personnel in an organization.<br/>Ho:      There is no obstacles habiting against the operation of stores management in the organization.<br/>Hi:       There is obstacles habiting against the operation of stores management in the organization.<br/>Ho:      There is no relation between stores function and other department in the organization.<br/>Hi:       There is relation between stores function and other department in the organization.<br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            Undoubtedly, it is the objective of every prudent manager to apply and control the organization fund profitably, and this starts with using qualified personnel that can meet and absorb all the needs of the organization advancement. It is therefore the belief of the researcher that the information gathered from this study will improve the need for efficient training and development of unskilled stores personnel, and his problems will be avoided on reduced drastically, thereby creating an avenue for efficiency.<br/>1.7       SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>            This work is an attempt to study the nature, the origin and subsequence growth of training and development of stores personnel in our organization set ups. With the aim of crystallizing the progress and achievement, the failure, the difficulties, the possibilities and limitation of the efficient training of stores function in both private and public sector activities thereby reducing totally inventory cost and improving services where the user departments. The above aim cannot be achieved where the training and development of store personnel is neglected and development of store personnel is neglected and only quack are used to occupy professional position. Simply because the man at the head wants achieve selfish end etc if right people employ and there is good training and development programme, it will help to avoid misrepresentation of the profession.<br/>1.9       DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>PURCHASING: It is the activities directed towards acquisition of materials goods and services required for production and human consumption in right quality at reduced cost and delivered at right time.<br/>NEED:   It is a physiological or psychological requirement for the well being of a person.<br/>TRAINING: Training is the adoption molding of a person to increase his fitness for a specific activity.

Negotiation in purchasing is the process, which provide a legitimate and ethical means for the buyer and the seller through give and take, or eliminate unjustified or unnecessary increment n cost.<br/>It should not be construed as a means of stripping the trend or a fair profit or an opportunity for extracting unreasonable concession. In reliability the most successful negotiations are those which produce result to satisfy both side and which to provide the framework long-term mutually beneficial relationship. In my own understanding Negotiation is nothing but an act and science for arriving at common understanding through bargaining on the essential of contract in purchasing context.<br/>Negotiation technique varies from one company to another depending on the type and policy of that company.<br/>In most companies and organizations today materials are consideration as vital tools to the success operations.<br/>The purchasing of materials take a lion share of the financial budget in a trading period almost 75% of the Asaba textile mill total expenditure goes on material procurement. This makes prompt negotiation a function of purchasing. This project work is a case study of Asaba tex Nigeria limited. I have chosen Asaba for two reasons.<br/>First, it is a manifesting company and they have acquired a lot of knowledge about purchasing function secondly, so that I can critically examine how they carryout local and international negotiation practices in the company and its effect on profitability. <br/>(ii)        HISTORICAL BACKGROUND<br/>Asaba Textile mile was income prorated on June 18th 1964. The name of the company at that time was Midwest textile mile limited and was the brain child of the partnership of the Midwestern region government and continue card and company ltd of Hamburg, western Germany with 90% and 10% share holding respectively. The authorized and fully paid capital of the company is N2.5m.<br/>Location. Asaba textile mile is situated at Asaba on the west bank of the legendary Rive Nigeria. The choice of the form as location of the mill was on double influenced by the fact of the being new river water is crucial to mills therefore this proximity to the river is a good insurance since public water supply is erratic. Locating the mill at Asaba.<br/>Also ensured proximity to the bustling  town of Onitsha just across the river.<br/>Onitsha has about the largest industrial market in the country.<br/>Raw materials and spare parts for the mile machinery are usually available there. Quite importantly too, there is a large market for the dispose of finished textile product. Though incorporated in 1964, production did not start until 2nd October 1965.<br/>Incidentally the disastrous Nigeria civil war started barely a year after this and the company was heavily damaged as a result of the ravages a cropping blow I its infancy. The period during which it had operated before the war broke out was far too short to establish a convenient system of production so that in reality it was faced with having to make a fresh start in 1970 when the war ended.<br/>Saddled with burden of damaged infrastructure, shortage of water, capital and the resultant low out put, the company plodded on for thirteen years after  that with little to show for the share holders aspirations.<br/>In those times production level was at an all – time low of about 4000 metres daily, and to survive we had to lean heavily on the Bendel state Government congresses. With the inception a new brand of directors under V. Okia – Anie however, administrative and operational strategy was over handed, a new energy injured, many forereaching decisions taken in chiding the agonizing one of pruning staff strength by 50% to reduce overheads.<br/>Immediately production level increased from dismal ranges of 4000 meters daily, giving the company the impetus to short repaying most of their loans and subventions.<br/>On 7th April 1987 a new board of directors under the chairmanship of it, COLEBOMA (rto) was sworn in to run the company. The high production level has been maintained so that today the mile Tums out between 10,000 – 12,000 meter daily. The buoyancy resulting from the production level has made it possible for the new board to reabsorb 140 previously rethreaded workers. The company looks at the further with great expectation hope and determination to keep the customers satisfied.<br/>PRODUCTION PROCESSES<br/>The mill is equipped with facilities for a full production circler. This means that the mill is capable of taking all production steps necessary to: <br/>(1)    Spin raw cotton limit into yarn <br/>(2)    We have the yarn to produce grey baft.<br/>(3)    And consequently bleach engrave and print the grey baft into the finished product we see in the market.<br/>There are four departments that handle start the production of those fine quality prints that the company is increasingly being noted for. The departments are.<br/>(A)             Wearing:- In this department, the yarn that has been turned out by the spinning department is woven into grey baft by our export team of weavers the machine with which this process is carried out is know as pirn chancing hoom, of which the mill presently has over five hundred. <br/>(B)              Engracing: Engracing the designs that have been chosen for particular prints into the grey baft is carried out by this department.<br/>(C)              This is done by the use of copper rollers and screens though the company turns out its own design, the customers can as well bring forward their own specifications for engraving.<br/>Finishing: This department processes the cloth with chemicals dyeing, printing and finishing and then making it into the attractive quality production level is encouraging and the incessant demand for the company’s product is an attestation to their high quality. This is a far – cry from the period of how production before 1983 when as we had said production as how as 4,000 meters daily and the company had to spend heavily on government publication Today we an able to say that things have definitely taken a tune for the better and we would like you to depart of that rejuvenation.<br/>At the moment, the mill has the capacity to produce African prints, dress prints and poplin. However every effort is being made by the management to polyester garments and other more sophisticated textile products as may be demanded by the market.<br/>A good management and a good staff are pre – requisites to a successful industrial growth. A company cannot do without its management neither can it so without its staff. These two aims of the organization, proceeding from their positions of individual strength must mutual dependence. The Asaba textile mill stridently pursues an industrial utopia whereby cordial relation &amp; between management and staff make them partners in progress and not adversaries. It as a result of that pursuit that production levels have been high and sustained in recent times, making possible the re-absolution of 146 previously retrenched staff of the company since last year.    <br/>The broad of directors had also established a gratuity / retirement scheme for all categories of staff by arrangement with Bended  insurance company limited. There was no such scheme. It therefore highlights the board’s relentless pursuit of avenues of achieving industrial accord.<br/>The staff union exists in the company, which serves as a medium for exchange of views, which may be conveyer to the board if necessary.<br/>4% is the capital of the company, reserved for staffs that wish to be shareholders.<br/>ASABA TEXTILE MILL AND THE FUTURE OF THE TEXTIE INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA.<br/>With the ban on importation of textile into the country, a new horizon opens to genuine textile  mills with the sort of production capacity which Asaba textile has. Since Nigerians must now buy locally – produce textile the market possibilities for a competitive company become bright. However this security of the competing mills in the country to ensure that quality of is a priority.<br/>Production will go a long way to re-assure skeptical consumer who have been used to foreign importer one. This is why Asaba textile mill spares on efforts to ensure that the consumers get real nature satisfaction.<br/>With the relative industrial superiority of Nigeria on the west Africa sub-region, mark possibilities could quite likely arises in other countries of the sub-region it was partly in recognition of the quality of the company production to popularized the products in the sub-region, that the red. Government especially selected Asaba textile mill represent Nigeria in Sitha– 986, a textile exhibition organized by the European economic community (EEC) at Abidjan,             Cotedevoire.<br/>Response to the company’s product was good and far reaching connection.<br/>It may be said in conclusion that the future generation will go far in the national textile industry in general and particularly for Asaba textile mill Ltd. Which is very mindful of its risibility in terms of quality to customers.<br/>SYSTEM  DISTRBUTION.<br/>The company sells its designs to its numerous customers on a cash and carry basis. As the demand far the company’s products steadily increases, it is not only necessary, but fair that special preference be given to customers of Delta state origin in the event of short supply.<br/>This is not to say, however that sufficient preference is not made to customers from other parts of the country.<br/>Asaba textile mill has customer, who are categorized according to their respective turnovers.<br/>1.2              BACKGROUND OF THE SUBJECT MATTER<br/>The chosen research topic in negotiation as a cost reduction tool in material purchase. A case study of Asaba textile mill Nigeria limited Delta state.<br/>It came about as of careful observations made by the researcher on the ways business organizations in the manufacturing sector of our economy have been operating.<br/>This makes procurement important, which definitely affects an organization profit position. Most industries produce at a very high cost due to high price of material in taken but thy sell only at production cost without making profit in order to meet competition and remain in business.<br/>Presently, text tile industries are becoming increasingly sophisticated with difficult product appearing Daily in our market.<br/>These are locally made in Nigeria and have to be sold along side with imported wax product. All are competing for almost the same products.<br/>The relevance of negotiation is a cost reduction tool on materials purchase in textile industries is that sales revenue is generated after sales.<br/>However, the firm can still make profit by ensuring proper negotiation on all materials bought from numerous suppliers source both locally and internationally from forgetting it can be seen that for textile industries and Asaba Tex which is a new textile to survive in this present business environment and economy, it needs a clear understanding and effective application to techniques in all its purchases.<br/>1.3              STATEMENT OF GENERAL PROBLEM<br/>In 184 the company started experiencing problems  as a result of level of production in the company till 1987 when the company was short down.<br/>Bendel state was divided into Edo and Delta state, and assets were share including government parastatals. At the end of the sharing processes, Asaba textile mill was share to Delta state.<br/>In 1994, when Aiecdr Ibrahim Kefas was the military Administrator of the state all government owned Para stators including the textile mills were sold and church Gate Nig Limited took over the management of the company with state government controlling 20% shares.<br/>In Nigeria economy is currently undergoing quite a number of problems.<br/>Principal among these are. The depreciation of the naira and the invariability of foreign  exchange, these combine to affect business positively or negatively.<br/>The textile industries have also added responsibility to the present government policy of producing locally. Chemical cottons tools and equipment. In order to discouraged importation which is due to the current exchange rate in the exchange market. The textile industries is now competing with imported wrappers like Hollandaise, English wax and many others, which are either the same high quality.<br/>From the above it can be seen that only efficient and innovative firms can survive and satisfy its customers.<br/>This makes life difficult for manufacturers who are now forced to be more scientific in order to obtain results, which  can be efficiently merged with the organization goal.<br/>1.4              RATIONAL OF THE STUDY<br/>The work will provide opportunity for the researcher to compare the theoretical aspect of the importance of purchasing with the practical aspect of it.<br/>The study will also be of a benefit to the researcher because it will widen her knowledge on negotiation as practiced in a company as opposed to what is written in textbooks. Also it is a pre-requisite for the award of Higher National Diploma (HND) in purchasing &amp; supply. For the company, it will serve as a reference text and provide probable suggestions to identified problems.  <br/>Finally, it will be a benefit to future researchers since almost all aspect of negotiation will fully discussed in this study, hence it will serves as a base for future studies.<br/>1.5              DEFINITIONS OF TERMS.<br/>Negotiation: This is the process of planning receiving and analyzing used by the buyer and the seller to reach an acceptable compromise in an aspect of business transaction such as price delivery, specification, terms of payment etc. also it is the act of attiring at a common understanding between the buyer and the seller through bargaining on essential of the contract:<br/>Purchasing:- This term is also here as the process of buying in the market. But in a broader sense, it is a professional term used when buying goods and services by an industries, commerce and co-operation by a professesional buyer <br/>Haggling:- Since negotiation is sometime mistaken to means the same thing as haggling it is good at this juncture to point out that haggling means arguing about price.<br/>Expediting:- it is also referred as follow up.<br/>Supply: This is the process of obtaining by legal means materials supplies, services and equipment required in the operation of organization.<br/>Specification: This is the process of defining an item in terms of it brand or trade name chemical analysis sample standard, performance or any other relevant characteristic suitable in all aspect for the purpose for which it is intended. <br/>Bargaining: Is an agreement to discussion in order to arrive at a compromise. <br/>Competitive Bidding: Is calling for bids and evaluating the bids to arrive at the best price.<br/>Both side wins something. Invariably one side wins, more than the other, this is how it should be in business, superior skills mentis superior records.<br/>HEINRITZ AND FARREL (1981, P.265) define negotiation as the act of arriving at a common understanding through bargaining on the essential of contract such as delivery terms, specification, price and others terms. Because of the interaction of these factors and many others, it is a difficult act and requires the exercise of judgment, fact and common senses. The effective negotiation must be a real shopper, alive to the possible of bang aiming strength. A negotiation knows where to be firm or make pessimistic concession on prices and other terms.    <br/>            According to Baily and farmer (1981, P.237) negotiation form substantial part of the jobs of most purchasing people with any measure of responsibility. Like sales men, buyer needs to be proficient in such skills as asking good question listening, interpreting, terms in negotiation pre – planning a negotiation ensuring that what is agreed is implemented. They need to be able to analyses and interpret information, and be aware of dangers, making unwarranted assumptions, since negotiation is an interpersonal process, they need to understand something about human behaviors, needs and motivations and the need to develop interactive skills.<br/>WESTING J.HC 1976, P-198) commented in established concerts sources of supply that have proved satisfactory in quality, services and prices have been developed over the years. These sources tend to be regularly utilized when the sources are found to be lighter in price or to offer delivery terms that are nor as desirable as those offended by a completion, the buyer will frequently negotiate, with the regular success for better price and delivery terms.<br/>            Negotiation may be conducted with the suppliers, sales men or they may sell or buy. It permits a more personal approach to the problem of agreeing on the terms of sales than does the formal invitation method.<br/>LYSON (1989,P.208) defines negotiation as any form of verbal communication in which the participant seek to exploits the relative strength of the respective bargaining position to achieve exploit or implicit objectives within the overall purpose of seeking to resolve the identified areas of disagreement.<br/>According to UGBANA (1987, 9.102) negotiation is seen as the art and science of arriving at a common understanding through bargaining on the essentials of a contract since as delivery price terms and conditions of services within the purchasing context.<br/>It is essentially a technique of communication of interchanging ideas and information as a result of which buyers and sellers arrives at a mutually acceptable bargain. To be successful the purchasing manage should do some home work well by planning his objectives and stages before hand entails the session with a position attitude of success, collecting and sending all relevant facts before the meeting and developing on agenda for the meeting.<br/>Since the essential element in negotiation is bargaining between individuals. The process involves personalities, human motive people strength and weakness and a great deal of psychology.<br/>Again Baily (1987, P-197-198) asserted that the scientific aids of operations research the elaborate calculations and the expensive computer hard with supplier after the fact  .<br/> <br/>\n\nNEGOTIATION AS A COST REDUCTION TOOLS IN MATERIALS PURCHASES (A CASE STUDY OF ASABA TEX NIGERIA LIMITED)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NEGOTIATION AS A COST REDUCTION TOOLS IN MATERIALS PURCHASES (A CASE STUDY OF ASABA TEX NIGERIA LIMITED)", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EVALUATION OF THE USE OF TENDERS IN A PUBLIC SECTOR PROCUREMENT<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF BUREAU FOR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT, ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The subject matter of this study is to carefully evaluate the use of tenders in the public sector procurement.  In a bid for better understanding of public procurement as to the Nigerian content backed by the Nigerian procurement Act of 2007.

But in this context, tender is defined as “An offer made in writing by one party to another to execute certain supply contract/commodity slated at a stated cost”.<br/>        Tendering is the process of making an offer, bid or proposal or expressing interest in response to an invitation or request for tender.<br/>        The dictionary of purchasing and supply management defines tender and tendering as offers from without callous, usually in sealed envelope, delivered by a time and date specified in the invitation to tendering from supply of goods and services. Uzor (2004:440) in CIPS, tendering can be defined as the public release by an organization of the requirements of goods or services for a project in order to allow formal bids to be made to supply the goods or services. Lyson (1996) also defined tendering as a purchase procedure whereby potential suppliers are invited to make a form and unequivocal offer of the price and terms which on acceptance shall be the basis of the subsequent contract. Chilaka o. and Amanze c. defines tender as an offer to sell at the right price indicated and can be converted into a contract by acceptance in the form of a buyers order.<br/>        Tender as an offer to sell at the price indicate and can be converted into a contract by accepting the offer in the form of a buyers order.<br/>        Perhaps, tendering is the very first opportunity for the buyers to have a full detail of the supplier and for the suppliers to improve their services level is the most important element. The public sector management has in their part made numerous contributions to effective and efficient management of contract in the public sector. Several restrictions has been made to see that tenders and tendering are dully observed. For instance, no contract work involving construction shall be considered by tenders board unless for the reasons as:<br/>(a)        The land has been acquired and the topography map on soil tested except where it has been approved by the Architect and it is not necessary. The document relating to the land, the survey map, the soil, test report or certificate of example by the architect should then pay off contract document to be presented to the board. See newly reviewed financial regulations (2000)<br/>i.             Architect design<br/>ii.            Structure design<br/>iii.          Mechanical design<br/>iv.          Bill of qualities<br/>Furthermore, in chapter 32 of financial regulation (2000) the conditions governing the local purchase of stores are set out and subject to those condition all local purchases of stores etc and all work and service costing over N500,000 must be obtained by contract after public tender. It must be recorded that tendering has been misused, mis-managed or even mis-understood.<br/>This single cause of poor contract collection of mobilization fees is carefully considered. The essence of this research therefore is to examine on evaluation of the use of effective an efficient tendering in improving public sector contract management and administration.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE STUDY<br/>(a)    A greater number of problem have bedeviled public sector tender which has had great affection on public sector procurement. The quality of contract entered by the public sector organization. The entire contract system has gone sour as a result of mis-management, corruption, misapplication of rule and regulation set to be adhered to in contracting for goods and services.<br/>(b)    Another problem facing public sector tendering is the issue of Nigeria factor where the nation suffer while the individual grows, selfishness, political consideration, godfatherism, embezzlement of public fund, contract abandonment, etc.. all these have in no small measure affected the quality of tendering which in turn affect the quality of public sector.<br/>(c)    The out date nature of our financial or stores regulation which guides the operations of public procurement as well as public sector tendering gin the greatest problem of our public sector tendering and therefore has serious implication on the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector contract management and administration.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY    <br/>(a)    To examine an evaluation of the use of tender or tendering in improving efficiency and effectiveness of public sector contract management and administration. <br/>(b)    To examine the reasons behind the failure of public sectors tender as well as public sector contract and those of the private sector organization.<br/>(c)    To examine the impact of poorly managed tendering on the public sector contract administration and management. <br/>(d)    To examine the impact of political corrupt godfatherism and Nigeria factor in public tendering in the public sector.<br/>(e)    To suggest ways of improving public contract management through efficient and effective tender.<br/>(f)     To examine the procedure and processes of tendering and contract award and the skills needed of officers involved in public tender and contract management.<br/>(g)    To suggest ways of improving public sector tender, attain better ways of contacting for goods and services that will benefit the tax payers, the government and the service providers.<br/>1.4    RELEVANCE TO THE STUDY <br/>        An evaluation of the use of tenders in public sector procurement cannot be overstated. This has become more important these days where replacement costs are usually higher than the initial estimated cost.<br/>        When the need to reach the rural areas through development project that touch the lives of the rural masses has increased.<br/>        Thus, the study is relevant in the following ways:<br/>1.   This study if relevant because it will help the researcher in acquiring skills and experience in conducting practical investigation on important issues especially on tenders and tendering and other related matter in the public and private sector in the future.<br/>2.   The study will give the researcher an insight on how tender and public sector contract are administered and managed.<br/>3.   This research work is also very essential to the researcher as it is one of the important requirement for the awards of the higher national diploma in purchasing and supply management.<br/>4.   When this study is completed, it will provide useful information to the public sector organization that is involved in one form of contract administration and management.<br/>5.   This study when completed will not only provide new and indepth insight as per the weakness and current tendering and contract practices and procedures. This research work will expose the weakness of the system but will also be helpful to the system, the organizations, both private and public sector and to the other student who may be interested in further research into public sector tendering and contract management and administration.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION  <br/>          In order to collect all the relevant information on the subject matter of this research work the following questions were developed by the researcher.<br/>1.   Does tender have a role to play in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector?<br/>2.   Can the current tendering sector organize, eliminate corruption and build accountability and transparency in public sector?<br/>3.   Are the officers handling tender in the public sector qualified?  <br/>4.   Are the composition of tenders board in the state in-line with the provision of the financial regulation (2000)?<br/>5.   What is the factor responsible for poor tender management in the public sector?<br/>1.6    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>        The following hypothesis will be listed in the course of the study.<br/>HO:   Tender has a role to play in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector.<br/>HI:    Tender has a role to play improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector.<br/>HO:   Current process or procedures as used by the public sector organization help to eliminate corruption and build transparency and accountability.<br/>H1:    Current process or procedures as used by the public sector organization help to eliminate corruption and build transparency and accountability.<br/>1.7    THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>          This study has been limited to the public sector organization and has not crossed borders of the other sectors of the economy as to allow for more detailed investigation into the impact of tendering on public sector contract management and administration in Nigeria. For proper understanding of the impact of tendering in the management and administration of the public sector contract, this study would have covered all the ministries department, agencies, board, even the local government areas in the country, but the researcher after due consideration of various variables and implication decided to concentrate on the study of the implications of efficient and effectiveness of tender in the administration and management of contract in the Bureau for public procurement Enugu, Enugu state. In doing this, the researcher concerted on most of the department and units that have one or other things that has to do with the subject matter of this study. These departments or units include administration, engineering, planning, finance of these areas will give a great insight as to what takes place in other ministries, departments, boards, agencies etc. <br/>        1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>1      Tender: Offer to supply goods and services stating a price at which offer is made in response to an invitation to submit such an offer in competition with others.    <br/>2      Quotation: This is a formal statement prepared by contractor or supplier to his customer includes cost estimates specification and other key information about an agreement between two parties.<br/>3      Government: An institution that is vested with the power to govern and direct affairs of the state.<br/>4      Evaluation: The process of finding out and deciding the amount and value of something.<br/>5      Negotiation: Seeking agreement between the purchaser and the contractor or supplier in the form of a dialogue in order to reach an acceptable terms and conditions prior to concluding a contract.<br/>6      Analysis: The process of breaking components into separated parts or unites in other to examine each unit and constitute critically.<br/>7      Certificate: Act of licensing by a document formally testing the fulfillment of condition.<br/>8      Procedures: A way or system or the pattern of performing a task, work or service etc.<br/>9      Performance: This is an undertaken to perform a contract as required and failure to perform as required the client will be compensated by the supplier or contractor.<br/>10     Specification: This is a detailed requirement of a job/supplies/contract which the contractor or the supplier must comply with.
