        "content": "Location Based Garbage Management System with for Smart City\n\nAbstract - Smart cities integrate multiple mobile or web solutions to build a comfortable human habitation. One of these solutions is to provide an environmentally friendly, efficient and effective garbage management system. The current garbage collection system includes routine garbage trucks doing rounds daily or weekly, which not only doesn't cover every zone of the city but is a completely inefficient use of government resources. This paper proposes a cost-effective mobile or web based system for the government to utilize available resources to efficiently manage the overwhelming amounts of garbage collected each day, while also providing a better solution for the inconvenience of garbage disposal for the citizens. This is done by a network of smart bins which integrates cloud-based techniques to monitor and analyze data collected to provide predictive routes generated through algorithms for garbage trucks. An android or web app is developed for the workforce and the citizens, which primarily provides the generated routes for the workforce and finds the nearest available smart bin for citizens.\n\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JX6X26a2nsw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nExisting System\n\nemployees heading for their workstations every morning. For all those people, there are just not enough garbage bins available. On the streets of urban cities, hundreds of people are\npassing the same location around one minute.\n\nThe obvious solution to this is for the cleaning staff to stay near garbage bins every day till they fill up to clean them. This is not a real solution.\n\nThere are some notable negative effects when considering the garbage bins always being full. One of the main effects is the surrounding area starting to smell and be very unpleasant. When\nthe garbage bins are full people put their trash on sides of the garbage bins.\n\nPROPOSED System \t\n\n    • The proposed system overview for this system. Solid waste management can be broadly categorized as segregation, collection, and transportation.\n\n    • The server will collect the data and store them only a database. This data will be analyzed and displayed on two different dashboards that can be accessed by the workforce and clients.\n\n    • Using data analytics, reports will be generated which can be monitored by the admins through the admin dashboard. \n\n    • Based on the data collected, garbage trucks can be given routes generated through various algorithms and google maps API to efficiently route through all necessary garbage bins and finally reach the dumping site \n\n\n\n\nModule Description\nBy using garbage update information of worker, general public can communicate with adminstrate. Communication is possible among the workers, general public  and administrator.\nSystem Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase. The problem is analyzed so that sufficient matter is provided to design a new system. Large problems are sub-divided into smaller once to make them understandable and easy for finding solutions. Same in this project all the task are sub-divided and categorized.\n\nSystem Modules:\n    • Administrator\n        a. Login \n        b. Create Garbage bin\n        c. Update/Delete garbage bin\n        d. Assign best route for drivers\n        e. Manage driver\n        f. View Garbage Report \n        g.

Users of the On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance will be the registered public and they will be getting connected with the particular mechanic through the trustworthy On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance (ORVBA) system. Because only the legally licensed and approved mechanics are enlisted in the On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance (ORVBA) system. Also they are under monitoring by the ORVBA system for not charging any extra service fee from the users as every user is updating their feedback about the availed service through ORVBA system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/frtUIRmSZy0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1Existing Solution:\n\tIn an existing system there are users who have their own mechanic database which is very minimal. And also they have no idea if their vehicles are broke down or had any mechanical issue in remote locations or any long distant locations from their known mechanic shops. Users with the contacts of people at the particular place may look for a help from them only if they are ready to do.\nIt is not possible to find out the suitable mechanic for the desired service at remote locations. The only way they have is to look for any other transportation at the time of issue and then they need to get a mechanic to the particular location at which they have left their vehicle.\n\nProposed Solution:\t\nHere the users  of On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance (ORVBA) system can search for list of mechanic at any location or the nearby locations which will help them in an unexpected situations raised by the mechanical issues of their vehicles. Only the licensed mechanics can get listed here while the search. And there are available mechanic who can come and repair the mechanical issues in the users vehicle.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nThe system after careful analysis has been identified to be presented with the following modules User, Administrator and Mechanic.\nUser\n    • Register – User has to register their basic details to get access with this application service.\n    • Login – Once they have registered they need to login to avail the service at the needy time.\n    • View Details – Logging in with the application will provide you the lists of mechanics that have the approval of the application.\n    • Search records & call – So that the users can search the mechanic among the list according to their place and time.\n    • Post feedback – After all the process every user has to give their feedback with this application to about their adopted service through this medium.\n\nAdministrator\n    • Provide Approval – Administration has to give approval to the registering mechanic after verifying their licensing details for the effective service.\n\nMechanic\n    • Register – At first every mechanic has to register their details with the admin for getting approval.\n    • Login – Registered mechanics can login their accounts if they got their approval from the admin.\n    • Post details – Here mechanics have to post their details like name, location, services available, etc.\n    • View feedback – Using the feedbacks provided by the users/customers of the service mechanics have to maintain or improve their service.\n\nSystem Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase.

Thus we provide this dynamic module to handle it all at one place. \n\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7rH-hig89pk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n \n\nObjectives:\nToensure a student friendly democratic environment in the campus.\nTo make all the students, faculty and staff awareabout their rights and duties.\nTo solve the various personal and educational related grievances of the student.\nTo ensure the qualitativeas well as quantitative development of the institution through the complaints and grievance redressal cell\nExisting Solution:\nThe biggest downfall to manual document filing is the amount of space it can take up. This is just one big headache you don’t need. It interrupts your productivity levels.\nProne to Damage and Being Misplaced\nManual document filing means you are placing faith in the people handling the files. There are so many ways they can be damaged, lost, or misplaced.  A fire or natural disaster could mean the loss of all your clients’ important information. You will have to start over at square one getting the information back. It can also lead you to losing clients who don’t appreciate your mishandling of their information.\nHard to Make Changes\nWhen you are working with paper documents it is much harder to make changes. Every time you want to make a change you will have to make a copy, so you don’t destroy the original with any edits or comments you might add. This means the editing process is more time consuming than if you were working with digital copies.\nAccess Time\nManual document filing is very time consuming. Not only do you have to organize and store the files, hunting down the information when it is need can take time. It can take anywhere from minutes to hours to hunt down a file, depending on how well your organization is. This can cause annoyance for clients as well as for employees. Their productivity is lowered by having to spend excessive time dealing with a paper filing system.\nLack of Security\nPaper document filing can be less secure than electronic filing systems. Misplaced documents can easily be placed in the wrong hands. Clients expect their information to be secure in your hands. If you can’t keep this safe, you are at risk for losing them. A cabinet filled with files is way easier to access than a computer which requires a password and credentials to get into.\nHigher Cost\nWhen you use paper documents your costs are going to be higher because you are paying for ink and paper. Your office supply bill will be higher if you are using a manual document filing process. While you might think this is insignificant, overtime it’s a lot of money that can be used in better ways.\n\n\n\nProposed Solution:\t\n    • Protection of Freedom of Expression.\n    • Protection against improper academic evaluation\n    • Faculty and students should be ethical, moral and should behave in a manner with good academic interest and should maintain decent academic relations with teachers and co-students and co-operate with college authorities to maintain vibrant and decent academic environment.\n    • In the proposed system we tried to provide the high security than the existing system.\n    • We will provide friendlier environment than the existing one.\n\n\nModules\nModules List:\nAdmin\n    • Login\n    • Register staff login for all grievance department\n    • Verify & Approve Student login  \n    • View All Grievance Report \nGrievance Login \n    • Login\n    • View Grievances\n    • Update Status\nStudent \n    • Register \n    • Login \n    • Create College Grievance\n        ◦ Manage Category – Projector, Garbage, AC , Fan , Water, Bed, Light, Other\n    • Create Hostel Grievance\n        ◦ Manage Category – Room Wise, Garbage, AC , Fan , Water, Bed, Light,  Other \n    • Create Counselling Grievance\n    • Create Cerficate Request\n        ◦ Manage Category – Bonatifate,  Other\n\nModules Description \nAdmin Login \nLogin Module:- \nIn login module the admin can login to the application with the master login details\nCreate Staff: \n\tAdmin will register staff grievance login for correspondin departments\nManage all details\n\tAdmin will manage all grievance details \n\nUser \nRegister Login Module:- \nIn login module the user can register to the application with the details Login will be pending , till admin approve the account.\nCreate Grievance :\n\tUser can login to the system and create grievance in following category food, hostel, college ang certificate.\nView Status of  Grievance :\n\tUser can login to the system and check status of  grievance in following category food, hostel, college ang certificate.\nStaff\nLogin Module:- \nIn login module the staff can login to the application with the details Login will be provided by admin\nUpdate Status Grievance :\nStaff can login to the system and Update status of his/her department grievance in any of the category food, hostel, college ang certificate\n\n",

        "content": "ABSTRACT\nTraffic Squad is an app which helps the police as well as the police by means of time and efficiency. With the increasing importance of corruption has become major factor to be considered as a result the number of vehicles and the rapid development of population are growing in our everyday life. Existing system makes the use of pen and paper that is a challans that are given to the offender on breaking the traffic rules. As the system consist of paperwork the papers are mostly gets damaged or tempered. Due to this hard time for RTO office to maintain the proper records. During patrolling if an offender commits a crime and is caught it is difficult to find out if the license is fake or real and in the same manner it is difficult for common people to find out if the officer who is pretending to be anofficial authority is fake or real one. There are many cases where the user runs away after being caught and the police person can’t take the appropriate action on the offender. Even there are many cases where the vehicles possess fake number plate and the police officers can’t recognize it. So to overcome this loophole in the existing system we have proposed a new system to help us to solve the issues.  Since the proposed framework is digitalized and android based, it will serve as handier instrument and helpful option implies for traffic. And android application is provided to traffic police to retrieve vehicle information, fine details.\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Utl7APpRTek\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nCHAPTER 1 –INTRODUCTION\n\n    In many situations, time is wasted before proper medicalattention is provided to the people affected in an accident. Inmany cases the accidents are severe enough to leave thevictims incapacitated and they fail to summon help. In mostcases fellow human beings on the road communicate with thePolice, but the response time increases during the night. In AUTOVeCoN, the design tries to minimize the responsetime using mobile tower location of both the Collided Vehicleand Policemen. The Civilian Vehicle consists of a collisiondetector and in case of a collision the detector would provide asignal to an embedded processor which shall generate a steadyamplified digital feedback to the owner’s cell-phone. Theowner’s cell-phone, with the help of its custom software wouldnotify the Police Control Room Server. The Police ControlRoom Server which would receive regular update from themobile phones carried by its personnel (to keep a track of thelatest position) would use its Decision Support Software toinform (as a SMSOrder) the nearest police personnel from theaccident location. Also under certain circumstances, Policemenare out of the Vehicle attending to Law & Order Problems, andto make sure that they do not miss out the communication,Short Messages (SMS) would record all information passed onfrom the Control Room Server, which again would serve as aLog.Computer Algorithms would be implemented in the ControlRoom Server, to select the nearest three Officers who are in aLocation nearest from the BTS (Base Transceiver Station) ofthe accident area. A totally automatic calculation would thinout manual error totally and help in efficient deployment.In order to appreciate a quick response time, once an“SMSOrder” have been generated, the Control Room Serverwould wait for the location of those Officers to match that ofthe Action Area and update the response time accordingly andcompletely automatically, which later would help SuperiorOfficers to check, if problems were attended by the rightvehicle at the right time. Base Transceiver Station ID or commonly known as CellID based location detection varies largely depending on the cellsize ranging from 100 metres to over 3000 metres but in theCity (Kolkata) it has been statistically found out by the Authorsusing Field Strength Meters, that the cell radius is around 200-300 metres. That means, that an Officer is within around 300metres of a Base Transceiver Station whose ID is updated inthe Control Room Server.A 100% accurate position of Police Vehicles is not requiredto get a quick response, and a relatively inaccurate locationsystem can decrease response time significantly, which in caseof AutoVeCoN is within a 200-300 metres radius if not less.The implementation cost of AutoVeCoN is comparatively a lotcheaper with practically very little Hardware cost as a CellPhone is very common to every one.\nThe Traffic Squad is an all volunteer unit serving the citizens of Kent County since 1917 making us one of the oldest organizations of its kind in the country. We function under the auspices of the Kent County Sheriff’s Department and Sheriff Lawrence A. Stelma.\n﻿We count among our past and present members some of West Michigan finest citizens, including Gerald R. Ford, Sr., who was Captain in 1936 and 1937 and just happens to be the father of President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. This long tradition of service and leadership lives on today.  As needs change in the law enforcement community, our efforts and services are also evolving and expanding to address these needs.\n﻿To meet these increasing demands, The Squad continues to recruit qualified men and women who have a strong interest in law enforcement oriented community service and are able to meet the rigorous personal and ethical standards required of individuals active in law enforcement.\nNo one wants to be stuck in traffic, which is why having a traffic app on your smartphone is an absolute necessity. Whether you are commuting to work daily or planning to rent a car and drive in a high-traffic city or area, there is likely a traffic app for your needs. The traffic functions are usually integrated into existing navigation apps, giving you real-time estimates of travel time and in some cases, real-time traffic situations and alternate routes. Here are some of the best traffic apps available in 2020. Many have a free version, with the possibility of paid add-ons.\nIf you want accurate traffic information for your city or state, think about downloading the state department of transportation app. Not only do these exist, but they often provide accurate local traffic information and access to local traffic cameras.\n\n        1.1 Objectives\n    • To make the pulic aware about the traffic rules and regulations.\n    • To help the police to make the cases fast and effective.\n    • To view and proceed with the challan details through the single interface.\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\nQuick medical & police response as well as efficient policedeployment is a major concern in both Developing as well asDeveloped Countries to decrease fatality rate and also to tackleLaw & Order problem. Manual modes of communication havea significant effect in response time as it has to pass throughdifferent departments and varies with the level of manpowerpresent. Very few works have been carried out to minimize humanintervention and automate collision response to emergency service providers. Some researchers tried to develop a collisionnotification system using wireless networks [1][2] but indeveloping countries such as India, on road wireless networksare not very common.\nOther works that have been done are designing of locationawareness devices using Map and GPS services to help policevehicles reach the location of activities, and take pictures tosend them back to the HQ [4]. These kinds of systems areknown as LAS and are also used for receiving short messagesfrom the HQ to the Police Vehicle. \nRemote Fleet Management is also a new area where workis being done but is mostly used for obtaining vehicle positionand status, determining the Officer Safety and monitors thefleet wirelessly [3][5]. Various deployment algorithms havealso been discussed in [6][7] which help in decision support todeploy vehicles at strategic locations close to importantaccident prone areas. They also discuss models of deploymentbased on traffic densities, shift time and numbers of carsassigned. In another work [8], Greedy Algorithm has been usedto deploy Police vehicles efficiently using parameters like cost,capability of response and deterrent capability.\n\n DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n\nExisting Solution:\nExisting process of Traffic Squad is very time consuming process. Traffic management is a serious issue confronted by the city. The RTO employees having lot of work burden of making registration, license issue, transfer etc. which required lot of paper work. As a result people cannot get things done in right time.\nProposed System:\nA low cost, Cell Phone based system design has beenproposed in this paper, which would automatically inform thenearest Police Radio Flying Squad or Traffic Dept. vehicles froma vehicle affected in an accident without the need of any humanintervention. The collision detector inside the vehicle would sendan update to the Police Control Room Server which in turnwould immediately send a ‘SMSOrder’ to the Officers / Vehiclesnearest to the location of accident. The automatic message in theform of an SMS would contain the Log with priority One, Two orThree depending on the distance from the said area\n\nSystem Modules:\nUser\n    • Register\n    • Login \n    • View Challan \n    • View Case Filed \n    • (Google map link)\n    • (Should be able to see the police updates of traffic)\nPolice \n    • Login \n    • Rules\n    • Create Case \n        ◦ Upload proof photos\n    • (Uploading bike number and person photo)\n    • Manage \n        ◦ Live information of traffic report - New updates \n    • Google map traffic - Link\nAdmin \n    • Manage Police Login \n    • (Creating area ,street,city)\n    • View Daily Report \n\n\n3.1 Module Description\nUser\n    • Register \n    • User needs to register them to enter into the system using uique login credentials.\n    • Login \n    • User can login to the system with their registered details.\n    • View Challan \n    • User can view the challan details once they login to the system.\n    • View Case Filed \n    • User can view the case field into their account.\n    • (Google map link)\n    • User will be linked with Google Map in the system.\n    • (Should be able to see the police updates of traffic)\n    • User can also notified with police updates regarding traffic.\nPolice \n    • Login \n    • Police can login to the system with the registered login credentials.\n    • Rules\n    • Police will update the rules about traffic into the system.\n    • Create Case – Upload Proof Photos\n        ◦ Police will create a case by the upload of photo proofs.\n    • (Uploading bike number and person photo)\n    • Police will upload the details of the person like bike number and a person’s photo into the system.\n    • Manage - Live information of traffic report - New updates \n        ◦ Police can manage the Live information of traffic report and also the New updates \n    • Google map traffic – Link\n    • Google map will be linked to the case by the police.\nAdmin \n    • Manage Police Login \n    • Admin can manage login details of Police\n    • (Creating area ,street,city) \n    • Admin can create Area, Street and City details.\n    • View Daily Report \n    • Admin can view the daily reports of the entire system.\n\n",

        "content": "White Card – Manage all card into one (Driving license, Pan Card, Voter Id, Ration Card)\nAbstract\n\nThe project entitled as “White Card Web Application with Android App” is to design and develop the application package for well secured dynamic application in sensor reading. Developed this software by using Android SDK and Java coding is used as the front-end tool and SQL Lite is used as the back-end tool. In this project presents White Card App Application with Android App is a personal identification card and it’s a future project for India which denotes Indians. An identity document (also called a piece of identification or ID) is any document which may be used to verify aspects of a person’s personal identity. If issued in the form of a small, mostly standard-sized card, which includes the details like Driving license, Pan Card, Voter Id, Ration Card. In the absence of a formal identity document, some countries accept driving licenses as the most effective method of proof of identity. Most countries accept passports as a form of identification. This White Card can be used as an all in one Card with Universal Product Code adoption of identity is supported by law enforcement officials who claim that it will make surveillance and identification of criminals easier. Every human being can carry this White Card for one’s own personal identification which cannot be falsified or discarded. Even if the people pretermit the Driving license or Pancard this White Card can be swiped for the particular purpose, which reduces the person saddle. In an effort to check the growing menace of ration cards and diversion of food grains from fair price shops, the state government has proposed to introduce unique White cards that will replace the traditional ration cards across the state. The state Science and Technology Department has been asked to design the system for the proposed White cards, based on biometric system. The White cards will be prepared under ration card computerization system, evolved by the State Food and Civil Supplies department.\n\n\nWhite Card App\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/moePGWPaW1c\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nWhite Card Authentication can be completed through various means like Biometric – Fingerprint and IRIS,  demographic, and One Time Password to registered mobile phone or email id.\n\nDemographic authentication- The White Card number and demographic information of the White Card number holder obtained from the White Card number holder is matched with the demographic information of the White Card number holder in the CIDR.\nOne-time pin based authentication- A One Time Pin (OTP), with limited time validity, is sent to the mobile number and/ or e-mail address of the White Card number holder registered with the Authority, or generated by other appropriate means. The White Card number holder shall provide this OTP along with his White Card number during authentication and the same shall be matched with the OTP generated by the Authority.\nBiometric-based authentication- The White Card number and biometric information submitted by a White Card number holder are matched with the biometric information of the said White Card number holder stored in the CIDR. This may be fingerprint-based or iris-based authentication or other biometric modalities based on biometric information stored in the CIDR.\nMulti-factor authentication- A combination of two or more of the above modes may be used for authentication\nA requesting entity (like Banks, Insurance Companies, EPF or Mutual Fund Companies) may choose the suitable mode(s) of authentication from the modes specified above for a particular service or business function as per its requirement, including multiple factors of authentication for enhancing security.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is clarified that e-KYC authentication shall only be carried out using OTP and/ or biometric authentication.\n\nEXISTING SYSTEM:\n\nIn the present system only the admin can view and track details of license, PAN card and other such details using white card enrollment number. Other users cannot bring out the details of their own.\n\nPROPOSED SYSTEM:\n\nThe proposed system is an application and maintains a centralized repository of all related information. The system allows anyone to easily access the relevant information and make necessary creation and review of the data at any cost.\n\nModule Description\nThe system is proposed to have the following modules: This app enhanced level of categories for White Card App.\n\n3.2 System Features\n\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase. The problem is analyzed so that sufficient matter is provided to design a new system. Large problems are sub-divided into smaller once to make them understandable and easy for finding solutions. Same in this project all the task are sub-divided and categorized.\n\nSystem Modules:\n\nWhite card creation.\nBar code updating.\nCentralizing the data.\nInformation warehouse.\nMining data from server.\nDetails from android application\nModule Description\n\nWhite Card Creation:\nThis is the initial module of this project. Here a basic white card will be created for every citizen and even a card will be issued to a new born baby while generating their birth certificate. The white card is a laminated plastic card which divided into 6 major categories. In the basic card it contains the nation identification number and the blood group. The bard code involves in the next module.\n\nBar Code Updating:\nAfter generating the white card with the basic details, a bar code will be generated relevant to the national identification Number. This bar code and national identification number is the unique details for every citizen in India. The values generating from the bar code will be saved in the centralized data which can be accessed only through this web application and a specially design bar code reader.\n\nCentralizing the data:\nThis is most important module in this project; this is because the updating details will be stored in the centralized server and the sub servers.  The following details will be updated: Driving License details, DNA details, Pan Card number, Ration card details, Voter ID details and Citizenship card details. A prior admin will be allocated to access these details like police man, Income tax officers, Ration shop workers and etc. They will be permitted to update the details too.\n\nInformation Warehouse:\nA special server will designed to store all these confidential information as will as prior security will be provided by the system admin. User will be permitted to access any details from the card; they are simply the card holders. The accessing agents are the admin here.\n\nMining data from server:\nAdmin plays a most important role here, Admin having a special bar code reader to access the white card from the user. Here the data will be mine according to the admin role. In case of a police man they can mine the license and other information relevant to license. And even the can able to update the black marks for the users. In can accessing other policeman in some other area, he can able to see the black mark updated by the other admin.\n\nDetails from android application:\nAndroid User can login into the android application by using his/her username and password. The user can get all the details of a person like voter id, pan card, passport, ration card, driving license through this android application by entering the id. If any user wants to update the complaint through the android application, he/she can update the details. The complaint details will be updated to the database.",

Also an alert in the form of a notification can be received whenever the user and a friend are in the same locations.\n\nServer: The server receives users’ location and alerts two friends if they are in the same location or update the user about the location of family members.\n\nDatabase: The database contains all users subscribed in the service with their location, a separate list for each user that contains friends and family members that can be located, and there is a table that contains locations with their coordinates. MySQL is the database used for maintaining the record of the child’s activities along with PHP.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nThis system is designed for parents and children. It can also be used in offices by the employer for the employees. Both have a smartphone that supports google geo location and SMS facilities. SMS is a basic service provided on any smartphones but google geo locationcan be found only new smartphones. The application is mostly to be used by parents to track their child’s location. In a later phase for implementation purposes, the system will be eclipse supporting android.\n\nSystem Features\n\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase. The problem is analyzed so that sufficient matter is provided to design a new system. Large problems are sub-divided into smaller once to make them understandable and easy for finding solutions. Same in this project all the task are sub-divided and categorized.\n\nSystem Modules:\n\nPARENT\n\nCreate site details\nView Google geo location\nManage sites\nBlock Sit\nRecive sms & email\nAdmin Login (Act like police control room)\n\nMointor Emerencies SOS\nRecieve only email\nCHILD\n\nLogin\nSearch site\nUpdate Geo location\nSOS Button – For emerency\nSMS Alert to parent\nAdd Guardin – Email & Mobile No\nManage Guardian",

The proposed system of the projects, develop a hospital - patient interaction system for booking and searching the near by hosptial on  android application platform to meet the needs of the patient and provide doctors more efficient and convenient means of communication with patients. The advantages of web can be made full use of to make up the time and distance gap between hospital and patients and to provide fast and adequate medical services. Through the connection between user terminals and specific service, both doctors and patients are able to obtain required data to achieve a better interaction. The platform, android services and database technology are all gradually maturing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n– INTRODUCTION\n\tA lot of people are facing difficulties getting help when their car breaks down on the road. Many of them do not have any On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance’ contact number and could not get help as the On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance might be far away from their locations.  These problems are the motivations for the development of this project to help those who are in need when their car breaks down along the roads. This project will start with the analysis of the car breakdown incidents on the road. It expects  that  through  some  research,  the  statistics  of  car breakdowns can be obtained to see if this project is helpful to those  in  need.  The  next  step  would  be  an  analysis  and comparison of those existing Car Breakdown Service portals or applications  to  identify  the  flaws.  Development of an On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance (ORVBA) System will be carried out after planning and analysis. Internal testing and user testing of the application will be carried out before the system is being deployed. As part of the expected results, the proposed system connects On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance (ORVBA) and the Public through this system. If  the car  owner's transportation  breaks down on any highway or federal road in any part of Malaysia, the owner could enter information with regards to the place of breakdown  in  the  system  using  mobile  phone,  tablets.  The system will automatically search for any ORVBA nearest to the reported incident spot. The users are able to contact the ORVBA to service the vehicle. This  project  aims  to  develop  a  Car Breakdown  Service  Station  Locator  System.  The proposed system connects On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance (ORVBA) and the Public through this system. \nthe problems faced by the drivers are not solely car breaking down. Car breakdown will cause frustration to the driver, the  frustration will then cause the  driver to make  bad decisions  and  being  scammed  by  the  tow  truck  scammers. Another problem is getting help from workshops or hosptials. One who does not possess any workshop’s number can only rely on the help of a car passing by and risk being scammed. Based on all these related problems, it is vital to come out with a solution that can solve these problems.  Revising  back  the background  studies,  the  current  way  of  how  people  obtain service from workshops might be satisfying such as the service provided by Automobile Association of Malaysia (AAM), the existing application such as CarBengkel might be designed to be more helpful for those who faces car breakdown difficulties, however the development of this project aims to improve the way  on  how  the  public  contact  the  ORVBA  and  to  provide convenience  for  both  sides.  The  development  of  this  Car Breakdown  Service  Station  Locator  System  also  aims  to overcome the flaws of some of the existing applications in the market. With open source resources, the development cost of this On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance (ORVBA) System is being kept to a minimum and that is why it is capable of providing assistance to the user with free of charge on  the application download.  The development  of this  application  also fits  the purpose  of  education  studies  and  meets  the  requirement  as stated in  early stages and  of course providing  help to people who are in need.\n\nObjectives\nIf On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance (ORVBA) is desirous to give a application based platform to your issues related to the hosptialal part of your vehicle in remote locations or the locations which you are not aware about the hosptials. With the list of registered and licensed hosptials in and around the desired locations will definitely help up out of the problem without extra charges. to the people who are living in your desired city. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n– LITERATURE REVIEW\nBook My Doctor is a multi functional  online doctor appointment scheduling software for doctors, clinics and large hospitals built up on Php with CodeIgniter framework. This open source scheduling system is built upon php with CodeIgniter framework. With the ease of configuration and personalization, Book My Doc is the best tool for both doctors and patients. This is a powerful medical doctor appointment scheduling software to meet all challenges that may surface during your appointment scheduling and hospital management. This online doctor appointment booking software is user-friendly at both front and back ends, which means that the process of booking appointments and scheduling management of Book My Doc is easy for both the doctors and patients. For attracting new patients, a medical practice must adopt digitization. By using Book My Doc make a start to provide digital healthcare.\nThe word “appointment” indicate duration of time apportioned in the schedule to a peculiar patient’s visit and time to be spent with the medical practitioner is stated early so the doctor absolutely concentrates with the patient (the specified duration andoriginal consultation time might vary)[1]. As established on Cayirli and Veral [2], Appointment arrangement can be categorized into two, Dynamic and Static. In later category appointment reservation accord must be made earlier to the onset of the sitting,which is the prevailing appointment system in hospitals. In former category appointment reservations will be an itinerary of forthcoming advents which are adjusted progressively everydaydepending on the current situation of the system. This is implementable when patient shows up to the clinic space so that they can be coordinated dynamically, which broadly comprises of patients previously admitted to a clinic or hospital. The appointment scheduling procedure will either be dynamic or static can be noticedas difficulty in hospitals that can be disposed using an efficient doctor patient portal which manages online appointment reservation and schedules them. The prosperity of exercising this system will reach everybody who took part in the scheduling process. Staffs and administrators can handle their duties further accurately and efficiently, while patients have the capability to fix their reservations and appointments conveniently and more quickly. Online appointment fixing and scheduling system is by whichan end user or directly, a patient can approach the website or web application and connect to the doctor, and by the online software system, the patient can conveniently book their appointments. Along with that, patient can also contribute supplementary details to the medical practitioner, composing the doctor more familiar of their position and offering the doctor duration to draw up the significant data for when the patient’s visits or appears. In this way, online appointment reservation and scheduling system can help the patients, the doctors, and the office staffs. There are considerable online scheduling tools in the internet, a few of which are trait loaded, simple to setup and economical.\n\n\nExisting Solution:\n\nIn an existing system  patients has to go to the hospital and wait in a queue at the appointment desk to make the reservation and get an appointment. But they generally finish up waiting endlessly for very long time intervals. The patient might choose to fix an appointment, but this choice is not possible at all times and does not likely work well for all people involved in the system. People involved are as follows: The medical personnel, the hospital and the patient. \nThe patient longs for effortlessly convenient and accessible times.When they cannot discover a quick enough appointment they feel like waitingendlessly (Duration between scheduling and the appointment being made available).The patient also expects to be seen all of a sudden or within few minutes of their visit to the hospital or clinic (whether an appointment has been scheduled earlier or not).\n\t\nProposed Solution:\t\nUser can search any hospital and book appoinment as user perfer. \nKey Features\n    • Search Module\n    • Appointment Booking\n    • Check-in form Submitting\n    • Appointment management\n    • Schedule a timing \n    • Past appointment Management\n    • Ratings and Reviews\nAdmin Features \nAdmin has overall control of the system.

Most of the time, it refers to the sale of products via Internet, but the term ecommerce also covers purchasing mechanisms via Internet (for B-To-B).\nA client who purchases on the Internet is called a cyber consumer. E-Commerce is not only limited to online sales, but also covers:\n    • Preparation of estimates online\n    • Consulting of users\n    • Provision of an electronic catalog\n    • Access plan to point of sales\n    • Real-time management of product availability (stock)\n    • Online payment\n    • Delivery tracking\n    • After-sales service\nIn certain cases, electronic commerce makes it possible to highly customize products, in particular when the electronic commerce site is linked with the production system of the enterprise (e.g. business cards, customized items such as T-shirts, cups, caps, etc.)\nFinally, insofar as electronic services and products are concerned (MP3 files, software programs, e-books, etc.), electronic commerce makes it possible to receive the purchase in a very short time, if not immediately.\nMost electronic commerce sites are online stores which have at least the following elements at the front-office level:\nAn online electronic catalog listing all products for sale, their price and sometimes their availability (product in stock or number of days before delivery);\nA search engine which makes it possible to easily locate a product via search criteria (brand, price range, key word, etc.) ;\nA virtual caddy system (sometimes called virtual cart): This is the heart of the e-commerce system. The virtual caddy makes it possible to trace the purchases of the client along the way and modify the quantities for each reference;\nSecure online payment (accounting) is often ensured by a trusted third party (a bank) via a secure transaction;\nAn order tracking system, which allows tracking of order processing and sometimes, provides information on pickup of the package by the shipper.\nA back office system allows the online dealer to organize its offerings online, modify prices, add or remove product references as well as manage and handle client orders.\nE Commerce stands for electronic commerce and caters to trading in goods and services through the electronic medium such as internet, mobile or any other computer network. It involves the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) in making commerce between consumers and organizations, organization and organization or consumer and consumer. With the growing use of internet worldwide, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) has also increased in humungous amounts and so has flourished e-commerce with the prolific virtual internet bazaar inside the digital world which is righty termed as e-malls.\n \nWe now have access to almost every knick-knack of our daily lives at competitive prices on the internet. No matter one is educated or illiterate, an urbane or a countryman, in India or in U.K; all you need is an internet connection and a green bank account. With e-commerce then, you can buy almost anything you wish for without actually touching the product physically and inquiring the salesman n number of times before placing the final order. Here is a beautiful picture depicting how has human life evolved to adapt to the digital world and hence trading over the internet. As seen, from pizza and potted plant to pair of shoes, we have everything on sale on the internet available in tempting offers..!! Snapdeal.com, Amazon, eBay, Naaptol, Myntra, etc are some of the most popular e-commerce websites.\nTracing some steps back, it’s been recorded that some institutes of the western world started exchanging information and data electronically by the late 1970s. But the concept of online trading of goods was first witnessed much later with the dawn of 1990. In 1994, Jeff Bezos; an American businessman started his e-commerce website Cadabra.com, now popularly known as Amazon.com. Amazon was the first online firm to execute secured online transactions. \nDell Inc emerged as the first company ever to record sales in millions of dollars in 1997. It was also the first company to sell large number of assembled computers online. It is popularly known for its successful business model and in the year 2007, it was listed as the 34thlargest company in the Fortune500 list.\nIn the United States, certain electronic commerce activities are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These activities include but not limit to the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and consumer privacy. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The Federal Trade Commission Act regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.[26] Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumers' personal information.[27] As a result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.\nThe Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which came into law in 2008, amends the Controlled Substances Act to address online pharmacies.[28]\nConflict of laws in cyberspace is a major hurdle for harmonization of legal framework for e-commerce around the world. In order to give a uniformity to e-commerce law around the world, many countries adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996).[29]\nInternationally there is the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN), which was formed in 1991 from an informal network of government customer fair trade organisations. The purpose was stated as being to find ways of co-operating on tackling consumer problems connected with cross-border transactions in both goods and services, and to help ensure exchanges of information among the participants for mutual benefit and understanding. From this came Econsumer.gov, an ICPEN initiative since April 2001. It is a portal to report complaints about online and related transactions with foreign companies.\nThere is also Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) was established in 1989 with the vision of achieving stability, security and prosperity for the region through free and open trade and investment. APEC has an Electronic Commerce Steering Group as well as working on common privacy regulations throughout the APEC region.\nIn Australia, Trade is covered under Australian Treasury Guidelines for electronic commerce,[30] and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission[31]regulates and offers advice on how to deal with businesses online,[32] and offers specific advice on what happens if things go wrong.[33]\nIn the United Kingdom, The Financial Services Authority (FSA)[34] was formerly the regulating authority for most aspects of the EU's Payment Services Directive (PSD), until its replacement in 2013 by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority.[35] The UK implemented the PSD through the Payment Services Regulations 2009 (PSRs), which came into effect on 1 November 2009. The PSR affects firms providing payment services and their customers. These firms include banks, non-bank credit card issuers and non-bank merchant acquirers, e-money issuers, etc. The PSRs created a new class of regulated firms known as payment institutions (PIs), who are subject to prudential requirements. Article 87 of the PSD requires the European Commission to report on the implementation and impact of the PSD by 1 November 2012.[36]\nIn India, the Information Technology Act 2000 governs the basic applicability of e-commerce.\nIn China, the Telecommunications Regulations of the People's Republic of China (promulgated on 25 September 2000), stipulated the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) as the government department regulating all telecommunications related activities, including electronic commerce.[37] On the same day, The Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services released, is the first administrative regulation to address profit-generating activities conducted through the Internet, and lay the foundation for future regulations governing e-commerce in China.[38] On 28 August 2004, the eleventh session of the tenth NPC Standing Committee adopted The Electronic Signature Law, which regulates data message, electronic signature authentication and legal liability issues. It is considered the first law in China's e-commerce legislation. It was a milestone in the course of improving China's electronic commerce legislation, and also marks the entering of China's rapid development stage for electronic commerce legislation.\nIn 1996, Forrester Research Institute (www.forrester.com) predicted that B2C would be a $6.6 billion business in 2000, up from $518 million in 1996. Then they revised the figure to $20 billion, and the prediction keeps growing. In 1997, about $10 billion worth of B2B transactions were conducted over the Internet. Predictions on the total size of ECommerce vary. For 2010, total online shopping and B2Btransactions are estimated to be in the range of $700 billion to $4 trillion. Some E-Commerce applications, such as auctions and online stock trading, are growing at a rate of 15 percent to 25 percent per month, and the number of Internet users worldwide is predicted to reach 750 million by 2008. \nThe benefits to organizations are as follows: • Electronic commerce expands the market lace to national and international market with minimal capital outlay, a company can easily and quickly locate more customers, the best suppliers, and the most suitable business partners worldwide. • Electronic commerce decreases the cost of creating, processing, distributing, storing, and retrieving paper-based information. For example, by introducing an electronic procurement system, companies can cut the purchasing administrative costs by as much as 85 percent. • Ability for creating highly specialized businesses. For example, dog toys which can be purchased only in pet shops or department and discounts stores in the physical world are sold now in a specialized www.dogtoys.com (also see www.cattoys.com). • Electronic commerce allows reduced inventories and overhead by facilitating “pull” type supply chain management. In a pull-type system the process starts from customer orders and uses just-in-time manufacturing. • The pull-type processing enables expensive customization of products and services which provides competitive advantage to its implementers. 21 • Electronic commerce reduces the time between the outlay of capital and the receipt of products and services. • Electronic commerce initiates business processes reengineering projects By changing processes, productivity of salespeople, knowledge workers, and administrators can increase by 100 percent or more. • Electronic commerce lowers telecommunication cost the internet is much cheaper than value added networks. • Other benefits include improved image, improved customer service, new found business partners, simplified processes, compressed cycle and delivery time, increased productivity, eliminating paper, expediting access to information, reduced transportation costs, and increased flexiblity.\n\n\n        1.1 Objectives\nE-Services for buy a Catering aim is to provide the information about the services or schemes and application for each service of Catering online and it also view and update by customer of buy a Catering.\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\t\nIn 2010, the United Kingdom had the highest per capita e-commerce spending in the world.[41] As of 2013, the Czech Republic was the European country where e-commerce delivers the biggest contribution to the enterprises´ total revenue. Almost a quarter (24%) of the country's total turnover is generated via the online channel.[42]\nAmong emerging economies, China's e-commerce presence continues to expand every year. With 668 million Internet users, China's online shopping sales reached $253 billion in the first half of 2015, accounting for 10% of total Chinese consumer retail sales in that period.[43] The Chinese retailers have been able to help consumers feel more comfortable shopping online.[44] E-commerce transactions between China and other countries increased 32% to 2.3 trillion yuan ($375.8 billion) in 2012 and accounted for 9.6% of China's total international trade.[45] In 2013, Alibaba had an e-commerce market share of 80% in China.[46] In 2014, there were 600 million Internet users in China (twice as many as in the US), making it the world's biggest online market.[47] China is also the largest e-commerce market in the world by value of sales, with an estimated US$899 billion in 2016.[48]\nIn 2013, Brazil's e-commerce was growing quickly with retail e-commerce sales expected to grow at a double-digit pace through 2014. By 2016, eMarketer expected retail e-commerce sales in Brazil to reach $17.3 billion.[49] India has an Internet user base of about 243.2 million as of January 2014.[citation needed] Despite being third largest user base in world, the penetration of Internet is low compared to markets like the United States, United Kingdom or France but is growing at a much faster rate, adding around 6 million new entrants every month.[citation needed] In India, cash on delivery is the most preferred payment method, accumulating 75% of the e-retail activities.[citation needed]\nE-Commerce has become an important tool for small and large businesses worldwide, not only to sell to customers, but also to engage them.[50][51]\nIn 2012, ecommerce sales topped $1 trillion for the first time in history.[52]\nMobile devices are playing an increasing role in the mix of eCommerce, this is also commonly called mobile commerce, or m-commerce. In 2014, one estimate saw purchases made on mobile devices making up 25% of the market by 2017.[53]\nFor traditional businesses, one research stated that information technology and cross-border e-commerce is a good opportunity for the rapid development and growth of enterprises. Many companies have invested enormous volume of investment in mobile applications. The DeLone and McLean Model stated that three perspectives contribute to a successful e-business: information system quality, service quality and users' satisfaction.[54] There is no limit of time and space, there are more opportunities to reach out to customers around the world, and to cut down unnecessary intermediate links, thereby reducing the cost price, and can benefit from one on one large customer data analysis, to achieve a high degree of personal customization strategic plan, in order to fully enhance the core competitiveness of the products in company\nEconomists have theorized that e-commerce ought to lead to intensified price competition, as it increases consumers' ability to gather information about products and prices. Research by four economists at the University of Chicago has found that the growth of online shopping has also affected industry structure in two areas that have seen significant growth in e-commerce, bookshops and travel agencies. Generally, larger firms are able to use economies of scale and offer lower prices. The lone exception to this pattern has been the very smallest category of bookseller, shops with between one and four employees, which appear to have withstood the trend.[56] Depending on the category, e-commerce may shift the switching costs—procedural, relational, and financial—experienced by customers.[57]\nIndividual or business involved in e-commerce whether buyers or sellers rely on Internet-based technology in order to accomplish their transactions. E-commerce is recognized for its ability to allow business to communicate and to form transaction anytime and anyplace. Whether an individual is in the US or overseas, business can be conducted through the internet. The power of e-commerce allows geophysical barriers to disappear, making all consumers and businesses on earth potential customers and suppliers. Thus, switching barriers and switching costs may shift.[57] eBay is a good example of e-commerce business individuals and businesses are able to post their items and sell them around the Globe.[58]\nIn e-commerce activities, supply chain and logistics are two most crucial factors need to be considered. Typically, cross-border logistics need about few weeks time round[clarification needed]. Based on this low efficiency of the supply chain service, customer satisfaction will be greatly reduced.[59] Some researcher stated that combining e-commerce competence and IT setup could well enhance company's overall business worth.[60] Other researcher stated that e-commerce need to consider the establishment of warehouse centers in foreign countries, to create high efficiency of the logistics system, not only improve customers' satisfaction, but also can improve customers' loyalty.\nor a long time, companies had been troubled by the gap between the benefits which supply chain technology has and the solutions to deliver those benefits. However, the emergence of e-commerce has provided a more practical and effective way of delivering the benefits of the new supply chain technologies.[61]\nE-commerce has the capability to integrate all inter-company and intra-company functions, meaning that the three flows (physical flow, financial flow and information flow) of the supply chain could be also affected by e-commerce. The affections on physical flows improved the way of product and inventory movement level for companies. For the information flows, e-commerce optimised the capacity of information processing than companies used to have, and for the financial flows, e-commerce allows companies to have more efficient payment and settlement solutions.[61]\nIn addition, e-commerce has a more sophisticated level of impact on supply chains: Firstly, the performance gap will be eliminated since companies can identify gaps between different levels of supply chains by electronic means of solutions; Secondly, as a result of e-commerce emergence, new capabilities such implementing ERP systems, like SAP ERP, Xero, or Megaventory, have helped companies to manage operations with customers and suppliers. Yet these new capabilities are still not fully exploited. Thirdly, technology companies would keep investing on new e-commerce software solutions as they are expecting investment return. Fourthly, e-commerce would help to solve many aspects of issues that companies may feel difficult to cope with, such as political barriers or cross-country changes. Finally, e-commerce provides companies a more efficient and effective way to collaborate with each other within the supply chain.\nAlong with the e-commerce and its unique charm that has appeared gradually, virtual enterprise, virtual bank, network marketing, online shopping, payment and advertising, such this new vocabulary which is unheard-of and now has become as familiar to people. This reflects that the e-commerce has huge impact on the economy and society from the other side.[62] For instance, B2B is a rapidly growing business in the world that leads to lower cost and then improves the economic efficiency and also bring along the growth of employment.[63]\n    • To understand how the e-commerce has affected the society and economy, this article will mention six issues below:\n    • E-commerce has changed the relative importance of time, but as the pillars of indicator of the country's economic state that the importance of time should not be ignored.\n    • E-commerce offers the consumer or enterprise various information they need, making information into total transparency, and enterprises are no longer is able to use the mode of space or advertisement to raise their competitive edge.[64] Moreover, in theory, perfect competition between the consumer sovereignty and industry will maximize social welfare.[65][66]\n    • In fact, during the economic activity in the past, large enterprises frequently had the advantage of information resources at the expense of consumers. Nowadays, the transparent and real-time information protects the rights of consumers, because the consumers can use the internet to pick out the portfolio to their own benefit. The competitiveness of enterprises will be much more obvious than before; consequently, social welfare would be improved by the development of e-commerce.\n    • The new economy led by e-commerce changes humanistic spirit as well, but above all, employee loyalty.[67] Due to the market with competition, the employee's level of professionalism becomes crucial for enterprise in the niche market. The enterprises must pay attention to how to build up the enterprises inner culture and a set of interactive mechanisms and it is the prime problem for them. Furthermore, though the mode of e-commerce decreases the information cost and transaction cost, its development also makes human beings overly computer literate. Emphasizing a more humanistic attitude to work is another project for enterprise to development. Life is the root of all and technology is merely an assistive tool to support quality of life.\n    • Online merchants gather purchase activity and interests of their customers. This information is being used by the online marketers to promote relevant products and services. This creates an extra convenience for online shoppers.\n    • Online merchandise is searchable, which makes it more accessible to shoppers. Many online retailers offer a review mechanism, which helps shoppers decide on the product to purchase. This is another convenience and a satisfaction improvement factor.\nE-commerce is not a new industry, technically speaking, but it is creating a new economic model. Most people agree that e-commerce will positively impact economic society in the future, but in its early stages its impacts are difficult to gauge. Some have noted that e-commerce is a sort of incorporeal revolution.[68] E-commerce has numerous social benefits: one, the cost of running an e-commerce business is very low when compared with running a physical store; two, there is no rent to pay on expensive premises; and three, business processes are simplified and less man-hours are required to run a typical business smoothly. In the area of law, education, culture and also policy, e-commerce will continue to rise in impact. E-commerce will truly take human beings into the information society.\n• Purchasing supplies – By creating an online account for your business with supply stores you can purchase office supplies and equipment online and save time and money by automating the purchasing process. • Purchasing direct materials – These are materials that go into the production or manufacturing of your products. Establishing a relationship with a vendor and purchasing online may help reduce costs. • Selling products or services to new vendors – Having an online e-commerce presence opens up more opportunities to extend your reach and gather new vendors beyond your bricks and mortar offerings. • Leveraging your existing web presence – If you already have B2C operations, you can extend them to business clientele – perhaps by providing private areas for special pricing, delivery options, etc. However, this additional functionality is not trivial and could require rebuilding your online store at a significant cost.\nManagement Information Systems (MIS) The information systems department is usually responsible for the deployment of ECommerce. This discipline covers issues ranging from systems analysis to system integration, not to mention planning, implementation, security, and payment systems, among others. 12 Accounting and Auditing The back-office operations of electronic transactions are similar to other transactions in some respects, but different in others. For example, auditing electronic transactions presents a challenge for the accounting profession; so does the development of methodologies for .cost-benefit justification. \nManagement Electronic commerce efforts need to be managed properly, and because of the interdisciplinary nature of E-Commerce, its management may require new approaches and theories. Business Law and Ethics Legal and ethical issues are extremely important in E-Commerce, especially in a global market. A large number of legislative bills are pending, and many ethical issues are interrelated with legal ones, such as privacy and intellectual property. Others Several other disciplines are involved in various aspects of E-Commerce to a lesser extent- for example, linguistics (translation in international trades), robotics and sensory systems, operations research / management science, statistics, and public policy and administration. Also, E-Commerce is of Interest to engineering, health care,\nE-business is the process of conducting business on the Internet. Its scope includes not only buying and selling but also services, fulfilling the needs of customers and collaborating with business partners. Business to business e-commerce is smart business. The opportunity for business to business e-commerce is even greater. A wholesaler may sell products to the retailer. There are advanced e-commerce software which support multi-tier pricing. This helps to set up online stores to offer preferred pricing to some vendors and shared price to others. This includes internet-enabled initiatives of an enterprise to form commercial linkages with another enterprise, dealer, warehouse or manufacturer. In this form of e-commerce, e paperwork and time-to-market get vastly reduced. Throughout the world, this ecommerce mode is the biggest.\n In a B2B transaction, the interaction is between businesses. For example, a website that is catching for the steel industry might have facility for buyers and sellers to list their requirements and post their products. It helps them in quickly closing the transactions and the buyer can get quality, material and can choose from different suppliers. 14 B2B commerce is a growing business in the e-commerce arena- with the increasing use of the internet, more and more business are realizing the commercial advantage of giving business clients a streamlined and easy manner to order products or service online. It facilitates access to the ordering process to only those with whom a concern has a commercial relationship. Business to Business e-commerce provides small and medium enterprises (SMES) with an excellent opportunity to access new markets, improve customer service and reduce costs. And while hurdles exist, they should be viewed more as speed breakers rather than road barriers. \n\nAs a medium of information storage and dissemination, the internet has and is emerging a clear winner. Its rate of penetration has far outpaced the growth of other popular media such as newspaper, radio and television.\nB2B transactions are however relatively high value in nature and organisations are slow to change their traditional systems for the supply chain management. The reasons for the growth in B2B e-commerce are many. In an increasing competitive scenario, e-commerce offers highly attractive cost saving options. The shift to this process is often driven by the needs of buyers. Innovative methods of enhancing B2B and B2C levels of e-commerce include • Kiosks placed at physical store locations or in shopping malls to introduce users to the easy online ordering options.\n • Extranets to link businesses together that conduct regular business to .business transactions and B2B transactions are however relatively high value in nature and organizations are slow to change their traditional systems for the supply chain management.

Innovative methods of enhancing B2B and B2C levels of e-commerce include\n • Kiosks placed at physical store locations or in shopping malls to introduce users to the easy online ordering options. • Extranets to link businesses together that conduct regular business to .business transactions and • Affiliate programmers to drive business to your commerce site from other content related sites. B2B e-commerce is expected to be the largest mode of transacting e-business and is a global phenomenon. It involves taking internet enabled initiatives to form commercial links with other enterprises, dealers or manufacturers. In this form of e-commerce, a business firm places orders for supplies with another business firms directly over the Internet. Paperwork and time required for processing the order and delivery of the goods are thus reduced to a great extent.\nB2C e-commerce involves selling of goods and services to consumers or end users. It allows them to browse the product catalogue, select products or services and complete the order online. In a B2C transaction, the interaction is between a consumer and the preferred business. For example, the most popular site is amazon.com, which is the first online bookseller which has proved a potential competitor to the traditional bricks and mortar booksellers such as Barrens and Noble. In this category of e-commerce, businesses use the internet to offer to consumers sales and services around the world 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year, The sites Amazon, Rediff and Uphar are among those belonging to this category. These websites are meant for selling goods directly to consumers through the internet. The two-way accessibility of the internet enables operating companies to directly ascertain customer preference and buying trends. Businesses are using these consumer insights to formulate marketing strategies and offer to the customers what they want and when they 16 want. E-business in this mode significantly reduces the costs associated with intermediaries, service centres and mass marketing campaigns. Since e-commerce makes just in time delivery possible, the supplier does not have to store the goods. He can procure them from the suppliers as and when he gets the order from the buyer through the internet.\nB2C is the most popular form of e-commerce, wherein the individuals are directly involved in B2C e-commerce, and businesses use the internet for offering their products or services 24 hours a day through global access. The sites Amazon.com and Rediff are among these. These websites spell goods directly to consumers over the Internet. The two way accessibility feature of the internet enables operating companies to ascertain consumer preferences and buying trends directly\nExisting Solution:\n    • This system helps in enhancing our traditional handmade products to publish in the market.\n    • The system helps buyers to search the product in their figure tips.\n    • It provides the easy way to buy the product directly from the merchants without the interface of any third party.\n    • It also helps the rural people to sell their products to the market and to earn money to improve their status.\n\nProposed Solution:\t\n    • In the proposed system we tried to provide the high security than the existing system.\n    • Try to make the rural people to feel to fill the description about their products.\n    • We will provide friendlier environment than the existing one\n\n\n\n OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nHere going to participate too actors.

So it is very difficult for both  gym members to keep all the paper receipts safely and to gym trainer to keep reminding for the fee receipts.Sometimes it creates a trouble when members lost their receipts.The other problem that can be faced by a gym owner is that if he/she wants to inform any message related to working or non working days of gym, manually sending message become difficult .  If there is online application available these problems can be solved.\n\tSo, I am developing an android application to overcome some of these issues. So this project can be helpful for both gym owner as well as for gym members. In this application all receipts are  store in a digital format, so there are no issues of loosing any confidencial receipts.This application will also notify the user(gym members) about their fees and also notifies the gym owner about the payment clearence.This application in future can be  elaborated by providing supplement store , diet  information, personal training etc.\n\n\n INTRODUCTION\nThe Gym Management requires a system that will handle all the\nnecessary and minute details easily and proper database security\naccordingly to the user. They requires software, which will store data\nabout members, employees, products, payroll, receipts of members etc\n& all transactions that occur in Gym and lock-up with graphical user\ninterface(GUI).\nWe have done a project on Gym Management and database\nmanagement and transactions. This system is proposed to be an\nautomate database management & transactions. This stores employee,\nmember, payroll, receipts, and products information. It also provides\nthe facility of search & advanced search for searching the records\nefficiently & immediately. This system provides data storing & report\ngeneration with graphical user interface (GUI).\nWe all know health is a wealth. We do not need a fancy car, big apartment, a doctor degree without a health. Being healthy is a first thing we need to keep in mind. Because most of time our attitude depends on how we feel. Being healthy and fit gives us energy todo anything. Physical fitness is very necessary for a healthy and tension free life. Physical fitnessincludes diet, exercise and sleep. These three basic things have their own importance in each individual's life and everyone should be sensible with regard to these for a healthy life.\nIt is always necessary to study and recognize the problems of existing\nsystem, which will help in finding out the requirements for the new\nsystem. System study helps in finding different alternatives for better\nsolution.\nThe project study basically deals with different operations and steps\ninvolved in generation of examination mark sheets. Ti includes:\n1. Data gathering\n2. Study of existing system\n3. Analyzing problem\n4. Studying various documents\n5. Feasibility study for further improvements\nFollowing are the steps taken during the initial study:\nInitially, we collected all the information, which they wanted to store.\nThen we studied the working of the current system which is done\nmanually. We noted the limitation of that system which motivated\nthem to have new system.\nWith the help of these documents we got basic ideas about the system\nas well as input output of the developed system.\nThe most important thing is to study system thoroughly.\nHere we are studying both existing system and proposed system so\nthat advantages & disadvantages of both the systems can be\nunderstood\nThe first task was identifying how system can be computerized. Some\nanalysis and projections was done regarding changes to be made to\nthe existing system.\nThe new developed system for Gym Management is simple without\ncomplexities.\t\n      \n\n\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\nAs modernizing is taking over all the systems and digitalizing helps them improve in so many particular ways. The Gym Management System is one of the systems which helps the administration in speeding up the tasks at the same time reducing the complexity.\n\nThe purpose or objective of this system is to digitalize and create an automated system. The system will perform the task like adding the new member to the gym, Removing the member or keeping the payments records and other stuff required in managing the gym properly.\nThe present scenario in the gyms is that the records are kept by writing in a file on the paper. Every management task is done manually. This creates a system unreliable and confusing to keep the correct track of the records.\nThe maintenance of the system like this is hardly required until it needs to change any part of the system. The information about the various things contained in the system are like members, trainers, equipment can get by just a few clicks unlike the paper documents required the serious reading for such information.\nIt helps in creating the various batch according to their preference or if they want a particular trainer. It made easy to generate the reports of various operations performed in the gym are like paying the fee it can be stored and later evaluated and get the list of members who did not pay the fee.\nIt also helps the users in reducing the carbon footprint as the amount of paper used in company reduces.\nThis also helps in keeping the standard width of the management system as if there is a case where the administration involves more than one person to manage the gym.\nThis system does not only limit itself to the administration and but also helps the members of the gym. The members can have options like attendance and fee payment change batch request etc.\nThis will improve the transparency between the members which is always a good quality in the system. It will also give the layer of security to the administration and the users that only authorized users can access by their credentials.\nSome major takeaways:\nOnline registration of the member\nIssuing the timetable of batch on system\nIncrease transparency between stakeholders\nEasy payment options\nStandardization of the system\n2.1Existing Solution:\n\t\nIn gym management system, after the planning and analysis phase of the system gets completed. Then the next phase required to transform the collected required system information into structural blueprint which will serve as a reference while constructing the working system.\nIt is a phase when most of the risks and error unveiled so it’s is good practices to take care of this thing from the start.\nThis is a fully fledged system which will be the backbone of the while management of the gym so ignoring the risk or error is not an option as later it can make a greater form of itself.\nSo, it is better to minimize the problems faced by both staff and the manager in the Organization. Let’s discuss the system in detail:\nThe gym is working manually. The current system is time consuming\nand also it is very costly, because it involves a lot of paperwork. To\nmanually handle the system was very difficult task. But now-a-days\ncomputerization made easy to work.\nThe following are the reasons why the current system should be\ncomputerized:\n To increase efficiency with reduced cost.\n To reduce the burden of paper work.\n To save time management for recording details of each and\nevery member and employee.\n To generate required reports easily.\nDisadvantage of existing system:\n Time consumption:\nAs the records are to be manually maintained it consumes a lot of\ntime.\n Paper work:\nLot of paper work is involved as the records are maintained in the\nfiles & registers\n Storage requirements:\nAs files and registers are used the storage space requirement is\nincreased.\n Less reliable:\nUse of papers for storing valuable data information is not at all\nreliable.\n Accuracy:\nAs the system is in manual there are lot many chances of human errors. These can cause errors in calculating mechanism or maintaining customer details.\n Difficulty in keeping new records:\nIt is difficult for keeping all the new entries of members, their account and transaction details.\n\t\n\n\n Proposed Solution:\t\nThe proposed system is managed by the visual basic 6.0, which are\nuser friendly windows for every user and for maintaining the\ndatabase Microsoft access is used.\nScope of proposed system:\nThe system proposed has many advantages.\n1. The proposed system is highly secured, because for login the system it requires the username and password which is different for each department therefore providing each department a different view of the customer information.\n2. It provides wide range of certain criteria in each window the client is working for better and quicker solution. \n3. It maintains report for all criteria and transactions.\n 4. Manages member information separately for all bill information separately for considering the requirement of gym.\n5. Stores information about regular products.\n6. Diet recommendation \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n Module Description\nThe system after careful analysis has been identified to be presented with the following modules User, Administrator .\nUser\n    • Login – Once they have registered they need to login to avail the service at the needy time.\n    • View Details – Logging in with the application will provide you the lists of bill reciepts and notification of the package.\n    • Search records– So that the users can search the bill history\n\nAdmin\n    • Login – Registered admin can login their accounts \n    • Register Member– At first every member has to register their details with the admin.\n    • Create/Manage Bill details – Here bill details have to post their details like name, id, package, amount, payed, services, due date, etc.\n    • Manage Customer – Admin can view the customer details. \n    • Manage Diet – Admin can recomend the diet details. \n    • Manage Supplement Store – Admin can manage the supplement store for the gym. \n\n System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase.

In the existing system finding the criminal and identify the background data is diffcuilt, which leads to time taking process and lack of accurcy. The proposed mobile applications contains criminal details such as name, case no, photo and etc. Police shall search using face recognition and other details easily through mobile. This research proposes an unobtrusive means of acquiring and recording shoeprints of anyone who enters the safe room. \n\n\n– INTRODUCTION\nOver the years, a lot of security approaches have been developed that help in keeping confidential data secured and limiting the chances of a security breach. Face recognition which is one of the few biometric methods that possess the merits of both high accuracy and low intrusiveness is a computer program that uses a person’s face to automatically identify and verify the person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source [1, 2, 3]. It compares selected facial features from the image and a face database or it can also be a hardware which used to authenticate a person. This technology is a widely used biometrics system for authentication, authorization, verification and identification. A lot of company has been using face recognition in their security cameras, access controls and many more. Facebook has been using face recognition in their website for the purpose of creating a digital profile for the people using their website. In developed countries, the law enforcement create face database to be used with their face recognition system to compare any suspect with the database. In other hand, in Malaysia, most cases are investigated by using thumbprint identification to identify any suspect for the case. However, because of unlimited knowledge through internet usage, most criminals are aware of thumbprint identification. Therefore, they become more cautious of leaving thumbprint by wearing gloves except for non-premeditated crimes. This paper to propose a facial recognition system for a criminal database where the identification of the suspect is done by face matched rather than thumbprint matched.\n\n        1.1 Objectives\n    1) Detection &conviction of criminals by ecriminal Identification Using Face Matching Based Mobile App\n    2) Computerize the attempt of taking complaints and records and establishing a communication gateway among other police stations\n    3) Transfering the cases or compalints to appropriate police stations by its id & locality\n    4) Update the case details timely to ensure that fast action strategy is applied\n    5) Provide the flexiblity to victims to register a company at any police station nearest, neverthless the locality of crime.\n    6) Provide a complaint id to victims to track their complaint details timely.\n\n\n\n2.1 Existing Solution:\n    • It need employment as the human efforts.\n    • In existing system works on manual process which is a time taking process and data organizing is not efficient. \n2.2 Proposed Solution:\t\n    • Police can easily search the crime details from remote using app\n    • Can upload the photo and identify the crime details\n    • The system allows automate management system. \n    • Allows for faster information updates.\n\nOVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\necriminal Identification Using Face Matching Based Mobile App consists of two generally independent systems. The first is a regular web application, which provides a number of web pages containing documents, pictures and other materials that have been picked up from every medium as a summarization can be accessed through mobile browsers of the clients. After becoming registered members, the client users can also upload and maintain their personal information, receive customized information, and participate in forum discussions.\n\nSystem Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase.

Here we provide a mobile application for ‘Bike Service System’. This application is an android app which can be run on any android compatible tablets and mobile phones. The app will enable any bike user to search and communicate with any bike service center in the vicinity. The user can find the service center, get its location and check and select any of the services provided by the respective service center. The user can send request for pick and drop, appointment for servicing, test drive as well as accessories purchase to the dealer. The dealer processes these requests and gives a response back to the user through push messages. This app also enables the user to set alarms for next servicing date, payment of insurance installment, etc. The app is provided with an extra feature of EMI calculator too. Thus we are developing an application which goes hand in hand with the new age technology and characterizes – user friendliness, in formativeness and time saving.\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qgg_Gv4Jh7A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nCHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION\nInternet tends to be the backbone of all the technologies.

They are written by VCMA professional staff in response to a demonstrated need for summary information. They may also include attention to the issue’s legislative, legal, economic, ethical, and social components, as well as implications for veterinary practice. VCMA literature reviews are not VCMA policy, and generally do not draw conclusions; they simply report what we know from the literature or other verifiable data about a given topic. Peer-reviewers for VCMA literature reviews are selected by staff from among recognized experts in their field, after reviewing related peer-reviewed published works and seeking input from those working on the topic of interest. Recognizing that even science is not value-free, in addition to ensuring we involve the needed experts, we attempt to be comprehensive and inclusive with respect to reviewers’ backgrounds and perspectives when soliciting comments. Peer-review for literature reviews is similar to peer-review used for publication of articles in scientific and other professional journals.\nVCMA welcomes new information that will improve the content of its literature reviews.

This paper reports a service oriented system, called Rescue Wings, for providing emergency support to sufferers and rescuers in disasters. The system utilizes mobile services to acquire real-time information about the users and environment, and constructs service agents (servants) to provide active services for mobile users. To perform their functions, the servants frequently invoke a set of intelligent services of Rescue Wings, which can further access a number of public services from government and other public organizations. We identify the most frequent request sequence patterns (FRSP) of Rescue Wings, and develop a new bio-inspired algorithm for efficiently scheduling the requests to minimize the response delay. The system has been tested in several disaster rescue drills, and has been successfully applied to the 2013 Ya’an Earthquake in Southeast China.\t\n\nCHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION\nWE are now facing increasing threats from natural and man-made disasters. In order to effectively plan and implement disaster rescue operations, first responders have to obtain as much detailed information as possible about population dynamics, paying special attention to special groups such as children, the elderly, and the disabled. It is also expected that disaster and evacuation information should be transmitted to the affected population in a timely and accurate manner, which can have an enormous effect in saving lives and reducing damage. While the importance of customized and intelligent services for assisting the population in emergencies has always been recognized [1]–[4], challenges surrounding the design, deployment, management and integration of such a system have prevented its emergence and/or wide applications.\n\nIn the last three years, we have been working on the construction of a service-oriented system for providing emergency support to both responders and the stricken population in disaster rescue operations. The project, named Rescue Wings, is conducted mainly upon a combination of two emerging paradigms: mobile computing and cloud computing. On the one hand, the portability and ease of information storage and diss-emination has enabled mobile devices to become one of the most viable means of communication with the population [5], and recent trends in mobile computing have motivated interest in accessing web services from mobile devices in order to extend their functionality and gain access to remote data [6]. On the other hand, cloud computing technologies enable configuring, scheduling, and coordination of shared resources via virtualization, and thus greatly facilitate communication between a broad range of public and private entities.\n\nExisting Definition\n    • Its manual process for earlier system.\n    • Its more time consume for all process.\n    • Need for more resources.\n    • Its chance to lose our life.\n\nProposed Solution:\n    • The query will be sent immediately.\n    • After view admin for this query post solution for escape details also.\n    • User can registered their account and post their queries for disaster time.\n    • Public can also post their queries and view solution for rescue without register and login.\n\nSystem Modules:\n    • ADMIN\n    • Login\n    • View Disaster Queries\n    • Post Solution\n    • USER\n    • Register\n    • Login\n    • Post Query\n    • View solution\n  \n    • PUBLIC\n    • Post Query\n    • View solution\n\nMODULES:\t\n    • ADMIN:\n    • Login:\n\t\tAdmin can login this system after they can view home page.\n    • View Query Disaster:\n\t\tAdmin enters this system and view user and public post their query details\n    • Post solution:\n\t\tAdmin can only post solution for public and user queries.\n    • USER:\n    • Register:\n\t\tUser enters this system and register with own details.\n    • Login:\n\t\tUser can login this system after they can view home page.\n    • Post Query:\n\t\tUser can login this system after they can post their own queries about escape of this situation.\n    • View solution:\n\t\tUser can login this system after they can view solution.\n\n\n\n\nUse case Diagrams:\t\n\n\n\n\n\nSequence Diagram:\n\n Collaboration Diagram:\n",

        "content": "Lost Debit Card ATM Card Management System\nAbstract\n\nAuthentication require two or more factors: “something only the user knows”, “something only the user has” and “something only the user is”. The factors must be validated by the other party for validation to occur. In debit cards authentication mechanisms which can be easily cracked using different mechanisms. According to US attorney report at least 7,000 fake identities are used to obtain more than 25,000 credit cards and documented $200 million in losses, but the figure could rise. The present authentication mechanisms use mechanism where we enter our PIN in pos (point of sale) devices where it is vulnerable in case if we have any skimmer devices installed in any one of the component. Sometimes we have to enter OTP (one time password) in card reader, but it’s vulnerable in case of lost or theft of both mobile and card together. In proposed method, GSM mobile service is used provide the security. Lost Debit Card ATM Card Management System When the Debit card is used, Server will request user to enter a password in his/her mobile phone. If the password valid, Server precedes the transaction, if not so, denies it. The proposed solution effectively prevents clone cards and relay attacks on Debit cards using mobile phone authentication through the flash message service. The proposed solution effectively prevents clone cards and relay attacks on Debit cards using mobile phone authentication through the flash message service. This methodology can be implemented with the current system.\n\n\nLost Debit Card ATM Card Management System\n\n\n\n\nObjectives\nThis web application will provide the ATM CARD for Customer. Customer can register and select the lost and stolen debit card, credit cards get sms from another customer give. Customer can view the alert sms immediately. Admin can manage the whole process.\n\nExisting Solution:\n\nFor some debit cards, we do not have any security mechanisms; we just swipe those cards and make the transaction. This system is highly vulnerable for all attacks, now a days security is added to these cards that we have to enter the PIN in card reader, but its vulnerable to relay attack which makes duplicate transactions and may leads the cards to be skimmed when they are swiped on malicious, For few other cards, we have to enter OTP in card reader, but it’s vulnerable in case of lost or theft of both mobile and card together.\n\nProposed Solution:      \n\nIn proposed method, flash message mobile service is used provide the security. When the Debit card is swiped at terminal, the transaction information send to visa server through acquirer bank and with an authentication normal procedures. Visa server will request user to enter a password in his/her mobile phone through the mobile network. If the password is valid, Server proceed the transaction towards the card holder bank and checks availability of required amount then flow of the transaction is as usual, if the password is not valid, server denies the transaction and lets the merchant and user to know that the transaction is denied. So this method can resolve three drawbacks in existing system first case if a card is cloned and swiped at some terminal, anyway the request for password to original owner of the card, he/she can know this transaction is not done by them and they can decline the transaction.\n\nSecond case, if relay attack happens in a transaction, the user will be requested for password to perform a parallel transaction also, so he/she can avoid duplicate transaction. In third case, if the mobile phone and card are lost together, no one can make any transaction because the password is not known to anyone other than original user\n\nModule Description\n.USER REGISTRATION\n\nThis module is used to create a user registrationsform.After registering application form the users able to enter into process. To register the form following details should be given by the user, the details that should be filled by the user is their personal details and the required details by the bank i.e. the card number, pin code, secret password, account type account branch etc. Then only the users allowed entering the server. Once they activate their account, they are allowed to access their user id.\n\nSERVER\n\nThe particular server will certainly monitor the complete User’s data inside their data source along with verify all of them if expected. Additionally the server will certainly shop the complete User’s data inside their data source. Additionally the server has to establish the connection to be able to get in touch with the users. The particular server will certainly bring up to date the each and every users activities with it is data source. The particular server will certainly authenticate each and every individual previous to many people admittance the application. So that the server will certainly stop the unauthorized individual coming from being able to view the application.\n\nLOCATION TRACKING\n\nIn this module, we track the location of the user access. Every time we monitor the location of the system that they are accessing. The user will frequently use the same location to access the location. So that we can monitor the User usage. This will increase the security level. Also the server stores this information in the database.\n\nACCESS TIME TAKEN AND AVERAGE AMOUNT\n\nHere we will monitor the access information of the users. The server will monitor the user’s access information along with the time taken to access the ATM. So that based on the Time of usage and amount withdrawn by the users will be stored in the database. So that we may able to retrieve the usage time and amount withdrawn by the users.\n\nSEQUENCE OF USAGE\n\nWe also track the usage sequence of each and every user. [4]So that we may able to track the users access details. The system will recognize the users usage sequence. For an example if the users are login into their account and they check their balance and then proceed to withdraw the cash from their respective account.\n\nOTP GENERATION AND SECURITY\n\nThe server will check the above mentioned details and generate an One Time Password if these details are varies. This One Time Password will be send to the users mobile number. So that the user is requested to enter their One Time Password and that will be verified by the Server, then only they are allowed to access to the system. To generate the One Time Password, we are using a Secure Random Number Generation algorithm. To generate the SMS to User mobile number we are using JSMS. Jar file which is used to send the SMS from the Server system to external device will transmit the SMS to the Concerned User‟s Mobile Number. In very rare cases we handle a difficulty about the coverage of mobile network is nil, so at that time we use security question as an alternative to access the ATM.\n\nSystem Features\n\nThis section gives a functional requirement that applicable to the On-Line ATM cards system.\n\nThere are two sub modules in this phase.\n\nCustomer module.\n\nAdministrator module.\n\nSystem Modules:\n\n Administrator:\n\nThe administrator has the full-fledged rights over the OES.\nCan create/delete an account.\nCan view the accounts.\nCan change the password.\nCan hide any kind of features from the both of users.\nInsert/delete/edit the information of available on OES.\nCan access all the accounts of the customer.\n\n \n\nUser:\n\nRegister\nCan change password.\nCan view their Account.\nCan view the sms alert.\nCan view and modify its profile but can modify it to some limited range.\nUsecase Diagrams:\n\nUse case diagrams model behavior within a system and helps the developers understand of what the user require. The stick man represents what’s called an actor. Use case diagram can be useful for getting an overall view of the system and clarifying who can do and more importantly what they can’t do.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/omale-godwin/gatsby-no-cms/master/src/images/atm-1%20(1).png\n\n\nhttps://github.com/omale-godwin/gatsby-no-cms/blob/master/src/images/atm-2.png?raw=true\n",

The concept of social exclusion was introduced in France in 1974 to explain the deprivation experienced by those who were unable to access social protection which, at the time, was available only to employed persons and their families (Peace 2001). Estimates indicated at the time, that approximately 10% of the population in France was excluded. These groups included homeless people, drug addicts, handicapped people, single parents, abused children, and households experiencing multiple problems (Peace 2001; Sen 2000). These aforementioned groups often faced barriers to employment and also experienced isolation from family and, as a result, they also lacked access to state support. The outcome was extreme deprivation, poverty, and social isolation. The fact that so many were afflicted, presented problems of social cohesion and economic prosperity for society as a whole.\n\n        1.1 Objectives\nSystem sends SMS to selected workers regarding work and customer details. A worker confirms either through phone or this system and either fixed up meeting or work start date. Organized sector user or general public can rate worker skill, charges, particularity about time, dedication, behavior, habits etc through this system.\n\n\n– LITERATURE REVIEW\t\nThe literature in this context refers to published scholarly work. For instance, scientific scholarly literature includes journal articles, conference proceedings, technical reports and books. A “literature review” reviews the scholarly literature on a specific topic by summarizing and analyzing published work on that topic. A literature review has several purposes:  to evaluate the state of research on a topic to familiarize readers and students with what has already been done in the field  to suggest future research directions or gaps in knowledge Green, Johnson and Adams describe a literature review as a type of research article published in a professional peer-reviewed journal. The purpose of a literature review is to objectively report the current knowledge on a topic and base this summary on previously published research. A literature review provides the reader with a comprehensive overview and helps place that information into perspective. 1 Most research articles include a section that reviews previous work, but this is not as comprehensive as an article-length literature review. A literature review does not include new, unpublished research results.\nIn an article database, search for the keywords “literature review” or “review” (in title or topic) in addition to your topic keywords  Some article databases have “reviews” coded as a separate article format. For example, Web of Science lists “reviews” under document type. Do a topic search, then click this box to refine to only review articles. In some databases (such as BIOSIS) this is called literature type. Pubmed includes Review as a filter under “type of article”. In PyscINFO, include “literature review” as a methodology.  You will still need to look at the papers you find to determine if they are truly literature reviews. Access the full-text of the paper (using the orange UC eLinks button) and read the first page or two. If it reports original research results, it’s not a review article. Most reviews explicitly state that they are reviewing the literature in the abstract or first paragraphs, or use the phrase “We review recent studies” or similar. Review articles also typically cite dozens of other papers in their quest to be comprehensive, so their bibliography sections are longer than usual.  Don’t forget to search review journals – try Annual Reviews (http://www.annualreviews.org).  Remember not all specific topics have review papers already published on them – you may need to broaden your keywords (by using fewer or less specific terms) to find a review of your subject.\n\n Existing Solution:\nThe users or companies have to trace the information about the workers and contractors manually by using news papers or advertisements or through Google search given by the corresponding people. This process has to be done separately for specific skilled worker. A particular skilled worker who is efficient and dedicated is difficult to find. To know worker skills, semi skills and performance is difficult to trace. Contractor also has difficulty to join a worker in their organization without knowing anything about the worker.\nProposed Solution:\t\nThe proposed system provides an application where all types of workers, organizational sectors, companies can use the system to satisfy their requirements. \n\n\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nBy using contact information of worker, general public can communicate with workers from home only.

        "content": "Evaluating Retailers in a Smart-buying Environment\nusing Smart City Infrastructures\nAbstract—In modern cities, most citizens are interested in buying from e-shops or mostly buy from large shopping brands. This is a challenge for small and medium-sized retailers, who cannot afford to maintain IT infrastructures and skills. The ongoing R&D project SMARTBUY, tries to close this gap by providing a platform for small and medium-sized retailers to become the place where they can easily make their products and promotions visible online for local audiences, along with a mobile application for customers. An important issue in this context is the evaluation of the retailers. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation application for assessing the quality of the retailer  services. Customers have the chance to rate the behavior and the offers that the retailers provide to them. This evaluation service is based on the SMARTBUY platform and is developed upon the OrganiCity Experimentation Platform. The evaluation application is a novel approach to generate knowledge for the retailer shops inside a future city using both data from open city datasets as well as feedback from citizens. Such an application is deemed useful to both customers, to identify retailers with best offers and services, and retailers as an incentive to improve their\nservices.\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uNqTogcZqnI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nExisting System\n    • The small and medium-sized retailers, who cannot afford to maintain IT infrastructures and skills.\n    • Only E com site and company will have online sales \n    • Visibilty on Small retailer are low in online. \n\nProposed System\nA recent R&D effort through the SMARTBUY project aims to narrow this gap between small and medium-sized\nretailers and their customers using technological infrastructures.

The concept of social exclusion was introduced in France in 1974 to explain the deprivation experienced by those who were unable to access social protection which, at the time, was available only to employed persons and their families (Peace 2001). Estimates indicated at the time, that approximately 10% of the population in France was excluded. These groups included homeless people, drug addicts, handicapped people, single parents, abused children, and households experiencing multiple problems (Peace 2001; Sen 2000). These aforementioned groups often faced barriers to employment and also experienced isolation from family and, as a result, they also lacked access to state support. The outcome was extreme deprivation, poverty, and social isolation. The fact that so many were afflicted, presented problems of social cohesion and economic prosperity for society as a whole.\n\n        1.1 Objectives\nSystem sends SMS to selected workers regarding work and customer details. A worker confirms either through phone or this system and either fixed up meeting or work start date. Organized sector user or general public can rate worker skill, charges, particularity about time, dedication, behavior, habits etc through this system.\n\n\n LITERATURE REVIEW\t\nThe literature in this context refers to published scholarly work. For instance, scientific scholarly literature includes journal articles, conference proceedings, technical reports and books. A “literature review” reviews the scholarly literature on a specific topic by summarizing and analyzing published work on that topic. A literature review has several purposes:  to evaluate the state of research on a topic to familiarize readers and students with what has already been done in the field  to suggest future research directions or gaps in knowledge Green, Johnson and Adams describe a literature review as a type of research article published in a professional peer-reviewed journal. The purpose of a literature review is to objectively report the current knowledge on a topic and base this summary on previously published research. A literature review provides the reader with a comprehensive overview and helps place that information into perspective. 1 Most research articles include a section that reviews previous work, but this is not as comprehensive as an article-length literature review. A literature review does not include new, unpublished research results.\nIn an article database, search for the keywords “literature review” or “review” (in title or topic) in addition to your topic keywords  Some article databases have “reviews” coded as a separate article format. For example, Web of Science lists “reviews” under document type. Do a topic search, then click this box to refine to only review articles. In some databases (such as BIOSIS) this is called literature type. Pubmed includes Review as a filter under “type of article”. In PyscINFO, include “literature review” as a methodology.  You will still need to look at the papers you find to determine if they are truly literature reviews. Access the full-text of the paper (using the orange UC eLinks button) and read the first page or two. If it reports original research results, it’s not a review article. Most reviews explicitly state that they are reviewing the literature in the abstract or first paragraphs, or use the phrase “We review recent studies” or similar. Review articles also typically cite dozens of other papers in their quest to be comprehensive, so their bibliography sections are longer than usual.  Don’t forget to search review journals – try Annual Reviews (http://www.annualreviews.org).  Remember not all specific topics have review papers already published on them – you may need to broaden your keywords (by using fewer or less specific terms) to find a review of your subject.\n\n Existing Solution:\nThe users or companies have to trace the information about the workers and contractors manually by using news papers or advertisements or through Google search given by the corresponding people. This process has to be done separately for specific skilled worker. A particular skilled worker who is efficient and dedicated is difficult to find. To know worker skills, semi skills and performance is difficult to trace. Contractor also has difficulty to join a worker in their organization without knowing anything about the worker.\nProposed Solution:\t\nThe proposed system provides an application where all types of workers, organizational sectors, companies can use the system to satisfy their requirements. \n\n\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nBy using contact information of worker, general public can communicate with workers from home only. Communication is possible among the workers, general public, contractors, and administrator.\n3.2 System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase. The problem is analyzed so that sufficient matter is provided to design a new system. Large problems are sub-divided into smaller once to make them understandable and easy for finding solutions.

Lovelin Auguskani, V. Sree Devi, A. Darwin Jose Raju, J. M. Jerlin Priya, M. Marsaline Beno - The present study aims to reduce threats of complaints in Handloom industry to the use of grievances handling mechanism. The grievance means any dissatisfaction whether expressed or not that an employee thinks, believes are the symptoms of conflict in the enterprise are to be found out. The grievance handling mechanism is used the dealing with the complaints of employees working in industries whether they are affected individuals or an organization. Risk is a concept that denotes a potential negative impact of value that may arise from a future event. Handloom industries follow the logical application of policies, dealings, practices to identifying analyzing and monitoring the risk. The grievances handling mechanism helps to reduce the loss of likelihood. Hypothesis tested used for effectiveness of grievance handling process and employees relations with the management to reduce the risk management.\n\nSanam Kazi, Sadiya Ansari, Mahvash Momin, Abbas Damarwala - The population of India is currently 1.34 billion, as the population is increasing the different complains/grievances are also increasing but unfortunately the common people don't have a proper platform to lodge their complains. In our day to day life we encounter many problems and we feel like there should be a government recognized platform to express and lodge our problems of any type we encounter. We have some apps now but for a particular domain like only road related problems or customer care services etc and these are also not so user friendly. They follow of the traditional system for accepting the grievances. There is not a common government recognized platform for putting up all types of grievances and a proper communication link between citizens and their locally elected member. Hence we have proposed a smart application to put up the grievances in text, image or video format. The location of the user will be tracked. The locally elected authority will in turn see the list of problems in his/her locality based on the domain i.e. type and count of problems. The major serious issues can be further passed on to the higher authority. The application will also consist of the a `Serve India' module in which the citizens who want to do some selfless service for the nation can register for providing free service to the nation and in response the concerned authority will deploy them to work for creating awareness about smart digital India in rural and other backward areas of the country.\nAdriana Giret - This paper presents the specification of an agent-based framework for conflict resolution into Open Multi-agent Systems by means of grievance protocols. In this framework, any grievance process primarily involves negotiation (with or without mediation) and arbitration or a combination of both. In this way, the result of a conflict resolution can be an agreement among the conflicting parties by which they voluntary settle the conflict, or a decision from the arbitrator (a neutral third party) which is final, and binding on both conflicting parties. The framework is designed in such a way that multiple agreement mechanisms may be available at any given time, to be activated and adjusted on demand (on-line) by participating agents. The framework is also generic enough so that new protocols may be easily added. The objective is to have a generic electronic institution that may be tailored to specific needs and grafted into other electronic institutions.\n\nAbhishek Naik, Apurva Saksena, Kumaresan Mudliar, Ayesha Kazi, Prerna Sukhija, Renuka Pawar - The more traditional approach towards launching a complaint is through written complaints that would be dropped into the complaint boxes available in some sectors, which has a lot of problems associated with it such as loss of complaints, security issues, etc. The proposed model that is structured towards replacement of this approach is an online complaint bot that would accept complaints through the onion routing algorithm. This would indeed secure complainant's identity and the bot would also use NLP to prioritize the complaints based on keywords. It would also direct it towards concerned authorities with a timestamp associated with each complaint and this complaint would have an id being sent back to the complainant for tracking of the issue on an online portal. These traits would in turn result into a system where data flows faster than the traditional approach and effective results a shorter time interval.\n\nFeyzullah Kalyoncu, Engin Zeydan, Ibrahim Onuralp Yigit, Ahmet Yildirim - Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are eager to learn more about complaint behaviour of their subscribers. In this demo, we study topic modeling approach for extracting relevant problems experienced by subscribers of MNOs in Turkey and visualize the topic distributions using LDAvis data analytics tool. For building topic models using Latent Dirchlet Allocation (LDA), we have built customer complaint text dataset of subscriber complaints for each MNOs from Turkey's largest customer complaint website. The proposed analysis tool can be used as customer complaint analysis service by MNOs in Turkey to gain more insight. We have also validated our generated topic model using another dataset obtained from Turkey's largest online community website. Our results indicate similar and dissimilar topics of complaints as well as some of the distinctive problems of MNOs in Turkey based on their subscriber's experiences and feedback.\nAlireza Faed - Negative customer perception often manifest as formal companies; while unknown percentages do not become so visible. Within a customer complaint management system, it is possible through careful analysis to identify the flaws in the service standards, in the complaint handling procedure itself, and the finer points which help to formulate resolution methods. When major key problems persist, complaints may spread across a range of company activity, from operational employee performance to managerial handling of both policy and practice. A poorly managed and/or designed complaint system will inevitably impact on the company's profit and loss status, through excessive expenditures, damage to market reputation and declining income. As the ultimate goal of a company is to content customers, acquire an efficient profit margin, and have a long-lasting relationship with customers and improving market shares. They should handle the complaints within complaint management system and this system alone must be under the monitoring of customer relationship management system. The aim of this study is to identify these irregularities and to propose a strategy to minimize them. For improving reliability of the company we benefited from failure mode and effect analysis technique (FMEA) which lets preventive analysis of failures that may compromise credibility of the company. As a methodology model set of 30 questionnaires have been assigned for this reason and a case study of an airline has been chosen. Ultimately, using, 5-point likert scale and SPSS software, we were managed to administer the data and conclude the results.\nEXISTING SYSTEM:\nThe biggest downfall to manual document filing is the amount of space it can take up. This is just one big headache you don’t need. It interrupts your productivity levels.\nProne to Damage and Being Misplaced\nManual document filing means you are placing faith in the people handling the files. There are so many ways they can be damaged, lost, or misplaced.  A fire or natural disaster could mean the loss of all your clients’ important information. You will have to start over at square one getting the information back. It can also lead you to losing clients who don’t appreciate your mishandling of their information.\nHard to Make Changes\nWhen you are working with paper documents it is much harder to make changes. Every time you want to make a change you will have to make a copy, so you don’t destroy the original with any edits or comments you might add. This means the editing process is more time consuming than if you were working with digital copies.\nAccess Time\nManual document filing is very time consuming. Not only do you have to organize and store the files, hunting down the information when it is need can take time. It can take anywhere from minutes to hours to hunt down a file, depending on how well your organization is. This can cause annoyance for clients as well as for employees. Their productivity is lowered by having to spend excessive time dealing with a paper filing system.\nLack of Security\nPaper document filing can be less secure than electronic filing systems. Misplaced documents can easily be placed in the wrong hands. Clients expect their information to be secure in your hands. If you can’t keep this safe, you are at risk for losing them. A cabinet filled with files is way easier to access than a computer which requires a password and credentials to get into.\n\nHigher Cost\nWhen you use paper documents your costs are going to be higher because you are paying for ink and paper. Your office supply bill will be higher if you are using a manual document filing process. While you might think this is insignificant, overtime it’s a lot of money that can be used in better ways.\nPROPOSED SYSTEM:\n    • Protection of Freedom of Expression.\n    • Protection against improper academic evaluation\n    • Faculty and employee should be ethical, moral and should behave in a manner with good academic interest and should maintain decent academic relations with teachers and co-employee and co-operate with company authorities to maintain vibrant and decent academic environment.\n    • In the proposed system we tried to provide the high security than the existing system.\n    • We will provide friendlier environment than the existing one.\nAdvantages \n    • Simple and effortless push notification for effective complaint submission\n    • Raise tickets instantly\n    • Automatic complaint ticket generation\n    • Complaint progress tracking and notifications\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nThe system is proposed to have the following modules: This app enhanced level of categories for Tourism App.\n3.2 System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase.

Generally, any information system aims to support operations, management, and decision-making. In the sport; football has its great influence on the daily life of humans and became the most famous sport in the world and it is considered a new emerging industry. IS should be applied in football because it is considered as an economic sector contains various departments and activities. With the increasing number of clubs and players, it becomes difficult to manage club data manually. So, it is necessary to have a system to manage data. In this paper, we seek to design an online IS to have the ability to save and update the database automatically. Users of the system (players, coaches, medicals, etc.) will have the ability to communicate with each other and access their profiles by using a unique ID and password. The players can use the system very easily and get updated information all the time. A study adopts a methodology for designs a general Football Club Management model, where this methodology includes theoretical and empirical sections. The theoretical section includes reviewing the literature on building an information system for the football club in addition to a survey that will be done to check all required sections for the model. Another section (empirical) includes web support programming and testing the model. The design of the system depends on the methodology that is used to develop it, the methodology will be user-friendly and easy interpretation.\n\nDesign and implementation of sport training management information system for high education sports team\nComputer-aided exercise training through sports training and information science research, improve training efficiency and training. In this paper, diving and track and field sports teams university has developed a training information management system, diving through the human motion detection and analysis of information on the technical movement to design and simulation, track and field research projects through the accumulation of training data and analysis, as well as athletes in sports and sports training load control theory understanding of the concept, establish exercise load evaluation system and evaluation index. This paper studies the college sports team training information management system for high-level sports team training, research and ancillary support, and sports disciplines and scientific research has important practical significance\n\n\nOrganization Design in Football Management Process\nNowadays, to create efficiency, businesses need to build expert departments (systematic structure) based on functional business section, accelerate the flow of information in itself and enable decisions to be taken more quickly, thus saving time and resources and taking measures against risks by constantly monitoring hierarchical structures. In the Sports Clubs, it is important to transfer the financial power, which is the result of sportive achievement, to the whole activity areas in the club in a balanced manner and to substructure investments to develop and grow and create economic magnitude and transform this magnitude to contribute to sportive achievement again. The purpose of this study is to split the football management into main processes and manage easily. In a system approach to manage football management areas with different variables in accordance with organizational goals in a harmony, sports clubs should separate ‘8’ main process like Team Intelligence, Team Management, Youth Development, Footballer Transfer, Logistics Support, Public Relations and Corporate Communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1Existing Solution:\nIn the existing Sports Event Management system, students are not able to get proper information about the games conducted in various colleges. The student needs to spend the time to get the information about the game. The student should attend the venue to get registered for the game which takes a lot of time\n•\tLack of privacy\n•\tRisk in the management of the data.\n•\tLess Security\n•\tLow co-ordination between \n•\tLess User-friendly\n•\tAccuracy not guaranteed\n•\tNot in reach of distant users.\t\n\n2.2 Proposed Solution:\t\nTo all the players are allowed to play. Whereas to the state level, the best players will be selected from the college level list which will be also saved in the database.  Current system provides different access levels for security.\n Rich user interface is provided in order to interact with application. Reports are generated dynamically on a periodic basis. This study is meant to help football club managers realize possible influence and significance brought by information system application, this study would be useful as a reference for football club managers and software developers when they try to establish or improve football club information system.\n\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nThe system after careful analysis has been identified to be presented with the following modules User, Manager, Admin. \nUser\n    • Register – User has to register their basic details to get access with this application service.\n    • Login – Once they have registered they need to login to avail the service at the needy time.\n    • Search Sports – to search verified sports details based on users need.\n    • Booking for playing – the application will provide you the lists of information user can order the book.\n    • Make Payment \n    • View My Booking \n    • View Score Board–Once schedule playing it will show the score board while select the match\nManager\n    • Login – Once they have registered they need to login to avail the service at the needy time.\n    • View User Booking– To create the details of a sports category.

Saves you from debt - Many students graduate from college with huge loan debts. The thought of repaying all the money limits their education. It also creates immense pressure on them for getting placed at good packages. This is the reason why most students can’t pursue careers, which don’t pay high salaries at entry level, even if they want to.On the other hand, a scholarship comes as free money and allows students like you to follow your dreams. It helps in empowering your academic and career goals by removing the financial barrier.\n    2. Improves performance - Getting a scholarship takes away all your financial concerns. Thus, it gives you more time to study, gain knowledge and secure better grades. You get ample time to look for opportunities for skill development and knowledge enhancement.\n    3. Gives you a career advantage - Earning a scholarship is prestigious. Since you get a scholarship on merit, getting one will leave a good impact on your future employers. Some competitive scholarships are so good that you can list them on your resume under accomplishments. Stand out from the rest during job search. \nNow all of you want to know why this scheme is so popular in all over the Country. We are going to tell you about all of this. Under this “Scholarship Management System” the State Government will give Rs.15000/- a year through cheque to the Mother and Guardian who will send their children to school. For this scheme family must be a native citizen of India.\nAll mothers or recognised guardians who belong to the BPL family having white Ration Card send their children who are studying between class 1st to class 12th to any recognised institution included Government, private schools and junior colleges, residential schools and colleges in state which comes under this “Scholarship Management System”. Main motto of this scheme is to Promote the literacy rate in the state so that not a single child left illiterate.\nMothers or guardians who are benefitting from this scheme should ensure that his /her children should maintain the 75% attendance. Officials under this scheme at district level started shortlisting beneficiaries who come under the scheme and most probably the first list of beneficiaries who comes under Scholarship Management System will be announced in the 25th December.\nFor this the User IDs and Passwords were given to the Principal of Government and Private schools to uploads the details of students in the online portal after checking their attendance. Details required is aadhar number of both student and his mother and mother bank details with IFSC code.\nThere is a deadline for schools to submit their data. School whose strength is less than 100 should submit the details before 25th of November. And schools whose strengths is between 100 to 300 submit the details on 26th of November. While schools whose strengths is more than 300 their deadline is 27th November. But there are some school management who are saying that this deadline should be increased because they cannot collect data on a single day for a whole academic year it requires time.\nPresently there are 44,400 government colleges are working in the state, and 37.03 lakhs children are studying and gaining education in government schools.\n“Scholarship Management System” Eligibility Criteria\nThose beneficiary who satisfy the “Scholarship Management System” can apply for the scheme:\nAccording to the rule mother and the Guardian should belong to the BPL family \nFamily should have white ration card.\nThey should have a valid aadhar card or voter ID.\nStudent of the beneficiary must be studying in class 1st to 12th in government or in private aided and private unaided school’s/ Jr. colleges including residential schools /colleges in the state from the Academic year 2019-2020.\nMother or guardians must ensure that his/her children must have 75% attendance in his school.\nParents and children should be the citizens of the Country.\nIf child discontinue the study in middle of the session of academic year then he will not be able to avail the benefits of the scheme.\nState or central government employee are not eligible for this scheme.\nWhat if you don’t have aadhar or ration card?\nIf you don’t have a white ration card and aadhar card, then village or ward volunteer will certify you as eligible and after a six stage filtration process your details will be forwarded to the mandal education officer. And this whole process should be completed before 30th November.\n\nJaganna Scholarship Management System is one of the welfare schemes among the nine schemes of YSRCP government called as “Navratanalu”.

        "content": "Book Exchange Easy : Online Book Sharing System – Lend & Borrow\n\n\nABSTRACT\nIn Online Book Exchange System, there can be 2 possible users; they are the owners and the borrowers of the book. The owners have the capability to post all the details of the book and with their contact information on the other hand borrower who is interested with the listed book will also update their contact details. So the interest of the user matches with any of the book listed with the system. They can directly contact and exchange the book themselves through this system. The purpose of the Online Book Exchange System is to provide quality services. It aims to provide a transparency in borrowing process. The system provides a feature that can easily manage user’s information, book details and manage borrowing transactions.\n\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AqxhkkGbd88\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nCHAPTER 1 –INTRODUCTION\nNowadays, in our society, computer technology is the most important advancement as people move along in this computerized world. These changes have big effects on man’s life; by making it easier and more convenient. Book Shops have the responsibility not only to know how to manage online shops systems but also to be aware that these changes will have a big help to them.\n\nIt helps a lot by providing sustainable technology towards quality education through consignment and effective learning. Computer technology is now in demand in our society. It is very essential in our daily lives. It continues to evolve and grow fast.\n\n             A Book Exchange System is software that had been developed to handle basic housekeeping functions of a library as well as a online book store. It helps to grant information on any book present in the system to the users. It keeps a track of book issued, returned and added to the system.\n\nIn preparation, this system became more reliable and consistently providing enough support to the society to accommodate an increasing amount of book readers in every year.\n\n            The proposed system was made based on the wants and needs of the book readers, the system consists of registering books with specific book identification number, so that the user has an easy access in each book, search tabs for reliable, easy and faster monitoring of books and more importantly a report and evaluation papers can be generated in a well-organized and well-presented reports. Each user is limited to borrow one book every transaction to provide each student an equal chances of borrowing specific books.\n            This project system was highly recommended due to the rapid increase of computer related tools in the industry. With this proposed system features and functions of the online book shop and the e-library that will be able to accommodate more reliably consistent and faster in providing a better service to the users.\n\n        1.1 Objectives\nThe principal objective of the system was to computerize the manual system in maintaining the records of the book issue, book return of the users, stock sustenance and book research, so that the functioning of the Online Book Exchange system will be easier and more convenient. Each user that is registered in the system is provided a unique ID.\n\n      LITERATURE REVIEW\nLibraries are repositories of knowledge and the tremendous growth in digital resources has forced library professionals to use various information technology tools to manage and render services to the users. To achieve greater efficiency in the rapidly changing environment, libraries are increasingly looking for new paradigms to deliver services to users on their desktops. Library portals play a crucial role by creating a web environment where users can easily access information. It not only offers services but also enhances scholarly communication and research among the patrons of the library. This paper describes the portal of Space Applications Centre (SAC) Library at ISRO, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and designed using Joomla: A Content Management System (CMS). An attempt has been made here to explain the various services provided through this portal to the ISRO/DOS users so that they can become effective information seekers and evaluate information efficiently and effectively. It also highlights how it tries to meet user expectations of information on demand as well as in anticipation.\nLibraries incorporate an increasing number of digital resources in their collection and they have the responsibility of disseminating the content 24 X 7 so that every user is able to access the latest information. The emerging trends in digital technologies and their applicability to information handling activities are adding new challenges to library professionals. The advancements in information technologies and telecommunication systems has changed the face of the traditional libraries from just being paper-based to digital libraries. Information can now be processed, stored and made available in digital formats and can be accessed by users from their desktops. With the tremendous growth in digital resources, users find it difficult to locate the most appropriate information or resource relevant to their needs. Even if they locate the right resources, they may struggle to search and use these effectively, as each service tends to have its own unique interfaces.\nRobotic process mechanization is the utilization of programming with manmade brainpower and machine learning abilities to deal with high-volume, repeatable assignments that beforehand required a human to perform.Robot is an automated machine.In library administration, we need librarian for management of books. To lessen curator inconvenience we have created robotization in library to speedy transport of books utilizing robotic arm.Library management robotic system is combination of software used to manage the library database and hardware used to manage the book handling. This system helps to keep the records of whole transactions of books available in a library.A robot is modular design of sensor operated motors to manage the library. Robot acquires the book information from stored database. The robot gathers the barcode data from the books and relates the decoded barcode data with the search input. The robot conveys a standardized identification scanner which gathers the scanner tag information from the books orchestrated in a vertical way and contrasts the decoded scanner tag information. Global positioning system is used for book location finding. This aides and streamlines the occupation of custodian and lessens the manual routine work done by the library staff.\nRobot is mechanical gadget that works naturally with humanlike expertise.The use of robot has increased intensively, robotic arm are very flexible with the more accurate and efficient sensors.It is kinematic chain of rigid links interrelated by movable joints. Robotics is associated to electronics, mechanics, and software. In thisdesign, links are considered to correspond to human arm as upper arm and forearm. Wrist joint is last part of arm. All the problems anddifficulty for the library management process has been acutelystudied [1]. In this anticipate we are building up a framework utilizing sensors, as indicated by the sensor information the development of the robot is controlled. Utilizing mechanical arm this framework picks the book from source area and spots at fancied area.The aim of this project is to build up a self-sufficient robot utilizing the National Instruments myRIO as a part of expansion with graphical programming called LabVIEW. LabVIEW is a graphical programming tool which places great emphasis on dataflow and allows for code to be executed in parallel[2]. LabVIEW communicates the appropriate movementedges to the mechanical arm that drives the servomotors having ability of fluctuating position.The robot required intelligence in the fields of obstacle avoidance, navigation and path finding, localisation as well as book handling.\nEven though most universities in China have successively introduced digital resources, traditional paperbased resources still share major percentage in the whole library resources. In the current library management schemes, the information of the resource requirement and usage record is not utilized effectively either in resource purchase decision or in resource allocation plan. Furthermore, there is no efficient approach proposed to utilize the advanced information technologies in library management. In this paper, we firstly analyze the patterns of the current library services in Chinese universities and points out some problems existing in the current resource management systems. We then propose several approaches attempting to improve user satisfactory and resource utilization by considering customer behavior and requirement information.\nUniversity libraries have entered a new era with digital resources along with traditional paper-based resources thanks to the advance of the information technologies (ITs), and most universities in China have earmarked a large amount of budget in the last decade to construct electronic libraries following to the guidance of the Ministry of Education of China [1]. A user of a university can access to any digital resource stored in the library via the Web-based interface and can also access, mostly on the campus, to any digital resource that is licensed to the library by an outside publisher or organization. However, most resources nowadays held in a library are still in paper-based format. If a user wants to find some paper-based resources, say, books or any kind of other materials, in a library, then the user has to go to the library at where the resources are kept. A university may have multiple campuses that are spatially separated from one another and there is usually one library on each campus. Therefore, a situation may often occur wherein a user inevitably goes back and forth between libraries in order to find all the paper-based resources the user needs. The university library works as the information service center for students and staffs of a university and the services provided by a university library can be classified into many categories ranging from text books to advanced research papers in different formats such as paper-based materials, digital files, and compact disks (CDs)/digital versatile disks (DVDs). A library can also provide a copy transmission service if any kind of the resources requested by a user is unavailable in the library. The library can ask one of the other libraries holding the resource to deliver a copy of the resource for the requested user. Two integrated academic library systems funded by the Ministry of Education of China, called China Academic Humanities and Social Sciences Library (CASHL) [2] and China Academic Library and Information System (CALIS) [3], work as an integrated resource search platform for the whole Chinese academic institutes. The integrated system performs a cross-search for a user request across key university libraries and identifies the libraries that have the required resource. In the current library management schemes in Chinese higher institutes, the information of only the lending and returning records is used and the resource purchase and the allocation plans are usually determined by library staffs. However, the information of the resource usage in library and the user requirements from different campuses are not taken into account. In this paper, we first investigate the problems of the current systems and then propose some possible solutions to improve the user satisfaction using user behavior information. \n\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\nExisting Solution:\nTime and access can be obstacles to library research. Readers must get to the library during library hours, which may not be convenient. They also may need to stay in the library for a long time to ensure they have exhausted all resources. Some resources may not be available for checkout, which means the student must stay in the library to use them. And those that do circulate may be checked out by others and unavailable to anyone else.\nProposed System:\nThis objective overcame all the short comings of a manual system that was used daily. This includes the following:\n    1. Developed a well-organized book borrowing system.\n    2. Produced a well-designed and functioning system in accordance to the needs and wants of the borrowers.\n    3. Minimized the task and the effort being performed by both the owners and borrowers.\n    4. Provided the school and the students a well-organize and well-presented reports.\n\t\n\n\nSystem Modules:\nModules\n    • Register\n    • Login\n    • Login Firebase\n    • Post Book Details\n    • My books\n    • Search all Book\n    • Contact Email > Poster\n    • Comment on book\n    • Review\n    • Email Alert for new book (For 2 registered account)\n    • Status: Lending/browing\n    • My Profile\n    • Add Google Map location using marker\n    • View Google map location (Viewable with browser only)\n\n\n\n3.1 Module Description\n\n    1) Register\n    • All the users must register themselves with the system from which they will get unique username and password.\n    2) Login\n    • Using the received username and the password users can get into the system whenever they want.\n    3) Login Firebase\n    • Also the users need to login to the Google Firebase. https://firebase.google.com/\n    • Note: Only Firebase setup without verifyation and validation\n    4) Post Book Details\n    • Owners of the books can post the details of the books they have.\n    5) My books\n    • Posted books of  the owners will be having those details under my books.\n    6) Search all Book\n    • Any user can search for their interested book in the system.\n    7) Contact Email > Poster\n    • Once they get their desired book on the serach results. The user can view the contact Email posted with the details of the book.\n    8) Comment on book\n    • The users those who are willing to read particular book can leave their comment.\n\n    9) Review\n    • Those who have read the book can review about the book as well as the service of the Online Book Exchange System.\n    10) Email Alert for new book (For 2 registered account)\n    • Email alert will be sent to the registered users if any of the new book posted in this system.\n    11) Status: Lending/browing\n    • Status of the Book will be updated with the system on a regular basis.\n    12) My Profile\n    • Every user will have their own profile details under their account.\n    13) Add Google Map location using marker\n    • User will add the Google Map location with the marker to make it clear.\n    14) View Google map location (Viewable with browser only)\n    • The added Google Map in this system will be viewable by any of the user.\n\n3.2 System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase. The problem is analyzed so that sufficient matter is provided to design a new system. Large problems are sub-divided into smaller once to make them understandable and easy for finding solutions. Same in this project all the task are sub-divided and categorized.\n",

        "content": "Lab Management System Project\n\nABSTRACT\nIt is an online diagnostic lab manager application that brings up various diagnoses working online. Here patients get an option to register on the site and login using registered details. Once registered with their address and contact details, the patients may now see a variety of tests conducted by the lab along with their costs. The system allows patients to do the bookings for various tests like CBC, Blood Glucose, KFT, and LFT. The tests also consist of parameters like Hemoglobin, WBC, etc. The system allows users to book any test needed and after successful booking, system calculates costs and allows users to pay online. As soon as the payment is done, the patient test is booked and the lab may now collected samples from patients registered address. After successful testing, the patient or the user gets a notification of test result through an email. The system allows admin to attach a copy of the report into the system and automatically email it to intended patient.\n\n\n –INTRODUCTION\nThe program is an on the Diagnostic Lab Reporting System administrator program which provides various analysis working on the internet. Here victims are first able to sign-up on the site and also sign in using authorized information. Once authorized with their deal with and contact information, the patient may now see a wide range of assessments performed by the lab along with their expenses. The program allows for CBC, Blood Sugar, KFT, LFT assessments to be reserved by individual. The assessments also comprises of factors like Hemoglobin, WBC, etc. Now the program allows customers to book any analyze needed. After effective reservation program determines expenses and allows customers to pay online.\n        1.1 Objectives\nTechnology has facilitates human beings in almost every field of life. They turn manual tasks automatic to saves recourses. Automatic works is considered more trustful, reliable, accurate etc. Technology is the main reason which successfully manages many processes and creates successful management system.\n\n\n\n       CHAPTER 2 – LITERATURE REVIEW\t\nThe literature in this context refers to published scholarly work. For instance, scientific scholarly literature includes journal articles, conference proceedings, technical reports and books. A “literature review” reviews the scholarly literature on a specific topic by summarizing and analyzing published work on that topic. A literature review has several purposes:  to evaluate the state of research on a topic to familiarize readers and students with what has already been done in the field  to suggest future research directions or gaps in knowledge Green, Johnson and Adams describe a literature review as a type of research article published in a professional peer-reviewed journal. The purpose of a literature review is to objectively report the current knowledge on a topic and base this summary on previously published research. A literature review provides the reader with a comprehensive overview and helps place that information into perspective. 1 Most research articles include a section that reviews previous work, but this is not as comprehensive as an article-length literature review. A literature review does not include new, unpublished research results.\nIn an article database, search for the keywords “literature review” or “review” (in title or topic) in addition to your topic keywords Some article databases have “reviews” coded as a separate article format. For example, Web of Science lists “reviews” under document type. Do a topic search, then click this box to refine to only review articles. In some databases (such as BIOSIS) this is called literature type. PubMed includes Review as a filter under “type of article”. In PyscINFO, include “literature review” as a methodology.  You will still need to look at the papers you find to determine if they are truly literature reviews. Access the full-text of the paper (using the orange UC eLinks button) and read the first page or two. If it reports original research results, it’s not a review article. Most reviews explicitly state that they are reviewing the literature in the abstract or first paragraphs, or use the phrase “We review recent studies” or similar. Review articles also typically cite dozens of other papers in their quest to be comprehensive, so their bibliography sections are longer than usual.  Don’t forget to search review journals – try Annual Reviews (http://www.annualreviews.org).  Remember not all specific topics have review papers already published on them – you may need to broaden your keywords (by using fewer or less specific terms) to find a review of your subject.\n Existing Solution:\nIt needs employment as the human efforts are being automated by this system.\nIn this existing Diagnostic Lab Reporting System, the reports are generated either manually or by using computer software in which the details itself needs to be fitted by the employees of the organization. Existing system has greater tendency of having more errors as compared to the automation system. In existing Diagnostic Lab Reporting System, as the chances of errors are greater, thus the chances of getting information from the reports are more which will indirectly or directly affect the patients and their health only.\nExisting Diagnostic Lab Reporting System needs to change asap in order to reduce the errors which affect the patient’s report and indirectly patient’s health in this way or any other way.\n\nProposed Solution:\nThe proposed system is an “Online Diagnostic Lab Reporting System”. Its main aim is to bring together various diagnostic working, researches on one single platform that is also online (so that it is accessible for everyone).\n    • The system allows automate diagnosis system. \n    • Allows for faster service.\n    • Allows increased sales and profits for diagnostic labs.\n    • Easy, user friendly GUI.\t\nAdvantages \nThe advantages of the proposed project are that the online system simply automates diagnosis system. It is faster and reliable, provides better services as compare to manual system. This system may increase the profit for diagnosis labs. The user friendly and interactive interface makes using this application easy for everyone. There is almost zero percent chance of report swapping or missing which has quite fair chances in manual system. The android version of the proposed application save users to visit website again and again, they can checks all details on finger tips.\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nSystem Users and Their Functions:\n3.2 System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase. The problem is analyzed so that sufficient matter is provided to design a new system. Large problems are sub-divided into smaller once to make them understandable and easy for finding solutions. Same in this project all the task are sub-divided and categorized.\n\nSystem Modules:\n    • Admin\n    • Patients\n\nModule Description:\nRegistration: \nThe patients or clients who are using the proposed website have to register them on the website by providing basic details about them, their medical details and contact details. They can set their unique name and password.\nLogin: \nThe users (patients or clients) access the system or system features by login into the website by using their username and password. \n\nViewInterface: \nOn main or home page of the proposed website the section of tests conducting is reserved. On that page each test along with their estimated cost is displayed for example CBC, Blood Glucose, KFT etc. \nLocateNearbyLab: \nThe system locates the nearby lab and their working hours as well the time slots available to them.\nBookTestorReserving: \nThe client can book certain needed test online. Client can take available slots or in case reserve demanded slots up to requirements.\nCost Calculation and Payment:\nAfter successful booking the system calculates the estimated cost and the user have to pay online. \nLabReceive: \nThe person’s tests are conducted in nearby lab or any unit mentioned by lab and collected from their later. \nTestsResults: \nAfter the test is conducted and samples are examined the patient gets reports results of their test with the help of notification. The users can immediately view their reports and can collect hard copy of reports from diagnostic center later. \n\n – DESIGN\nDesign is the first step in the development phase for any techniques and principles for the purpose of defining a device, a process or system in sufficient detail to permit its physical realization.\nOnce the software requirements have been analyzed and specified the software design involves three technical activities - design, coding, implementation and testing that are required to build and verify the software.\nThe design activities are of main importance in this phase, because in this activity, decisions ultimately affecting the success of the software implementation and its ease of maintenance are made. These decisions have the final bearing upon reliability and maintainability of the system. Design is the only way to accurately translate the customer’s requirements into finished software or a system.\nDesign is the place where quality is fostered in development. Software design is a process through which requirements are translated into a representation of software. Software design is conducted in two steps. Preliminary design is concerned with the transformation of requirements into data.\n\n4.1UML Diagrams:\nUML stands for Unified Modeling Language. UML is a language for specifying, visualizing and documenting the system. This is the step while developing any product after analysis. The goal from this is to produce a model of the entities involved in the project which later need to be built. The representation of the entities that are to be used in the product being developed need to be designed.\nThere are various kinds of methods in software design:\n\n    • Use case Diagram\n    • Sequence Diagram\n    • Collaboration Diagram\n\n\n4.1.1Usecase Diagrams:\t\nUse case diagrams model behavior within a system and helps the developers understand of what the user require. The stick man represents what’s called an actor. Use case diagram can be useful for getting an overall view of the system and clarifying who can do and more importantly what they can’t do.\n\n\n\n\nUse case diagram consists of use cases and actors and shows the interaction between the use case and actors.\n    • The purpose is to show the interactions between the use case and actor.\n    • To represent the system requirements from user’s perspective.\n    • An actor could be the end-user of the system or an external system\n\n4.1.2 Sequence Diagram:\nSequence diagram and collaboration diagram are called INTERACTION DIAGRAMS. An interaction diagram shows an interaction, consisting of set of objects and their relationship including the messages that may be dispatched among them.\nA sequence diagram is an introduction that empathizes the time ordering of messages. Graphically a sequence diagram is a table that shows objects arranged along the X-axis and messages ordered in increasing time along the Y-axis.\n\n\n4.1.3 Collaboration Diagram:\nA collaboration diagram is a type of visual presentation that shows how various software objects interact with each other within an overall IT architecture and how users can benefit from this collaboration. A collaboration diagram often comes in the form of a visual chart that resembles a flow chart.\n\n\n4.1.4 Activity Diagram\nActivity diagram is another important diagram in UML to describe dynamic aspects of the system. Activity diagram is basically a flow chart to represent the flow from one activity to another activity. The activity can be described as an operation of the system. So the control flow is drawn from one operation to another.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 ER Diagram\t\n\n4.1.6 DFD Diagram\t\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "icar : Car Pooling Using Bootstrap\n  \n ABSTRACT\n\n In today's world, there are lots of people commuting from place to place. Example: employees going back home. Students going home from university etc. And lot of times, people will be commuting via car or bike and there is place to take a fellow employee along with him to give a ride. But the problem is there is no easy way to know how many people a person can take and co-ordination is a huge issue that there is no effort by people to help each other by giving a lift and more over this saves the environment in reducing fuel usage, reduces traffic with fewer vehicles etc. The Carpool is an android application which will provide the advanced searching techniques and provide most relevant results for the carpooling in the city. This will be help full in easy way Carpooling reduces the costs involved in repetitive or long distance driving by sharing cars, sharing rental charges, or paying the main car owner. Some countries have introduced high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to encourage carpooling and use of public transport, to combat rising traffic congestion\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION\n\n In recent years, the problems of global warming and the energy crisis have aroused widespread public concern. One recommended solution for reducing the harmful factors leading to such problems is carpooling. This type of transportation service could make a big difference if organized on a large scale by government or big companies, particularly large corporations with many branches or sub-companies. Carpooling schemes are designed to encourage commuters to share travel expenses and resources with colleagues. Carpooling (also known as car-sharing, ride-sharing, lift-sharing), is the shared use of a car by the driver and one or more passengers, usually for commuting. Carpooling arrangements and schemes involve varying degrees of formality and regularity.\n\n\n        1.1 Objectives\n\n Long-term carpooling is defined as the sharing of a private vehicle by several individuals who follow a semi-common route between different points of origin and destination (OD) during a specific period. In practice, a participant can request to share the same trip with his/her friends, in which case they are treated as a participant group with the same OD and travel route/schedule. The results of such an action are the following: \n1) Reduction in the number of vehicles on the route;\n 2) Reduction in expenses for gas; \n3) Reduction in energy consumption (CO2 emissions) and Pollution;\n4) Provision of social connections in an increasingly Disconnected society.\n        1.2 Purpose of proposed work\n\n The Dynamic Carpooling is more complicated than long-term/daily many-to-one or one-to-many carpooling problems. An efficient plan for the Dynamic Carpooling may require matching participant groups to a car on a semi common route or assigning a participant group to different cars on different days. It is very difficult to simultaneously and optimally determine every participant group’s role (driver group or passenger group), driver group schedules, and passenger group deliveries, as well as to suitably match several participant groups in a car while still keeping in mind fairness considerations. This process involves complicated movements of driver groups (or vehicles) and passenger groups in both time and space, with consideration of driver/passenger traveling costs.\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kRHBCPB57hE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n– LITERATURE REVIEW\nThe literature on carpooling. The review focuses on studies that have attempted to provide insight into the following questions: What factors affect carpooling? What is the role of technology in the formation of carpools? The first section of the literature review (Section 2.1) outlines Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and explains how carpooling fits into the practice. Section 2.2 discusses factors that encourage and discourage carpooling. Section 2.3 considers the literature that examines how Information and Communications Technology (ICT) can be used to benefit carpooling. Section 2.4 summarizes the main findings of the literature review.\n2.1 Existing Definition\n\n In recent years, the problems of global warming and the energy crisis have aroused widespread public concern. One recommended solution for reducing the harmful factors leading to such problems is carpooling [1]. This type of transportation service could make a big difference if organized on a large scale by government or big companies, particularly large corporations with many branches or sub-companies. Carpooling schemes are designed to encourage commuters to share travel expenses and resources with colleagues [1]. Dynamic carpooling is also known as casual carpooling and a variety of other names, is already widespread in a few metropolitan regions. In each case, public policies encouraging multiple-occupancy vehicles were the impetus. For example, on the Bay Bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland, traffic moves very slowly in rush hour except in the High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane, which can only be used by vehicles with 3 or more occupants (2 for pickup trucks) [10].\n\n2.2 Proposed Solution:\nDynamic carpooling today is limited to a few standardized pickup and drop-off locations, as that is the only mechanism available for route coordination. But that severely limits the geographic areas and the set of people who will find it convenient to ride with others. A basic piece of infrastructure for more flexible pickup is for riders and drivers to have devices that can transmit their current location. Cell phone companies may be building this service, though triangulation among cell towers, in order to provide emergency response, or it may be provided through Global Positioning Systems. In order to be useful, the location information would have to be fairly precise, at least identifying a single city block, for example. \nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Product Perspective\n\tA basic piece of infrastructure for more flexible pickup is for riders and drivers to have devices that can transmit their current location. Cell phone companies may be building this service, though triangulation among cell towers, in order to provide emergency response, or it may be provided through Global Positioning Systems. In order to be useful, the location information would have to be fairly precise, at least identifying a single city block Also, residents get restless that issues are not getting resolved despite reminders and no one knows the status of the complaint raised.\n3.2 Interfaces\nThe application will have a user friendly and menu based interface. Following user interface pages will be provided.\n    • Registration to have their detailed information to maintain database\n    • Login to validate and allow them to access these application complaints with already stored database.\n    • Admin enters the login and view complaint and prepare for solutions.\n    • Then user enters this application and view complaint status of their complaint.\n3.3 System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase. The problem is analyzed so that sufficient matter is provided to design a new system. Large problems are sub-divided into smaller once to make them understandable and easy for finding solutions.

        "content": "eBus – Geo Location Based Current Location Tracking System \nABSTRACT\nAdvanced traveler information systems are one component of intelligent transportation systems, and a major component is travel time information. Prediction Model have been adopted by many transit agencies for tracking their vehicles and predicting travel time in real time. It is a very important subject to improve the precision and reliability of the prediction model which can attract additional ridership, reduce passengers' anxieties and waiting times at bus stop, and increase their satisfaction. Furthermore, it can promote the development of city public transportation. This paper presents an improved approach to predict the public bus arrival time based on location. After analyzing the components of bus arrival time systematically, the bus arrival time and dwell time at previous stops are chosen as the main input variables of the prediction model. At first, the algorithm of data interpolation and processing is designed to get the real-time of bus arrival as the input variables of the prediction models. Secondly, the statistical model is obtained based on the filtering the location, bus route and date of each bus respectively. Thirdly, a hybrid prediction model is proposed to predict the bus arrival time. The results show that the improved model out performs the historical data based model in terms of prediction accuracy.\n\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YlSfkx2pymQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n    1  INTRODUCTION\n        1.1 Introduction of the Project\nReal time schedule is becoming more and more popular as devices utilizing the android application more readily available. The local bus service provider for Mayiladuthurai, store the details to a central database. This data allows the dispatcher to know where all the buses are at any given time. \nThe goal of this project is to enable passengers to easily access data related to the bus that they are interested in. This goal was accomplished by creating display monitors at the new android application. The displays show the estimated arrival times of the filtered buses that come to the station. This application  also serve as a way to provide current news and information about Mayiladuthurai. For instance every buses can be displayed to broadcast bus uptime and downtime that may arise quickly and easily. The news and information is updated using a content management system by SQLite Database.\n        1.2 Scope\nMany cities have found that using GPS tracking systems not only improve the efficiency of city bus operations, but also encourage more commuters to take advantage of their city bus systems. Many city bus systems have discovered that GPS tracking systems which allow passengers to monitor the location and estimated arrival time of their bus actually increases the number of people using city buses for routine commuting.  \nThis project is to enable passengers to easily access data related to the bus even in offline, because information is updated using a content management system by SQLite Database. SQLite Database is mainly used for offline android application.\n        1.3 Overview \nThe purpose of this section is to obtain bus information using android application. Ultimately this segment defines the boundaries of the effort. The “Bus Management System” presents an improved approach to predict the public bus arrival time based on location. After analyzing the components of bus arrival time systematically, the bus arrival time and dwell time at previous stops are chosen as the main input variables of the prediction model.\n\nPosted on September 21, 2018 by nikhith P\n        1.4 Existing System & Disadvantage \n    • Location of the bus is not known, thus we need to ask the bus information for respective persons.\n    • Long time waiting for the bus.\n    • Chances of missing bus.\n        1.5 PROPOSED SYSTEM & Advantages. \n    • We are expecting to find the location of the bus and let the users know the location.\n    • so that one can manage their time efficiently and reach their stop just before the bus arrives or take an alternate means of transport if they miss the bus or they are running late.\n     \n\n    2  DESCRIPTION\n        2.1 Product Perspective\nThe Bus Management System is designed for both online and offline users to check the bus information and can search for anybus location by filtering source and destination location using android application. The new system is to control the following information; bus information, available time, and stopping points, so passengers can reach the bus stop at correct time instead waiting for long time. This application are to be provided in an efficient, cost effective manner, with the goal of reducing the time of passengers. \n        2.2 User Interfaces\nThe application will have a user friendly and filter based interface. The following screens will be provided.\n    • Login Screen for user to provide user email and password. \n    • Register Screen for creating new account, who do not have their account.\n    • Home page will display list of menus to go with.\n    • Each menu page will consists of filtering and searching bus information, about hotels, tourists spot, famous temples and about Mayiladuthurai.\n\n        2.3 Modules \n    • ADMIN\n    • Create Login\n\n    • Driver/Travels\n    • Login\n    • Post Bus Information\n    • Post Bus Type\n    • Post Contact \n\n    • USER\n    • Register\n    • Login\n    • View Details\n\n\n\n\n3.3 MODULES Description:\t\n    • ADMIN:\n    • Create Login:\n\tAdmin enters this system and create login for driver/travel.\n    • Driver/Travels:\n    • Login:\n\t\t\t\t\tDrivers/Travels are login to this system.\n    • Post Bus Information:\n\t\t\t\t\tDrivers/Travels enter this system and post their Bus’s complete Information.\n    • Post Bust Type:\n\t\t\t\t\tDrivers/Travels enter this system and post their Bus’s complete details about type of bus.\n    • Post Contact:\n\t\t\t\t\tDrivers/Travels enter this system and post their Contact details.\n    • USER:\n    • Register and Login:\n\t\t\tHere user after register and login they can enter this system.\n    • \tView Details:\n\t\t\t\t\tUser can only view this system.\n\n            2.3.1 Login\nThis module used for the customers to login with valid credentials.\n            2.3.2 Register\nThis module is for the customers who do not have their account.

This interface integrates all bank operations and provides business solutions for both retail and corporate. BankApp system is an innovative web application. The main focus of the application is managing the bank transactions as simple. A person can have bank account in any of the bank. But it’s hard to remember the options of every bank’s operating system. So we have developed a web application where a person can handle all his bank transactions in a secure manner with the user friendly application.\n\nCHAPTER 1 –INTRODUCTION\nThe objective of this application to make the Customers of various Banks can do their account accessibility and transactions using this solution. They need not to interact with various applications or web sites of each bank. The Admin will add new Bank details and can update the existing details of the bank. The Admin will accept/reject the registration of a Customer to use this application. The Bank Admin makes access this site to see the all Customer transactions, account Transfer status, etc. He/she can accept or reject the fund transfer of the Customer. Should able to provide Response for the queries related to the Customers. \n\tThe Customers should make request for multiple bank account access to the Administrator. He/she can view the Account related information. The customer should able to transfer the amount from one bank to another bank account using this system by providing the Secondary authentication details. The customer also facilitated to generate report for own bank details for a respective period. The Customer should able to send Queries to the Bank Admin. \n\n        1.1 Objectives\nThis system enables user friendly for Bank-Customer relationship. Customer can easily maintain the multiple bank accounts. Then bank provide update details about customer.\nThe project objective is to create an application that uses customer multi banking system. A person can have bank account in any number of banks. But it’s hard to remember every bank logins. So we have developed a web application where a person can handle all his bank accounts in a secure manner.\n\n\n– LITERATURE REVIEW\t\nThe use of computers in medicine dates back to the 1950s with studies that attempted to expand the mental capacity of physicians (Stumpf and Freitas, 1997) or dealt with research on electrophysiology (Collen, 1986). With the evolution of this equipment, especially with the capacity to simultaneously execute various tasks beginning in the 1960s, computers began to be used in the processing of information in large hospitals, in both administrative and financial functions for the collection of statistics and the development of research projects (Stead, 2007; Stumpf and Freitas, 1997). The use of microcomputers, beginning in the 1970s, introduced the concept of distributed processing, increasing the number of systems in use in large hospitals (Stumpf and Freitas, 1997).\nBecause this diffusion did not always occur in an organized or homogeneous manner, the initial diffusion of computers in hospitals led to the emergence of islands of computerization, with isolated systems that lacked any form of interconnection and were developed by different teams. The redundancy and the lack of data integrity deterred health professionals, who saw these systems as developed by systems professionals for systems professionals (Stumpf and Freitas, 1997). This situation was also investigated by McDonald (1997), who analyzed the lack of interconnection of the different systems used by the hospitals, laboratories, and service providers in the healthcare field.\nCollen (1986) described the development of approaches in the 1970s that sought to approximate the habitual processes of decision-making with the use of artificial intelligence in differential diagnoses. In the same decade, studies were undertaken in search of a better organization of the healthcare system (Kaihara, 1978). With the help of computer-processed simulations, the author established an ideal relationship between medical centers and population demands.\nThe distributed processing was expanded during the 1980s with the development and greater availability of microcomputers, and the possibility of network communication of such equipment increased in the 1990s (Stumpf and Freitas, 1997). This allowed for the emergence of hospital information systems (HIS), covering medical, administrative, and hospitality areas, although hospitality may be considered as integrated into the administrative area (Cortes, 2008). These three areas are interlinked by horizontal data and information flows, providing support to the developed activities. Figure 1 shows a sample record for use in the medical, administrative, and hospitality areas, generating inter-related demands and actions. In the proposed scheme, the information on the electronic records, which contain the procedures, prescriptions, laboratory examinations, professionals involved, and hospitalizations (when applicable), is fundamental for an HIS (Wakamiya and Yamauchib, 2009; Pinochet and Albertin, 2008).\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\nExisting Solution:\nIn existing system, the users need to log in to different online bank accounts to perform transactions. The process should be requiring many security issues. The net banking process can take more time. The online net banking process can allowed to sending transactions only bank timings.\nDisadvantage \n It does not provide transactions from one bank to another bank. \n In this system separate account for each bank. \n To send transactions only within bank timings. \n Enormous amount of time consumption for recording all transaction.\nProposed System:\nIn proposed system can introduced multibank system.

Where ever we go we come across digital gadgets and everything has been atomized whether it is an institution or business sector or any commercial sector for that matter, anything and everything has become technicality oriented in this cyberspace world.\n              The project “SMART BUSINESS” is a small approach to automate the ledges of the retailers, distributors and stockiest and help them to overcome stress when comes to investment analysis and management of stocks, orders and maintaining products such as baby care, biscuits, body care, hair care etc...,\n              This project deals about the marketing and requirement strategy of the clients. These marketing strategies differ from place to place, time to time and from product to product. This is an application which is been developed and customized based on the categories of clients. The categories of clients are i) Retailer   ii) Distributor    iii) Stockiest.\n            Using this application the retailer can maintain his/her profile. He/She can find all the distributors available for the product for which has registered.

Retailing involves the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand is identified through a supply chain. Retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services and the store's overall market positioning. Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel and presentation. In the digital age, an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both bricks and mortar and online retailing. Digital technologies are also changing the way that consumers pay for goods and services. Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services and a range of supporting services.\nThe term \"retailer\" is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of a large number of individuals, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products. Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods, including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity. Recreational shopping often involves window shopping (just looking, not buying) and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase.\nRetail shops occur in a diverse range of types and in many different contexts - from strip shopping centres in residential streets through to large, indoor shopping malls. Shopping streets may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to create a more comfortable shopping environment – protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or precipitation. Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of electronic-commerce used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions) and mail order.\n\nMarkets have existed since ancient times. Open air, public markets were known in ancient Babylonia and Assyria. These markets typically occupied a place in the town's centre. Surrounding the market, skilled artisans, such as metal-workers and leather workers, occupied premises in alley ways that led to the open market-place. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on market days. [2] In ancient Greece markets operated within the agora (open space), and in ancient Rome the forum. In antiquity, exchange involved direct selling, merchants or peddlers.[3]\nThe Phoenicians, noted for their seafaring skills, plied their ships across the Mediterranean, becoming a major trading power by 9th century BCE. The Phoenicians imported and exported wood, textiles, glass and produce such as wine, oil, dried fruit and nuts. Their trading skills necessitated a network of colonies along the Mediterranean coast, stretching from modern day Crete through to Tangiers and onto Sardinia[4] The Phoenicians not only traded in tangible goods, but were also instrumental in transporting culture. The Phoenician's extensive trade networks necessitated considerable book-keeping and correspondence. In around 1500 BCE, the Phoenicians developed a consonantal alphabet which was much easier to learn that the complex scripts used in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Phoenician traders and merchants were largely responsible for spreading their alphabet around the region. [5] Phoenician inscriptions have been found in archaeological sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and colonies around the Mediterranean, such as Byblos (in present-day Lebanon) and Carthage in North Africa. [6]\nIn the Graeco-Roman world, the market primarily served the local peasantry. Local producers, who were generally poor, would sell small surpluses from their individual farming activities, purchase minor farm equipment and also buy a few luxuries for their homes. Major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating the producers' need to attend local markets. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved exporting. The nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and archaeological case studies. [7] Markets were also important centres of social life. [8]\nThe rise of retailing and marketing in England, the United States and Europe has been extensively studied, but less is known about developments elsewhere. [9] Nevertheless, recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early retail systems. [10] From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 AD. [11] Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty (960–1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite. [12] The rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image, retail signage, symbolic brands, trademark protection and sophisticated brand concepts.\n\n        1.1 Objectives\nUsing this application the retailer can maintain his/her profile. He/She can find all the distributors available for the product for which has registered. He/She can order the products from the nearest and available distributors based on the demands of the customers.\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 – LITERATURE REVIEW\t\n\nAs you probably know, manufacturers produce products and retailers sell them to end users. A can of motor oil, for example, is manufactured and packaged, then sold to automobile owners through retail outlets and/or repair shops. In between, however, there are a few key operators-also known as distributors-that serve to move the product from manufacturer to market. Some are retail distributors, the kind that sell directly to consumers (end users). Others are known as merchant wholesale distributors; they buy products from the manufacturer or other source, then move them from their warehouses to companies that either want to resell the products to end users or use them in their own operations.\nAccording to U.S. Industry and Trade Outlook, published by The McGraw-Hill Companies and the U.S. Department of Commerce/International Trade Administration, wholesale trade includes establishments that sell products to retailers, merchants, contractors and/or industrial, institutional and commercial users. Wholesale distribution firms, which sell both durable goods (furniture, office equipment, industrial supplies and other goods that can be used repeatedly) and nondurable goods (printing and writing paper, groceries, chemicals and periodicals), don't sell to ultimate household consumers.\nThree types of operations can perform the functions of wholesale trade: wholesale distributors; manufacturers' sales branches and offices; and agents, brokers and commission agents. As a wholesale distributor, you will probably run an independently owned and operated firm that buys and sells products of which you have taken ownership. Generally, such operations are run from one or more warehouses where inventory goods are received and later shipped to customers.\nPut simply, as the owner of a wholesale distributorship, you will be buying goods to sell at a profit, much like a retailer would. The only difference is that you'll be working in a business-to-business realm by selling to retail companies and other wholesale firms like your own, and not to the buying public. This is, however, somewhat of a traditional definition. For example, companies like Sam's Club and BJ's Warehouse have been using warehouse membership clubs, where consumers are able to buy at what appear to be wholesale prices, for some time now, thus blurring the lines. However, the traditional wholesale distributor is still the one who buys \"from the source\" and sells to a reseller.\nToday, total U.S. wholesale distributor sales are approximately $3.2 trillion. Since 1987, wholesale distributors' share of U.S. private industry gross domestic product (GDP) has remained steady at 7 percent, with segments ranging from grocery and food-service distributors (which make up 13 percent of the total, or $424.7 billion in revenues) to furniture and home furnishings wholesalers (comprising 2 percent of the total, or $48.7 billion in revenues). That's a big chunk of change, and one that you can tap into.\nThe field of wholesale distribution is a true buying and selling game-one that requires good negotiation skills, a nose for sniffing out the next \"hot\" item in your particular category, and keen salesmanship. The idea is to buy the product at a low price, then make a profit by tacking on a dollar amount that still makes the deal attractive to your customer.\nExperts agree that to succeed in the wholesale distribution business, an individual should possess a varied job background. Most experts feel a sales background is necessary, as are the \"people skills\" that go with being an outside salesperson who hits the streets and/or picks up the phone and goes on a cold-calling spree to search for new customers.\nIn addition to sales skills, the owner of a new wholesale distribution company will need the operational skills necessary for running such a company. For example, finance and business management skills and experience are necessary, as is the ability to handle the \"back end\" (those activities that go on behind the scenes, like warehouse setup and organization, shipping and receiving, customer service, etc.). Of course, these back-end functions can also be handled by employees with experience in these areas if your budget allows.\n\"Operating very efficiently and turning your inventory over quickly are the keys to making money,\" says Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting Inc., a Philadelphia strategic consulting firm. \"It's a service business that deals with business customers, as opposed to general consumers. The startup entrepreneur must be able to understand customer needs and learn how to serve them well.\"\n\n\nEXISTING SYSTEM:\n    • Its manual process for earlier system.\n    • Its more time consume for all process.\n    • Need for more resources.\n\nPROPOSED SYSTEM:\n    • This system enhanced combined all stockiest, distributor, retailer and also user.\n    • Its reduced time consuming process.\n    • Here need limited resources only.\n\n\n\n\n OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nThe system is proposed to have the following modules:\nThis app enhanced level of categories for smart business.\n3.2 System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase.

        "content": "Smart City Traveler\n\nABSTRACT\nIn many cities, pilot projects are set up to test new technologies that help to address urban sustainability issues, improve the effectiveness of urban services, and enhance the quality of life of citizens. These projects, often labeled as “city steer” projects, are typically supported by municipalities, funded by subsidies, and run in partnerships. Many of the projects fade out after the pilot stage, and fail to generate scalable solutions that contribute to sustainable urban development. The lack of scaling is widely perceived as a major problem. In this paper, we analyze processes of up scaling, focusing on smart city pilot projects in which several partners with different missions, agendas, and incentives join up.\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION\n \tIn recent years, many cities around the world have witnessed a proliferation of pilot projects that aim to test or develop new solutions to address urban sustainability issues, improve the effectiveness of urban services, and enhance the quality of life of citizens. These projects, often labeled as “smart city” projects, come in many forms, sizes, and types and vary in their degree of technical and organizational complexity. Helped by a growing supply of (inter)national funding opportunities, city administrations have been actively initiating, promoting, and supporting these projects, reflecting the belief of urban policymakers and other stakeholders that technology might help to make the city more livable, sustainable, competitive, and inclusive while improving public services\nA wealth of funding opportunities for smart city projects has become available in recent years. Europe’s Horizon 2020 program provides €18.5 billion in subsidies for clean energy, green transport, and climate actions, implying significant funding opportunities for city-related research (most of it to be conducted in collaboration with local authorities and companies). Also, the European Regional Development Fund (E.R.D.F.) regulation requires that a minimum of 5 percent of the funds be allocated to sustainable urban development, which amounts to a minimum of €16 billion between 2014 and 2020. \nThe city equally appeals to the private sector. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the information and communication technology (I.C.T.) industry have discovered the potential of smart city technology as a high-growth business opportunity. These firms offer a great number and variety of solutions, ranging from energy-efficient and carbon-neutral solutions for city logistics, building management, and public street lighting, to big data analytics tools and dashboards for optimization of public services. \nAccelerated market growth is expected in the next few years. As an indication, Deloitte (2015) expects the global smart cities market to grow from US$400 billion to US$1.5 trillion by 2020. To explore and exploit new business opportunities in this sector, many of these firms have set up city centric programs, of which Cisco’s “Smart & Connected Communities” and I.B.M.’s “Smarter Cities” are prime examples. Moreover, these companies engage in local pilot projects and partnerships with a number of urban stakeholders, including housing corporations, local authorities, grid owners, and energy companies to test or demonstrate innovations in real-life contexts.\nThe growing interest from city administrations, businesses, research institutes, and all kinds of other urban stakeholders in smart cities has led to a great number of pilot projects in recent years. However, many of them remain small and experimental, and fade out after a (subsidized) demonstration phase; as a consequence, the impact of solutions developed in these pilot projects on urban development often remains limited (Vilajosana et al., 2013). \nThere are obvious cases where scaling does not happen. Some pilots are merely set up to offer inspiration, demonstrating a future possibility or solution without claiming immediate commercial viability. Such projects are typically run in a protected/shielded situation with regards to funding and/or regulation. Other pilot projects end because they fail in terms of technology, feasibility, a lack of demand/interest or otherwise, and scaling in whatever form makes no sense.\nNevertheless, the lack of scaling is widely perceived as a major problem that needs to be addressed by policymakers on all levels. \nThe European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities (E.I.P.-S.C.C.) reflects that scaling and replication are considered to be important, and promotes sharing viable business models, financial tools, and procurement instruments in order to make smart city projects economically sustainable instead of dependent on temporary subsidies or grants. Similarly, the requirements for receiving funding from the European Union (E.U.) for projects is oftentimes conditional on the inclusion of dissemination/replication activities (roadshows, handbooks, toolkits, or online tools .\nObjectives\nIf we are desirous to give a web based platform to your city to be showcased for all it has in terms of unique business, places to see, things to do, use local transport for a new traveler – how would you structure this information and also try to provide some valuable services to the people who are living in your desired city. \n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n The idea that smarter planet building would lead a new generation of economic investment and acknowledged such concept as the information superhighway plan has since received wide and positive affirmation and creation of smart cities is receiving policy focus in countries throughout the world. One reason is that across the world, the stride of migration from rural to urban areas is accelerating numerically. By 2050, about 70 per cent of the population will be living in cities, and India is no exception. It will need about 500 new cities to accommodate the influx. Smart Cities offer a conceptual and practical tool box to deal with unprecedented urbanization. Urbanization in India has historically been viewed as a byproduct of failed regional planning. It is only now that it is being realized that it is inevitable. However, the policy and practice surrounding urbanization will only change when the benefits of urbanization overtake the costs involved, it is an opportunity for achieving faster growth. \nThe problems arise immediately. What is a smart city? In ideal terms a working definition may be that a 'smart city' is an urban region that is highly advanced in terms of overall infrastructure, sustainable real estate, communications and market viability. It is a city where information technology is the principal infrastructure and the basis for providing essential services to residents. There are many technological platforms involved, including but not limited to automated sensor networks and data centers. Though this may sound futuristic, it is now likely to become a reality as the ‘cities’ movement unfolds in India. In a smart city, economic development and activity is sustainable and rationally incremental by virtue of being based on success-oriented market drivers such as supply and demand.\nSmart Citizen \nThe differentiating element between a digital city and a smart city is Smart People. People are smart in terms of their skill and educational levels, as well as the quality of social interaction in terms of integration and public life and their ability to open to the outside world. \nEducation and Training \nA key element in the development of cities is having well‐educated citizens. In addition to having well‐educated citizens and a university with a major presence in the city, another priority is to adapt the educational offer, especially considering the changes that society is going through due to globalization and the advancement of new technologies. \nE-Learning \nNew technologies are evolving at breakneck speed; therefore, it is important to design digital development plans in classrooms that mainly focus on closing the digital divide, promoting the digital skills of teachers and incorporating the new generation of digital learning resources. New technologies contribute to improving people's education and training and, in that sense; virtual education offers many benefits, such as reduced costs, flexible hours and greater interaction.\nSmart Technology \nTechnological development, supported by Innovation, is essential to offer competitive products and services. In addition to Research & Development, we must also promote innovation, Source: Federal Ministry of Economic affairs and Energy, Germany “The role played by citizens has a special impact as the differentiating element between a digital city and a smart city is Smart People. The new relationship emerging from e‐Government has led to the emergence of a new kind of citizen, the e‐citizen. ”Cities Page 6 which includes areas such as new means of marketing and more efficient organizational and managerial systems. Smart city technologies are being developed to address a range of issues, including energy management, water management, urban mobility, street lighting, and public safety, for example. These innovations are underpinned by general developments in areas such as wireless communications, sensor networks, data analytics, and cloud computing. The smart city concept is also driving new integrated approaches to city operations.\nSmart Infrastructure \nSmart Infrastructure designs will need to be anticipatory and proactive to be truly sustainable. Much like an ecosystem, these will contain many small-scale, networked elements that serve a multitude of uses, rather than one single guiding purpose for their existence. Urban community garden plots, for example, not only provide food for urban dwellers, but serve as storm water management systems, allowing water and waste to be recycled at the smallest scale with real-time sensors telling the centralized system how much less will have to be processed downstream. Cities will need to accurately measure current conditions, and model the future. Sensors and technological controls embedded within new and retrofitted urban designs could monitor existing conditions and provide real-time feedback in case modifications are needed\nSmart Building \nAt the most fundamental level, smart buildings deliver useful building services that make occupants productive (e.g. illumination, thermal comfort, air quality, physical security, sanitation, and many more) at the lowest cost and environmental impact over the building lifecycle. Reaching this vision requires adding intelligence from the beginning of design phase through to the end of the building's useful life. Smart buildings use information technology during operation to connect a variety of subsystems, which typically operate independently, so that these systems can share information to optimize total building performance. Smart buildings look beyond the building equipment within their four walls. They are connected and responsive to the smart power grid, and they interact with building operators and occupants to empower them with new levels of visibility and actionable information.\nSmart Healthcare \nThe application of new technologies in ways that affect health care, from diagnosis to monitoring patients, including the management of the organizations involved in these activities, is defined as Smart Healthcare. Smart Healthcare provides citizens with considerable advantages in terms of information, and even favors the availability of alternative diagnoses and of remote treatment or tele‐assistance. Through the use of new technologies, citizens can enjoy a number of on‐line medical services, including key services such as requesting an appointment on‐line or the possibility of having a digital record.\nGovernment Initiatives \nIndia plans 100 new smart cities and will develop modern satellite towns around exiting cities under the smart city program. Government of India has allocated Rs. 70.6 billion (USD 1.2 billion) for Smart Cities in budget 2014-15. “IBM prepared the Integrated Communication Technology (ICT) Master Plan for Dighi Port Industrial Area in the DMIC that also provides for the establishment of an Intelligent Operations. In Bangalore, Cisco is converting a 5 sq. km area around Electronics City, the IT-Hub in the city’s peripheries, into a Smart City.” “The Government plans 100 new cities and has allocated INR 70.6 billion for the year 2014-15” Smart Cities Page 12 Some of the key highlights under various parameters is listed below. \nSmart Governance\n  USD 83 million allocated for Digital India Initiative \n PPP model to be used to upgrade infrastructure in 500 urban areas\n  Plans to develop at least 2 smart cities in each of India’s 29 states\n  Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Limited (DMICDC) plans seven smart cities along the 1500 km industrial corridor across 6 states with total investment of USD 100 billion.\nSmart Energy \n Establish smart grid test bed and smart grid knowledge center \n Implementation of 8 smart grid pilot projects in India with investment of USD 10 million \n Addition of 88,000 MW of power generation capacity in the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) \n The Power Grid Corporation of India Limited has planned to invest USD 26 billion in the next five years. \n Installation of 130 million smart meters by 2021\nSmart Transport \n Ministry of Urban Development plans to invest more than USD 20 billion on the metro rail projects in coming years\n  India’s first monorail project at Mumbai will cost around USD 500 million, of which USD 183 million has been spent on phase I\nSmart Information and Communication \n Broadband connections to 175 million users by 2017\n  Under the flagship “Safe City” project, the Union Ministry proposes USD 333 million to make seven big cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Hyderabad) to focus on technological advancement rather than manpower\nSmart Buildings\n India is expected to emerge as the world’s 3rd largest construction market by 2020, by adding 11.5 million homes every year \n The Intelligent Building Management Systems market is around USD 621 million and is expected to reach USD 1,891 million by 2016\n  Smart Buildings will save up to 30 per cent of water usage, 40 percent of energy usage and reduction of building maintenance costs by 10 to 30 per cent\n\t\n2.1Existing Solution:\nIn the existing system city information can be known by the users by manually like city guides, roots maps, travel guides and through personally. The data contains regarding city on the books and manuals are not in a structural way. To search corresponding business information through books and manuals is a tedious process. The city will be increased day by day, lot of infrastructure can be update also, modifications are not possible these books and manuals. Once the book is printed, that’s information is final, if any modification are needed, it can be possible on the next released book only, dynamically data modification is not possible.\n To understand different symbols which are used in books and travel guides is a tedious job. User requirement are not satisfied through these books and Manuals. It is not possible to display lot of information in books and papers, while searching also it is a tedious job.\n2.2 Proposed Solution:\t\nCity Pilot search will help you to find what we are looking for, wherever we may be like read, dining and entertainment reviews and browse smart city search yellow pages to find recommended services like Emergency Services, Business Services, Transport services etc nearby you. \n\nCity information can be easy to remember and search. For any people use our service and 24X7X365 days people can access information from this system.  Customers give feedback through emails to the management. \n\n\t\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nThe system after careful analysis has been identified to be presented with the following modules Administrator, Customer/Guest, Services, Search, and Authentication.\nAdministrator\nThe role and responsibility of the administrator are the following:\nResponsible for maintaining the information regarding various services, he can have the privilege to add new details in to the system, if any modifications are needed regarding the information he can perform all these issues. Responsible for the Insert Emergency services like Ambulance, hospital, fire and police services. Each service is having the location details and contact numbers.  Responsible for maintaining the Transport information in the system, he can able to insert new transport service details, like Airways, Trains time tables, Road ways and city bus root guides and services with timing schedules. \nGuest/Customer\n\nGuest is treated as a citizen who can able to search city information using the system user interface.  Various services are displayed to customer based on his requirements like:- \nThe system interface provides city history and tourist place information to tourists, who can interest to visit in this city. Business information and company information is provided in the system user interface by category wise and alphabetical order, this can be very useful to customer to search their required criteria very well. \nRoad transport details are displayed; various transport buses are going out of the city and their schedules. City bus guide and city bus services from various important places from the city are displayed in the system interface. Displays the Bank and ATM Location of the city are displayed to customer. They can able to find the trains and airways timings which can be provided by the system. Hospital and Health centers information can be displayed to guests.\n\nSearch\nDifferent search facilities are provided to customers in this system. Normally search can be done on different criteria. For that purpose the system is having search capabilities like Simple Search, Category wise Search \nServices\n\n\tThe system contains various service information they are\n        1.

        "content": "APPLICATION FOR ONLINE EXAMINATION AND RESULTS SYSTEM\nAbstract\n\nTechnology has supported online examinations successfully for a number of years, and has progressively enhanced the online examination process over the years. However, some schools particularly public tertiary institutions in developing countries are still involved in the conventional manual system of writing examination. This manual system of writing examination has a lot of demerits.

This project is mainly focusing on the customized, dynamic generation of building construction plan.  This project is useful for the organization that runs construction business.  The system evaluates the available Land value in a wide range of measurement such as\n    • Square Feet\n    • Cent\n    • Acres\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 –INTRODUCTION\nConstruction planning is a fundamental and challenging activity in the management and execution of construction projects. It involves the choice of construction technologies, the definition of work tasks, the estimation of the required resources and durations for individual tasks, and the identification of any interactions or constraints among the different tasks. A good construction plan is the basis for developing the project budget and the schedule of work. Poor estimates or schedules can easily result in large construction cost increases or delays. Inappropriate or inconsistent decisions concerning the appropriate technologies to use can have similar effects. As a result, construction planning is crucial to the eventual success of a project.\nCurrent construction planning relies upon manual formulation of plans and is usually performed in an intuitive and unstructured fashion with considerable reliance on engineering judgment. Few computer based aids for activity scheduling exist other than general project templates or past project networks that can be adapted to the particulars of a new project Commercial scheduling systems require a complete construction plan as an input Descriptions of the characteristics of good project plans exist in the literature (see, for example, (Willis, 1986)), but little attention has been paid to analyzing the process by which plans are or should be formed (Baracco-Millcr, 1987).\nIn this paper, a knowledge intensive expert system for construction project planning is described. The system generates project activity networks, cost estimates and schedules, including the definition of activities, specification of precedence’s, selection of appropriate technologies and estimation of durations and costs. \nThe system includes three major components: \n1. Hierarchical representation structures to record information about project activities and decisions made during the planning process; \n2. A set of operators to perform specific planning tasks such as technology choice, activity duration estimation, or scheduling; and 3. a store of knowledge sources to provide relevant information for operations.\nExperience with a prototype of the overall system is also described. This prototype plans activities associated with site preparation, excavation, foundation construction, and structural erection for high rise buildings.\nThe construction planning expert system described here, called CONSTRUCTION PLANEX, is proposed for several reasons. First, this system provides a means to formalize the planning process so as to permit analysis and evaluation of different strategies and tasks within the overall process. By formalizing the various decisions and planning strategic, existing knowledge can be examined and gaps in knowledge or procedures highlighted. Many expert system development projects have had secondary effects of this sort (Shortleaf, 1976). Second, the system represents a framework for the development of automated planning assistants based on knowledge-based expert system and artificial intelligence programming techniques. \nThese techniques promise to have a revolutionary impact on construction engineering and management since they greatly expand the capability to manipulate and utilize qualitative and experiential information so prevalent in the construction field. In the realm of construction planning, the expert system is likely to work as an assistant to a planner to handle details of planning or to suggest alternatives. With an automated assistant, more detailed and accurate activity networks should be feasible and cost effective.\nFinally, the proposed system might provide a component for more extensive project control systems in which project monitoring or facility design are major goals. By facility design, we include the entire process of architecture and engineering design and facility fabrication. For project monitoring and adaptation of a plan over time, the expert system has the advantage of preserving a record of decision points and hierarchy among activities so that past decisions can be reviewed and modified in light of new events.\nThe next section briefly describes some background on the use of expert systems and artificial intelligence in planning. The following section describes the architecture of the CONSTRUCTION PLANEX system. Operation of the system is illustrated with a planning problem for a modular building. A concluding section summarizes preliminary results in the area.\n\n        1.1 Objectives\nA prototype knowledge intensive expert system to accomplish construction planning for modular high rise buildings, BUILDING CONSTRUCTION PLANNER, is described in this paper. This system generates project activity networks, cost estimates and schedules, including the definition of activities, specification of precedence’s, selection of appropriate technologies and estimation of durations and costs.\n\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\t\nSimilar to other knowledge-based expert systems, CONSTRUCTION PLAN has three essential parts as illustrated in The Context contains information on the particular project being considered, including the design, site characteristics, the planning decisions made, and the current project plan. The Operator Module contains operators that create, delete or modify the information stored in the context. Operators are used for different tasks such as technology choice, activity synthesis, duration estimation and others. Hie Knowledge-Base contains distinct knowledge sources of tables and rules specific to particular technology choices, activity durations, or other considerations. In addition to these three components, CONSTRUCTION PLAN contains a menu driven interface used to control the execution of the operators and a Knowledge Source Acquisition Module used to modify the contents of the Knowledge Base. The system is implemented in KNOWLEDGECRAFT on a Texas Instruments' EXPLORER™ computer.\nThese different frames are organized to represent the current project plan, decisions made during the planning process, and different aggregation schemes. Figure 5 shows the general structure of the context. On top of the hierarchy there are frames used to store information at the project, sector, block and floor levels. Below them there are trees for design elements, element activities and project activities. Element activities are linked to design elements, to element activity groups and to project activities. Decisions and computations undertaken during the planning process can be stored in any of the frames of this hierarchy and inherited by element activities. Furthermore, inherited values can be overridden by local decisions for particular cases. Thus, the set of activities can form a conventional project network while the system context contains a more extensive network which also records the planning process and other information.\nThe operator modules alter the system context by creating frames or modifying attributes. The exact modifications made are found by evaluating relevant knowledge sources in the knowledge base. In the initial creation of a construction plan, the following sequence of operations might be followed:\n• Create Element Activities for design elements\". This operation only identifies the set of element activities required to accomplish each design element. Other information is added to element activity frames using other operators. \n• Group Element Activities of common characteristics in order to have a hierarchy of element activities similar to that of the MASTERFORMAT. \n• Determine Amounts of Work for element activities. Geometric information is inherited from design element frames. \n• Select Units of Measure for element activities. Crew productivities or material quantities may be expressed in different units (eg. days instead of hours). In these cases, the system performs appropriate unit conversions. \n• Determine Material Packages for element activities. Material Packages should satisfy design specifications. \n• Create Project Activities that aggregate element activities.\n • Determine Precedence’s for project activities. Project activities can be structured into a project network.\n\nExisting Solution:\nAmong other concerns, construction planning involves the choice of construction technology, the definition of work tasks, the estimation of required resources and durations, the estimation of costs, and the preparation of a project schedule. A prototype knowledge intensive expert system to accomplish these tasks, CONSTRUCTION PLAN, is described in this paper. This system generates project activity networks, cost estimates and schedules, including the definition of activities, specification of precedence’s, selection of appropriate technologies and estimation of durations and costs. The CONSTRUCTION PLAN system could be useful as an automated assistant in routine planning, as a laboratory for the analysis and evaluation of planning strategies, and as a component for more extensive construction assistance systems involving design, site layout or project control. The current application for CONSTRUCTION PLAN is to plan modular high rise buildings, including excavation, foundation and structural construction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Solution:\t\nBased on the available Land Value the system will generate a building construction plan blue print and the model of the building.  The customization role will play in effect to the users who can also give an option of their own plan of construction of building such as \n    • Individual House / Villa\n    • Shopping Complex / Multiplex / Malls\n    • Apartments\nIf the customization is failure then the system will automatically generate the plan for constructing the building.\nThis System has been developed using PHP and MySQL\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nBy using contact information of worker, general public can communicate with workers from home only. Communication is possible among the workers, general public, contractors, and administrator.\n3.2 System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase. The problem is analyzed so that sufficient matter is provided to design a new system. Large problems are sub-divided into smaller once to make them understandable and easy for finding solutions. Same in this project all the task are sub-divided and categorized.\nSystem Modules:\n    • Administrator\n    • User\n    • Search\n    • Reports\n\nModule Description:\nSite Administrator\nAdministrator is treated as a super user in this system.

The person has to maintain the attendance record in registers and file using pen and paper. The problem with this approach is that it requires lots of paper which are the part of our non-renewable natural resources. We are in the age, where we have to think about sustainable development. Managing the attendance using mobile phones, provide an alternative way in this direction. Communication between teachers and the parent is also an important issue that should also be considered, because parent can only get the information about their ward after the interaction with teachers. So, we also tried to bring the system which enables parent to receive the information of their ward of regularity on daily basis.\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSihnCABJZk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n –INTRODUCTION\nAttendance is taken every day on each working day whether it is college, school or any other institution and in this process every institution wasted lots of paper just for keeping the record. With such small reasons, our natural resources are depleting at the enormous rate and it can be possible that our descendants don’t able to get those resources. It is also important to inform guardians of the students about the absence or presence of their ward. \nSome reputed schools and colleges are there, who do it by arranging meetings between them at a specific interval of time. But that’s not enough, parent need the report of their ward on regular basis. So, there is a need to solve this problem and automate this process so that for the absentees’ student, the sms or by any other means we should able to inform that their ward is absent. This could be very helpful for both the teachers and their guardians to keep an eye on their ward about their activity, his interest, their regularity etc. So, they can take appropriate action accordingly.\nMany systems and applications have been developed in this regard to solve the automating the process of attendance, but almost none of them fulfill the whole requirements. Many problems can be seen on those existing applications, some lack GUI, some lack automating the process of informing the care taker or guardians. There are software available for automating such problem of attendance but being the fact that desktop it consumes more energy or power consumption that the mobile.\nNowadays, attendance is generally taken on the piece of paper in register. Using mobile for taking attendance, consumes not only less energy but also helps in reducing the wastage of paper and can serve as green way for taking the attendance. Use of paper, nowadays can be eliminated by the use of mobile or automating the process of attendance. As now generally every person has a mobile device and thus can read the sms easily on the spot to get the status of their ward in their college or school.\nThus although there exists a system for implementing this feature as desktop application[11] for particular college or school or any other place, But with the mobile, we get solution that is green and eco -friendly i.e. consume less energy and power and also provide a good interface and easy to use for taking the attendance. Mobile being portable can help teachers or any other user to take attendance on their mobile and view the various statistics to analyze the attendance record of the student.\n \n        1.1 Objectives\nWe tried to implement a system which overcomes the limitations of the existing approach. Taking the attendance on mobile phones instead of traditional approach is one step forward to sustainable development. Doing the same work on mobile phones not only saves our resources but also enables the user to get easy and interactive access to the attendance records of student. We tried to make an application that can help the teacher to take attendance of the students through their own mobile device. What could me more interesting for that!!\nThe problem that guardians or parents are not able to get the status of their child time to time or we can say on daily basis. The application that we are building can allows teacher or any departmental head to take the attendance through their mobile devices, manage records, inform to their parents or guardians to the status of his/her child of what actually they are doing it. It provides a good interactive user interface to get the user of taking the attendance and he became able to send the sms to the mobile number given in the details of the students in the file. User should make sure that the mobile number entered is of their mobile device. So sending emails and sms or calling them individually is old process now. It reduces many things like energy coefficients thus green method and helps user to get reduce the effect of greenhouse gases.\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\t\nThis document will propose all features and procedures to develop the system.\n\nThis document specially containing details about objectives, scope limitation, process model, primary requirements, team development,  possible project risks, project schedule, and finally monitoring and reporting mechanisms.\n\nOn-line Exam System is very useful for Educational Institute to prepare an exam, safe the time that will take to check the paper and prepare mark sheets. It will help the Institute to testing of students and develop their skills. But the disadvantages for this system, it takes a lot of times when you prepare the exam at the first time for usage. And we are needs number of computers with the same number of students.\n\nThe effective use of \"On-line Exam System\", any Educational Institute or training centers can be use it to develop their strategy for putting the exams, and for getting better results in less time.\nObjectives and concentrations:\n    • Corporate between the data stored in the server of the Institution and our On-line Exam system. To deal with On-line System in an easy way and an efficient mannered. (connection process) \n    • Create strong and secrete data base that allow for any connection in a secret way, to prevent any outside or inside attacks.\n    • Specify a privilege for each person to allow each person use this system to create his own exam. And have a complete control on his exam.\n    • Allow each person to create more than one exam with different way to create variant questions.\n\n Existing Solution:\nIt is better than PC based system in many ways:\n 1. In an environment of inadequate and erratic Power (Electricity) supply, the Mobile phones are much better than the Computer; Desktop or Laptop. The Mobile phone requires a small fraction of the power requirement of Computers and has power storing batteries that tend to store power for a longer period, when compared to Laptops \n2. It provides mobility to the users to access the attendance record at any time and at any place. \n3. The Mobile Phone is relatively cheaper than the Computer on the average, so economically it has advantage over that. \n4. In an environment of poor maintenance culture, Mobile phones are less prone to malfunctioning when compared to Computers so; Cheaper Maintenance is the next added advantage for any system based on mobile phones. \n5. The reduction in Paper material being used in traditional method of pen and paper based attendance system, thus preserving the Forests of the world (the small phone can contain hundreds of thousands of pages of books, and written materials). It is a Green technology.\n 6. Availability wise also it is preferable, today mobile phone is available to every other person as compared to computer. So, any institution does not need to incur any extra cost while installing the system.\nProposed Solution:\t\nThe advantages of our system are as follow:\n Ease up the process of attendance. \n Easy Analysis of data. \n Better user interface. \n Made access to the record of attendance available 24X7.\n  Reduced dependency on natural resources for paper.\n  Easy generation of summary of attendance.\n Make the process of attendance a green process.\n  Provide communication between teachers and parents. \n Automatic SMS will be sent to parents to inform the status of their ward whether present or absent in the institution.\nLimitations\nInforming the parents for their child attendance status regularly can be irritating if they are not interested. \n Small screen of the mobile is a big limitation and can leads to difficulty in marking the attendance of the system.\n  Limited storage capacity of the mobile is also a limitation in the system and due to this large number of records can’t be kept in the mobile. \n It can be a little bit costly for the teacher to send the sms from the mobile every time she takes attendance in the class in case he/she has not used message card.\n  Speed of the OS of the mobile is less than the computer if compared with computer so it has speed limitations if compared with computer based attendance system.\n\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nUser\nThe different menu options that the user have to choose from like\n    • Creating the class,\n    • Take attendance, \n    • View the attendance record, \n    • Search the attendance of particular student, \n    • Inserting the new student in the class, \n    • Edit details of the existing student in the class and \n    • The last is deleting the class.\n3.2 System Features\nThis section gives a functional requirement that applicable to the Daily Attendance System. \nThere are two sub modules in this phase.\n    • User module.\n    • Administrator module.\nAdministrator:\n    • Can create/delete an account.\n    • Can view the student’s accounts.\n    • Can change the password.\n    • Insert/delete/edit the information of available on daily attendance system.\nCan access all the accounts of the faculty members/students\n The Administrator can be done the following: \n    • Create/delete accounts (add list of his student)\n    • Change password for Student\n    • Create/ delete/update courses (subject).\n\n\n\n\n",

The CIBIL scores are monitored by the Reserve Bank of India. Here our proposed system uses the term of providing awareness about the CIBIL score. The web application collects the information with about the client details like PAN card number, Loans , Dues dates, Area of interest, Job details and so. Based on the due dates the web application will send a message to the registered E-mail address and the register mobile number before ten days of the due date. According to the reply the application will act accordingly. By having partnership with the CIBIL system and the part-time jobs sector, the web application can be monitored and detect the values of score, and also assign the various part time job to the client ,which ultimately results in the term of earning money and able to repay the amount within the time. And the web applications clients are periodically monitored and encouraged to keep them a constant and good scores in their CIBIL score.\nKeywords: Bank loans, EMI, CIBIL score, Credit score, Dues.\n\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0xgntXvF00\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nCHAPTER 1 –INTRODUCTION\n\nIf you want to take a home loan, you cannot afford to ignore the Credit Information Bureau of India Limited (CIBIL) score. The CIBIL score helps lenders decide whether to grant you a home loan. \nWill you lend lakhs of money to a friend if you have heard that his repayment track has always been clean? May be not. But if you have a registered and an authorized agency which is into the business of establishing credit scores based on reliable facts and sources of information, then you might turn out to be a 'friend indeed' to this 'friend in need'. This is exactly why banks and financial institutions check CIBIL scores. It gives lenders a snapshot of your credit health and history, and your willingness and ability to repay debts on time.\nThe CIBIL score plays a very important role in Indian financial system because it helps home loan applicants secure credit quickly. The CIBIL score is a numeric figure that sums up the credit history of prospective home loan buyers and helps them to get their home loan applications approved. CIBIL scores are determined based on several facts and details like the borrower's payment history, number and types of loan accounts, outstanding and opening loan amounts, credit enquiries and guarantors on the loan, if any. \nBanks and financial institutions have their own benchmarks that counts as a good CIBIL score. For example, there may be lenders who reject home loan applications with a CIBIL score of 550. There may be lenders in the same market who consider cases with a score of 550 for assessment (i.e. after scrutinizing applications based on other parameters).\nYou can improve your CIBIL Score by maintaining a good credit history, which is essential for loan approvals by lenders. Follow these 6 steps which will help you better your score:\n    • Always pay your dues on time: Late payments are viewed negatively by lenders\n    • Keep your balances low: Always be prudent to not use too much credit, control your utilization.\n    • Maintain a healthy mix of credit: It is better to have a healthy mix of secured (such as home loan, auto loan) and unsecured loans (such as personal loan, credit cards). Too many unsecured loans may be viewed negatively.\n    • Apply for new credit in moderation: You don’t want to reflect that you are continuously seeking excessive credit; apply for new credit cautiously.\n    • Monitor your co-signed, guaranteed and joint accounts monthly: In co-signed, guaranteed or jointly held accounts, you are held equally liable for missed payments. Your joint holder’s (or the guaranteed individual) negligence could affect your ability to access credit when you need it.\n    • Review your credit history frequently throughout the year: Monitor your CIBIL Score and Report regularly to avoid unpleasant surprises in the form of a rejected loan application.\n\n\n        1.1 Objectives\nUsing this application user will get the CIBIL score notification and the Job recommendation.

Okesola, Kennedy O. Okokpujie, Adeyinka A. Adewale, Samuel N. John, Osemwegie Omoruyi - Credit scoring is a decision tool used by organizations to grant or reject credit requests from their customers. Series of artificial intelligent and traditional approaches have been used to building credit scoring model and credit risk evaluation. Despite being ranked amongst the top 10 algorithm in Data mining, Naïve Bayesian algorithm has not been extensively used in building credit score cards. Using demographic and material indicators as input variables, this paper investigate the ability of Bayesian classifier towards building credit scoring model in banking sector.\nPradeep Singh - Credit Scoring is the primary method for classifying loan applicants into two classes, namely credible payers and defaulters. In general, credit score is the primary indicator of creditworthiness of the person. This credit scoring technique is used by banks and other money lenders to build a probabilistic predictive model, called a scorecard for estimating the probability of defaulters. In the current global scenario, credit scoring is a major tool for risk evaluation and risk management for all the existing and emerging economies. With the introduction of Basel II Accord, Credit scoring has gained much significance in retail credit industry. In this paper, we performed an extensive comparative in order to classify the credit scoring and identification of best classifier. Furthermore, we used two different categories of classifiers i.e. individual and ensemble. Identification of optimal machine-learning methods for credit scoring applications is a crucial step towards stable creditworthiness of the person. Different parameters Accuracy, AUC, F-measure, precision and recall are used for the evaluation of the results.\nWei Li, Jibiao Liao - This paper investigates the credit scoring accuracy of five data mining technologies for bank credit cards: C5.0 decision tree, neural network, chi-squared automatic interaction detector, stepwise logistic model and classification and regression tree. Firstly, we extract a comprehensive variable from the raw data by using principle component analysis to indicate the customers' default or not. Then we build the credit scoring models using data mining technologies and compare forecasting effects of the five models. Finally, we discuss how to classify non-defaulting applicants by using stepwise logistic model extensively.\nJasmina Nalić, Amar Švraka - The aim of this paper is to present a Credit Scoring Model applied by one Microfinance Institution in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as to show how the most relevant attributes for its implementation were identified. The purpose of created Credit Scoring Model was to predict default clients and reduce credit risk of Microfinance Institution by applying data mining algorithm in order to find patterns for recognition of default clients and, thus, support decision making process of credit approval. Credit Scoring Model was build using Oracle Data Miner software package that uses Generalized Linear Model for classification. Created model showed great predictive confidence and accuracy, but also gave trustworthy results regarding feature selection, so the Microfinance institution decided to adopt this model as help in decision making process.\nMinghui Jiang, Shuang Yin, Xuchuan Yuan - Personal credit scoring plays an important role for commercial banks to keep away from consumer credit risks. This paper used neural networks for personal credit scoring and used two evolutional algorithms of genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to train the networks to construct a GA neural network and a PSO neural network respectively. The two neural networks were used to classify the consumer credit data of commercial banks. Compared with BP neural network, the results indicate that GA network and PSO network get lower accuracies on training samples, but on testing samples, the accuracies of GA network and PSO network are higher than that of BP network by 0.38% and 0.76% respectively. On modelpsilas robustness, the accuracy differences on the two groups of samples of GA network and PSO network are lower than that of BP network by 2.08% and 1.33% respectively, which indicate that GA neural network and PSO neural network get a better robustness.\nAntariksha Bhaduri - Credit scoring has become a very important task in the credit industry and its use has increased at a phenomenal speed through the mass issue of credit cards since the 1960s. Credit scoring models have been widely studied in the areas of statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). Many novel approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), rough sets, or decision trees have been proposed to increase the accuracy of credit scoring models. artificial immune systems (AIS) which are algorithm developed with inspiration from natural immune system processes have been used to solve various kinds of real life processes with success. Various AIS algorithms like AIRS, CLONALG, Immunos etc have been proposed. This paper explores the possibility of application of various artificial immune system algorithms to credit scoring problem and compares the results with other methodologies. Experiments are done against two benchmark data sets and results presented with respect to other algorithms to help credit analysts chose from various methodologies.\nCitation Map \nYan-qin Fan, You-long Yang, Yang-sen Qin - According to the features of high dimensional, nonlinear and redundant of the Credit Scoring data, the establishment of a model for credit scoring has a direct bearing on the complexity of personal credit scoring process and the collection of characteristic parameters reflecting the credit scoring status constitutes an important link for setting up a efficient model,to resolve the problem that it is difficult to reduce the dimension and the classification accuracy rate is low in traditional methods, a novel Credit Scoring model is proposed based on Principal Component Analysis and improved tree augmented Bayesian Classification. It first uses principal component analysis to eliminate redundant information and simplify the Bayesian network's inputs. Then establishes an improved tree augmented Bayesian Classification models for personal credit scoring. The algorithms have been validated experimentally by using real data. Theoretical and experimental results show a performance competitive with the state-of-the-art and higher classification accuracy.\n\nEXISTING SYSTEM:\nIn the present system a user can be reminded with the calculated CIBIL score based on the repayment of the loans that the user availed. This often requires a lot of time and effort as it a manual system of the admins. A customer may not get the desired information from these offices and often the customer may be misguided. It is tedious for a user to get a proper guidance to repay the loan due.\nPROPOSED SYSTEM:\nThe proposed system is a web based automated application and maintains a centralized repository of all related information. The system maintains the records of the loan details for every user. Also it calculates the CIBIL score known as credit score based on the repayment ability of the user. On a regular basis it notifies the users to pay their loan amount. If the user didn’t pay their loan amount it will recommend them the Job offer to help them maintain the credit score.\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nThe system is proposed to have the following modules: This app enhanced level of categories for Tourism App.\n3.2 System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase.

It will thus help remove current impediments to investments in urban areas, and, also produce property titles in rural areas. The objective of this project is to prevent the selling of the agricultural areas and to avoid the illegal registration of the owned lands by using the forgery document with the implementation of the web application.\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTt0MHtRuy0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nINTRODUCTION\nSurveying and land surveying is the measurement and mapping of our surrounding environment using mathematics, specialized technology and equipment. Surveyors measure just about anything on the land, in the sky or on the ocean bed. They even measure polar ice-caps.\nLand surveyors work in the office and in the field – from suits to boots. Out in the field, they use the latest technology such as high order GPS, Robotic Total Stations (Theodolites), and aerial and terrestrial scanners to map an area, making computations and taking photos as evidence.\nIn the office, Surveyors then use sophisticated software, such as Auto-cad to draft plans and map the onsite measurements. Surveyors work on a diverse variety of projects from land subdivision and mining exploration, to tunnel building and major construction, which means no two days are the same. They are experts in determining land size and measurement. They also give advice and provide information to guide the work of engineers, architects and developers.\nSurveying is related to the broad areas of Spatial Science or Geospatial Science. Spatial means “the relative place or location of something”. Spatial Science helps to understand the relationship between the community and the environment to help predict trends and patterns. Surveying is first done to establish the boundaries, and Spatial Technologies are used to interpret and report on the data.\nThis data is used whenever we search on Google Maps or track a location on a GPS unit. Other Spatial professionals will use the data to help establish trends or predict changes to the environment such as the spread of the Queensland Floods in 2011.\nLand Surveying is one of the oldest professions in the world. The first land surveys date back to nearly 3,000 years ago, when Egyptian Surveyors subdivided the fertile land around the Nile River and worked on re-marking the land after the annual flooding of the Nile River.\nThe early settlement of Australia also required help from Land Surveyors. The majority of famous early explorers including Burke and Wills had a Surveying background and their work allowed the land to be settled, by defining property boundaries in the city and the country. Back then Surveyors used primitive technology including chains and steel bands, which made their measurements difficult to record and often required the use of logarithmic tables and slide rulers.\nWe depend on Surveying to ensure order in the physical world around us. Surveyors play an integral role in land development, from the planning and design of land subdivisions through to the final construction of roads, utilities and landscaping.\nSurveyors are among good company, working closely with their peers in the fields of engineering, architecture, geology and planning. Their role underpins these industries; Surveyors are the first people on any construction site, measuring and mapping the land. These primary measurements are then used by architects to understand and make the most of the unique landscape when designing and engineers to plan structures accurately and safely, ensuring buildings not only fit with the landscape but are able to be constructed.\n    • Surveying provides a great diversity of indoor and outdoor work, meaning you won’t be chained to a desk.\n    • There is job variety; you can choose to work in many different industries from IT to Archaeology.\n    • The high demand for Surveyors means it’s easy to get a job, 95% of students find work within 4 months after graduating.\n    • The salaries are excellent; graduates earn an average of 55-60k p.a\n    • Surveyors have access to the latest technology and equipment.\n    • Surveyors can work for themselves, in private firms or in government departments.\n\n\n\n        1.1 Objectives\nThe objective of this project is to prevent the selling of the agricultural areas and to avoid the illegal registration of the owned lands by using the forgery document. \n\n\n LITERATURE REVIEW\t\n\nSurveying or land surveying is the technique, profession, and science of determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional position of points and the distances and angles between them. A land surveying professional is called a land surveyor. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish land maps and boundaries for ownership, locations like building corners or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales.\nSurveyors work with elements of geometry, trigonometry, regression analysis, physics, engineering, metrology, programming languages and the law. They use equipment like total stations, robotic total stations, GPS receivers, retro reflectors, 3D scanners, radios, handheld tablets, digital levels, drones, GIS and surveying software.\nSurveying has been an element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history. The planning and execution of most forms of construction require it. It is also used in transport, communications, mapping, and the definition of legal boundaries for land ownership. It is an important tool for research in many other scientific disciplines.\nShields and Rangarajan (2013) distinguish between the process of reviewing the literature and a finished work or product known as a literature review.[5]:193–229 The process of reviewing the literature is often ongoing and informs many aspects of the empirical research project. All of the latest literature should inform a research project. Scholars need to be scanning the literature long after a formal literature review product appears to be completed.\nA careful literature review is usually 15 to 30 pages and could be longer. The process of reviewing the literature requires different kinds of activities and ways of thinking.[6] Shields and Rangarajan (2013) and Granello (2001) link the activities of doing a literature review with Benjamin Bloom’s revised taxonomy of the cognitive domain (ways of thinking: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating). \nThe first category in Bloom's taxonomy is remembering. For a person doing a literature review this would include tasks such as recognition, retrieval and recollection of the relevant literature. During this stage relevant books, articles, monographs, dissertations, etc. are identified and read. Bloom’s second category understanding occurs as the scholar comprehends the material they have collected and read. This step is critical because no one can write clearly about something they do not understand. Understanding may be challenging because the literature could introduce the scholar to new terminology, conceptual framework and methodology. Comprehension (particularly for new scholars) is often improved by taking careful notes. In Bloom’s third category applying the scholar is able to make connections between the literature and his or her larger research project. This is particularly true if the literature review is to be a chapter in a future empirical study. The literature review begins to inform the research question, and methodological approaches. When scholars analyze (fourth category in Bloom's taxonomy) they are able to separate material into parts and figure out how the parts fit together. Analysis of the literature allows the scholar to develop frameworks for analysis and the ability to see the big picture and know how details from the literature fit within the big picture. Analysis facilitates the development of an outline (list). The books, articles and monographs read will be of different quality and value. When scholars use Bloom’s fifth category evaluating they are able to see the strengths and weaknesses of the theories, arguments, methodology and findings of the literature they have collected and read.[7] When scholars engage in creating the final category in Bloom's taxonomy, they bring creativity to the process of doing a literature review. In other words, they draw new and original insights from the literature. They may be able to find a fresh and original research question, identify a heretofore, unknown gap in the literature or make surprising connections. By understanding how ways of thinking connect to tasks of a literature review, a scholar is able to be self-reflective and bring metacognition to the process of reviewing the literature.[5]\nMost of these tasks occur before the writing even begins. The process of reviewing the literature and writing a literature review can be complicated and lengthy. It is helpful to bring a system of organization and planning to the task. When an orderly system can be designed, it is easier to keep track of the articles, books, materials read, notes, outlines and drafts.\nThe primary purpose of surveys is to describe the self-reported characteristics of a population (Baxter & Babbie, 2004; Fraenkel & Wallen, 2006). Surveys usually fall into one of two major categories (Fraenkel & Wallen, 2006). The first of these is the cross-sectional survey. A cross-sectional survey collects information from a sample that has been drawn from a predetermined population and is collected at just one point in time (Dillman, 2000; Groves, Cialdini, & Couper, 1992). These surveys are ideal for information that is to be used for a current project or to reflect current public opinion. Examples include political polls on how people plan to vote or surveys asking a customer to rate his or her satisfaction with a sale transaction. These differ from longitudinal surveys where information is collected at different points in time in order to study changes over time (Billiet & Loosveldt, 1988; Groves, Cialdini, & Couper, 1992). Sometimes a series of cross-sectional surveys may be used to assess longitudinal implications, but statistical measures must be considered in these situations (Arleck & Settle, 2004; Fraenkel & Wallen, 2004). Additionally, sometimes one survey will be administered and a brief period of time later the exact same survey will be administered to the same person (Fraenkel & Wallen, 2006). This usually does not constitute a longitudinal survey, but rather demonstrates a method often used to verify survey data (for more on this type of data safeguard, see the literature review on Re-Interview Design).\nIf an organization or individual determines they wish to conduct a survey, many rigid procedures must be followed in order to ensure the validity and reliability of the survey (de Leeuw & van der Zouwen, 1988; Foddy, 1993; Fraenkel & Wallen, 2006; Singleton & Straits, 2002). This includes conducting an appropriate probability sampling procedure (see the Sampling literature review); standardized measurement, meaning the probability sample comes from the entire population for which the survey will make claims; and ensuring the survey questions are unbiased and measure what is claiming to be represented in the survey results (Foddy, 1993). To begin this process, it is important to first define the problem the survey seeks to solve (Fraenkel & Wallen, 2006). This may be confusing for those new at constructing surveys, as oftentimes the information being sought through a survey is not naturally seen as a problem. For this research method, then, the research designer must problematize the issue the survey covers by turning it into a question. For instance, if a political advisor wanted to know if her candidate was going to win the election, she might create the question, “Who will vote for my candidate?” The problem this question inherently represents, then, is that the campaign manager does not know how likely her candidate is to win. By asking the question, she in turn solves her problem.\nAfter defining the problem and posing a question, the survey administrator needs to identify the target population to who this question would be asked (Baxter & Babbie, 2004; Fraenkel & Wallen, 2006). In order to do this, the survey administrator must take into account everyone who could possibly be represented by the survey; and must not include anyone who could not be affected by the survey (Foddy, 1993). In the political advisor example, those who are not registered to vote would be discounted because they could not vote for the candidate even if they wanted to – so, in order to keep her survey sound, she would only include those who were registered to vote. She would also only ask those in the voting district where the candidate would be on the ballot. She would have to continue thinking of people who should be included and excluded until the list is exhausted. After the target population has been identified, the mode of data collection is considered (Briggs, 1986; Fowler, 1995; Lavrakas, 1993; Shuy, 2002; Weinberg, 1983). This largely depends upon financial resources, human resources, time frame, accessibility, and other issues that can act as catalysts or deterrents to collecting survey responses (Arleck & Settle, 2004; Fowler, 2002; Singleton & Straits, 2002). Approaches include convenience samples where the group being surveyed is all in one location at one time and the survey administrator can approach the group (although these situations are highly rare) (Baxter & Babbie, 2004), mail administration, telephone interviewing, and face-to-face interviews (see the Interview/Re-Interview literature review for more details on administration). Finally, the sample will be selected (Arleck & Settle, 2004). The sample must be methodically chosen using specific techniques (these are addressed in the Sampling literature review later in this series).\n\n\n\nEXISTING SYSTEM:\n    • Its manual process for earlier system.\n    • Its chance to lose our record or data.\n    • If we search any details for old records its take more time consuming process.\n    • We can search only few category details.\nPROPOSED SYSTEM:\n    • Here using fully automated system.\n    • We established new Advance technology and hardware system.\n    • Collect pervious (more than 100) records maintain this system. \n    • We can search all details about one land.\n\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\nThe system is proposed to have the following modules: This app enhanced level of categories for Tourism App.\n3.2 System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase. The problem is analyzed so that sufficient matter is provided to design a new system. Large problems are sub-divided into smaller once to make them understandable and easy for finding solutions. Same in this project all the task are sub-divided and categorized.\nSystem Modules:\n    • ADMIN\n    • USER\nADMIN\n    • Login\n    • Post Land Survey Details\nUSER\n    • Register\n    • Login\n    • View Survey Details\n\n\n\n\nModule Description\nLogin Module\nThe main activities in the application are the user login page for user. The other modules are followed by this login page. This module records only user and password of the user. \nRegistration Module\nAnother main function of our proposed system is registration, in order to register with the unique application details such as name; password, email, place and time are required.\nADMIN\n    • Post Land Survey Details\nAdmin can only post land survey details. Like Land’s 1st party, 2nd party, Survey No, Location, Lat & Long, Landmark, and Details of Square Feet’s and so on.\nUSER\n    • View Land Details\nUser can view who admin posted details. Those details about survey land.\n\n\n – DESIGN\nDesign is the first step in the development phase for any techniques and principles for the purpose of defining a device, a process or system in sufficient detail to permit its physical realization.\nOnce the software requirements have been analyzed and specified the software design involves three technical activities - design, coding, implementation and testing that are required to build and verify the software.\nThe design activities are of main importance in this phase, because in this activity, decisions ultimately affecting the success of the software implementation and its ease of maintenance are made. These decisions have the final bearing upon reliability and maintainability of the system. Design is the only way to accurately translate the customer’s requirements into finished software or a system.\nDesign is the place where quality is fostered in development. Software design is a process through which requirements are translated into a representation of software. Software design is conducted in two steps. Preliminary design is concerned with the transformation of requirements into data.\n\n4.1UML Diagrams:\nUML stands for Unified Modeling Language. UML is a language for specifying, visualizing and documenting the system. This is the step while developing any product after analysis. The goal from this is to produce a model of the entities involved in the project which later need to be built. The representation of the entities that are to be used in the product being developed need to be designed.\nThere are various kinds of methods in software design:\n\n    • Use case Diagram\n    • Sequence Diagram\n    • Collaboration Diagram\n4.1.1Usecase Diagrams:\t\nUse case diagrams model behavior within a system and helps the developers understand of what the user require. The stick man represents what’s called an actor. Use case diagram can be useful for getting an overall view of the system and clarifying who can do and more importantly what they can’t do.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse case diagram consists of use cases and actors and shows the interaction between the use case and actors.\n    • The purpose is to show the interactions between the use case and actor.\n    • To represent the system requirements from user’s perspective.\n    • An actor could be the end-user of the system or an external system\n\n4.1.2 Sequence Diagram:\nSequence diagram and collaboration diagram are called INTERACTION DIAGRAMS. An interaction diagram shows an interaction, consisting of set of objects and their relationship including the messages that may be dispatched among them.\n\n\n\nA sequence diagram is an introduction that empathizes the time ordering of messages. Graphically a sequence diagram is a table that shows objects arranged along the X-axis and messages ordered in increasing time along the Y-axis.\n\n4.1.3 Collaborate Diagram:\nA collaboration diagram, also called a communication diagram or interaction diagram, is an illustration of the relationships and interactions among software objects in the Unified Modeling Language (UML).\n\nOUTPUT SCREENSHOTS\n\nMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\n6.1 Introduction to Html Framework\nHyper Text Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology used to create web pages, as well as to create user interfaces for mobile and web applications. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.\nHTML elements form the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML allows images and other objects to be embedded and it can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structuralsemantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> introduce content into the page directly. Others such as <p>...</p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\nHTML can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages. HTML markup can also refer the browser to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the look and layout of text and other material.\nHyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[1] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\nHTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> introduce content into the page directly. Others such as <p>...</p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\nHTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.\nHTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: <p>[61]\nIn the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a \"start tag\" <p> and \"end tag\" </p>. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.\nTags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.\nThe start tag may also include attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the <img> used to embed images, the reference to the image resource.\nSome elements, such as the line break <br>, do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.\nMany tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element <p>, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML coders.\nThe general form of an HTML element is therefore: <tag attribute1=\"value1\" attribute2=\"value2\">''content''</tag>. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form <tag attribute1=\"value1\" attribute2=\"value2\">. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the <br> tag or the inline <img> tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, \"/\", and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.\n\n\n6.2 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\nCSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG andXUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. \nCSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content, such as semantically insignificant tables that were widely used to format pages before consistent CSS rendering was available in all major browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate presentation instructions from the HTML content in a separate file or style section of the HTML file. For each matching HTML element, it provides a list of formatting instructions. For example, a CSS rule might specify that \"all heading 1 elements should be bold\", leaving pure semantic HTML markup that asserts \"this text is a level 1 heading\" without formatting code such as a<bold> tag indicating how such text should be displayed.\nThis separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (when read out by a speech-based browser orscreen reader) and on Braille-based, tactile devices. It can also be used to display the web page differently depending on the screen size or device on which it is being viewed. Although the author of a web page typically links to a CSS file within the markup file, readers can specify a different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author has specified. If the author or the reader did not link the document to a style sheet, the default style of the browser will be applied. Another advantage of CSS is that aesthetic changes to the graphic design of a document (or hundreds of documents) can be applied quickly and easily, by editing a few lines in one file, rather than by a laborious (and thus expensive) process of crawling over every document line by line, changing markup.\nThe CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities (or weights) are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.[1] Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media.

Readers can also specify a different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author specified.\nChanges to the graphic design of a document (or hundreds of documents) can be applied quickly and easily, by editing a few lines in the CSS file they use, rather than by changing markup in the documents.\nThe CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities (or weights) are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.\nThe CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.\n\n6.3 MYSQL Server\n\tMySQL  is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS);[6] in July 2013, it was the world's second most widely used RDBMS, and the most widely used open-source client–server model RDBMS. It is named after co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, My. The SQL acronym stands for Structured Query Language. The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedishcompany MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation. For proprietary use, several paid editions are available, and offer additional functionality.\nMySQL (officially pronounced as /maɪ ˌɛskjuːˈɛl/ \"My S-Q-L\",[6]) is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).[7] Its name is a combination of \"My\", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius' daughter,[8] and \"SQL\", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation.[9] For proprietary use, several paid editions are available, and offer additional functionality.\nMySQL is a central component of the LAMP open-source web application software stack (and other \"AMP\" stacks). LAMP is an acronym for \"Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python\". Applications that use the MySQL database include: TYPO3, MODx, Joomla, WordPress, phpBB, MyBB, and Drupal. MySQL is also used in many high-profile, large-scale websites, including [10][11] (though not for searches), Facebook,[12][13][14]Twitter,[15] Flickr,[16] and YouTube.\n6.4PHP\nPHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by RasmusLerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for therecursive backronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. \nPHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management system and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHPinterpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface(CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.\nThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system andplatform, free of charge. \nThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as a de facto standard. Since 2014 work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\nPHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994,[4] the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Development Team.[5] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[4] but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[6]\nPHP code may be embedded into HTML or HTML5 code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks.

Since 2014 work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\nInstead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does \"something\" (in this case, output \"Hi, I'm a PHP script!\"). The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of \"PHP mode.\"\nWhat distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.\nThe best things in using PHP are that it is extremely simple for a newcomer, but offers many advanced features for a professional programmer. Don't be afraid reading the long list of PHP's features. You can jump in, in a short time, and start writing simple scripts in a few hours.\nAlthough PHP's development is focused on server-side scripting, you can do much more with it.

It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel(MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.\nThe AngularJS framework works by first reading the HTML page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag attributes. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.\nAccording to JavaScript analytics service Libscore, AngularJS is used on the websites of Wolfram Alpha, NBC,Walgreens, Intel, Sprint, ABC News, and approximately 8,400 other sites out of 1 million tested in July 2015. \nAngularJS is the frontend part of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework, Angular.js itself, and Node.js runtime environment. AngularJS (commonly referred to as \"Angular.js\" or \"AngularJS 1.X\") is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework mainly maintained by  and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. The JavaScript components complement Apache Cordova, the framework used for developing cross-platform mobile apps. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications. In 2014, the original AngularJS team began working on Angular (Application Platform).\nThe AngularJS framework works by first reading the HTML page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag attributes. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.\nAccording to JavaScript analytics service Libscore, AngularJS is used on the websites of Wolfram Alpha, NBC, Walgreens, Intel, Sprint, ABC News, and approximately 12,000 other sites out of 1 million tested in October 2016.[3]AngularJS is the 6th most starred project of all time on GitHub.[4]\nAngularJS is the frontend part of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework, Angular.js itself, and Node.js server runtime environment.\nAngularJS is built on the belief that declarative programming should be used to create user interfaces and connect software components, while imperative programming is better suited to defining an application's business logic.[5] The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to present dynamic content through two-way data-binding that allows for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS de-emphasizes explicit DOM manipulation with the goal of improving testability and performance.\nAngularJS's design goals include: to decouple DOM manipulation from application logic. The difficulty of this is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured. To decouple the client side of an application from the server side. This allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides. To provide structure for the journey of building an application: from designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.\nAngular implements the MVC pattern to separate presentation, data, and logic components.[6] Using dependency injection, Angular brings traditionally server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server can be reduced.\n\nSYSTEM STUDY\n\n7.1 FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe feasibility of the project is analyzed in this phase and business proposal is put forth with a very general plan for the project and some cost estimates. During system analysis the feasibility study of the proposed system is to be carried out. This is to ensure that the proposed system is not a burden to the company.  For feasibility analysis, some understanding of the major requirements for the system is essential.\nThree key considerations involved in the feasibility analysis are\t\n    • ECONOMICAL FEASIBILITY\n    • TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY\n    • SOCIAL FEASIBILITY\n    • \nECONOMICAL FEASIBILITY\n  This study is carried out to check the economic impact that the system will have on the organization. The amount of fund that the company can pour into the research and development of the system is limited. The expenditures must be justified. Thus the developed system as well within the budget and this was achieved because most of the technologies used are freely available. Only the customized products had to be purchased. \n\n\n-TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY\n\n       This study is carried out to check the technical feasibility, that is, the technical requirements of the system. Any system developed must not have a high demand on the available technical resources. This will lead to high demands on the available technical resources. This will lead to high demands being placed on the client. The developed system must have a modest requirement, as only minimal or null changes are required for implementing this system.   \nSOCIAL FEASIBILITY\n The aspect of study is to check the level of acceptance of the system by the user. This includes the process of training the user to use the system efficiently. The user must not feel threatened by the system, instead must accept it as a necessity. The level of acceptance by the users solely depends on the methods that are employed to educate the user about the system and to make him familiar with it. His level of confidence must be raised so that he is also able to make some constructive criticism, which is welcomed, as he is the final user of the system.\n8.1Non Functional Requirements\n\tNon-functional requirements are the quality requirements that stipulate how well software does what it has to do. These are Quality attributes of any system; these can be seen at the execution of the system and they can also be the part of the system architecture.\n\n\n\n8.2 Accuracy:\nThe system will be accurate and reliable based on the design architecture. If there is any problem in the accuracy then the system will provide alternative ways to solve the problem. \n\n8.3 Usability:\nThe proposed system will be simple and easy to use by the users. The users will comfort in order to communicate with the system. The user will be provided with an easy interface of the system.\n\n8.4 Accessibility:\nThe system will be accessible through internet and there should be no any known problem.\n\n        8.5 Performance:\nThe system performance will be at its best when performing the functionality of the system.\n\n\n        8.6 Reliability:\nThe proposed system will be reliable in all circumstances and if there is any problem that will be affectively handle in the design.\n\n        8.7 Security:\nThe proposed system will be highly secured; every user will be required registration and username/password to use the system. The system will do the proper authorization and authentication of the users based on their types and their requirements. The proposed system will be designed persistently to avoid any misuse of the application.\n\nSYSTEM TESTING\n\n            The purpose of testing is to discover errors. Testing is the process of trying to discover every conceivable fault or weakness in a work product. It provides a way to check the functionality of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and/or a finished product It is the process of exercising software with the intent of ensuring that the\nSoftware system meets its requirements and user expectations and does not fail in an unacceptable manner. There are various types of test. Each test type addresses a specific testing requirement.\n\nTYPES OF TESTS\n\nUnit testing\n          Unit testing involves the design of test cases that validate that the internal program logic is functioning properly, and that program inputs produce valid outputs. All decision branches and internal code flow should be validated. It is the testing of individual software units of the application .it is done after the completion of an individual unit before integration. This is a structural testing, that relies on knowledge of its construction and is invasive. Unit tests perform basic tests at component level and test a specific business process, application, and/or system configuration. Unit tests ensure that each unique path of a business process performs accurately to the documented specifications and contains clearly defined inputs and expected results.\nIntegration testing\nIntegration tests are designed to test integrated software components to determine if they actually run as one program.  Testing is event driven and is more concerned with the basic outcome of screens or fields. Integration tests demonstrate that although the components were individually satisfaction, as shown by successfully unit testing, the combination of components is correct and consistent. Integration testing is specifically aimed at   exposing the problems that arise from the combination of components.\n\nFunctional test\n Functional tests provide systematic demonstrations that functions tested are available as specified by the business and technical requirements, system documentation, and user manuals.\nFunctional testing is centered on the following items:\nValid Input               :  identified classes of valid input must be accepted.\nInvalid Input             : identified classes of invalid input must be rejected.\nFunctions                  : identified functions must be exercised.\nOutput           \t   : identified classes of application outputs must be exercised.\nSystems/Procedures: interfacing systems or procedures must be invoked.\n\n     Organization and preparation of functional tests is focused on requirements, key functions, or special test cases. In addition, systematic coverage pertaining to identify Business process flows; data fields, predefined processes, and successive processes must be considered for testing. Before functional testing is complete, additional tests are identified and the effective value of current tests is determined.\n\nSystem Test\n     System testing ensures that the entire integrated software system meets requirements. It tests a configuration to ensure known and predictable results. An example of system testing is the configuration oriented system integration test. System testing is based on process descriptions and flows, emphasizing pre-driven process links and integration points.\n\nWhite Box Testing\n        White Box Testing is a testing in which in which the software tester has knowledge of the inner workings, structure and language of the software, or at least its purpose. It is purpose. It is used to test areas that cannot be reached from a black box level.\n\nBlack Box Testing\n        Black Box Testing is testing the software without any knowledge of the inner workings, structure or language of the module being tested. Black box tests, as most other kinds of tests, must be written from a definitive source document, such as specification or requirements document, such as specification or requirements document. It is a testing in which the software under test is treated, as a black box .you cannot “see” into it. The test provides inputs and responds to outputs without considering how the software works.\n\n9.1 Unit Testing:\n\n\tUnit testing is usually conducted as part of a combined code and unit test phase of the software lifecycle, although it is not uncommon for coding and unit testing to be conducted as two distinct phases.\n\nTest strategy and approach\n\tField testing will be performed manually and functional tests will be written in detail.\n\nTest objectives\n    • All field entries must work properly.\n    • Pages must be activated from the identified link.\n    • The entry screen, messages and responses must not be delayed.\n\nFeatures to be tested\n    • Verify that the entries are of the correct format\n    • No duplicate entries should be allowed\n    • All links should take the user to the correct page\n\n\n\n9.2 Integration Testing\n\n\tSoftware integration testing is the incremental integration testing of two or more integrated software components on a single platform to produce failures caused by interface defects.\n\tThe task of the integration test is to check that components or software applications, e.g. components in a software system or – one step up – software applications at the company level – interact without error.\nTest Results: All the test cases mentioned above passed successfully. No defects encountered.\n\n9.3 Acceptance Testing\n\tUser Acceptance Testing is a critical phase of any project and requires significant participation by the end user. It also ensures that the system meets the functional requirements.\n\nTest Results: All the test cases mentioned above passed successfully. No defects encountered.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we presented the design and implementation of a web application called Survey Land, with which online users can get Survey guidance information they need anytime and anywhere, like Land Location, survey details about square feet, 1st and 2nd parties details, Landmarks and so on.",

Our Proposed work consist of three modules post, search and view posted invitations. This will be implemented by taking wedding or engagement or house warming occasion related details from user and then ask user to post or search an invitations. Once user get registered in this application they are allowed to post, search and view the invitations. Google map also added in this application, the exact occasion venue will shown by getting address from user and shown on Google map. Google Maps is a Web-based service that provides detailed information about geographical regions and sites around the world. In addition to conventional road maps, Google Maps offers aerial and satellite views of many places.  Google map can helps people as creating understandable directions and root to reach your functions places. \n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJf5kvxXFLs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n INTRODUCTION\nPrior to the invention of the moveable-type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1447, weddings in England were typically announced by means of a Town crier: a man who would walk through the streets announcing in a loud voice the news of the day. Traditionally, anyone within earshot became part of the celebration.\nIn the middle Ages, illiteracy was widespread, so the practice of sending written wedding invitations emerged among the nobility. Families of means would commission monks, skilled in the art of Calligraphy, to hand-craft their notices.\nSuch documents often carried the Coat of arms, or personal crest, of the individual and were sealed with wax.\nThe origins of commercially printed 'fine wedding stationery' can be traced to the period immediately following World War II, where a combination of democracy and rapid industrial growth gave the common man the ability to mimic the life-styles and materialism of society's elite. About this time, prominent society figures, such as Amy Vanderbilt and Emily Post, emerged to advise the ordinary man and woman on appropriate etiquette.\nGrowth in the use of wedding stationery was also underpinned by the development of thermography. Although it lacks the fineness and distinctiveness of engraving, thermography is a less expensive method of achieving raised type. This technique, often called poor man's engraving, produces shiny, raised lettering without impressing the surface of the paper (in the way traditional engraving does). As such, wedding invitations - either printed or engraved - finally became affordable for all.\nMore recently Letterpress printing has made a strong resurgence in popularity for wedding invitations. It has a certain boutique and craft appeal due to the deep impression or bite that can be achieved. It was not the original intent of letterpress to bite into the paper in this way, but rather to kiss it creating a flat print. The bite or deep impression is a recent aesthetic that adds the sensory experience of touch to letterpress printed wedding invitations. Many letterpress printers that specialize in wedding invitations are small start ups or artisan printers, rather than large printing companies.\nLaser engraving has also been making headway in the wedding invitation market over the last few years. Primarily used for engraving wood veneer invitations, it is also used to engrave acrylic, or to mark certain types of metal invitations.\nThe latest trend in wedding invitations is to designing cards using android application them online. Using the internet has made viewing, organizing and making wedding invitations an easy task. There are hundreds of websites that offer wedding invitations and stationery and being online allows the people to invite friends from anywhere in the world.\n        1.1 Objectives\nThe \"wedding invitation app\" allow you to:\n    • Send invitation to your guests with bridal and groom name, place and time\n    • Show navigate to their venues on Google map\n    • Guest can search for marriage invitations by filling input fields bridal or groom name and place or date\n    • It will allow guests to follow all your friend’s wedding invitations\n    • Send the right information at the right time to all your guests\n    • Google Maps is a Web-based service that provides detailed information about geographical regions and sites around the world. In addition to conventional road maps, Google Maps offers aerial and satellite views of many places. \n    • Google map can helps people as creating understandable directions and root to reach your functions places.\nThis invitation application can useful for inviting friends and relatives for wedding, engagements and house warming functions. The major difficulties in inviting people is that inviters are need to go to guest native places and they have to spend more money on designing and printing the wedding cards. So this application will people to make and show wedding, engagement and house warming functions invitations to all people in anywhere in the world.\n        1.2 Purpose of proposed work\nThough you’ll need an invitation account to sign into the app, users who don’t have one yet can easily get one from within the app. Once you’ve signed in, creating an invitation is easy. Invitation for Android supports integration with your Android device’s address book so that you can easily select as many contacts as you’d like to invite.\nOver the years, however, the rush of modern life has made it difficult for event organizers to sit down and make invitations. It’s so much easier, and faster, to send an informal message contains bridal and groom name, place and time.\nBut, for those of you who want a classic touch to your events without having to purchase cards from the store, this is best way to invite your friends and relatives. Invitations are an online platform for creating, managing, and sharing event-based invitations using attractive card designs.\nThe added advantage of these invitation applications is showing occasion venues on Google map. Google Maps offers several services as part of the larger Web application, as follows.\n    • A route planner offers directions for drivers, bikers, walkers, and users of public transportation who want to take a trip from one specific location to another.\n    • The Google Maps application program interface (API) makes it possible for site administrators to embed Google Maps into a proprietary site such as a real estate guide or community service page.\n    • Google Maps for Mobile offers a location service for motorists that utilizes the Global Positioning System (GPS) location of the mobile device (if available) along with data from wireless and cellular networks.\n    • Google Street View enables users to view and navigate through horizontal and vertical panoramic street level images of various cities around the world.\n    • Supplemental services offer images of the moon, Mars, and the heavens for hobby astronomers.\n\n LITERATURE REVIEW\nThere will be number of applications are launched in Google play store for wedding invitation cards designing, inviting people, posting wedding information and sharing occasion related messages and blessing to the couples. They are:\nHindu Wedding Invitation Cards - Make Hindu Wedding Invitation Cards and invite your friends and loved ones.

In Indian culture, the people have to print thousands of invitations to invite their relatives and friends, they also have to go to their relative places and invite them for that occasion. \nThis is one of the major difficulties in inviting peoples; the second thing is inviter has to spend more money on printing invitation cards. In India, the starting price of a single invitation cards from rupees five to rupees hundred, this amount is big thing, when it comes to a middle class people.\nIn invitation application all invitations are well designed and pleasant look to the viewers. This will clear hesitations of choosing non-printed digital cards could be a invitation for relatives and friends.\nThe third problem is occasion locations, in printed invitation card we cannot visualize the occasion location to guests, in terms of mobile application there is a facility of visualizing navigational map. This feature of our application will eliminate the confusion in choosing right path of the occasion location.\n2.2 Proposed Work of Invitation app\nOur proposed system consists of invitation searching and showing information of that occasion. This application begins with user login module after registering their required inputs. The registration module requires user name, email, password, address and mobile number; all these credentials are stored in database for future login. Once the user has signed up, thereafter they can log in at anytime. \nInvitation application requires inviters to choose which kind of occasion you want to invite friends. After choosing the occasion type application requires occasion details contains bridal and groom name if they choose wedding and engagement invitation, venue location and time. If inviters have given all those fields, they will be stored in live database. \n\nFigure 2.1 Proposed system architecture of Invitation application\nWhen giving occasion venue, they have given the address in such a way that Google map can recognize as in real. This Google map location is retrieved from live links as in Google map website.\n\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Product Perspective\nA simple, easy-to-use application designed to celebrate your special occasion with your friends or relatives. Unfold your love story before the world and make your guests see your wedding journey in the most unique way possible. Invitation provides a one stop destination where your loved ones stay connected as you count down till your big day.\nEspecially made for you and your wedding guests, Invitation has plethora of happiness to offer with its fresh and aesthetic design; add and share your memorable photos, event schedule, humble notes, travel arrangements, RSVP and a lot more.

This paper reports a service oriented system, called Rescue Wings, for providing emergency support to sufferers and rescuers in disasters. The system utilizes mobile services to acquire real-time information about the users and environment, and constructs service agents (servants) to provide active services for mobile users. To perform their functions, the servants frequently invoke a set of intelligent services of Rescue Wings, which can further access a number of public services from government and other public organizations. We identify the most frequent request sequence patterns (FRSP) of Rescue Wings, and develop a new bio-inspired algorithm for efficiently scheduling the requests to minimize the response delay. The system has been tested in several disaster rescue drills, and has been successfully applied to the 2013 Ya’an Earthquake in Southeast China.\t\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w85tYkCUi6A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nCHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION\nWE are now facing increasing threats from natural and man-made disasters. In order to effectively plan and implement disaster rescue operations, first responders have to obtain as much detailed information as possible about population dynamics, paying special attention to special groups such as children, the elderly, and the disabled. It is also expected that disaster and evacuation information should be transmitted to the affected population in a timely and accurate manner, which can have an enormous effect in saving lives and reducing damage. While the importance of customized and intelligent services for assisting the population in emergencies has always been recognized [1]–[4], challenges surrounding the design, deployment, management and integration of such a system have prevented its emergence and/or wide applications.\n\nIn the last three years, we have been working on the construction of a service-oriented system for providing emergency support to both responders and the stricken population in disaster rescue operations. The project, named Rescue Wings, is conducted mainly upon a combination of two emerging paradigms: mobile computing and cloud computing. On the one hand, the portability and ease of information storage and diss-emination has enabled mobile devices to become one of the most viable means of communication with the population [5], and recent trends in mobile computing have motivated interest in accessing web services from mobile devices in order to extend their functionality and gain access to remote data [6]. On the other hand, cloud computing technologies enable configuring, scheduling, and coordination of shared resources via virtualization, and thus greatly facilitate communication between a broad range of public and private entities.\n\nExisting Definition\n    • Its manual process for earlier system.\n    • Its more time consume for all process.\n    • Need for more resources.\n    • Its chance to lose our life.\n\nProposed Solution:\n    • The query will be sent immediately.\n    • After view admin for this query post solution for escape details also.\n    • User can registered their account and post their queries for disaster time.\n    • Public can also post their queries and view solution for rescue without register and login.\n Modules:\n    • ADMIN\n    • Login\n    • View Disaster Queries\n    • Post Solution\n    • USER\n    • Register\n    • Login\n    • Post Query\n    • View solution\n  \n    • PUBLIC\n    • Post Query\n    • View solution\n\nMODULES:\t\n    • ADMIN:\n    • Login:\n\t\tAdmin can login this system after they can view home page.\n    • View Query Disaster:\n\t\tAdmin enters this system and view user and public post their query details\n    • Post solution:\n\t\tAdmin can only post solution for public and user queries.\n    • USER:\n    • Register:\n\t\tUser enters this system and register with own details.\n    • Login:\n\t\tUser can login this system after they can view home page.\n    • Post Query:\n\t\tUser can login this system after they can post their own queries about escape of this situation.\n    • View solution:\n\t\tUser can login this system after they can view solution.\n\n\n\n\nUse case Diagrams:\t\n\n\n\n\n\nSequence Diagram:\n\n Collaboration Diagram:\n",

        "content": " –\neLearning – Skill Development And Learning App\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\nLearning Management System (MOODLE) is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking and reporting of training programs, classroom and online events, e-learning programs, and training content. It is supposed to be online flexible course management software which mainly caters educational requirements for teachers and students. \nLMS is supposed to have the following features: \n    • Self registration and Enrollment options to teachers and students. \n    • Adding/Deleting Courses by the teachers \n    • Set the different User Roles and user account \n    • Setting the course calendar \n    • Quiz module \n    • Upload and Retrieve Assignment and Resources \n    • Forum or discussion module \n    • Evaluate and Grade the students with the feedback \n    • Instant messages \n    • File download \n    • Grading/feedback \n    • Online calendar \n    • Online news, updates and announcement \nLMS is used by audiences like students, teachers and administrators. Also LMS can be used by anyone who is interested in conducting the online classes and who wants to store and retrieve the student’s documents.\nThe University of British Columbia (UBC) has a long tradition of supporting distance education and blended learning. Distance education And blended learning provide opportunities for learners from all over the world to access learning opportunities through UBC And they provide additional ways for instructors to enhance the range of learning experiences available to students.\nOver the years, UBC Has provided learning management systems (LMS) Software applications that provide flexible online classroom space in order to support the delivery of blended and fully online course modalities. Until recently, UBC Provided WebCT Vista, An LMS, To instructors and students. In 2010, UBC Was informed that WebCT Vista, UBC’s Then current LMS, Would no longer be supported as of 2014. In Order to identify a new LMS For the UBC community, UBC Undertook extensive testing of three LMSs, Inviting  the UBC Community to provide feedback on possible LMSs. As A result of this process, Blackboard Learn (branded Connect At UBC) Was selected as UBC’s Next LMS And will fully replace WebCT Vista By June 2014.\nTo facilitate the transition from WebCT Vista to Connect, UBC Developed a phased implementation process with the introduction of Connect Varying by faculty. Alongside The phased implementation process, the Centre for Teaching Learning and Technology (CTLT) Conducted a year--‐long research project from January 2012 To December 2012. \nThe Research project was focused on determining users’ experiences with the transition from WebCT Vista to Connect In order to inform the subsequent wider roll--‐out of Connect Across the University, Including operating procedures, educational development, and user support.\n1.1 Report Purpose and Structure    \nThis    report    presents    a   detailed    narrative    outlining    all   aspects   of   the    LMS   research    project    including    the    research    process,    data    collection    and analysis, and    key   findings.    This    report   has    three    purposes:    1)    to    disseminate    the research    findings    to    the    UBC    community    including  those   who    contributed  to the    LMS    research    project;    2)    to    inform    processes    (operating    procedures, professional    development,    and    user    support)    at    the   department,    Faculty,    and support    unit    level    in    order    to   better    support  the    broader    roll-­‐out    of Connect    at    UBC;    and  3)    to  contribute    to   other    institutions’    understandings of   LMS    transitions,    particularly    institutions  that   are    facing  or   will   be    facing a    similar    transition.       \n1.2 Scope   \nThe   LMS    research    project    involved    three    phases:   1)    January    to   April    2012;    2)    May    to    August    2012;    and    3)    September    to   December    2012.    In    each    phase,    students    and    instructors    involved   with    courses    being    offered   in   Connect    were   invited   to   voluntarily participate    in an    initial    online    survey    and    an    interview.    Instructors   were also invited to   participate in   a   follow-­‐up    survey.   Instructors    who   were    not    teaching    courses    in    Connect    and    students, who were not taking any courses in Connect,    were    excluded    from    the    research    project.   The   research    involved   participants    from    both    UBC    Vancouver    and   UBC   Okanagan    and    was   open to all Faculties and departments offering course in Connect.\n1.3 Research Methods    \nFrom the beginning, the    research    project    was    conceived    of    as mixed-methods, multi phase research    project collecting    both quantitative and   qualitative data.  This was to provide opportunities for    participants to   engage in the research in multiple ways and to provide a variety of data    points (throughout   the year) to gather participant   perspectives on the ongoing changes to the new LMS. Online    surveys    were   selected    in    order   to    efficiently    gather    data from a large number of potential   participants.   Individual   interviews were selected in order to gather   in-­‐depth    participant   feedback of the individual experience in the new LMS. The interviews also   provided an opportunity to explore    key   themes    from    the    initial online   survey and to probe deeper into some of the data with a small number of students    and    instructors. \nThe purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the course management system. It will explain the purpose and features of the system, the interfaces of the system will do, the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli. This document is intended for both stakeholders and developers of the system.\n1.4 Overview\nThe next chapter, the Overall Description section, of this document gives an overview of the functionality of the product. It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical requirements specification in the next chapter.     \nThe third chapter, Requirements Specification section, of this document is written primarily for the developers and describes in technical terms the details of the functionality of the product.\nBoth sections of the document describe the same software product in its entirety, but are intended for different audiences and thus use different language.\n1. 5 Overall Description\nProduct Perspective\nThe system will be operate within university environment. This environment has anther systems that will interact with this system so we need interfaces between this systems.\n\n1.5.1Product Functions\n            1.1.1 The system shall be able to Create Courses.\n\n            1.1.1 The system shall be able to automatically create accounts for students and instructors.  \n\n            1.1.2 The system shall be capable of Managing Student Grades.\n\n            1.1.3 The system shall be capable of automatically accepting Homework Submissions.\n\n\n            1.1.4 The system shall support Group Management features especially important for courses with group projects, this is especially important for large classes.\n\n\n\n            1.1.5 The system should provide Online Quizzes. \n\n\n1.6 Existing System\nExisting system is a manual one in which the students have to search fro the information regarding the colleges institutes about different information regarding the studies .They have to go to different institutions for getting the proper information about the educational institutes. It is very difficult to maintain historical data. \nDISADVANTAGES:\nThe following are the disadvantages of the existing system\n    •    It is difficult to maintain important information in books.\n    •    The students have to search for the information regarding the institutions manually ,so more manual hours are needed for.\n    •    It is tedious to manage historical data which needs much space to keep all the information regarding the institutions and about the courses.\n    •   They didn’t even get proper  or accurate information about the courses. \n1.7 Proposed System\nThe DISTANCE LEARNNG SYSTEM is a software application which avoids more manual hours that need to spend in record keeping and searching the information manually. Through this the students are  registered online .their information is stored in the database the admin can easily access the details of the Students The students can search the information regarding the institutions and about different course which they want to know they can get admission though online registration . This application keeps the data in a centralized way which is available to all the users simultaneously. It is very easy to manage historical data in database. They can easily use the tool that decreases manual hours spending for normal things and hence increases the performance. \n            The objective of the LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is to provide better information for the students of this system easily they can register from anywhere without facing any difficulty, and gets the proper information regarding the institutions. \nCHAPTER 2 - FEASIBILITY STUDY:\nFeasibility study is conducted once the problem is clearly understood.  Feasibility study is a high level capsule version of the entire system analysis and design process.  The objective is to determine quickly at a minimum expense how to solve a problem.  The purpose of feasibility is not to solve the problem but to determine if the problem is worth solving.\n            The system has been tested for feasibility in the following points.\n\t   1. Technical Feasibility\n\t   2. Economical Feasibility\n\t   3. Operational Feasibility.\n1. Technical Feasibility\n                 The project entitles \"Courier Service System” is technically feasibility because of the below mentioned feature.  The project was developed in Java which Graphical User Interface.\n           It provides the high level of reliability, availability and compatibility.  All these make Java an appropriate language for this project.  Thus the existing software Java is a powerful language\n2. Economical Feasibility\n                                 The computerized system will help in automate the selection leading the profits and details of the organization.  With this software, the machine and manpower utilization are expected to go up by 80-90% approximately.  The costs incurred of not creating the system are set to be great, because precious time can be wanted by manually.\n3. Operational Feasibility\nIn this project, the management will know the details of each project where he may be presented and the data will be maintained as decentralized and if any inquires for that particular contract can be known as per their requirements and necessaries.\n2.1 Implementation:\n       Implementation is the stage where the theoretical design is turned into a working system. The most crucial stage in achieving a new successful system and in giving confidence on the new system for the users that it will work efficiently and effectively.\nThe system can be implemented only after thorough testing is done and if it is found to work according to the specification.\nIt involves careful planning, investigation of the current system and its constraints on implementation, design of methods to achieve the change over and an evaluation of change over methods a part from planning. Two major tasks of preparing the implementation are education and training of the users and testing of the system.\n  The more complex the system being implemented, the more involved will be the systems analysis and design effort required just for implementation.          \n       The implementation phase comprises of several activities. The required hardware and software acquisition is carried out. The system may require some software to be developed. For this, programs are written and tested. The user then changes over to his new fully tested system and the old system is discontinued.\n\n\n2.3 TESTING:\n            The testing phase is an important part of software development. It is the puterized system will help in automate  process of finding errors and missing operations and also a complete verification to determine whether the objectives are met and the user requirements are satisfied.\nSoftware testing is carried out in three steps:\n            1.     The first includes unit testing, where in each module is tested to provide its correctness, validity and also determine any missing operations and to verify whether the objectives have been met. Errors are noted down and corrected immediately. Unit testing is the important and major part of the project. So errors are rectified easily in particular module and program clarity is increased. In this project entire system is divided into several modules and is developed individually.  So unit testing is conducted to individual modules.\n              2.        The second step includes Integration testing. It need not be the case, the software whose modules when run individually and showing perfect results, will also show perfect results when run as a whole. The individual modules are clipped under this major module and tested again and verified the results. This is due to poor interfacing, which may results in data being lost across an interface. A module can have inadvertent, adverse effect on any other or on the global data structures, causing serious problems.\n               3.        The final step involves validation and testing which determines which the software functions as the user expected. Here also some modifications were. In the completion of the project it is satisfied fully by the end user.\n\n2.4 Maintenance and environment:\nAS the number of computer based systems, grieve libraries of computer software began to expand. In house developed projects produced tones of thousand soft program source statements. Software products purchased from the outside added hundreds of thousands of new statements. A dark cloud appeared on the horizon. All of these programs, all of those source statements-had to be corrected when false were detected, modified as user requirements changed, or adapted to new hardware that was purchased. These activities were collectively called software Maintenance.\n    The maintenance phase focuses on change that is associated with error correction, adaptations required as the software's environment evolves, and changes due to enhancements brought about by changing customer requirements. Four types of changes are encountered during the maintenance phase.\n\n\n\n - PROJECT OVERVIEW \n\n                     In the existing learning system all the students are required to gather at a common location at a particular time to attend the lectures, because of which it lacks Geographical independence and Time independence. The students must attend the training classes as per the pre-defined schedule and they need to contact the training administrator if they desire to do a course and wait for the administrator to grant permission for taking the course Since the evaluation of test papers is done manually it takes more time and there is a chance that errors may creep in during the evaluation. \n                      The students cannot pursue a course of his/her choice at any time, as the training for that course may not be available at that instant. The student has to wait for the training to conclude even if he/she is familiar with the course content and wants to write the test and they even need to contact the training staff for the study material and test result details. Since the details of all the students who are undergoing training are maintained manually it is difficult to search for required details and generate reports\n3.1 MODULES \nThis project involves mainly four modules.\n    • Administrator module\n    • Student module\n    • Course module\n\n    • Administrator module :\t\n\t\tThis module will provide two types of login one is staff login and one is student login.

Therefore, it’s important to clearly define and prioritize requirements before shopping in order to find the right LMS that will meet your organizations initial core requirements, as well as grow to meet subsequent requirements in the future. Once you’ve determined how you plan to use the LMS, you can match product functionality to your requirements. To that end, the following functional requirements are recommended: Integration with HR. LMSs that aren't synchronized with HR systems miss the boat. \nWhen systems are integrated, a human resources employee can enter a new hire's information into the HR system, and the employee is automatically signed up for training tailored to his or her role within the company. Administration tools. The LMS must enable administrators to manage user registrations and profiles, define roles, set curricula, chart certification paths, assign tutors, author courses, manage content, and administer internal budgets, user payments, and chargebacks. Administrators need complete access to the training database, enabling them to create standard and customized reports on individual and group performance. Reports should be scalable to include the entire workforce. \nThe system should also be able to build schedules for learners, instructors, and classrooms. Most important, all features should be manageable using automated, user-friendly interfaces. In addition, the system should be able to identify employees who need a particular course and tell them how it fits into their overall career path, when it’s available, how it’s available (classroom, online, CD-ROM), if there are prerequisites, and when and how they can fulfill those prerequisites. Once learners complete a course, the LMS can administer tests based on proficiency requirements, report test results, and recommend next steps. In that capacity, LMSs are instrumental in assuring that organizations meet rigid certification requirements in such vertical markets as healthcare, finance, and government.\nContent access: This involves the medium (e.g., classroom, CD-ROM, online, etc.) in which the content is delivered, the method (e.g., instructor-led, selfpaced, blended) in which the content is delivered, the languages in which the content is delivered and to whom the content is being delivered (e.g., employees, customers, partners, etc.). \nContent development: Content development encompasses authoring, maintaining, and storing the learning content. This is where the issues of authoring-tool compatibility, version control, and re-usable learning objects are considered.\nContent integration: It's important for an LMS to provide native support to a wide range of third-party courseware. When shopping for an LMS, keep in mind that some LMSs are compatible only with the supplier's own courseware, and others do little more than pay lip-service to learning content standards. An LMS supplier should be able to certify that third-party content will work within their system, and accessing courses should be as easy as using a drop-down menu. \nSkills management: Skill assessment and management capabilities revolve around learners assessing their competency gaps. Skills assessments can be culled from multiple sources, including peer reviews and 360-feedback tools. Managers must be able to determine whether results are weighted, averaged, or compared to determine a skill gap. Businesses also might use this feature to search their employee base for specialized skills. \nAssessment capabilities: It's a good idea to have an assessment feature that enables authoring within the product and includes assessments as part of each course. Evaluation, testing, and assessment engines help developers build a program that becomes more valuable over time. \nAdherence to standards: An LMS should attempt to support standards, such as SCORM. Support for standards means that the LMS can import and manage content and courseware that complies with standards regardless of the authoring system that produced it. Beware: Unless the supplier certifies that the content will work on your LMS, plan on additional expenses. \nConfigurability: If an organization needs to completely re-engineer its internal processes to install an LMS or employ expensive programming resources to make changes to the LMS, then it’s probably not a good fit. Also, it's helpful if IT and designers can access the LMS behind the scenes; they need to set processes and standards based on company policy. To make some systems ITand user-friendly, some LMS providers have user groups or customer advisory councils that provide insight into installing or upgrading systems. Security is a priority in any data system containing employee information and proprietary content. Security measures typically include passwords and encryption.\n\nSELECTED SOFTWARE\n5.1. Introduction to Html Framework\nHyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology used to create web pages, as well as to create user interfaces for mobile and web applications. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.\nHTML elements form the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML allows images and other objects to be embedded and it can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> introduce content into the page directly. Others such as <p>...</p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\nHTML can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages. HTML markup can also refer the browser to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the look and layout of text and other material\n5.2 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\nCSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG andXUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. \nCSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content, such as semantically insignificant tables that were widely used to format pages before consistent CSS rendering was available in all major browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate presentation instructions from the HTML content in a separate file or style section of the HTML file. For each matching HTML element, it provides a list of formatting instructions. For example, a CSS rule might specify that \"all heading 1 elements should be bold\", leaving pure semantic HTML markup that asserts \"this text is a level 1 heading\" without formatting code such as a<bold> tag indicating how such text should be displayed.\nThis separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (when read out by a speech-based browser orscreen reader) and on Braille-based, tactile devices. It can also be used to display the web page differently depending on the screen size or device on which it is being viewed. Although the author of a web page typically links to a CSS file within the markup file, readers can specify a different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author has specified. If the author or the reader did not link the document to a style sheet, the default style of the browser will be applied. Another advantage of CSS is that aesthetic changes to the graphic design of a document (or hundreds of documents) can be applied quickly and easily, by editing a few lines in one file, rather than by a laborious (and thus expensive) process of crawling over every document line by line, changing markup.\nThe CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities (or weights) are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.\n5.3. Sql Server\n\tA database management, or DBMS, gives the user access to their data and helps them transform the data into information. Such database management systems include dBase, paradox, IMS, SQL Server and SQL Server.  These systems allow users to create, update and extract information from their database.\n\tA database is a structured collection of data.  Data refers to the characteristics of people, things and events.  SQL Server stores each data item in its own fields.  In SQL Server, the fields relating to a particular person, thing or event are bundled together to form a single complete unit of data, called a record (it can also be referred to as raw or an occurrence).  Each record is made up of a number of fields.  No two fields in a record can have the same field name.\n\tDuring an SQL Server Database design project, the analysis of your business needs identifies all the fields or attributes of interest.  If your business needs change over time, you define any additional fields or change the definition of existing fields.\nSQL SERVER TABLES\n\tSQL Server stores records relating to each other in a table.  Different tables are created for the various groups of information. Related tables are grouped together to form a database.\nPRIMARY KEY\n\tEvery table in SQL Server has a field or a combination of fields that uniquely identifies each record in the table.  The Unique identifier is called the Primary Key, or simply the Key.  The primary key provides the means to distinguish one record from all other in a table.  It allows the user and the database system to identify, locate and refer to one particular record in the database.\nRELATIONAL DATABASE\n\tSometimes all the information of interest to a business operation can be stored in one table.  SQL Server makes it very easy to link the data in multiple tables. Matching an employee to the department in which they work is one example.  This is what makes SQL Server a relational database management system, or RDBMS.  It stores data in two or more tables and enables you to define relationships between the table and enables you to define relationships between the tables.\nFOREIGN KEY\n\tWhen a field is one table matches the primary key of another field is referred to as a foreign key.  A foreign key is a field or a group of fields in one table whose values match those of the primary key of another table.\nREFERENTIAL INTEGRITY\n\tNot only does SQL Server allow you to link multiple tables, it also maintains consistency between them.  Ensuring that the data among related tables is correctly matched is referred to as maintaining referential integrity.\nDATA ABSTRACTION\n\tA major purpose of a database system is to provide users with an abstract view of the data.  This system hides certain details of how the data is stored and maintained. Data abstraction is divided into three levels.\nPhysical level:  This is the lowest level of abstraction at which one describes how the data are actually stored.\nConceptual Level:  At this level of database abstraction all the attributed and what data are actually stored is described and entries and relationship among them.\nView level:  This is the highest level of abstraction at which one describes only part of the database.\n\n\n\n- SYSTEM DESIGN\n6.1. Introduction\nSoftware design sits at the technical kernel of the software engineering process and is applied regardless of the development paradigm and area of application. Design is the first step in the development phase for any engineered product or system. The designer’s goal is to produce a model or representation of an entity that will later be built. Beginning, once system requirement have been specified and analyzed, system design is the first of the three technical activities -design, code and test that is required to build and verify software.  \nThe importance can be stated with a single word “Quality”. Design is the place where quality is fostered in software development. Design provides us with representations of software that can assess for quality. Design is the only way that we can accurately translate a customer’s view into a finished software product or system. Software design serves as a foundation for all the software engineering steps that follow. Without a strong design we risk building an unstable system – one that will be difficult to test, one whose quality cannot be assessed until the last stage.\nDuring design, progressive refinement of data structure, program structure, and procedural details are developed reviewed and documented. System design can be viewed from either technical or project management perspective. From the technical point of view, design is comprised of four activities – architectural design, data structure design, interface design and procedural design.\n",

This project allows the phrase ‘Marriages are made in heaven’ to be rephrased as ‘Marriages are now made online’. This application allows browsing profiles of other registered users on the site. An individual needs to give their information such as Name, Gender, Religion, Caste, Marital status, Current salary, Occupation etc. along with an option to upload photo of the individual registering and their kundali. The person looking for marriage can register and search for a profile that matches their requirement. This application allows individual to search by gender, age, religion, caste, marital status. It gives an option to an individual to view kundali, which is highest priority in many cases. An individual can select a profile as per his/ her requirement and can send an email indicating their interest and the email will be sent along with the sender’s details. Thus this application allows individual to let others view its profile and allows it to view others profile depending on the priority set. And also the user wants to match the horoscope.\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 –INTRODUCTION\nMarriage information has always been an integral part of the knowledge base in any civilized society. Usually some agencies and other de-institutionalized sources become operative in producing and transferring great variety of matrimonial information. In recent time, online matrimony portals accelerate the opportunities of providing newer matrimony services for sharing matrimonial information more comfortably and selectively, though often criticized in terms of adequacy and authenticity of such information.\nThis paper aims to present a brief account on marriage information systems and services with reference to India, thus provide glimpses of popular matrimony sites emerged in last two decades. It evaluates the usefulness and web-metrics as well as popularity of broad-spectrum matrimony portals; those have become accessible to diverse Indian communities, and beyond the geographical boundaries. It emphasizes on proper coordination and standardization among the service portals toward developing a comprehensive information system for potential marriage-information seekers in national, regional, and local level. New policy initiatives and technological capabilities might provide more effective platform is suggested to reveal a new matrimony space in India.\n        1.1 Objectives\nThe Proposed Project is named as “WEB BASED MATRIMONIAL SITE” where boys and girls registered themselves for to search their companions. Due to computerized and it is available online, people can register as and when they require and they can register wherever they are, so it provides lot of flexibility for people to search their companions easily.\nToday, the marriage alliance arranged by known people and that are conducted manually and the amount of time required is very huge. Only they can help to know only few alliances.\n\n <iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bVOpkc3XLio\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nSystems are created to solve problems. One can think of the systems approach as an organized way of dealing with a problem. In this dynamic world, the subject System Analysis and Design mainly deals with the software development activities.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter going through this lesson, you should be able to:\n Understand a system\n Understand the different phases of system developments life cycle\n Know the components of system analysis\n Know the components of system designing\nWhat is Matrimonial Web Application?\n The main objective of Matrimonial Web Application is to provide Grooms and Brides with excellent matchmaking experience by exploring the opportunities and resources to meet true potential partner. Keeping our objective in mind, we have created a world renowned online matchmaking services that will touch the souls of millions of people all over the globe. \nThe purposes of the Matrimonial Web Application are:\n• The main purpose of this application is to facilitate matchmaking business by applying the information in the field. \n• It helps the user by providing profiles of perspective “Bride” or “Groom” and other information regarding them online.\n• User can get information regarding their dream life partner at his/her home at his/her convenience. \n• This application also provides a search utility which helps those users who have a certain criteria of qualities in mind to make online matrimonial easier.\n • Since internet is a pivot for modern business, our project which is based on internet paves a path for modernization in trade.\n Matrimonial Web Application will allow a new user to register and after successfully registration user can get email confirmation, after completing registration users profile will be visible to other users.\nDefining a System\nA collection of components that work together to realize some objective forms a system. Basically there are three major components in every system, namely input, processing and output. In a system the different components are connected with each other and they are interdependent.\nFor example, Human body represents a complete natural system. We are also bound by many national systems such as political system, economic system, educational system and so forth. The objective of the system demands that some output is produced as a result of processing the suitable inputs\n2.1Existing Solution:\nFrom the through study it is found that, the existing method of conducting civil services preliminary examinations are very tedious to both the commissions those are conducting and the students those who are appearing for. Here all the aspects of exams are conducted manually. It is time consuming, Evaluation will be later and results are expected later.\n2.2 Proposed Solution:\nTo overcome these problems here is a package of computerizing the whole aspect. Computerizing and making online does the same task in a better and efficient manner. These exams are also called as screening exams in which the candidates are selected to the main exams by considering the maximum marks secured by them. These marks are not counted for the main exams.\nIn these preliminary exams the questions will be of objective types. Hence this is a step ahead to show that online exams are easier to conduct, reduces the paper work and evaluation will be easier and faster.\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\nThe main objective of Matrimonial Web Application is to provide Grooms and Brides with excellent matchmaking experience by exploring the opportunities and resources to meet true potential partner.

This system will solve key problems faced by restaurants today through the use of technologies such as Web applications and cloud computing. Restaurants have many  inefficiencies due to human limitations that can be resolved through automation and device-to-device communication. This Smart Restaurant Management System accomplishes this by providing two interfaces for the two types of users in restaurants; an web application for customers and a web application for restaurant staff members. The web application allows customers to have a seamless dining experience with features such as finding available parking spaces easier through internetconnected web application, finding available tables at the restaurant easier through application, ordering dishes through an interactive menu. The web application provides staff members benefits such as collecting data and statistics on  the restaurant’s performance in real time and automating the order placement system for waiters and cooks via web technology.\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Czz_YnqPWQk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nExisting System \nWaiting for a table to open up and for a waiter to seat them, receiving a noninteractive paper menu displaying limited information about the food available (typically containing only the dishes’ names, prices, and brief descriptions), waiting for a waiter to arrive to them before customers can order, receiving no information about the progress of their meal while waiting for it to arrive, \nwaiting once more for the waiter to provide their bill to pay, and finally no automated way for customers to directly provide feedback to the restaurant’s management immediately after finishing their meal.\n\nProposed System \nVersatility of an End-to-End Solution: The WEB APP  supports a variety of smartphones, and it provides assistance at various stages of the entire dining experience from finding parking spots and available tables to ordering food and paying for the bill\n\n    • Flexibility: Clients can selectively use the WEB APP  for specific features and then perform other features  through conventional means.

        "content": "\nOperation Schedule Application For Hospital Management\n\nABSTRACT\n\nOperating room surgical schedules often present logistical difficulties in terms of assigning doctors to specific operating rooms. Due to a wide variety of factors such as room availability, working hours in a week, doctor preferences, and operating room capabilities, surgical scheduling can prove to be challenging. Administrators utilize a static schedule and manually modify the assignments on a case-by-case basis. In this senior design project, we work to transform this static schedule into a working dynamic model which can be programmed to incorporate different scenarios within the hospital based on specific hospital parameters. By implementing a mixed linear integer program to minimize the difference between a surgical group’s target and allocated time within an operating room, we demonstrate the advantages of using this model to optimize surgical assignments.\n\n–INTRODUCTION\nThe managerial aspect of providing health services to patients in hospitals is becoming increasingly important. Hospitals want to reduce costs and improve their financial assets, on the one hand, while they want to maximize the level of patient satisfaction, on the other hand. One unit that is of particular interest is the operating theater. Since this facility is the hospital’s largest cost and revenue center [65, 80], it has a major impact on the performance of the hospital as a whole. Managing the operating theater, however, is hard due to the conflicting priorities and the preferences of its stakeholders [57], but also due to the scarcity of costly resources. Moreover, health managers have to anticipate the increasing demand for surgical services caused by the aging population [48]. These factors clearly stress the need for efficiency and necessitate the development of adequate planning and scheduling procedures.\nIn the past 60 years, a large body of literature on the management of operating theaters has evolved. Magerlein and Martin [81] review the literature on surgical demand scheduling and distinguish between advance scheduling and allocation scheduling. Advance scheduling is the process of fixing a surgery date for a patient, whereas allocation scheduling determines the operating room and the starting time of the procedure on the specific day of surgery. Blake and Carter [11] elaborate on this taxonomy in their literature review and add the domain of external resource scheduling, which they define as the process of identifying and reserving all resources external to the surgical suite necessary to ensure appropriate care for a patient before and after an instance of surgery. They furthermore divide each domain in a strategic, administrative and operational level, although these boundaries may be vague and interrelated. Przasnyski [100] structures the literature on operating room scheduling based on general areas of concern, such as cost containment or scheduling of specific resources. Other reviews, in which operating room management is covered as a part of global health care services, can be found in [16, 99, 106, 121].\nThe aim of this literature review paper is threefold. First, we want to provide an updated overview on operating room planning and scheduling that captures the recent developments in this rapidly evolving area. In order to maintain a homogeneous set of contributions, we do not enlarge the scope to operating room management and hence exclude from this review topics such as business process reengineering, the impact of introducing new medical technologies, the estimation of surgery durations or facility design. In other words, we restrict the focus to operating room capacity planning and surgery scheduling (timetabling). Second, we want to structure the obtained information in such a way that research contributions can easily be linked to each other and compared on multiple facets, which should facilitate the detection of contributions that are within a specific researcher’s area of interest. In Section 2, we describe how the structure of this review paper contributes to this goal. Third, pooling literature in a detailed manner enables the identification of issues that are currently (not) well covered and examined.\n        1.1 Objectives\nOperating Theatre (OT) management responsibilities cover a diverse group of different functions and capabilities, including scheduling patients and clinicians; ensuring patient safety, managing supplies and materials; improving operating room and employee utilization; managing clinical, administrative, and billing documentation; and much more. \nControlling, synchronizing, and optimizing the various aspects of perioperative service is, to say the least, a challenging task. Management of the OT in hospital — from a people, supply, and information system perspective — has been fragmented, decentralized and disconnected, with nursing, surgery, and anesthesiology often operating autonomously. This makes it difficult to share critical information throughout the OT enterprise. In addition, important operational and clinical information is still frequently manually recorded and not available online. This has led to tremendous inefficiencies, redundancies, and performance bottlenecks.\n  \n LITERATURE REVIEW\t\nThe main outline of the conducted experiment of scenarios is organized according to; \n1. Analysis concerning static allocation of operating rooms compared to dynamic/flexible allocation of the same. \n2. Extended opening hours of the operating rooms. \nWhen utilizing static operating room allocation, the surgeon teams allocate the same number of rooms at the same day (time slot) every week. While at the dynamic/flexible approach, employed at the cardiothoracic surgery, the surgeons (not the surgeon teams) allocate the rooms and time slots according to patient load. This fact gave us the idea of allowing for the optimization model to incorporate a choice of the level of flexibility, in order to simulate the dynamic/flexible approach also at the general surgery. We have modelled (see description of optimization model) so that we are free to choose either a static surgeon team allocation, as is utilized in Blekinge Hospital, flexible surgeon team allocation by applying constraint (4a), or the alternative of no team allocation; flexible surgeon allocation by applying constraint (4b), utilized in Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Constraint (9) and (10) are, as earlier mentioned, not applied in this experiment principally because further investigations in how the estimated post operative care can be related to the clinic (patient group). We use opening hours for each operating room, denoted default time, according to Table 2 below (parameter amt ). Then we extend opening hours to 450 minutes on Mondays and Tuesdays in Room 1 to illustrate the effects of potential shifts, over-time or flextime for the staff (operating room team). No considerations to availability of staff and beds are taken. On Fridays, the time slots are smaller due to staff considerations during week-ends.\nIn order to conduct as relevant experiment scenarios as possible, we use input data based on statistics from Blekinge Hospital. The scenarios represent one week of operating room planning. The numbers and types of operations that apply for operating room admission in the scenarios are in ratio to operations performed during the last year at Blekinge Hospital. We have chosen the number of 40 patients at each scenario to represent the patient queue. No considerations to seasonal variations are taken, if there are any. The estimated length of time for each operation, j e , is based on mean values from real data plus 45 minutes of set-up time (also mean value). Also number of surgeons and surgeon teams correspond to the approximately amount of available surgeons during one week at Blekinge Hospital. In this experiment we use 5 surgeon teams with 3 surgeons each. The individual schedules for the surgeons, i.e. what day to operate or to have a day-off and so on, are predetermined which together with the fixed allocation of operating room constitute basis to current operating room scheduling at Blekinge Hospital and is here denoted; default case. To enable flexible room allocation we let the individual surgeon schedules to be in a more preliminary state. This implies that the surgeons are not scheduled for surgery or other duties until the final surgery schedule is set. We let two of the three surgeons always to bee available for surgery. The number of operating rooms considered is three, as in Blekinge Hospital, and the time slots representing opening hours per day and room are calculated four full-time days, Monday-Thursday, and one half day, Friday. The opening hours for each room are in reality describing the availability of operating team (not to mix-up with surgeon team). The cost parameters j c are not based on real cases but are here randomized to represent patient diagnosis and patient waiting time. Our intention is to further develop this value into realistic patient cost parameters.\nAs described earlier, the surgeons at the general surgery often are responsible for the medical examination of the patients. In several cases this implies the responsible surgeon also to be the operative surgeon, i.e. a combination of patient-surgeon that is fixed. This could also be the case when some operations require special surgical qualifications. Patients with double priority often are contracted diseases with carcinogenic or other problematic characteristics which involve additionally needs. In reality, this means, the surgeon together with the patient wants to decide what day the operation will be performed. To reflect these needs and come as close to the reality as possible, we have constructed 6 fixed operations per week distributed among all surgeon teams, for the scenarios which are not default. This entails increased validity to the suggested dynamic approach, and allows us to compare our proposal to the existing system (here; default scenarios) of operating room planning. We use 40 patients for admission to operating room planning as default. Each patient is assigned a random cost between 1-70 except for 6 patients that are assigned the value of 100 which will represent the patients that are needed to be scheduled within this time frame. This cost is modeled as a penalty to the objective function when the patient is not operated on and represents a mix of medical priority, time waited and economical aspects. Except for the following described aspects, the scenarios use the same system settings for optimization.\nEXISTING SYSTEM:\nManaging and scheduling Operation Theater (OT) activities are critical tasks in a hospital. Main objective of this module is to create a more user friendly environment for hospitals to manage their OT activities efficiently. OT scheduling is the most critical task in managing an OT in a hospital. Scheduling always needs to deal with emergency surgery scheduling, cancellation of surgeries etc. Having a OT module integrated with Open MRS will gain major benefits for hospitals including efficiently manage hospital resources, optimizing theater schedules, gives an overview for assign surgeons and nurses for each surgery efficiently and etc. Management people can analyze efficiency of OT by past records associate with each OT and also can determine consumption and future need of resources for surgeries.\nPROPOSED SYSTEM:\n    1. Create a new module following Creating Modules \n    2. The one of major function of the module is to enable a interface to efficiently schedule OT activities in each OT in the hospital. (Managing interfaces for scheduling activities will be critical here).\nScheduling needs to address changes in surgeries such as new additions, cancellations, delayed surgeries, emergencies, etc.\n    3. Each surgery should be associate with following details\n        ◦ Surgery date and time.\n        ◦ Operation Theater (OT) number of ID.\n        ◦ Anesthesia type and Anesthetist Name.\n        ◦ Surgeon (Include if there is Assistant surgeon).\n        ◦ Theater nurses associate with the surgery (If possible).\n        ◦ Mechanism to track pre and postoperative events.\n        ◦ Attach any reports associated with surgery (i.e. patient surgery chart, Operative reports - transcription).\n        ◦ Managing doctors comments regarding surgery.\n        ◦ Special drugs, instruments and materials needed for a operation.\n    4. Build interfaces to view daily OT activities. Also it should be necessary for view OT schedules for past and future days.  \n    5. Create interface needed for hospital administrative people for analyze OT activities and efficiency. These interfaces may contain special needs of materials need for upcoming surgeries and consumption of resources in each OT.\n.\nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\n Operating Theatre Management System (OTMS) provides a comprehensive perioperative information system that enables hospitals to achieve remarkable improvements in organizational performance and patient safety. \n OTMS enables the total perioperative automation that will help the hospitals to achieve the control and efficiency needed to succeed in this evolving environment. OTMS covers all areas needed for the Operating Theatre workflow processes from Booking of operating rooms, Scheduling of OT staff, Pre-Operative Check-list, Operating Room Intra-Operative Records, Recovery monitoring, etc.\n3.2 System Features\nIn the life of the software development, problem analysis provides a base for design and development phase.

The program follows the logical purchasing process from time of purchase to the point of consumption and is fully integrated with the Cruise Ship’s Property Management System (SPMS). This program can be used in a shore side location, at a cruise operator’s Head Office (the Head Quarter Module) if they are responsible for the purchasing process for the vessel or fleet of vessels or onboard a ship (Shipside Module) if the ship is directly responsible for the purchasing task. Customers for CMMS are the existing Cruise customers who have been using the original Cruise product& Beverage system but as this program is also a stand-alone product - it can be used independently of the Cruise SPMS - non-Cruise customers are potential customers. In addition to offering full integration with the Cruise SPMS and an on-line interface to the Point of Sale system, one of the key benefits of CMMS is that it gives the user a total overview (historic and real time) of all consumables. The user can track and check on the status of all food, beverage, uniforms, tools, shop stock, medical items and more, that have been ordered, purchased, delivered, consumed and invoiced throughout the life cycle of that item.\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of the System:\n Cruise ship facility depends on voyagers only. When one ship during voyage time voyages requirements are ordering through walkie-talkie or telephone. This method or device had any problem occur means voyages have to go and directly buy their requirements in several department.\n Manager view all the booking items. If voyager booking or ordering items on the time tickets are not available means “Ordering or Booking items are currently not available” message will be displayed in this system.   Admin maintain menu items for this system. Admin can insert, update and delete for menu items. Then admin only allocate voyager registration details.\n So admin use these details and create login id and password for voyages. Then admin can provide login Id and Password.  So this system enhanced voyages order items through online. Each voyager has unique Id and Password. So, voyager login this system they can order their requirements. Voyagers can order catering items and stationary items through this system. And they can book Resort-Movie tickets, Beauty Saloon, Fitness Centre and Party Hall.  Catering items order means voyager can order snacks items, food items, drinks items and so on. A stationary items order means they can order gift items, candy items, and story books and so on. Movie tickets booking means they have to select movie and check availability for seating allotments finally booking their tickets. Resort booking means voyager select type of restaurant. There are several types ocean view, balcony view, corridor view and lounge booking. Fitness centre booking means they have to select their exercise equipment through this system. And they can also book their gym work timing. Party hall booking facilities available in this system. Here also type of halls is their voyager have to select their require hall. There are birthday parties, marriage party, engagement party, business party, get-to-gather parties and so on.

More importantly, CMI embraces your business with a personalized approach to cruise ship management, and a customer service level.\n        1.1 Scope of the Project\nThe objective of the application is to streamline the process for creating inventories of both main stores and points of consumption by giving the user the ability to enter inventory data directly into a handheld device instead of using printed count sheets. The data entered into the mobile device will then be uploaded to the database via a web service interface. In addition to processing inventories, the mobile application also includes functionality to allow the user to view, control and enter exact amounts received from suppliers during loading\n\nTools:\n    • Android Emulator\n    • Xampp-win32-5.5.19-0-VC11\n    • Android SDK – adt-bundle-windows-x86\n    • IDE: Eclipse Mars\n    • Jdk-8u66-windows-i586\n2.1Existing Definition:\n\tThis project is associated to maintain Ship details, Shipment details, Stock details and work order details these details are going to be maintained in manual process to do All these tasks it will take lot of time. Thus the existing system not supporting multi-user support. It is having lots of manual work (Manual system does not mean that you are working with pen and paper, it also include working on spread sheets and other simple software's). \t\nDrawbacks of the system:\n    • The existing is an undeveloped form and the manual process of the overall system is too clumsy and complicated.\n    •  The Customers facing lot of problems to know their c schedule details.\n    •  It is very difficult to know Employee work order details.\n    •  It is very difficult to know the stock details and available status immediately.\n    • The present system is very less secure.\n    • It is unable to generate different kinds of report.\n    • It is difficult to maintain Phones.\n    • Manual Interaction of Friends is much difficult.\n2.2 Proposed Solution:\t\nThis product interacts with mainly three entities i.e. Customer, Employee and Stores Department. The automated system with distributed architecture can support issues like the system maintains the details of all types of ship details.  The system intemperate consistently all projects and sub contacts into one canted storage with proper association. The details about the shipment to Customer maintained very fast in a short period of time.  All the Ship details, work order details, Customer details are segregated and stored consistently with unique Ids.\nADVANTAGES\nThe system makes the overall project management much easier and flexible.\n    •  The schedule of the presently working Employee on various ships with the details of their status is maintained.\n    • There is no risk of data mismanagement at any level while the project development is under process.\n    • The Optima Cruise Management Software is the complete, leading, most advanced system for the cruise ships industry Cruise Management system. \n    • Synchronized online and telephonic boat reservation system would increases your reservations.\n    • It provides integrated hospitality technology for the cruise line industry that automates operations such as collecting  our systems. \nCHAPTER 3 OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Product Perspective\n\tManager view all the booking items.

The production practices used to grow crops impinge on an agro ecosystem made up of complex interactions among soil, water, biota, and the atmosphere. The interactions among the farming systems and the soil, water, biota, and atmosphere determine the effects those farming systems will have on soil and water quality.\n\n        1.1 Objectives\nTo define the scientific basis on which the local environmental management and crop production is based.To develop models and strategies in the sectors responsible for the agricultural product development and distribution in order to create a permanent link between the scientific institutions dealing with natural resources and environment and the planners at different levels.\n     \n\nCHAPTER 2 – LITERATURE REVIEW\t\nSince the middle of 2012, we have participated inseveral rescue drills and tested the effect of Rescue Wings in rescue support. The first real-world application of\nRescue Wings was the 2013 Ya’an Earthquake in Sichuan province, China. During the rescue operation, there were more than four hundred mobile devices connected to the Rescue Wings servers, around 32,000 service requests had been processed, and at least 58,000 messages had been produced, transmitted, and utilized for assisting the stricken people and supporting the responders. According to on-the-spot investigation and post hoc analysis, the services provided by Rescue Wings contributed effectively to the performance and success of the operation. Until now, the client-side applications of Rescue Wings have been deployed to more than 18,000 end users.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 presents the framework of Rescue Wings and introduces the functionalities of Rescue Wings clients, servants, and rescue support services. Section 4 proposes an efficient bio-inspired algorithm for scheduling the requests to services of Rescue Wings. Section 5 introduces the experiments of Rescue Wings in two drills, Section 6 describes the application of the Ya’an Earthquake rescue operation, and Section 7 concludes.\n\n\n\n OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.1 Module Description\n\tPublic choose their category and view details about this research paper.

But actually 10 second delay may decide the life or death of a person. We are familiar with the concept of an emergency ambulance, an ambulance which is used to move patients rapidly to critical care in an emergency room under required medical condition. They can also be used for routine transport of non-urgent cases, such as transfers between hospitals and nursing homes and accidents. In most nations, ambulances are given priority on the road, in recognition to the fact that time is important when moving a critically ill or seriously injured patients. So Ambulances are critical tools in helping EMTs and other trained first responders not only quickly arrive at an emergency but also provide potentially life-saving measures.\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7MJz9rr8yMU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nExisting Definition\n    • Its manual process for earlier system.\n    • Its more time consume for all process.\n    • Need for more resources.\n    • If we can’t able to find vehicle its chance to lost the patient life.\n\n\n\nProposed Solution:\n    • The propose system provides ambulance location and surrounding areas. \n    • We can search and immediately call and give information of patient details.\n    • Its help to save the patient’s life for any emergency time or accidents time.\n    • We can find the location, landmark details also available through this website.\n\n\nSystem Modules:\n    • ADMIN\n    • Register\n    • Login\n    • Update Details\n    • Edit and delete\n    • USER\n    • View details\n    • Filter search\n    • Make call\n\n    • ADMIN:\n    • Register:\n\tAdmin can register to create their account\n    • Login:\n\t\tAdmin can login this system after they can set their own password.\n    • Update Details:\n\t\tAdmin enters this system update their company details about type of vehicle, landmark, location, surrounding available details and etc.\n    • Edit and Delete:\n\t\tAdmin can only edit and delete information about their company details.\n    • USER:\n    • View details:\n\tUser can view the ambulance company details.\n    • Filter Search:\n\t\tUser can search for filter type like location, landmark, address etc.\n    • Make Call:\n\t\tAfter find the ambulance details they can call immediately.\n\n\n4.1.1Usecase Diagrams:\t\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Sequence Diagram:\n\n4.1.3 Collaboration Diagram:\n\n",

        "content": "Orphanage Management System \nABSTRACT\nAs Orphanages are increasing in day to basis simultaneously the helping hands are also increasing in higher range. The practical difficulty is finding out the real orphans and the less knowledge about the donation details. So the website was developed to help to reach the needy orphans by the volunteering donations. It allows the users to search and find the orphanages on internet and then they can donate with the orphanages whichever they want.\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_H_6hM2kEk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n1.3 Existing method:\n\tIn the old process of adoption & donation donor have undergo many manual process \n    • Prospective adoptive parents need to register with an authorized agency \n    • Home study and the child \n    • Filling of the petition \n    • Acceptance of the child \n    • Pre adoption foster care \n    • Referral of the child \n    • Court hearing \n    • Court order \n    • Follow up \n\n1.4 Drawbacks:\nMajor drawback of the process is that option for the adopter is limited. And it increases the delay of adoption and time consuming. Because of such lengthy process many willing people will also lose their interest in adopting. In the later period government of Indian taken some initiative to help the orphans and introduced a website named CARA (Central Adoption Resource Authority) is a statutory body of ministry of Women & Child Development, Government of India. It functions as the nodal body of adoption. But the drawback of this paper is that there is no option for donating through online. So it disappoints the donor who is willing to donate via online .CARA gives the details of agency which was government approved. By selecting the region, donor will get the details of the nearby government approved organizations. Later this website is developed into an web application “Give Orphanage” which was a private application and developed version of CARA website. It provides the bank details and online payment methods, but the drawback of this application is it gives details of only particular orphanage. In later period many application was developed but not in India.\n\n1.5 Proposed Method:\nMotive of our paper is to eliminate the drawback of previous application and to help orphans to the full extend. For this we are going to develop an web application. Initial step of the application will be login. It has two ways of login one is user/donor login and other is admin’s login which means the admin of the particular orphanage. In case of donor login they will be having three options; they are donation, adoption and orphanage details. By selecting the particular category they can reach their required page. In the donation category they can donate food, clothes and money the particular orphanage they wish. In adoption category they will get list of orphans and their details of different orphanages. In case for admin login whole pattern will be different. Whenever new orphan is admitted they can enroll the details of that child in this portal. And if there is any shortage of food, cloth or money they can give a notification to the registered user’s phone numbers. Each person who login into the application has to undergo authentication with their phone number and they will become a member of this application and they will be given a unique ID which reduces chaos. So whenever admin puts a notification of need will be reflected as a notification to the donor’s side. And in our application we have planned to display list of orphanage region wise. And their bank details will also be associated with that. This will be used for the donors for the online fund transaction. So that donor can directly pay to that particular orphanage with full satisfaction. Since the process of adoption undergoes many legal processes, we are not including that in our application. We will only provide child details and where they belong to.\n\n1.6 Advantages \n    • Easy to finding the orphanages.\n    • Easy to resolve the problem with in the span of time to given donation to the needy people. \n\nAdmin \n    • Login \n    • Add Orphanage/Old Ages\n        ◦ Name ,No of people, Manager , contact, email, Bank details , Image, Google map , Address , City, District, State, Pincode\n    • View Orphange /Old Ages\n    • Edit/Delete Orphange/Old Ages\n    • Upload Images\n    • Update Google geo location\n\nUser \n    • Search by \n        ◦ City, District,state, pincode\n        ◦ Orphanage name \n    • List of Orphanage\n    • View Full details orphange\n\nSoftware Requirements: -\nFront End: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap\nBack End: PHP, MYSQL\nControl End: Angular Java Script\n\nTools:\n    xampp-win32-5.5.19-0-VC11",
