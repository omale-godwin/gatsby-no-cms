In 2013, an estimated 6.3 million children under the age of five died (Children: Reducing Mortality, 2014). Child mortality is important as it is a pointer of the usage, accessibility, and availability of the health system by the inhabitants especially children. It is also a sign of the extent in which a society exercises the most basic human right: the right to life and health (GOAL 4: Reduce the under-five child mortality rate, 2010).</div> <div>Although the rate of under-five deaths has decreased by 28 per cent between 1990 and 2008, it still remains high (Goal 4 Reduce Child Mortality, 2010). Research and experience has revealed that out of the almost 11 million chil-dren deaths per year, more than half could be saved by measures such as vaccines, antibiotics, micronutrient supplementation, insecticide-treated bed nets and improved family care and breastfeeding practices (Goal: Reduce Child mortality, Unicef). Therefore, the intensification of the health system to provide such interventions could save many lives (Children: reducing mortali-ty, 2014). A report published by the United Nations (UN) claims that \"nurses are key to achieving the United Nations Development Program’s Millennium Development Goals\" which includes reducing child and maternal mortality (Amieva and Ferguson, 2011). According to an article titled \"The vital role of health care workers\" published by <em>the guardian</em> (2012), a child is more likely to live till their fifth birthday if there are enough midwives, nurses and doctors. If the rate of under-five mortality is to reduce, nurses need to be knowledgeable and empowered in caring for children. Therefore, this study aims to examine and identify the role of nurses in reducing and or preventing infant and child mortality with a purpose of providing research based information that could be used by nurses.</div> <div><strong>2</strong>      <strong>Infant and Child Mortality</strong></div> <div><strong>2.1  Causes of infant and child mortality</strong></div> <div>Child mortality rate also known as under-five mortality rate is defined as the possibility that in every 1000 live births one baby will die before reaching age five: Whereas, the death of a child before his/her first birth day is termed infant death or infant mortality. Therefore, infant mortality rate is the number of chil-dren dying under a year of age by 1000 live births. Infant mortality rate is an important marker to measure the health and wellbeing of a population (Centre for disease control and prevention, 2014). This is because it is often linked to several factors such as maternal health, quality and access to medical care, socioeconomic conditions, and public health practices (Definition of Mortality, Infant, 2012).</div> <div>In 2013, an estimated 6.3 million children under five years of age depart this life. An estimated 44% of these deaths occurred during the neonatal period. Neonatal period, which is the first 28 days of life, is considered to be the time where in a child is at the highest risk of dying. In addition, about 45% of all the under-five death has a connection with malnutrition. Although a child born in an already developed or a developing country can die before five years of age, he/she is, however, more likely to die if living in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia compared to his/her counterparts in a developed country. About 50% of all under- five deaths occur in only five developing countries namely China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. (Children: Reducing Mortality, WHO, 2014). A large proportion of these deaths are caused by infectious yet preventable diseases (Niño-Zarazúa, 2013)</div> <div>The main reasons of death in these regions are pneumonia (13%), diarrhea (9%), malaria (7%), measles, (2%), HIV/AIDS (3%), neonatal conditions like pre-term birth, birth asphyxia, and infections (46%).</div>\n\nNURSES' ROLE IN PREVENTION OF INFANT AND UNDER-FIVE CHILD MORTALITY IN AFRICA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NURSES' ROLE IN PREVENTION OF INFANT AND UNDER-FIVE CHILD MORTALITY IN AFRICA", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Cancer of the cervix remains the most common malignant neoplasm of the female genitalia and the second most common cancer in women..

The hypothesis for the study was: there is no relationship between knowledge of cervical cancer and acceptability of cervical cancer screening. Survey research design was used in the study. Simple random sampling was used to select the sample. The sample consisted of 200 Female Part- Time Students in University of Benin. Data was collected using questionnaire. The study findings revealed that slightly above half more than half of (74%) of the respondents were between the age of 20-25 years, 58 (77%) respondents could not remember age of their first sexual intercourse, the majority 168(86%) of respondents have heard of cervical cancer, majority 126 (63%) of respondents heard about cervical cancer from media, hundred and two (51%) participants explained cervical cancer as abnormal lesion on the cervix, sixty four (32%) respondents stated that unprotected sexual intercourse is a risk factor of cervicals cancer, sixty (30%) of respondents stated that abnormal vaginal bleeding is a sign of cervical cancer, 120 (60%) respondents stated that cervical cancer can be detected by cervicals cancer screening, majority 194 (97%) of respondents stated that cervical cancers screening is done in hospital, majority 178 (89%) of respondents had never been screened for cervical cancers, majority 94 (47%) of respondents strongly agreed that cervical cancer screening is important, the majority 144(72%) of the respondents had no intention of going for cervicals cancer screening, majority 80 (40%) of respondents stated that lack of awareness to cervical cancers screening is a major barrier to cervical cancer screening. The study recommends among others that nurses should engage more on giving Information Education and Communication (IEC) at all levels of Health Care Delivery toward cervical cancers screening. Cervical cancers screening center should be made available in university of Benin health center at subsidized amount so that female students can easily access the service.</p>\n\nKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPTABILITY OF CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING AMONG FEMALE PART-TIME STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPTABILITY OF CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING AMONG FEMALE PART-TIME STUDENTS", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The problem of every hospital when the targeted objective is not achieved is that there is something wring either with health care givers, the patients or the general public.

It is also the predictive power of an increase. Therefore, it is recommended that government should provide more medical facilities for easy delivery.    </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.1       INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In statistical analysis and inference statistics is playing an important role nearly in all phases of human life. Formally dealing only with affair of the state and this account for its name statistics.  </p> <p>The influence of statistics is now spread to manufacturing companies, agricultural sectors, bank, business communication, economic, education, political science, psychology, sociology and other numerous held of life. It’s therefore, a body of scientific method and theory of collecting, organizing, presenting and analyzing of data as well as drawing valid conclusion and making a reasonable decision. The application is found in all discipline of numerical form.</p> <p>Furthermore, this project is to explain and to analyze more on fertility and mortality rate of people in “OSOGBO LOCAL GOVERNMENT”. This project cover four fiscal year from 2006 – 2009 and data is being collected at LAUTECH TEACHING HOSPITAL OSOGBO. Also computation would be determined from the total number of fertility and mortality rate and this will be use for information required for the actualization of facts.</p> <p><strong>1.2       HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>LAUTECH TEACHING HOSPITAL is owned by both Osun State Government and Oyo State Government. The hospital is situated at Idi-seke area in Osogbo Local Government. LAUTECH Teaching Hospital is equiped to standard that no other hospital in the state can complete with it. LAUTECH Teaching Hospital has many professional doctors and well trained and very efficient nurses.</p> <p><strong>1.3       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>-           To know whether the number of life birth (Fertility) of Osogbo Local Government is more than number of death (Mortality).             </p> <p>-           To be able to study the future occurrence in the rate of fertility and mortality by using least square method.</p> <p>-           To measure the trend value of fertility and mortality rate by using moving average method.</p> <p><strong>1.4       TYPES OF STATISTICS</strong></p> <p>There are two types of statistics namely:    </p> <ol><li>Descriptive statistics</li> <li>Inference statistics</li> </ol> <p>In descriptive statistics, the research has information on every member of the population and also describes the characteristics of the population such as: Total, average, Means or more (Population Parameters). But in Inferential Statistics, the researcher has information on part of population (sample). Mean, mode and standard deviation are collected for the sample; each of them is called statistics.  </p> <p><strong>1.5       USES OF STATISTICS</strong></p> <p>Statistics is useful in all field of human endeavour. We can use the knowledge of statistics to find the number of employed people in a country, we can use it to find market trend, to make any possible request in any business ventures. Infact, there is no aspect of our daily life that statistics is not applicable.</p> <p><strong>1.5.1   TYPES OF STATISTICAL DATA</strong></p> <p>Data can be defined as pieces of information collected for specific purpose. </p> <p>In any survey, what determines the types of data to be collected is the topic studying upon, which enquiries are to be made. </p> <p><strong>1.5.2   PRIMARY DATA</strong></p> <p>Primary data can be define as the data collected or drawn from the original source for specific reason, from which it will be useful. These types of data are always accurate and reliable upon it can be collected through these methods:</p> <ol><li>Mail questionnaire</li> <li>Telephone interview</li> <li>Personal interview</li> <li>Direct observation</li> <li>Experiment </li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5.3   SECONDARY DATA</strong></p> <p>This is the data collected for a purpose different for which is originally meant for. It is a secondhand data collected for a purpose direct from statistical enquiries in which they used. It has the advantage of reducing the time and cost to be used. </p> <p><strong>1.6       POSSIBLE LIMITATION TO THE USE OF DATA</strong></p> <p>The data collected is a secondary data and it’s liable to some kind of difficulties which limits the extent to which it can be used dealing with secondary data.</p> <p>Therefore, any suggestion or recommendation made as the outcome of analysis is not only meant for LAUTECH Teaching Hospital.</p>\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON FERTILITY AND MORTALITY RATE IN OSOGBO LOCAL GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE YEAR (2006 - 2009)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON FERTILITY AND MORTALITY RATE IN OSOGBO LOCAL GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE YEAR (2006 - 2009)", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The problem of every hospital when the targeted objective is not achieved is that there is something wring either with health care givers, the patients or the general public.

The result showed that many factor contribute to the effect of relapse.</p> <p>All these can be prevented through adequate Education, Family oriented therapies, good social support, compliance and keep the follow-up appointment.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>Psychiatric illness has fascinated and confounded healers, scientist and philosopher for centuries, it symptoms have been attributed to possession by demons considered to be punishment by the gods for the evil done or accepted as evidence of the inhumanity of its sufferers victims. Thus explanation resulted in enduring stigma for those whose were diagnosed with such disorders. Even today, much of the sigma persist although it has less to do with demonic possession than with society’s unwillingness to shoulder the tremendous cost associated with mental illness.</p> <p>Relapse is one of the most severe problem of mental health care givers. It is common in about 1.3% of the already treated cases of mental illness or more than two million people (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS] 1999). Its economic cost is envious. Direct cost of relapse treatment expenses of most psychiatric illness were estimated 2.5% of the total treatment of first hand mental illness care budget in 1998 (American Psychiatric Association [APA] 2000).</p> <p>The last year for which these data were available (USDHHS, 1999). In 1997, this accountant for $23.6 billion of mental health care dollar spent. The indirect cost such as lost of wages, premature death and incarceration were estimated to be $46 billion in the first half of 1998 (APA, 2000).</p> <p>Further unemployment among permanent disability is 10% (APA 1998). The cost relapse in terms of individuals and family suffering are probably inestimable.</p> <p>Despite the current trend in modern treatment, there is still an alarming rate of relapse and the reoccurrence of psychiatric illness globally. Individual who ought to be productive and responsible in life are wasting away on daily basis.</p> <p>Today patients are required to stay for a short period of time in the hospital admission and discharge to home environment to help reduce dependency on the hospital care and reducing relapse. Also this helps to reduce stigmatization and prevent complications (Feyinsayo, A. 2009). This study will attempt an overview of Nurse and also to show how proper utilization of psychiatric Nursing service will go a long way in reducing and eradicating the ever growing cases of relapse among psychiatric patients in Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Barnawa, Kaduna.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>The frequency of patients having readmission into the hospital over the last few years has become a problem. This has made the achievement of good control of patients’ symptoms and cure impossible.</p> <p>Nursing Staff and the Hospital has suffered frustration seeing the readmission of patients, whom were recently discharged home after being stabilized on admission. Some patient relapse as soon as they are discharged home. Other on trials discharge relapse while other still relapse while on admission. Various factors ranging from financial problems, lack of adequate staff have contributed to the relapse of patients.</p> <p>Some patients have about a day or two days journey distance to the hospital resulting in poor monitoring and accessibility to the mental health services. Other factors also include stigmatization and dependency on care giver. All these have contributed in the frequency of relapse experienced in the care of these groups of patient leading to the social disability.</p> <p>Hence, resulting in the following:</p> <ol><li>Low manpower</li> <li>Untold hardship</li> <li>Financial constraints</li> <li>Societal nuisance</li> </ol> <p>If not properly handled and solutions found, the economy may suffer and the society will be at a loss apart from the untold hardship. This is what motivated the researcher to investigate the cause, give suggestions, remedy the situation and also reduce the high rate of relapse.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>1.      To evaluate the relationship between the educational background of the Nurses and their attitude towards prevention of relapse.</p> <p>2.      To ascertain he relationship between the status of the Nurse and her ability to prevent relapse among psychiatric patients.</p> <p>3.      To determine the relationship between the experience of the Nurse and their ability to identify symptoms of relapse.</p> <p>4.      To find out whether poverty can predispose psychiatric patient to relapse.</p> <p>5.      To determine the relationship between drug compliance among psychiatric patient and relapse prevention.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of this study is to help Nurses develop a positive attitude towards the care to the psychiatric patient thereby reducing the incidence of relapse.</p> <p>1.5    <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.      What is the relationship between the educational background of the Nurse and their attitude toward relapse prevention?</p> <p>2.      What is the ability of the Nurse towards Relapse prevention among psychiatric patients?</p> <p>3.      What is the experience of the Nurse toward identifying symptoms of relapse?</p> <p>4.      Can poverty predispose psychiatric patients to relapse?</p> <p>5.      Can drug compliance prevent relapse among psychiatric patient?</p> <p>1.6    <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is restricted to Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Barnawa Kaduna which is one of the tertiary healthcare institutions owned by the federal Government of Nigeria.</p> <p>1.7    <strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>          Financial Constraint as there is no adequate Funds.</p> <p>The limitations of this study were due to lack of time due to the limited time within which the study had to be carried out.</p> <p>1.8    <strong>Operational Definition of Terms</strong></p> <ol><li><strong><em>Attitude</em></strong>: The way you think and feel about something.</li> <li><strong><em>Disability:</em></strong> Any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being.</li> <li><strong><em>Management:</em></strong> The process of treatment or control of disease or disorders or the care of patient who suffer them.</li> <li><strong><em>Nurse:</em></strong> A person whose job is to care for people who are ill.</li> <li><strong><em>Psychiatric Nursing:</em></strong> This is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, treatments, diagnosis, cause of mental illness.</li> <li><strong><em>Prevention:</em></strong> To keep away from happening or arising of stop from occurring.</li> <li><strong><em>Psychiatric Patient:</em></strong> Person who suffers from mental illness which could be minor or major.</li> <li><strong><em>Rehabilitation:</em></strong> Restore to effectiveness or normal life by training especially after illness.</li> <li><strong><em>Relapse:</em></strong> The return of disease after an interval of convalescence.</li> </ol>\n\nA RESEARCH STUDY ON ATTITUDE OF NURSES TOWARDS RELAPSE PREVENTION AMONG PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS IN FEDERAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A RESEARCH STUDY ON ATTITUDE OF NURSES TOWARDS RELAPSE PREVENTION AMONG PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS IN FEDERAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL ", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Tuberculosis is a problem of global importance among communicable diseases.

The aim was to prevent small pox by exposing healthy people to tissue from the scabs caused by the disease this is the first recorded attempt at vaccination. The British physician Dr. Edward Jenner in 1796 discovered vaccination in its modern form and proved to the scientific community that it worked. He was considered the founder of vaccinology in the west after he inoculated a 13year old boy with vaccine of a virus (cow pox) and demonstrated immunity to small pox. By 1798, the first small pox vaccine was developed.Immunization is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases. Widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restrictions of disease such as polio, measles and tetanus. Generally immunization involves stimulating immune responses with infectious agents, i.e. priming the immune system with an immunogen with the intention of creating specific resistance to an infectious disease. Simply put a process by which an individual’s immune system becomes fortified against an agent.</p> \n\nANALYSIS ON THE KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE REGARDING IMMUNIZATION OF UNDER-FIVE CHILDREN AMONG MOTHERS ATTENDING ANTENATAL CLINIC (ANC)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS ON THE KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE REGARDING IMMUNIZATION OF UNDER-FIVE CHILDREN AMONG MOTHERS ATTENDING ANTENATAL CLINIC (ANC)", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Food is anything which when taken into the body serves       to nourish or build up the body tissues or to supply body        health (Nurses Dictionary 2010).

Food safety is a\r\nscientific discipline describing handling, preparation, and storage of food in\r\nways that prevent foodborne illnesses.<sup>3</sup> This include the number of\r\nroutines that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards.\r\nFood can transmit diseases from one person to the other as well as serve as a\r\ngrowth medium for bacteria that can cause food poisoning.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-top:10.1pt;margin-right:39.8pt;margin-bottom:\r\n0in;margin-left:23.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:\r\n200%\">Debates on genetic food safety include such issues as impact of\r\ngenetically modified food on health of further generations and genetic\r\npollution of environment, which can destroy natural biological diversity. <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.15pt\">In </span>developed countries, there are\r\nintricate standards for food preparation, whereas in lesser developed countries,\r\nthe main issue is simply the availability of adequate safe<span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\"> </span>water,<span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\"> </span>which<span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\"> </span>is<span style=\"letter-spacing:.35pt\"> </span>usually<span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\"> </span>a<span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\"> </span>critical<span style=\"letter-spacing:.3pt\"> </span>item.<span style=\"letter-spacing:.45pt\"> </span><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.15pt\">In</span><span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\"> </span>theory,<span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\"> </span>food<span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\"> </span>poisoning<span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\"> </span><span style=\"letter-spacing:.15pt\">is</span><span style=\"letter-spacing:.3pt\"> </span>hundred<span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\"> </span>percent<span style=\"letter-spacing:.35pt\"> </span>(100</p>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-top:3.65pt;margin-right:39.9pt;margin-bottom:\r\n0in;margin-left:23.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:\r\n200%\">%) preventable.<sup>3</sup> Food sanitation also extends to keeping the\r\npreparation area clean and relatively germ-free.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">  </span>Mixing bowls,<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\"> \r\n</span>spoons, paring knives<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">  </span>and<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">  </span>any other<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\"> \r\n</span>tools<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">  </span>used in <span style=\"letter-spacing:1.05pt\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\"> </span></span>the<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";\r\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:\r\nEN-US;mso-bidi-language:EN-US'></span> kitchen should be washed thoroughly before use.

It is second leading disease causing death worldwide killing nearly 2 million people each year in Nigeria.  Non-compliance of patients on tuberculosis treatment in an irregular and unreliable way has greatly caused risk of treatment failure, relapse and the development of drug-resistance tuberculosis strains. There are varieties of reasons why patients fail to take their medications. The center for disease control (2008) states the following: </p> <p>·        The patients compliant is that medicines  must be taken with empty stomach to facilitate absorption. This can be difficult for patients to follow especially waking  up an hour earlier than usual everyday just to take medicine  on empty stomach.</p> <p>·        Another complains is the size of tablet</p> <p>·        Side-effect of the drugs can lead to patients not complying to their treatment. </p> <p>·        Issues on denial, stigmatization, emotional distress, cultural and life-style factors make patients not to take their treatment. </p> <p>·        Poverty, transportation, religion and attitude of health workers contribute to non-compliance of patients on tuberculosis treatment. </p> <p>Non-compliance of patient on tuberculosis treatment is a serious problem for national tuberculosis control programs (2007) states that this case tends   to have higher morbidity and mortality rate when compared to those who are not cured.

World health organization (2013)reported worldwide that some countries like South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Malaysia, Ghana, China, United States of America and Canada were implementing the directly- observed treatment short-course strategy by the end of 2013. World health organization 2015) currently recommends a case detection rate of 70% and a treatment success rate of 85% for all tuberculosis cases. It is believed that achieving these targets will lead to a reduction in tuberculosis prevalence, incidence, transmission and drug-resistance to tuberculosis treatment. </p> <p>This study was conducted to determine the non-compliance of tuberculosis in Imo State University Teaching Hospital, Orlu L.G.A.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>Despite the global effort to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis worldwide through mass media, there is  still non-compliance to treatment which may be due to the bulkiness of the drugs and taking the  drugs on empty stomach. Noticing the incidence of tuberculosis on orthodox and other clinics motivates the researcher to carry out a research to determine the reasons for non-compliance of patients to tuberculosis treatment.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF STUDY </strong></p> <p>The objectives of this study include:</p> <p>·        To ascertain the knowledge of people about tuberculosis, its  causes and its effects.</p> <p>·        To find the cause of patients not complying to their treatment. </p> <p>·        To identify the knowledge of patients based on the importance of complying to treatment.</p> <p>·        To identify strategies for improvement of patients’ acceptance of care and treatment of tuberculosis. </p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY </strong></p> <p><strong>To The Client: </strong></p> <p>·        The study will help the individual to have the knowledge on health investigation and screening in order to indicate the early signs and symptoms </p> <p>·        It will also help the patient to know the importance of treatment given to them.</p> <p><strong>To the family</strong></p> <p>It will help the family members to have the knowledge on the cause &amp; prevention of tuberculosis. </p> <p><strong>To the community </strong></p> <p>This will educate people on the importance of good personal and environmental hygiene and also avoid over-crowding. </p> <p><strong>To the country</strong></p> <p>It will reduce mortality and morbidity rate in the county.</p> <p><strong>To the health worker </strong></p> <p>It will help the health care provider to have adequate knowledge on the management and treatment of the patient.</p> <p><strong>1.5  RESEARCH QUESTION </strong></p> <p>·        What are the knowledge levels of people about tuberculoses disease, its cause and its effects? </p> <p>·        What are the causes of patients not complying to their treatment?</p> <p>·        What are the people’s knowledge about the importance of complying to their treatment? </p> <p>·        What are the strategies for improvement of patients’ acceptance of care and treatment of tuberculosis?</p> <p><strong>1.6  SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is focused on patients suffering tuberculosis in Imo State University Teaching Hospital, Orlu, L.G.A. </p> <p><strong>OPERATIONAL DEFINITION  OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>·        <strong>Tuberculosis:</strong> a communicable disease that is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis.</p> <p>·        <strong>Investigation:</strong> finding or searching for more information.</p> <p>·        <strong>Infectious patients:</strong> people that harbor infections caused by micro- organisms.</p> <p>·        <strong>Infection:</strong> the presence and growth of a micro-organism that produce tissue –damage </p> <p> <strong>Epidemic:</strong> this is the presence of a disease which affects a large number of populations in a definite territory</p>\n\nTHE NON-COMPLIANCE TO TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT AMONG PATIENTS SUFFERING TUBERCULOSIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE NON-COMPLIANCE TO TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT AMONG PATIENTS SUFFERING TUBERCULOSIS", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><br/><strong>THE PERCEPTION AND ATTITUDE OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT TOWARDS CESAREAN SECTION</strong><br/><br/></p> <p>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/><br/>Pregnancy as a physiologic state is expected to lead to a process of delivery within thirty six weeks (36) of gestation in a normal delivery but due to the different reasons such as variation in human body, sizes, races, external factors e.t.c, it can be a very unpleasant experience as women may have difficulties in being delivered of the pregnancy they have carried over many weeks.<br/><br/>Hence, to save the life of both mother and child in some cases, a cesarean section. A cesarean section also known as C/S is an operation technique by which a fetus is delivered through an indications can either be maternal or fetal. The trend of acceptability and the rate of C/S has been on the increase in the developed countries in the past two decades. In the United State of America, it has revolved off a 32.8% in 2010 and 2011 (Hamilton BE, Martin JA, Ventura SJ, 2010). Several cesarean sections are sometimes done for justifiable medical and non-medical indications sequently the rate of C/S in Europe and North America have been increasing (Declercq ER, Sakela C, Corry MP, 2013).<br/><br/>Conversely, in the developing countries, the change in C/S rate has been dramatic during the same period. This results from negative perception of C/S among women in the developing countries. C/S is still being perceived as an abnormal means of delivery by some women in developing countries, hence C/S rate in Sub-Saharan African Country like Burkina Faso and Niger is as low as 2% (Sunday Adeoje I, Kalu CA, 2011).<br/><br/>Among women in the developing countries, C/S is still being perceived as a curse on an unfruitful women and the lot of weak women. In a study among Yoruba women of South western Nigeria, C/S was viewed with suspicious, aversion, misconception, fear, guilt misery and anger. (Sunday-Adeoje et al, 2011).<br/><br/>In Nigeria, as in most sub-Saharan African countries, it has been suggested that women reluctantly accept C/S even in the face of obvious clinical indications. Also, negative view and perception of C/S by women in the developing country has led to gross underathizetlien of the procedure compared to the large burden of obstetric morbid requiring resolution by C/S (AzikenMicheal, Lawrence Omo-Aghoja 2010).<br/><br/>1.2STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/><br/>Nigerian has been rated the third country with the highest mortality rate after India and Sierra Leone with over 40,000 dths of pregnant women 2012 (WHO 2013).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite the well documented record of safety, the strong aversion of women in sub-Saharan Africa tot eh procedure especially in the presence of life threatening indications is a great concern (Awoyinka BS, 2006).

Childhood malnutrition is a serious challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa and a major underlying cause of death. It is a result of dynamic and complex interaction between political, social, economic, environmental and other factors. Malnutri-tion is a major contributor to mortality and is increasingly recognized as a cause of potential-ly lifelong functional disability. Malnutrition is well recognized as a widespread health prob-lem with consequences that are acute and even, more often long-term problems. Malnutri-tion remains a problem of public health concern in most developing countries (Kennedy, Ped-ro, Seghieri, Nantel &amp; Brouwer 2007). Containing less or no animal products, and slight amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables, diets are deficient in micronutrients and of poor qual-ity.</div> <div>In a global context, approximately 45% of the 6.6 million deaths of children under-five year of age in 2012 are caused by undernutrition (UNICEF, 2012). Geographically, the majority of the undernutrition burden exists in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-Central Asia (Bhutta and Salam 2012). Malnutrition has three commonly used comprehensive types named stunting, wasting and underweight: measured by height for age, weight for height and weight for age indexes respectively. Adequate nutrition continues to play an important role during the school age years in assuring that children reach their full potential for growth, development and health. Nutrition problems can still occur during this age, such as iron-deficiency anemia, under nu-trition such as Kwashiorkor, marasmus, overnutrition and dental caries. The prevalence of obesity is increasing but the beginning of eating disorders can also be detected in some school age and preadolescent children.</div> <div>In addition, adequate nutrition prevents the onset of health-related problems, encouraging a healthy eating pattern can help prevent immediate health concerns as well as promote a healthy lifestyle, which in turn may reduce the risk of the child developing a chronic condi-tion such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life (Story, Holts &amp; Sofka 2000). Adequate nutrition, especially eating breakfast has been associated with im-proved academic performance in school and reduced tardiness and absence (Meyer, Sampson, Weitzman, Rogers &amp; Kayne 1989). Consequently, this meets the energy and nutrient needs of the children, addressing common nutrition problems, and preventing nutrition-related disor-ders.</div> <div>The growth and development of school-age and preadolescent children and their relationships to nutritional status is significant right from the beginning. Children continue to grow physi-cally at a steady rate during this period; nevertheless the development from cognitive, emo-tional and social standpoint is tremendous. This period in a child's life is preparation for the physical and emotional demands of the adolescent growth spurt, with aid of family members, teachers and others in their lives who model healthy eating and physical activity behaviors.</div> <div>This thesis focuses on the effects of malnutrition and the impact it has on the lives of chil-dren in the developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia by re-viewing existing scientific-based literatures on the topic of malnutrition. The purpose of this study was to find out and describe why developing countries are associated with malnutrition problems.

Teaching adolescents about birth control may not be consistent with promoting abstinence. However, most adolescents are sexually active and have high tendency to engage in early sexual activities despite having knowledge of abstinence. According to the American Pediatric Association, nine in ten adolescents have had intercourse by the time they turn twenty and, more than 15 million girls between the ages of 15 and 19 give birth every year worldwide, and an additional 5 million have abortions. In Central America, 18% of all births are to women in their teens and in Africa this figure is 23% according to world health organization. Parents-adolescent communication also plays an important role in attitudes and behaviors of adolescents concerning contraceptives. (Pediatrics 1999.)</div> <div>Our project is done under MIMO (Moving in moving on) which is 3 year research and development project with EU funding from the central Baltic program. The aim of the project is to improve professional team work and art based methods for social and youth work by carrying out various workshops for the target groups of 13-17 year olds. The project is targeted on youths who are at risk of isolation from society. (MIMO 2013.)</div> <div>However, the aim of this project is to share adolescents experiences about sexuality and contraceptives from a cultural perspective. And task is to use digital story telling method to share adolescent experiences of sexuality and contraception from cultural perspectives.</div> <div><strong>2     CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE.</strong></div> <div>A large number of factors influence sexual activities during adolescence period. The most common factor is teenagers’ ability to cope with the body changes in shape and size especially women. Teenagers are exposed to the risk of contracting STDs, including HIV/Aids and teenage girls are even more at risk, with early, unwanted and unplanned pregnancies.(WHO2013.)</div> <div>This chapter is a review of different literatures of relevant articles, journals and texts related to adolescent sexuality and contraceptive experiences from cultural perspectives.</div> <div><strong>Adolescent Sexuality and Contraception.</strong></div> <div>A Zambian population has about 48% of adolescents below 15 years and 21 years. Most of adolescent who drop out from school engage themselves in drugs, alcohol, smoking and unprotected sex, risking their lives with diseases like HIV/Aids, sexual transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. Sexual activities has become more passively to youths in rural areas that have less knowledge about sexuality and contraceptives, and have difficulties obtaining information and contraceptive services or they are poorly informed about sexual health issues. In the past Zambian parents could not talk to their children about sex because it was a taboo, however, it is the duty of a grandfathers or grandmother to instruct their grandchildren on sexual matters (Likwa 2009). This is so due to culture, religions, believes and values followed by Zambian traditions. Adolescents lack knowledge due to factors such as ignorance from service providers and negative staff attitudes at the centers also fear of being seen by neighbors who may communicate to parents or guardians. Some believe that contraceptive access is thought of promoting prostitution; pills cause cancer, infertility and other diseases among women. Parents, health care providers, teachers and the society are neglating adolescent’s sexual activities.

The world elderly population has increased tremendously and special measures are taken to secure their well being. One of the vital steps towards securing elderly health is through participation in exercise.</div> <div>The purpose of this quantitative research was to explore ways in which exercise functions as a boost to elderly health in multicultural environment. The aims are to get an overall view of elderly awareness and experiences about exercise and to find out the role played by nurses in provision of exercise to elderly. Research method of the thesis was quantitative, whereby questionnaires as data collection method were distributed to the elderly in three countries: China (Ri Yuexing nursing home), Kenya (Eldoret and Cherangani nursing home), and Finland (Purola elderly home). Manual way, Microsoft Excel and SPSS programme were used as a descriptive statistics technique to analyze the data and table and graphs were made to reflect the results.</div> <div>The research questions were: What are the elderly experiences about exercise? How do elderly implement exercise? How do the elderly experience the effects of exercise on their health? What is nurses’ role in promotion of exercise among elderly?</div> <div>The results of this research showed most elderly are aware of the importance of exercises. Age is not a limiting factor to exercise since there are different forms of exercises as adopted by the elderly. It also showed the active role played by nurses and families in promoting exercises to the elderly. Through exercise, the quality of elderly life is improved since exercise helps to keep them strong, active and healthy.</div> <div> <div><strong>1 INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>As it has been noted that the majority of the population is aging, there is a great need for health promotion of elderly in order to enable them to carry out day to day tasks independently. Exercise as the most common and effective way of boosting health has been advocated among elderly for years. However, elderly people who have multi-illnesses have restricted activities due to their general condition. By age 75, about one in three men and one in two women engaged in no physical activity (Harber 2007, 139).</div> <div>Older adults with higher exercise fulfillment demonstrated better mental and psychological health, regardless of their physical activity levels. Older adults with low-exercise fulfillment could potentially improve their physical abilities; however, their mental and psychological health significantly differed from that of older adults with medium or high-exercise fulfillment after exercise intervention. These findings provide preliminary evidence, which indicates that exercise can provide sufficient fulfillment and contribute to the promotion and improvement of health in older adults. Moreover, performing adequate tests on exercise fulfillment may aid in assessing the effects of intervention programs in healthcare system. (Sakurai &amp; Fujiwara &amp; Fukaya &amp; Saito &amp; Yasunaga &amp; Suzuki &amp; Nonaka &amp; Kim &amp; Kim &amp; Tanaka &amp; Nishikawa &amp; Uchida &amp; Shinkai &amp; Watanabe 2012, 743-54.)</div> <br/> <div>According to the authors of this thesis, exercise has been underestimated or even ignored in real implementation which brings about patients’ physical deterioration. The authors of this thesis have encountered various examples during previous practical experiences. In health care it has been assumed that health is basically maintained through nutrition and drugs. For example, sleeping problem is more common with the elderly and it surely affects individuals and their families. Often elderly patients use a lot of drugs for this problem including sleeping pill many of which have side effects. The results of Fábio’ s present study indicate that, elderly subjects submitted to chronic moderate training presenting improved sleep quality. (Fábio &amp; Gustavo &amp; Ronaldo &amp; Lila &amp; Damaso &amp; Nascimento &amp; Valter &amp; Boscolo &amp; Grassmann &amp; Santana &amp; Esteves &amp; Tufik &amp; Mello 2011, 113-118.)</div> <div> <div>The purpose of this research is to explore ways in which exercise functions as a boost to elderly health promotion. The increasing number of people living longer has led to international interest in the enhancement of quality of life and health-related quality of life in older age (Bowling 2005, 1).</div> <div>The aim of this research was to get an overall view of the elderly awareness and experiences about exercise in the multicultural background. The aim was also to find out the role of nurses in provision of exercise. This research was carried out to map the ways of implementing exercise for the aged population. The authors wanted to get more evidence that exercise promotes elderly health in various ways ranging from physical, psychological, cognitive, and sociological and obtain more positive influences of exercise on elderly people so that they really realize its importance as method of health promotion. It also includes the suitable ways and guidance that nurses can utilize to promote elderly health by implementing exercise in appropriate ways.</div> <div>The theoretical part of this research entails aging, types and effects of exercise to elderly, health issues of elderly and nurses’ role in promotion of exercise on elderly health. The empirical part was carried out in Finland (Purola elderly home), Kenya (Eldoret and Cherangani nursing home) and China (Ri Yuexing elderly home). This research is meant to be utilized by other researchers, student nurses, paramedics, family members of elderly and any potential readers.</div> </div> </div>\n\nEXERCISE AS A BOOST FOR THE HEALTH PROMOTION OF THE ELDERLY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EXERCISE AS A BOOST FOR THE HEALTH PROMOTION OF THE ELDERLY", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Malaria continues to be a greater cause of morbidity and mortality in Ghana.

Malaria poses a greater threat to about 40% the population of the world, particularly pregnant women and children under the age of five. In year 2010, there was an estimation of almost 220 million cases of malaria and 660,000 deaths respectively. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region mainly affected with about 85% of these cases occurring in that region (Abora, et. al. 2013.) According to WHO (2013), malaria kills 1300 children in a day and one child every minute globally. Malaria is pandemic throughout the tropical regions in the world. It is considered to be one of the killer diseases in sub-Sahara Africa. It was estimated that 300 million cases of malaria was recorded on the globe annually (Dugbartey &amp; Apedo, 1998.) The world needs 3 billion dollars to combat malaria every year (UNICEF, 2012<em>)</em>.</div> <div>The 2010 report from 106 malaria endemic countries indicates that the cost of funding for the control of this disease was 1.5 billion dollars in only 2009. This seriously threatens the 2015 global target, since the report further indicates that fund inflow remained at 1.8 billion dollars as against over 6 billion dollars required within the period mentioned (WHO, 2010). Malaria kills over a million people every year globally with 90 percent of the deaths coming from Africa. Children under five years also constitute 70 percent of this number. In sub-Saharan Africa, one in five children death is the result of malaria (Molavi, 2003.)</div> <p>In Ghana, malaria has rendered many people mentally handicap and psychiatric morbidity (Dugbartey &amp; Apedo, 1998). Malaria has caused a section of the population into poverty and this situation has reduced national output, hence slowing down national development. Despite the fact that several attempts have been made over the years to combat the disease in Ghana, statistics for 2010 indicated that an average of 8200 cases were reported daily, and a total of 3 million cases for a whole year. Out of this figure, over 3000 deaths were recorded. The most vulnerable population was children and pregnant women (Tettey, 2011).</p> <div>Malaria is the leading killer disease in Ghana. In 2008 Ministry of Health (MOH) budgeted 846,142,000 dollars for malaria. It is estimated that malaria accounts for 33% of death in children under five year old and 36% of all hospital admission sickness in the country (Ghanaweb, 2012.) Every year 3.5 million people are infected with malaria and approximately 20,000 people also die from malaria of which most of them are children under five years of age. Most of the children who are able to survive from malaria suffer from convulsion and brain disorders, which affect their growth and development. In 2008 the cost of malaria was 760 million dollars and that was 10% of the country’s gross domestic product. Upon this entire devastating situation little attention has been given to research in this area of study (Tweneboa-Kodua, Otuo &amp; Mahama 2012.)</div> <p>The incidence rate of Malaria in Dormaa Municipality of Ghana continues to increase. Available records at the Minisry of Health for Dormaa Municipality shows annual malaria incidence increasing from year 2005 to 2007. In year 2005, Out Patient Department (OPD) cases diagnosed, as malaria was 51,163. This figure rose to 66,833 and 93,216 in year 2006 and 2007 respectively. In year 2008 however, the figure dropped from 93,216 recorded the previous year to 88,381 (Majoros, 2011.) These figures show that malaria is still a major threat to the population of Dormaa and Ghana in general. The aim of the study is to find out the experiences community nurses have about the existing methods of preventing malaria.</p>\n\nPREVENTION OF MALARIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREVENTION OF MALARIA", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The purpose of this study was to review the attitude of nursing students towards people with disabilities in the western world and compare this with the pilot study from Africa for possibility of cultural differences and demographical variables.</div> <div>A systematic review of the previous studies were observed (n=6).The pilot study was conducted with 60 students in Ghana.

Of the world’s population of nearly 6.5 billion in 2004, 18.6 million (2.9%) were severely disabled and another 79.7 million (12.4%) had moderate longterm disability. Disability prevalences rise strongly with age. (WHO 2004, 33.)</div> <div>The average global prevalence of moderate and severe disability ranges from 5% in children aged 0–14 years, to 15% in adults aged 15–59 years, and 46% in adults aged 60 years and older. At all ages, both moderate and severe levels of disability are higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries; they are also higher in Africa than in other low- and middle-income countries .Older people make up a greater proportion of the population in high-income countries, but have lower levels of disability than their counterparts in low- and middle-income countries. Disability is also more common among children in the low- and middle-income countries. Moderate disability rates are similar for males and females in high-income countries, but females have somewhat higher rates of severe disability. In low- and middle income countries, male and female disability rates are similar, although females aged 15–59 years tend to have higher levels of moderate disability in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Pacific. (WHO 2004, 34-35.)</div> <br/> <div>Surveys conducted in all EU member states have shown that about 16% of the population aged 16-64 has a long standing health problem or disability and that 3.4% has severe health problem. (United States Agency for International Development 2009.) Biritwum et al., (2001) also reported that prevalence of disabilities is increasing with age in Ghana.</div> <br/> <div>As a result of this, health care professionals are greatly needed to provide services for this growing number of disabled people. A <em>Call to Action</em> was launched in US to improve the health and wellness status of men,women,and children with disabilities (Smeltzer 2007,189) .</div> <div>Many have reported negative experiences in their interactions with health care providers from all health professions. Collectively, the nursing profession has been silent in its response to this call. (Smeltzer 2007,189.)</div> <div>Mantzious et al., (2002,1) complained in Greece ,of communication problems and poor relationships with health professionals, delays in detection and treatment, insufficient information, guidance and support, inadequate specialized holistic care and lack of home care services.</div> <div>To save the situation, more knowledge is needed about the current status of attitude of future nurses and factors influencing these attitudes. It has been observed that this area is avoided by nursing professionals because of their negative attitude toward people with disabilities (Johnston &amp; Dixon 2006, 1).</div> <div>This bachelor thesis review the current behavior of the nursing students and what factors mostly influence their attitude towards disabled people. The review also involve societal attitudes’ towards individuals with disabilities, attitudes of other health professional students and health care professionals towards individuals with disabilities. However, a pilot study was conducted to test for cultural influence on the attitude with the nursing students (N=60) in Ghana.</div> <br/> <div>This study is very important in the sense that, the results will give information on the status of students’ attitude towards people with disabilities.

The study adopted a cross sectional descriptive survey design. Simple random sampling procedure was used to select two Secondary Schools out of the ten Government Senior Secondary School in Dala LGA, of Kano State. Both Schools have a combined population of 2293 students made up 1202 boys and 1096 girls. The two Schools sample were Government Secondary School Kurna Asabe for boys and Government Senior Secondary School Kuka bulukiya for girls. The instrument for Data collection was a WHO Youth Drug Survey (WHOYDSQ) adapted questionnaire. The reliability of the instrument was established using a test re-test and computed using Pearson Moment Correlation. Coefficient of 0.82 was obtained. Data generated was subjected to descriptive statistics and analysed using Chi-square. The prevalence of psychoactive substance use among Government Senior Secondary School in Dala LGA, of Kano State shows that majority (91.1%) of the respondents have been using psychoactive substances. The commonest substances used were kola nut (87.4%), tobacco (15%) and cannabis (5.5%). more than half of the users of each of the substances take it occasionally, using them on one to five days in a month except kolanut taken on twenty or more days in a month. They include male (52.9%), female (47.1%). Majority (68.1%) of the respondents were between 18-20 years. Most of the respondents who use psychoactive substances were introduced by their friends (60.6%), family (27.6%) and by nobody (5.7%). Most (27.9%) first use kolanut at the age less than 10 years, alcoholic beverages at the age of 11-12years (25.6%) while others like tobacco, cannabis at 19-and above years (38.3%). Major reasons for using psychoactive substance include to be sociable (25.4%) and for enjoyment (24.4%). There was significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) between Males and females in psychoactive substance use. The pattern of use is dependent on the type of psychoactive substances (p &lt; 0.05). Also the psychoactive substances use based on lifetime use is dependent on the age at first use (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion the prevalence of substance abuse among Senior Secondary School students is high as such Government, Parents and Teachers needs to joint hands and address the problems.</p> <p>11</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Psychoactive Substance use and dependence cause a significant burden to the individuals and societies throughout the world. The World Health Report (2010) indicated that 8.9% of the total burden of disease comes from the use of psychoactive substances. The report showed that tobacco accounted for 4.1%, alcohol 4%, and illicit drugs 0.8% of the burden of disease in 2010. Much of the burden attributable to substance use and dependence is the result of a wide variety of health and social problems. Data from the (World Health Organization, 2011) show large-scale seizures of cocaine, heroin, cannabis and amphetamine-type stimulants in different parts of the world. Availability of cocaine, heroin and cannabis depends on the level of cultivation in source countries and on the success or failure of trafficking organizations. However, even with increased levels of law enforcement activities, there always seems to be enough available to users. According to (UNODC, 2011) estimates show that about 200 million people make illicit use of one type of illicit substance or another.</p> <p>Psychoactive substance use is a social problem that has spread and increased rapidly in educational institutions especially among secondary school students (Neeraja, 2011). This social problem is considered an issue of serious concern as it adversely affects the lives and performance of students involved as well as the harmonious functioning of the entire structure of the society. Use of psychoactive drugs and other associated problems are inimical to the survival and effective functioning of human societies. A significant number of untimely deaths and accidents have been linked to the activities of persons under the influence of one psychoactive drug or the other (Shelly, 2010).</p> <p>12</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>Drug abuse is viewed by different authorities in various forms. Neeraja (2011) defined substance abuse as the dependence on a drug or other chemical substances leading to the effect that are detrimental to the individual’s physical and mental health or the welfare of others. According to Smelzer, Bare, Hinkle, and Cheever (2008) substance abuse is a maladaptive pattern of drug use that causes physical and emotional harm with the potential for disruption of daily life. From these definitions, it can be deduced that substance abuse is the misuse of one or more drugs which could be prescribed by a health practitioner with the intention to alter the way one feels, thinks or behaves and it is associated with consequences which include physical and emotional harm to the person.</p> <p>The African Symposium (2010) viewed substance abuse as the improper use or application of drugs by a person without proper knowledge of the drugs and without due prescription from a qualified medical practitioner. This definition focuses on psychoactive drugs. All drugs can be abused to an extent that it turns into addiction when the drug user is unable to stop the use of the drugs despite the harmful effects on the user’s social, personal and economic lives. The problem of substance abuse is so grave that though it was originally conceived as the problem of a ‘select few’, it has extended beyond the usual characteristics of abusers being males, adults and urban based people, to now include females, youngsters and rural dwellers (Rocha, 2009). These abusers erroneously believe that drugs enhance their performance, put them in good mood etc. The accompanying problems of this act constitute a major threat to the well-being of the society (Ajala, 2009).</p> <p>The youths in Nigeria like many countries of the world are increasingly developing addiction to psychoactive substances. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA, 2011) collected drugs use and abuse data from schools, records of patients admitted at mental health institutions for drug problems and interview of persons arrested for drug offences. The result</p> <p>13</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>showed that youths constitute the high risk group for drug trafficking and abuse. Friends and school mates account for about 90% of the source of influence of the use and abuse of various psychoactive substances. In Nigeria, alcohol and cigarette are legal substances but, the two have been discovered to cause physical damage to human bodies. It has been reported that smoking tobacco causes 90.0% of lung cancer, 30.0% of all cancers, and 80.0% of other chronic lung diseases (Sale 2008). Apart from these health implications, according to Stephen (2010), alcohol and cigarette are said to be “gatew ay drugs” to other more potent psychoactive drugs like marijuana, heroin and cocaine.</p> <p>The future of any community, society, state or nation is tied to the character of the adolescent in that particular place, area or locality. It is also said that “The youth are the leaders of tomorrow”. Therefore responsible youth in the socie ty indicates responsible and brighter future of that society and also the reverse is the case.</p> <p>In our society people are known to have had problems that had made them to adopt various measures to cope with such problems and live successfully within the confines of societal normative values. While some people take solace in lawful ways others resort to unlawful and unhealthy measures such as the use of drugs or psychoactive substances to the extent of abusing them, hence resulting in addiction. According to Edum (2006) the adolescent in our society are not left out in this, as they are either influenced by peer group while others do so because of the easy availability of the abused substances, others also watch on television and films and some read in books and so try to experiment to experience the effects. The effects of specific psychoactive substance vary depending on their mechanism of action, the amount consumed and the history of the user among other factors.</p> <p>14</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>An ugly fact that is with us in the recent time is road traffic accident related to psychoactive substance use as well as increased crime rate in Nigeria, though a number of measures are put in place to check this menace. This includes the establishment of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) through Degree 48 of 1989 and 33 of 1990. However, in spite of these measures people especially the adolescents continue to use psychoactive drugs illicitly with its attendant problems.</p> <p>Kano state is the most populated state in Northern Nigeria (NPC, 2006). The use of psychoactive Substance in this state is the order of the day, evidence by increase in crimes of different nature, failure at examination, abandoning school and poor performance in all aspects of life etc.</p> <p>Dala local government is the largest, most populated local government Area of Kano State. One myth about the youth and adolescents in Dala local government is drug and substance use evidently shown by increase in crime, abandoning and inconsistencies in school, as well as failure in examination. These reasons encouraged and motivated the desire to investigate the prevalence and pattern of psychoactive substance use among the senior government secondary school students of the largest local government area in the middle of Kano City, Dala Local Government Area of Kano State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Substance use is not a strange phenomenon; the global, regional and national dimension of it are documented. It is in recognition of the complexity of the problem that 26th June of every year has been declared as the International Day Against Abuse and illicit trafficking by United Nations. In its June, 2003 report, the United Nations Children and Education Fund</p> <p>15</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>(UNICEF) stated that the problem of HIV/AIDS is inextricably connected to a range of problems, among which is drug abuse among children and young people. Similarly, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) pointed out that drug abuse among “area boys” in Nigeria has been reported as the cau se of delinquent behaviours and crime.</p> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO, 2010) believes that young people are more vulnerable to suffering physical, emotional and social harm from their own or other people’s drug use. It also identifies strong links between the high rate of drinking, violent sexual behaviour, traffic and other accidents and drug use. In relation to tobacco, World Health Organization also estimates that about 250 million children and adolescents who live in developing countries like Nigeria are likely to be killed by tobacco (Stephen, 2010).</p> <p>The United Nations office on Drug and Crime (UNODC) partly attributes the prevalence of drug use in Nigeria to street hawking of drugs and pharmaceutical preparation. The prevalence rate of adolescent’s substance and drug abuse in our society poses a great concern to health care providers as some end up as addicts. This is quite substantial in Kano state. According to NDLEA (2010) reports, Kano State is the highest in terms of people arrested with the case of drug trafficking’ and suspected drug addicts (638 arrested suspects) followed by Katsina (411) and Rivers (347) etc.</p> <p>According to NDLEA (2010) most of the people arrested in Kano state for drug addicts and trafficking are from Dala local government and neighboring communities and majority constitutes secondary school drop outs.

The objectives of the study were to determine the influence of family structure, socio-economic status of the family, maternal education on the nutritional status of children and to identify the religious and cultural practices that influence the nutritional status of children. A cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used for the study in Enugu East L.G.A., Enugu State. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 5 communities from the L.G.A. for the study and snow-ball non-probability sampling techniques was used to select the subjects for the study. The target population was unknown; a sample size of 384 was determined using Golden formula for infinite population. Self developed questionnaire with 4 point modified Likert scale was used. Anthropometric measurements of the children under 5 were measured using weighing scale and height measurement. Cronbatch alpha statistic was used to establish the internal consistency which gave a reliability coefficient of 0.80. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze data. Results were presented in tables as percentages, means and standard deviations. One sample t-test was used to test hypotheses at P &lt; 0.05 level of significance. Findings revealed that family structure with a grand mean score of 3.29, socio-economic status of the family with a grand mean score of 2.91 and some religious and cultural practices with a grand mean score of 2.77 which was above the criterion mean of 2.5 all had a negative influence on the nutritional status of children. Maternal education was revealed to influence the nutritional status as 33.3% of children malnourished were from mothers with no formal education, 48.7 from mothers with primary education, 15.9% had secondary and tertiary education, respectively. There were significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) in relationship between family structure influence, socio-economic status influence, religious and cultural practice influence, maternal education influence and the nutritional status of children. In conclusion, all the variables, family structure, socio-economic status, certain religious and cultural practices were all perceived to have a negative influence on the nutritional status of children. Maternal education also has a strong influence on the nutritional status of children as educated mothers had less number of children malnourished. Recommendation is that health care personnel should educate mothers on factors that lead to poor nutritional status, women empowerment through education should be encouraged as it promises improved family finances, better food security and better childhood nutrition.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>Background to the study</strong></div> <div>Child nutrition plays a key role in infant and child health or death. Young children, pregnant women and lactating mothers are nutritionally the most vulnerable group, especially in the developing countries of the world, and yet relatively little is done to achieve their special nutritional needs. (Oyira, Abua, Mgbekem&amp;Okon, 2010).</div> <div>The importance of nutrition in childhood for both immediate health and health in later life is a topic that has aroused a considerable interest and argument over the past 15 – 20 years. The depth of interest and the data t hat arouse the interest are new but the concept that the way a child is fed has a long-term effect or consequences are not new. In developed countries and many traditional societies today, early feeding has been considered a determinant of later character as much as later growth and health. Correct nutrition ensures healthier children, who grow into more productive adults while Poor nutrition on the other hand leads to malnutrition.</div> <div>Malnutrition continues to be a significant public health and development concern around the world with about one-third of the world’s children malnourished and an estimated 150 to 200 million pre-school children (&lt; 5-years) in developing countries being underweight and stunted, respectively (WHO, 2006).</div> <div>Malnutrition is the condition that results from taking inadequate diet in which certain nutrients are lacking, in excess, or in the wrong proportions (Sullivan &amp; Sheffrin, 2010)...</div>\n\nPERCEIVED SOCIO-CULTURAL FACTORS INFLUENCING NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF CHILDREN BELOW 5 YEARS IN SELECTED RURAL COMMUNITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PERCEIVED SOCIO-CULTURAL FACTORS INFLUENCING NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF CHILDREN BELOW 5 YEARS IN SELECTED RURAL COMMUNITIES", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This study is aimed at assessing the nursing students’ perceptions of clinical nursing training in selected nursing programmes in Enugu State. Five specific objectives and two null hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. Descriptive cross-section design was adopted. Purposive sampling technique was used to select the nursing programmes and the class level of the students. A total population of 442 nursing students was used for the study. A self-developed questionnaire in 4 point modified Likert type scale with reliability of 0.970 was used for data collection. The questionnaire was distributed to the students in the classroom setting with 99.77% return rate. Information derived from the questionnaire were subjected to descriptive and t-test statistics testing at 0.05 level of significance. Results were presented in Table as frequencies, percentages, means and standard deviations. Findings revealed that nursing students had positive perceptions in clinical placement, clinical teaching and clinical evaluation but revealed that the students showed negative perception in clinical supervision. There were significant differences in perception of clinical training between the university-based and hospital-based nursing students (P-value &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the perceptions of clinical training between the male and female nursing students (P-value &gt; 0.05), but female nursing students showed negative perception in clinical supervision. It is therefore recommended that; enough clinical supervisors should be employed and equal attention should be given to both male and female students, the university-based and hospital-based nursing students during clinical training etc. Suggestions for further studies were also made.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>Background to the study</strong></div> <div>Nursing education consists of acquisition of a body of knowledge that is partly delivered in a classroom setting which forms the theoretical basis of nursing knowledge, and an organized and supervised clinical training experience that takes place in the clinical setting where the nurse-patient relationship is experienced directly or indirectly (Sheriff &amp; Masoumi, 2005). Clinical nursing training is the most critical step in transforming nursing education, because that is really at the heart of getting the nurse ready for clinical setting; and for providing safe and excellent patients care. Students must be offered clinical experiences that are of highest quality and of interest.</div> <p>Clinical nursing training provides a practical approach for training prospective nursing students to acquire practical skills for practice as nurses (Emerson, 2002). The heart and soul of nursing education is the clinical practicum where nursing knowledge is shaped into professional practice (Diekelmann, 2004). Thus, basic knowledge and skills; and the ability to apply knowledge into the actual practice of nursing is developed and inculcated into the student nurses during clinical training. Barnes, Sutphen, Leonard and Day (2009) also stated that clinical nursing education is a fundamental part of nursing education and forms more than half part of nursing curriculum.</p>\n\nNURSING STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CLINICAL NURSING TRAINING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NURSING STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CLINICAL NURSING TRAINING", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The purpose of this study was to examine the maternal health care seeking behaviour and pregnancy outcome of pregnant women in two rural communities in Enugu State. The objectives of study were to: (i) determine the gestational age at which pregnant women book for Antenatal Care(ANC) in Udi and Abiacommunities, (ii)determine how often pregnant women attend Antenatal Care(ANC)during the third trimester, (iii) ascertain the facilities utilized by pregnant women with complications for care and (iv) ascertain their pregnancy outcome. Cross-sectional survey design was adopted for the study. A sample size of 207 respondents was drawn from a population of 586 pregnant women. The instrument for data collection was the researcher-developed questionnaire that was used as an interview guide. Observation guide was also used to corroborate the findings of the questionnaire. The design of the study was descriptive cross-sectional survey. Convenience sampling was used to select a sample size of 207 respondents from a population of 586 pregnant women. Collected data wereanalysed using descriptive statistics of frequencies and percentages. Chi-square was used to test for significant association atsignificancelevel of 0.05.</div> <div>Major findings show that most of the respondents (79.7%) booked for ANC during the first trimester. On frequency of ANC during the third trimester, 81.1% maintained weekly attendance while 100% of the respondents with complications accessed care from health facilities especially the general hospital under skilled healthcare providers. On pregnancy outcome, 84.5% of the babies cried vigorously at birth and 0.5% did not cry at all. On maternal delivery outcome, 83.1% were strong to take care of self and baby after delivery. There was no significant association (p &gt; 0.05) between the respondents’ demographic variables (age and educational status) and their healthcare seeking behaviour. There was no significant association (p &gt; 0.05) between maternal healthcare seeking behaviour and mothers’ delivery outcome (women that were strong to take care of self and baby and those that were weak to take care of self and baby after delivery). There was significant association (p &lt; 0.05) between maternal healthcare seeking behaviour and babies’ birth outcome (number of babies that cried vigorously at birth and those that did not cry at all).</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>A woman’s health care seeking behaviour during pregnancy depends a great deal on her beliefs, culture, experience, educational level, financial status, attitude towards pregnancy, as well as herautonomy and decision making power. Adele (2010)suggests issues of importance to include information about pregnancy the woman’s family communicated to her as a child and whether the pregnancy was planned or unplanned. Garba, Hellandendu, andAjayi (2011) further explained that long before the advent of modern scientific medicine, most cultures have among their patterns of life, a body of beliefs and practices that centre on the recognition and treatment of complications of pregnancy and conduct of deliveries. Thus, an understanding of appropriate health care seeking behaviour is very important in achieving the desired pregnancy outcome. Negativebehaviour is highly implicated in increased morbidity and mortality of mother and baby.</div> <div>Osubor, Fatusi, and Chiwuzie(2006),suggests Maternal Health Care Seeking Behaviour (MHCSB) to include the number of visits made to antenatal clinic (ANC) by pregnant women and their preference for place of delivery.Jain, Nandan and Misra (2006) defined health seeking behaviour as “a complex outcome of m any factors operating at individual, family and community levels including their biosocial profile, past experiences with health services, availability of alternative health care providers, and the people’s perception regarding the efficacy and quality of the services” .</div> <p>Adele (2010) explains health seeking behaviour to be those activities undertaken by individuals in response to any discomfort felt. He further stated that in the developed countries like United States of America (USA), most women visit ANC early in pregnancy, comply with prenatal directives and are attended to by skilled health care providers when in labour. He also suggests that in the developing countries, especially in the rural sub-Saharan Africa, most women consider pregnancy a natural process and the services of skilled health care providers deemed not necessary. Rastogi (2012) observed low utilization of ANC among rural women in India due to lack of means of transportation, also because the women were often shy when discussing their health problems before a male professional. Rastogi suggests that women who had formal education up to secondary school level sought health care from skilled providers.</p>\n\nMATERNAL HEALTH CARE SEEKING BEHAVIOUR AND PREGNANCY OUTCOME<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MATERNAL HEALTH CARE SEEKING BEHAVIOUR AND PREGNANCY OUTCOME", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>With the global trend towards an increasing aging population, there is a corresponding increase in the health problems associated with elderly population especially in developing Countries including Nigeria. With this increase in the growth of the aging population, the number of people that will need health care will undoubtedly increase, which motivated this study. The study was aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude and practice of care of the elderly patients among health workers in University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar, Cross River State. The specific objective were to (i) determine the level of knowledge of the physical, emotional and social care of the elderly in the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar (ii) determine the attitude of health workers in the care of the elderly, (iii) determine the health workers practices in the provision of care of the elderly, (iv) identify factors that influence the health workers attitude towards the elderly in University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar. The hypothesis for the study tested the association between years of experience of health workers and their attitude towards care of the elderly in UCTH. Calabar. The study adopted a cross sectional descriptive design. The population of the study was 1023 health workers, which was made up of 402 Doctors, 600 Nurses, 10 Dentists and 11 Physiotherapists that provided direct clinical care of elderly patients. The sample was calculated using Taro-Yamane (1967) simplified formula for finite population giving a sample of 461 health workers. The instrument for data collection was questionnaires, the reliability of the instrument was done using test retest method and a reliability co-efficient of 0.91 was obtained. The questionnaires had five sections, section A covered socio demographic data, section B, C, D consisted of items which explored level of knowledge. Attitude, practice and section E elicited information on factors influencing the care of the elderly. The completed questionnaire was coded and analyzed using E.P.I info-7. Descriptive statistics of percentage, mean, standard deviation were used for data analysis. The criterion mean of 2.5 was also used and results of the study revealed that 95% of the health workers had good knowledge of care of the elderly. Majority of the health workers had positive attitude above rating scale of 2.5. The health workers moderately practiced care of the elderly. The factors that positively influenced health workers attitude to the care of the elderly were years of experience, age and mental state of the elderly.

It involves a multidimensional process of physical, psychological and social change. Some dimensions of aging grow and expand over time, while others decline. Research shows that even in late life, potentials exist for physical, mental and social growth and development (Papalia, Sterns, Feldman, and Camp, 2002). It is not a disease; but phase of life where there is retrograde biological process in growth and development which leads to decreased powers for survival and adjustment. Aging is an important part of all human societies reflecting the biological changes that occur and also reflecting cultural and societal convention.</div> <div>An estimated 100,000 people worldwide die each day of age related causes (Aubrey de Grey, 2007). According to National Population Commission (NPC, 2006), persons who are old enough to receive pension who are between ages of 60-65 years are regarded as the elderly. The elderly are classified by age into young old for those aged 60-74years, middle old for those aged 75-84years, old for those aged 85-94 years and oldest old for those 95years and above. (Barman, Snyder, Kozier &amp; Erb , 2008).</div> <p>Care of the elderly is the fulfillment of the special needs and requirements that are unique to senior citizens. It covers such services as assisted living, adult day care, long term care, nursing homes, hospice care and home care. Elderly care emphasizes the social and personal requirements of senior citizens who need some assistance with daily activities and health care, but who desire to age with dignity. The care of the elderly is multidimensional and these include physical, emotional, spiritual and social care (Ayres, 2008).</p>\n\nKNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE OF CARE OF THE ELDERLY PATIENTS AMONG HEALTH WORKERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE OF CARE OF THE ELDERLY PATIENTS AMONG HEALTH WORKERS", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>KNOWLEDGE ACCESSIBILITY AND USE OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) AMONG STUDENTS AND TEACHERS</strong></div><div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>People over time, have devised various techniques for communicating their thoughts, needs and desires to others in every aspect of life. The emergence of ICT has affected all aspects of human life, including education at all levels. ICT knowledge, accessibility and use are linked with higher efficiency and higher productivity. Undergraduate nursing students and their teachers occupy a central position in both educational and health care systems of any country. This study was carried out to investigate the knowledge, accessibility and use of ICT among students and teachers in the Department of Nursing Sciences, University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus. A descriptive cross sectional survey design was used. All the 454 undergraduate students in the Department of Nursing and 23 teachers comprised the subjects for the study. A researcher-developed questionnaire was the instrument for data collection. Data were subjected to descriptive statistics and anayzed using student’s t-test and Chi square. Probability value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Majority of the students 346 (80.5%) and majority of the teachers 20(90.9%) had knowledge of ICT. Respondents had access to the following ICT: computer; students 314(73.0%), teachers 20 (90.9%), Internet; students 343(79.8%), teachers 22(100%) and e-mail; students 248(57.7%) and teachers 17(77.3%). The Internet activities mostly performed by the students were: browsing 386(89.8%), chatting with friends 274(63.7%) and e-mailing 262(60.9%). The Internet activities mostly performed by teachers were: browsing 22(100%), e-mailing 20(90.9%) and downloading articles 18(81.8%). Google is the most common search engine used by students 393(91.4%) and teachers 20(90.9%). High cost of ICT 281(62.2%) and irregular power supply 258(57.1%) were major factors that affect accessibility to and use of ICT negatively. There was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in the access to ICT types among teachers and students. There was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in the constraints associated with ICT use among students and teachers. There was significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in the use of ICT between students and teachers. Findings of this study revealed that there is still need to provide ICT materials and training at subsidized rate in order to encourage use in university education.</div> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPETR ONE<br/>1.0   INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1        Background of the study<br/>1.2        Statement of problem<br/>1.3        Objective of the study<br/>1.4        Research Hypotheses<br/>1.5        Significance of the study<br/>1.6        Scope and limitation of the study<br/>1.7       Definition of terms<br/>1.8       Organization of the study<br/>CHAPETR TWO<br/>2.0   LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>CHAPETR THREE<br/>3.0        Research methodology<br/>3.1    sources of data collection<br/>3.3        Population of the study<br/>3.4        Sampling and sampling distribution<br/>3.5        Validation of research instrument<br/>3.6        Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION<br/>4.1 Introductions<br/>4.2 Data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.1 Introduction<br/>5.2 Summary<br/>5.3 Conclusion<br/>5.4 Recommendation<br/>Appendix</p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of the study<br/>People over time have devised various techniques for communicating their thoughts, needs and desires to others. In early civilized times, people achieved adequate communication through speech and written messages. Communication in teaching and learning situation were mainly done using a teacher-centered education system in the past few years (Adeyinka, Adedeji, Majekodunmi, Adika &amp; Adeyinka, 2011) when the conventional way of teaching was the order of the day. The teacher was seen as the sole source of knowledge and the students were “mere receipients” of his/her information. Chalk and talk methods were used in delivering lectures to students and pupils in schools. The emergence of information communication technology (ICT) has affected all aspects of life (Nadira, Kamal &amp; Banu, 2010). ICT has become an indispensable part of our contemporary world. No wonder the use of such terms as e-nursing, e-commerce, ebanking, e-medicine, e-government, e-learning and e-education just to mention but a few, to show how such aspects of life revolve round technology. ICT materials are adapted to carry out some routine activities in almost every aspect of life. ICT includes any equipment or interconnect system of equipment that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission or reception of data or information resources (National Information Technology Policy, 2010). This policy equally sees ICT as computers, ancillary equipment, software and firmware (Hardware) and similar procedures, services (including support services) and related resources. To the Federal Ministry of Education (2010) ICT means all equipment, tools (inclusive of traditional technologies of radio, video and television to the newer technologies of computers, hardware, firmware, etc) as well as the methods, practices, processes, procedures, concepts and principles that come into play in the conduct of the information communication activities. Globally, the emergence of ICT has stimulated rapid development in all sectors of the economy, especially in the socio-cultural and political spheres of life (Akanbi, 2005, in Olatokun, 2009). Ajayi (2003) noted that ICT is redefining the way almost everything is done and is a ready tool for all strata of the society. Danner (2013) stated that ICT has transformed the world into a large global connected community and play an increasingly important role in people’s lives. Previous studies like those of (Idowu, Cornford &amp; Bastin, 2008) and (kambi, 2005) have highlighted advantages and disadvantages that nations, institutions and industrial sectors would face if they did not position themselves to harness and implement ICTs as tools for leveraging their activities in the emerging global economy. In educational sector, ICT has been continuously linked to higher efficiency, higher productivity, and higher educational outcomes, including quality of cognitive, creative and innovative outcomes (Adeosun, 2010). ICT is often perceived as a catalyst for change, change in learning approaches and in access to information (Watson, 2005) and can help by providing alternative possibilities for education (Casal, 2007, in Danner 2013). For both social and economic reasons students will need computer and communication technology skills to live successfully in a knowledge-based society (Danner, 2013). The knowledge, access and use of ICT are becoming integral part of education in many parts of the globe (Ololube, 2006). To Danner (2013) education is the first and best key area for ICT application. Use of different ICT has become inevitable for students in learning. By using modern ICT, students and teachers can retrieve required information within a short time. Use of ICT has the potential to become cost-effective as it offers greater flexibility regarding time and location of teaching and learning, (UNESCO 2003). ICT also provides greater flexibility to adapt teaching and learning to meet the learners’ cognitive and learning styles. ICT offers the learners the opportunity to work at their own pace. Betts (2011) affirmed that ICT can enhance the quality of learning where its use is tailored to lesson objectives and the needs of the learners. The use of ICT in teaching is a relevant and functional way of providing education to learners that will assist in imbibing in them the required capacity for the world of work. Very few jobs today do not require the use of skills in technology, collaboration, teamwork and information, all these can be acquired through teaching and learning with technology. ICT fundamentally changes the way we live, learn and work. On the other hand, there are documented hindrances to using ICT in spite of its numerous benefits to both teachers and students. The factors hindering both teachers’ and students’ readiness and confidence in using ICT include teacher’s lack of expertise with ICT, lack of confidence in using ICT by both teachers and students. Other factors include; insufficient knowledge of appropriate software and insufficient knowledge and skills on how to use ICT equipment, lack of knowledge of how to evaluate the use and the role played by ICT in teaching and learning is also another factor hindering use of ICT by both teachers and students (UNESCO, 2012). Ofodu, 2007 in (Ajayi, Ekundayo &amp; Haastrup, 2009) enumerated ICT tools used by both teachers and students to include; computers specifically; internet, telephone, digital camera, and overhead projector. Other ICT materials include; compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM), teleconferencing, audio-cassette tapes and video tapes, interactive television, electronic board, optical fibres, electronic notice board, slides, radio among others.. Teachers and students turn to ICT for various reasons such as removing distance from education and making knowledge more accessible to all. Development of a lifelong learning culture and the capacity to empower learners by providing them with multiple pathways that offer choices and channels to meet their education and training needs (UNESCO, 2003) is another reason why people use ICT. ICT is cost-effective as it offers greater flexibility regarding time and location of training delivery. ICT also provides greater flexibility to adapt teaching and learning to meet learners’ cognitive and learning styles. Teachers and nursing students have the obligation to know, access and use various instructional aids including modern ICT tools during their course of teaching and learning. This is because ICT is redefining the way almost everything is done and is a ready tool for all strata of society including education. ICT is changing the way people teach and learn, thereby offering new alternatives to the traditional classroom methods of teaching and learning. Teachers and students who are unaware of existing ICT may lose an important opportunity to make use of the positive features (cheap, safe, effective and accessible) of ICT as well as teach and learn accordingly. Teachers and students may not be able to harness all the benefits of ICT in Nigeria. Ofodu (2007) noted that Nigeria is a nation with constant power outage and poor infrastructural material supply in every stratum; her institutions of learning are not exempted as well. There may be lack of general information, access or misinformation about ICT used by both teachers and students during teaching and learning. The knowledge, access and use of ICT during teaching and learning of nursing sciences are unknown. Studies carried out in Nigeria on ICT use were among the Reproductive Health Workers (Wole &amp;Olufunke, 2009), ICT use in Nigerian Secondary Schools (Ajayi, Ekundayo &amp; Haastrup, 2009). Adetimirin (2012), ICT literacy among undergraduates in Nigerian universities and Wole &amp; Olufunke, (2009), provided information on Information on ICT use among Reproductive Health Care Workers (RHWs). The present study was conceived based on the fact that to the researcher’s best knowledge there has not been any study done on ICT knowledge, access and use among teachers and students in the Department of Nursing Sciences, University of Nigeria Enugu Campus (UNEC).<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/> The National Policy on ICT in Education and Framework launched in 2010 presents a holistic and broad vision for ICT integration in the education sector in Nigeria. This policy moves beyond a basic technology literacy approach. Rather, the policy focuses on leveraging technology to transform the roles of the teacher and the learner in the classroom. In developed countries, the use of ICT by teachers and students in education has been widely studied and documented especially the positive influence of ICT in education (Kay, 2006; Mur-ray, Nuttall &amp; Mitchell, 2008). Studies have also been conducted on the use of ICT by teachers and students in teaching and learning in developed countries where the use of ICT has advanced, and where there are resources and materials to maintain them (Adeyinka, Adedeji, Majekodunmi, Adika &amp; Adeyinka,2011). Very few studies have been carried out in Nigeria on the use of ICT in education (Ololube, 2006). These studies were limited to attitude and competence in the use of computers by academic and non-academic staff in Nigerian higher institutions. Unfortunately there were limited documented studies on knowledge, accessibility and use of ICT in education generally in Nigeria, and none was found in relation to nurse educators’ and student nurses’ knowledge, accessibility and use of ICT in Nursing Education. <br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The specific objectives of this study were to:<br/> 1. Ascertain students’ and teachers’ knowledge of ICT in Department of Nursing UNEC. <br/>2. Determine accessibility to ICT among nursing students and teachers of Department of Nursing UNEC.<br/> 3. Investigate students’ and teachers’ use of ICT Department of Nursing UNEC. <br/>4, To determine the constraining factors to use of ICT as perceived by students and teachers.<br/><br/>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES<br/>Hypothesis One<br/>HO: There is no significant difference in the knowledge of ICT between students and teachers <br/>HI:   There is significant difference in the knowledge of ICT between students and teachers<br/>Hypothesis Two<br/>HO:  There is no significant difference in the use of different ICT types among students at different level of study<br/>HI:  There is significant difference in the use of different ICT types among students at different level of study <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The findings will reveal whether both teachers and students actually understand what ICT means, whether they have access to ICT and also to what use they put ICT tools. This will help in academic decisions and review of teaching and learning process where necessary. Teachers will utilize the information from the study to plan teaching-learning activities to include softwares, hardwares and programmes to make teaching and learning easier, faster and learner centered. The findings will as well provide data for student’s and teacher’s individual decision making. To the authorities; especially Departmental and the University administrators, the findings will serve as a guide to design appropriate in-service training programmes to update teacher’s skills in ICT as well as integrating ICT into curriculum for students; to enhance their knowledge and use of ICT in relation to teaching and learning. To the stakeholders, it will give them insight on the activities of the Department in terms of ICT in the Department and plan programmes according to determined needs.<br/>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is delimited to determining the knowledge, access and use of ICT. It is also delimited to undergraduate students and teaching staff of the Department of Nursing Sciences, University Nigeria Enugu Campus. The researcher encounters some constrain which limited the scope of the study;<br/> a) AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL: The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study    <br/>b) TIME: The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.<br/>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/> 1. Information Communication Technology (ICT): Refers to hardwares, softwares and programmes that affect academic and non-academic activities of both students and teachers.<br/> 2. ICT knowledge: This refers to the undergraduate students and teachers ability to identify correctly the types and benefits of ICT. ICT knowledge also means ability to possess formal information about ICT. <br/>3. ICT Accessibility: Accessibility to ICT in this study refers to students’ and teachers’ ability to possess or hire ICT materials and willingness and capacity to take advantage of the available ICT services. ICT accessibility is measured by items 14 -21 in the accessibility subscale of Information Communication Technology questionnaire (AICTQ). <br/>4. ICT use: Refers to performing academic and non-academic activities using ICT. ICT use is measured by items 22 – 32 in the use subscale of Information Communication Technology questionnaire (UICTQ). <br/><br/>\n\nKNOWLEDGE, ACCESSIBILITY AND USE OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) AMONG STUDENTS AND TEACHERS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete </button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE, ACCESSIBILITY AND USE OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) AMONG STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><strong>Nigeria has the highest number of diabetics in Sub-Saharan Africa. As a chronic illness, diabetes mellitus (DM) places serious constraints on the people living with diabetes mellitus.

This study assessed and compared the HRQOL of diabetic patients and non-diabetics in Port</strong></p> <p>11</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. Four objectives and two null hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. The study adopted a descriptive cross sectional survey design. It was conducted at the diabetic out- patient clinic of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Port Harcourt. Power analysis was used to determine the minimum sample size of 200 each for the diabetic and the non-diabetic comparison group. The diabetics who met the inclusion criteria were purposively recruited, while the age and sex matched non-diabetics were recruited from Catholic Community of Mater Misericordiae Catholic Church, Rumumasi and Anglican Community of Anglican Church of Messiah, Elekahia Housing Estate, all in Port Harcourt. The World Health Quality of Life-Bref, (WHOQOL-BREF) a 26 item standardized questionnaire with 12 additional questions soliciting demographic and clinical data was used for data collection. The reliability of the instrument was carried out using split-half method.The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of reliability was 0.70 for physical domain, 0.76 for psychological domain, 0.78 for social domain and 0.70 for environmental domain.. Instrument was interviewer administered and data collected were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics using Chi-square, student t-test and analysis of variance at alpha significant level of P&lt;0.05. There were no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) between the diabetics and the non-diabetics in their demographic variables. The mean scores for diabetics in the four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF were: physical 23.17 </strong>±<strong> 3.39, Psychological 20.06 </strong>±<strong> 3.32, social 10.20 </strong>±<strong> 2.47 and environmental 28.00 </strong>±<strong> 5.15. The mean scores for non-diabetics in the four domains were: physical 24.17 </strong>±<strong> 2.42, psychological 21.53</strong></p> <p>±  <strong>2.51, social 11.43 </strong>±<strong> 1.87 and environmental 28.68 </strong>±<strong> 5.044. The diabetic group had less</strong></p> <p><strong>HRQOL (p &lt; 0.05) than the non- diabetic group in the physical, psychological and social domains. Out of the 200 diabetics, 92 reported co-morbidities. The mean scores of diabetics with co-morbidities in the four domains were: physical 22.73 </strong>±<strong> 3.30, psychological 19.63 </strong>±<strong> 3.08, social 9.96 and environmental 27.41 </strong>±<strong> 4.98. The mean scores of diabetics without co-morbidities in the four domains were: physical 23.55 </strong>±<strong> 3.43, psychological 20.39 </strong>±<strong> 3.48, social 10.40 </strong>±<strong> 2.62 and environmental 28.50 </strong>±<strong> 5.25. There was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) between the diabetic patients with co-morbidities and the diabetics without co-morbidities in all the four domains. The diabetics with post-secondary education had a significant higher mean score (3.93 </strong>±<strong> 0.81) than those with secondary and primary education (3.75 </strong>±<strong> 1.12 and 3.37 </strong>±<strong> 1.06 respectively). In conclusion, DM impacts negatively on the</strong></p> <p><strong>HRQOL of the patients. Efforts to enhance diabetic HRQOL should be promoted</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p><strong>Diabetes mellitus is defined as a group of metabolic diseases characterized by increased level</strong></p> <p><strong>of glucose in the blood resulting from defects in insulin secretion or insulin action or both</strong></p> <p>12</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>[American Diabetic Association (ADA), (2004); Huang, Hwang, Wu, Lin, Leite &amp; Wu, (2008)]. It is a devastating illness that has physical, social, emotional and economic implications. It impinges on the quality of life and overall health status of the individuals, as well as direct health care cost and indirect costs to the society when related to lost productivity. It is a chronic and distressing illness that makes demands on the individual by causing a lot of short-term and long-term complications that is life threatening. Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of non-traumatic amputation and blindness in working age adults and the third leading cause of death from diseases primarily, because of the high rate of cardiovascular complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease) among people with diabetes (Smeltzer, Bare, Hinkle &amp; Cheever, 2010).</strong></p> <p><strong>Studies have shown that the incidence of diabetes is on the increase. The centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2011), stated that in 2010, an estimated 79 million American adults aged 20years or older with pre-diabetes. In 2000, the world-wide estimate of the prevalence of diabetes was 171 million people, and by 2030, this is expected to increase to 366 million (Wild, Roglic, Green et al, 2004). The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that 194 million people had diabetes in the year 2003, and about two thirds of these people lived in developing countries of which Nigeria is one. The President of IDF (2006-2009), warned that if left unchecked, the number of people with diabetes will reach 380million in less than 20years. This will mean 1 out of 14 adults worldwide will have diabetes in the years 2025. The loss of earnings and life will be hard to bear.</strong></p> <p><strong>Diabetes mellitus was once regarded as a disease of the affluent but is now vastly visible as a growing health problem in developing economies as almost 80% of diabetes deaths occur in low and middle income countries, of which Nigeria is one (Diabetes Atlas, 2006). Available data suggests that it is emerging as a major health problem in Africa, including Nigeria. In the</strong></p> <p>13</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>African sub-region, diabetes is frequently undiagnosed. In most cases, it is diagnosed incidentally during routine check-up or when the patient presents with the complications (International Diabetes Federation, African Region, 2006). The World Health Organization (WHO) statistics indicates that Nigeria has the highest number of diabetics in Sub-Saharan Africa (Chinenye &amp; Ogbera, 2013). The incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Nigeria continues to increase despite great deal of research and resources. With current trend of transition from communicable to non-communicable disease, it is projected that non-communicable diseases will equal or even exceed communicable diseases in developing nations, including Nigeria thus culminating in double burden of disease(Chinenye &amp; Ogbera, 2013).The crude prevalence rate of diabetes mellitus in Port Harcourt, Nigeria is 6.8% ( Nyenwe, Odia, Ihekwaba, Ojule &amp; Babatunde, 2003).With the alarming growth in the number of people suffering from diabetes, efficient and quality care become imperative. The numerous complications of the disease and its management poses challenges on the quality of life of the individuals suffering from the disease, therefore the need to assess the quality of life (QOL) of these individuals becomes necessary.</strong></p> <p><strong>Quality of life (Q0L) is a descriptive term that refers to people’s emotional, social and physical well-being and their ability to function in the ordinary task of living (Donald, 2010). Health related quality of life (HRQ0L) is preferred by health researchers because it is used to narrow the scope to aspects of functioning directly related to diseases and or medical treatment (Odili, Ugboka &amp; Oparah, 2010).</strong></p> <p><strong>Studies of quality of life are performed for two reasons. First, they are conducted to evaluate the psychosocial functioning of patient group and to identify specific problems and needs of patients at different stages of the disease process. Secondly, and most often, HRQOL studies</strong></p> <p>14</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>are conducted to compare the impact of different regimens on the patient’s well-being and the treatment satisfaction (Snoek, 2000).</strong></p> <p><strong>Researchers report lower HRQOL in people diagnosed with diabetes than for non-diabetic (Andayani, Ibrahim &amp; Aside, 2010; Odili et al, 2010). In Nigeria, studies of HRQOL with diabetics have been carried out at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) (Odili et al., 2010) and University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) (Issa &amp; Baiyewu, 2006). UBTH study concluded that diabetes impacts on the lives of diabetic patients while UITH study concluded that lower income, lower education, low rated employment and physical complications adversely affect the HRQOL of patients with diabetes mellitus. Both studies dwelt on the psychosocial aspects of the diabetics. This study therefore assessed the HRQOL of patients with diabetes mellitus in Port Harcourt.</strong></p> <p><strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p><strong>Diabetes mellitus is a chronically distressful illness with which to live. Polonsky, (2000) stated that for many patients the demand of self-care can be burdensome, frustrating and overwhelming. According to Kubler Ross, (1969), in Berman, Synder, Kozier &amp; Erb, (2008), the individual has to pass through the stages of grief which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance on diagnosis.</strong></p> <p><strong>People living with diabetes mellitus pass through a lot of stress in order to live. The disease, as a chronic illness, places serious constraints on the peoples’ activities due to its manifold demands. Individuals with diabetes have to think of what to eat and when to eat, exercise, decide whether to test plasma glucose and depending on the result, plan when to eat or take their drugs (insulin or tablets). They also carry along with them glucose drinks for fear of hypoglycaemia and usually stop to check the symptoms of hypo or hyperglycaemia. To</strong></p> <p>15</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>crown it all, they are always gripped with the fear of complications especially foot complications and amputation. A good number of patients become frustrated, discouraged and/or engaged with a disease that often does not seem to respond to their best efforts. This, Rubin (2000), referred to as “diabetes overwhelmus”. Diabetes can exert an enormous negative impact on QOL in the area of social and psychological well-being, as well as physical ill-health and environmental health. As the disease progresses, psychosocial problems imernate from onset of complications, medical and self- management. To what extent do the disease and its management impact on the QOL of the patients? This study therefore assessed the HRQOL of patients with diabetes mellitus.</strong></p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p><strong>The purpose of this study was to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with diabetes mellitus attending the diabetic clinic of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, and compare with that of non-diabetic persons resident in Port Harcourt.

They are matching group.</strong></p> <p><strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p><strong>The study objectives were to:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.   </strong><strong>Determine the HRQOL scores of patients with diabetes mellitus and the non-diabetic group in all the four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF.</strong></p> <p>16</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>2.   </strong><strong>Compare the HRQOL scores of diabetes mellitus patients with non-diabetic group in all the four domains of the World Health Organization Quality Of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF).</strong></p> <p><strong>3.   </strong><strong>Compare the HRQOL scores of DM patients with co-morbidities with the scores of DM patients without co-morbidities in the four domains of WHOQOL-BREF.</strong></p> <p><strong>4.   </strong><strong>Determine the influence of socio-demographic variables on the HRQOL overall mean score of the DM patients.</strong></p> <p><strong>Hypotheses</strong></p> <p><strong>1.   </strong><strong>There is no significant difference between the HRQOL scores of patients with diabetes mellitus and that of the non-diabetic group in the four domains of the</strong></p> <p><strong>WHOQOL-BREF.</strong></p> <p><strong>2.   </strong><strong>There is no significant difference between the HRQOL scores of diabetic patients with co-morbidities and those without co-morbidities in all the four domains of the</strong></p> <p><strong>WHOQOL-BREF.</strong></p> <p><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p><strong>This study was carried out at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital using diabetic patients attending the diabetic clinic that hold on Wednesdays.

The purpose was to investigate factors influencing the choice of infant feeding options among HIV positive mothers in Ogoja, Cross River State. Four objectives and four research questions were used to guide the study. Literatures were reviewed. The population for the study was all HIV positive mothers attending health facilities in Ogoja from January-December 2011-2013, with a total of 136 registered HIV positive mothers. There was no sampling because the total population was included in the study. The instrument for data collection was questionnaire with two sections. Section A had 8 items on socio-demographic characteristics. Section B was made up of 10 items rating scale of Yes and No. Data was analyzed using chi-square statistics. Result revealed that marital status (x2= 20.924, p&lt;.00), religious status (x2 = 14.972, p&lt;.05), maternal health condition (x2=12.436, p&lt;.02), limited time to breastfeed baby because of work (x2 =11.065, p&lt;.04) and baby’s refusal to take breast milk (x2 = 18.318, p&lt;.00) significantly influenced HIV positive mothers’ choice of infant feeding options. Major findings reveal that marital status, religious status, maternal health condition, limited time to breast feed baby because of work and baby’s refusal to take breast milk had significant influence on infant feeding options. Based on the findings it was recommended that HIV positive mothers should be sensitized by HIV/PMTCT counselors with necessary knowledge for the choice of infant feeding options.</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Human immune-deficiency virus (HIV) is a chronic, health problem with symptoms appearing anytime from several months to years. HIV is found among all known populations of the world, including the embryonic population (unborn babies) and the breastfed babies. World Health Organization, (WHO, 2011) revealed that more than eleven million people worldwide had died of AIDS, while another 3.6 million of people are already infected with HIV, with a daily infection rate of over 16,000 people globally. It was observed by Anyebe, Whiskey, Ajayi, Garba, Ochigbo and Lawal (2011) that by 2002, 42 million people had been infected with HIV/AIDS globally, 38.6 million of them were adults of which 19.2 million were women. More than 3 million children below the age of 15 were infected worldwide within the same period with about 5 million new infections being recorded yearly. Nearly two thirds of these are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, an estimated 600,000 children are infected vertically (in utero) each year, while in places where women do not breastfeed, most of the transmission occurs at the time of labor and delivery, (Okon, 2011).</div> <div>In Nigeria where most women breastfeed, there is an additional risk. About 800,000 were infected out of 5.8 million in 2003 were infants and children of which 90% of these got infected through their mothers, occurring at three levels; antepartum, intrapartum and breastfeeding (Okon, 2011). There is no cure for HIV currently available, but prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) appears to be the most important intervention (Family Health International, 2004). American international health alliance (AIHA, 2008) in Ajayi, Hellandendu and Odekunle (2011) posited that ‘’ther e is no cure for HIV, but prevention of vertical transmission of HIV to include voluntary counseling and testing, (VCT) , ante-retroviral therapy, elective caesarean section; replacement of infant feed or modified breastfeeding, and restrictive use of invasive procedure such as artificial rupture of membrane, (ARM),episiotomies and cleansing of the birth canal with a microbite during labor and delivery.</div> <div>Sadoh, Adeniran and Abhulimhen-Iyohas (2008) opined that exclusive breastfeeding is the ideal practice among HIV infected mothers in the first six months of life, as recommended currently, followed by replacement feeding (any formula food rather than breast milk).</div>\n\nFACTORS INFLUENCING THE CHOICE OF INFANT FEEDING OPTIONS AMONG HIV POSITIVE MOTHERS ATTENDING HEALTH FACILITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CHOICE OF INFANT FEEDING OPTIONS AMONG HIV POSITIVE MOTHERS ATTENDING HEALTH FACILITIES", "id": 24}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The economic burden of cancer and the stress of payment require that, health care providers provide quality cost-effective care that will shorten the stay of patients in the hospital and reduce the frequency of visit to health facilities. This study investigated the economic burden of cancer patients and payment coping mechanism in Jos University Teaching Hospital, Plateau State. Four objectives and two hypotheses were raised to guide the study. Cost-of-illness framework was used to assess the economic burden of cancer patients and payment coping mechanism. A cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used for the study. A sample of 179 cancer patients was drawn consecutively from an estimated population of 276 that used the hospital in one year. Data were analyzed descriptively using frequencies, percentages, mean and standard deviation. Chi-square was used to determine the association between socio-economic groups and payment coping mechanisms utilized by cancer patients and between the cost distributions among different socio-economic groups. Majority of respondents were ranked among the poorest, the mean monthly total income of the patients is N65,978.74 + 104,036.97, mean monthly total expenses is N43,916.28 + 56,070.33, the mean monthly patients’ expenditure is N43,916.28 + 56,070.33, the mean total annual loss was N217,515.19 + 798,708.95, the mean patients’ annual loss as a percentage of their mean annual income is 11.38 + 19.13% while as a percentage of their mean annual expenditure was 50.06 + 421.98. There was a significant difference in the cost distribution of different socio-economic groups in terms of monthly patients’ total income, monthly earnings of persons accompanying patients, patients’ monthly loss, accompanying persons’ monthly loss, total monthly loss, patients’ annual loss, accompanying persons’ annual loss and total annual loss (P &lt; 0.05). Payment coping mechanism utilized by most (78.8%) of the patients was their own money (i.e. salary, earnings and/or savings). There was a significant difference between payment coping mechanism of cancer patients (borrowed money/loan, sales of land) and different socio-economic groups (P &lt; 0.05). There is need for government to intervene by subsidizing the cost of cancer treatment. There is need for the formation of a strong cancer Association in Plateau State so that cancer patients could pool their resources together as a strong social support to help themselves.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Cancer is the second leading cause of death and disability in the world followed by heart disease (Mathers &amp; Lancer, 2006). It is a major public health issue and represents a significant burden of disease. Based on the most complete and current data available, cancer accounts for one out of every eight deaths annually (Mathers &amp; Lancer, 2006). The incidence and death rates from cancer remain significantly higher in the developing world including Nigeria (Boyle &amp; Levin, 2008). It is responsible for more deaths than all the deaths due to HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria combined (Okoye, 2010).</div> <div>Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells (Global cancer facts and figures, 2011). It affects different parts of the body and the name of the cancer is given in relation to the part that is affected. It is a global disease that consumes resources. The cost of cancer treatment globally is reported to be high. Records have it that developed countries spend more on cancer treatment than developing countries; for example in the United States of America, the economic burden from cancer is tagged at $895 billion nearly 20% more than heart diseases toll ($753 billion) (John &amp; Ross, 2009). The cancers which account for the largest costs on a global scale, and the greatest burden in developed nations are; lung, colorectal and breast while in low-income countries, the cancer with the greatest impact are cancer of the mouth and oropharynx, cancer of the cervix, breast and prostate cancer (John &amp; Rose, 2009).</div>\n\nECONOMIC BURDEN OF CANCER AND PAYMENT COPING MECHANISM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ECONOMIC BURDEN OF CANCER AND PAYMENT COPING MECHANISM", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The purpose of the study was to examine demographic and socio-economic factors influencing utilization of Maternal Health Services in selected rural communities in Igbo-Etiti Local Government Area in Enugu State, Nigeria.

Findings revealed that 251 (71%) of the respondents were between the ages of 21-35 years, 196 (55.6%) had attained secondary level education, 127 (35.9%) had only child. Significant proportions 116 (32.8%) were traders, 54 (15.3%) were students, 42 (11.9%) were civil servants while only 36 (10.2%) were not working. Among those working 128 (36.2%) and 102 (28.8%) had monthly per capita income N10, 000 and N20, 000 naira respectively. A little lower than half (45.5%) of the respondents’ husbands attained secondary level education and 117 (33.1%) were traders. Use of maternal health services revealed 310 (87.5%) registered for antenatal care in hospitals, 127 (35.9%) registered at first trimester, 184 (51.4%) registered at second trimester and 286 (80.8%) made at least four antenatal care visits. According to place of delivery 263</div> <div>(74.3%) gave birth in the hospitals while 91 (25.7%) gave birth at traditional birth attendants’ homes. According to levels of use 134 (37.9%) made the best use, 132 (37.3%) good use while 36 (10.2%) poorly utilized maternal health services. There was significance association (P &lt; 0.05) between age, education and use of maternal health services. There was no significance association (P &lt; 0.05) between parity, socioeconomic status and use of maternal health services. It was concluded that utilization was high though very few registered at first trimester and considerable proportion delivered at traditional birth attendant’s homes. It is recommended that the use of media to disseminate consistent messages promoting early registration (first trimester) for antenatal care and health institution delivery could help discussion of the issue within the communities.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Globally, a woman dies every minute from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth (Igbease, Isah and Igbeleoyi 2009 cited in Ochako, Fotso, Ikamari and Khasakhala, 2011). According to the same authors about half a million women die yearly due to maternal causes with 99% of the deaths taking place in developing countries. Pregnant mothers in developing countries experience short or long term life threatening conditions related to pregnancy and child birth including maternal death (Asghar, Ashfag, Naimatullah, Igbal, Tanvir and Samina, 2009; Nitai, Ataharul, Rafiqul, Wasimul and Halida, 2003). These include haemorrhage, eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), vesico vagina fistula (VVF) among others. Maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, child birth and postpartum period (WHO, 2011). It involves ensuring good health of mother and baby during pregnancy, delivery and the postpartum period (National Reproductive Health policy and Frame work, 2005 – 2008). Maternal health simply means maintaining the health and general well-being of women from pregnancy through birth and six weeks after child birth.</div> <div>In recognition of the need to improve maternal health status, detect and manage life threatening complications many international conferences were held. They include Safe Motherhood Initiative held in Nairobi in 1987 and the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) of 1994. </div>\n\nDEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS INFLUENCING UTILIZATION OF MATERNAL HEALTH SERVICES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS INFLUENCING UTILIZATION OF MATERNAL HEALTH SERVICES", "id": 26}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study was on coping strategies of clients with fertility challenges attending Obstetric and Gynaecological clinic of University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital. The objectives of the study were to ascertain the use of escape/avoidance coping strategy by couples with fertility challenges, determine the use of self controlling coping strategy by couples with fertility challenges, determine if couples with fertility challenges use social seeking support as a coping strategy and assess if couples with fertility challenges use positive reappraisal as a coping strategy. A descriptive survey design was used for the study. A sample size of 232 respondents was used for the study which was calculated from the target population of 456 using power analysis. The instrument for data collection was adapted from Folkman and Lazarus ways of coping. The face and content validity were determined by the supervisor, psychologist and a consultant in Obstetric and Gynaecological clinic in UMTH. The results were presented in tables as percentages, means and standard deviation. Pearson Chi-square and Fisher’s Exact test were used to determine the association between coping strategies based on gender at 0.05level of significance. Major findings of the study revealed that males used most coping strategies than the females. The analysis shows 57% of males and 31.1% of females drinks smokes and indulges in drugs as escape/avoidance coping strategy. There was significant difference in the used of this coping strategy (P=0.000). Similarly, there was significant difference in the use of self controlling coping strategy as P=0.000, where 79.2% of males and 50.3% of females avoid people who trouble them about pregnancy and children. However, there was no significant difference in the used of social seeking support as 75% of males and 92.2% of females ask people with similar problem for advice with P=0.080. In the same vein, 64.9% of males and 89.2% of females used praying to God to change the situation as a positive reappraisal coping strategy with P=0.087. In conclusion, escape/avoidance and self control coping strategies were used more by men and there was no difference in use of social seeking support and positive reappraisal coping strategies. It was recommended that where couples cannot achieve pregnancy on their own, they should go for assisted reproduction.</p> </div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Infertility is perceived as a problem across virtually all cultures and societies and affects an estimated 10-15% of couples of reproductive age (Bovine, Bunting, Collins &amp; Negron, 2007). It has been viewed differently in different cultures. The population in the developed and developing countries hold different attitudes regarding infertility. In developing countries, infertility may be linked to an act of God, punishment for sins of the past, prolonged use of contraceptives, and the result of witchcraft which is causing childlessness, whereas people in developed countries view infertility as caused by biological and other related factors like excessive alcoholism, lack of cooperation between the man and the woman during sexual intercourse (Bovine, Bunting, Collins &amp; Negron, 2007). No matter the culture, infertility is viewed as an enormous problem by couples everywhere.</p> <p>According to Dhont, Van der Wijgert, Coene, Gasarabwe &amp; Temmerman, (2010) children are seen as blessings of marriage and in some societies of the world; it is even believed that they are symbols of God's approval and blessings on marriages. Under normal circumstances, it is the choice of each individual and couple, within their own sense of conscience, to determine if they intend pregnancy and if so, the size of their family unit and the timing of when to have a child or children. However, in many African cultures, married couples who are unable to bear children shortly a few years after marriage are faced with all forms of unfriendly</p></div>pressure from the family and social groups which could lead to unnecessary frustration, resentment and depression.<div> <p>Apart from the rare cases when couples deliberately decide not to have children, inability to bear children has been the cause of many failed marriages and even destroyed many homes. It affects the self-esteem of a man, dampens his sense of control and also throws a woman into total confusion, frustration and anxiety. It is therefore an issue that should not be taken lightly by both the man and the woman. Many women believe that without children, life is without hope (Marida &amp; Ulla, 2008).</p> <p>World Health Organisation, 1987 as cited in Tabong &amp; Adongo, (2013) defined infertility as failure to conceive after one year of regular unprotected sexual intercourse in the absence of known reproductive pathology. However epidemiological studies have revealed that in a normal population of heterosexually active women who are not using birth control methods, 25% will become pregnant in the first month, 63% within six months and 80% within one year. By the end of the second year, 85% to 90% will have conceived (National collaboration centre for women and children heath, 2012). Because some couples who are not infertile may not be able to conceive within the first year of unprotected sex, World Health Organization (WHO) therefore recommends the epidemiological definition of infertility, which is the inability to conceive within two years of exposure to pregnancy (WHO, 1987 in Tabong &amp; Adongo, 2013).Individuals who are thought to be infertile are generally relegated to an inferior status, and stigmatized with many labels. As a result, childlessness has varied consequences through its effects in the society and on life style of individuals. Though in some cases, the childless life style enhances life satisfaction for some individuals, yet it is diminishing for others for whom parenthood is a personal goal (Aysel &amp; Gul, 2015).</p> </div>Graham (2015) noted that, parenthood is one of the major transitions in adult life for both men and women. The stress of the non fulfilment of a wish for a child has been associated with emotional related problems, sexual dysfunction and social isolation. Couples passing through the stress of infertility challenges experience stigma, sense of loss, and diminished self esteem in the society. Among couples with infertility challenges in general, women show higher levels of distress than their men partners. They experience sense of loss of identity and have pronounced feelings of incompleteness and incompetence.<div> <p>However, infertility is a significant medical problem that affects many couples and has multiple aspects including physical, emotional, financial, social and psychological effects (Omu &amp; Omu, 2010). Experience of fertility challenges is a stressful condition itself, becoming particularly traumatic with previous pregnancies ending up in abortions, stillbirths and neonatal/infant deaths (Rouchou &amp; Brittany, 2013). Receiving a diagnosis of infertility is a significant life crisis (Alesi, 2007). Feeling of grief and loss are very common as couples come to terms with the fact that they are not able to conceive. Infertility may result in a decrease in quality of life and an increase in marital discord and sexual dysfunction (Sameer, Trupti &amp; Surendranths, 2010).</p> <p>For many couples, infertility is undeniably a major life crisis and psychologically stressful (Holstein, Christensen &amp; Boivin, 2011a). It has been reported to cause depression, pain and the promise of often unfulfilled dreams in women. It is a lonely place for individuals and couples because “infertility is often a silent and solitary crucible, since it is not visible, life threatening or disfiguring” (Mogobe, 2010). Studies have found infertile women to be more neurotic, dependent and anxious than fertile women, experiencing conflict over their femininity and fear associated with reproduction. Others studies have similarly come to negative conclusions regarding the relationship between psychological factors and infertility (Noble, 2009).</p> </div>Worldwide, more than 70 million couples suffer from infertility. In sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence differs widely from 9% in the Gambia, 21.2% in north-western Ethiopia, 11.8% among women and 15.8% among men in Ghana and between 20 and 30% in Nigeria (National collaboration centre for women and children health, 2012). In African culture, the meaning of marriage is only fulfilled if the woman conceives and bears children as they are seen as sources of power and pride as well as assurance of family continuity. Anthropological and sociological studies bear testimony to the considerable suffering associated with involuntary childlessness due to negative psychosocial consequences such as marital instability, abuse and stigmatization (Dyer, Abraham, Hoffman &amp; Van der Spy, 2012).<div> <p>In Nigeria, the prevalence of infertility has been studied in demographic surveys, epidemiological surveys and through clinical observation (Okonofua, 2010). The Nigeria demographic and health survey for the period 2006-2010 reported a prevalence rate of primary infertility of 22.7% in 15-49years old women and 7.1% in 25-49years old (Okonofua, 2010). The inability to have children affects both men and women across the globe and lead to distress and depression as well as discrimination and ostracism (Cui, 2010). In order to deal with the stress of infertility, couples adopt various coping strategies.</p> <p>According to Jordan &amp; Revenson (2013) Coping strategies are ways in which one learns to deal with stressful situations. Every one copes with stress differently. Over time, people construct coping strategies that are good for mental wellness. Coping with infertility is often challenging because “infertility can be conceptuali zed as a chronic, unpredictable, and (personally or medically) uncontrollable stressor that may exceed the couple’s coping resources”. Carrol, Robinson, Marshall, Callister, Olsen, and Dyches, (2011) noted the following coping strategies including distancing themselves from reminders of infertility (such as avoidance of families with children), instituting measures for regaining control,</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>4</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>acting to increase feeling of self-worth in other areas of their lives such as achieving professional success, trying to find meaning in infertility, or sharing the burden with others.</p> <p>Many people have reported encountering a number of stressors associated with the medical diagnosis of infertility. These stressors include but not limited to stress related to endurance, sexual functioning, quality of their relationship and changes in their social and family as well as family networks (Newton, Sherrad &amp; Glavac, 2014). The severity and frequency of these stressors can contribute to negative outcomes such as psychological distress or marital dissatisfaction. To curb the potential negative consequences of excessive infertility stress, couples often use a number of coping strategies. This study investigated the various coping strategies utilised by clients with fertility challenges attending Obstetrics and Gynaecological (O and G) clinic of University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH).</p> <p><strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Fertility challenges are the most frequent reason for gynaecological consultation in Nigeria (Okonofua, 2010). However, experiences from actual clinical practice indicate that, infertility is a major burden on clinical service delivery in Nigeria (Ajayi, 2013). More than 50% of gynaecological caseload consultation and over 80% of laparoscopic investigations are as a result of infertility (Obiechina, Okoye &amp; Emelife, 2009).</p> <p>Individuals who are thought to be infertile are generally relegated to an inferior status, and stigmatised experiencing sense of loss, and diminished self esteem in their community. Among people with fertility challenges in general, women show higher levels of distress than their men partners (Aysel &amp; Gul, 2015). Married individuals experience sense of loss of identity and have pronounced feelings of incompleteness and incompetence. In 2014, while supervising students during the clinical posting in Obstetric and Gynaecological clinic of UMTH for six weeks, the researcher observed that 30% of the clients that came for</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>5</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>consultation had fertility challenges and these raised questions in the mind of the researcher on how clients with fertility challenges cope with infertility. Which coping strategies do they adopt? Are there differences in the use of coping strategies based on gender? This study attempted to address these questions.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study was to determine the coping strategies adopted by clients with fertility challenges attending Obstetrics and Gynaecological clinic of UMTH.</p> <p><strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>1.     Ascertain the use of escape/avoidance coping strategy by clients with fertility challenges.</p> <p>2.     Determine the use of self-controlling coping strategy by clients with fertility challenges.</p> <p>3.     Determine if clients with fertility challenges use seeking social support as a coping strategy.</p> <p>4.     Assess if clients with fertility challenges use positive reappraisal as a coping strategy.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.      What type of escape/avoidance coping strategies do clients with fertility challenges use in coping?</p> <p>2.      To what extent do clients with fertility challenges use self controlling strategies in coping?</p> <p>3.      Which of the seeking social support coping strategies do clients with fertility challenges seek to use in coping?</p> <p>4.      To what extent do clients with fertility challenges use positive reappraisal to cope?</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>6</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>There is no significant difference based on gender and the use of coping strategies of clients with fertility challenges.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The result of this study will reveal how clients cope with infertility challenges using various coping strategies and as well help to improve the coping strategies of people with fertility challenges by identifying positive coping strategies which will be accessible when the work is published. The society and significant orders will also accept individuals with fertility challenges and give the necessary social and psychological support needed by them. The findings from this study will be communicated to the health team of Obstetric and Gynaecological clinic of UMTH which will assist them not only to give assistance in reproductive treatment but also gives psychological counselling to people with fertility challenges.</p> <p><strong>Scope of Study</strong></p> <p>This study is confined to assessing the coping strategies of clients with fertility challenges attending Obstetric and Gynaecological clinic of UMTH.

Within the society there are individuals from different background, with different perspectives and approaches to life. This gives rise to opposing viewpoints, disagreement, competitions, arguments, suspicions, pain etc. Consequently, it is inevitable for conflict to exist. In fact, conflict is a part and parcel of everyday life and each individual enters into some type of conflict in his/her life.</div> <div>Thus Reece and Brandt (2006) defined conflict as people striving for their preferred outcome which if attained prevents others from achieving their own preferred outcome thereby resulting in hostility and breakdown in human relation. According to Johnansen (2012) and Kelly (2006), conflict is a result of perceived threat to one’s needs, interest and/or concern and has something to do with arms, fighting a war, a struggle between opposing principles or aims, a clash of feeling or interest. For Carnevals, Pruit, and Seilheimer (2007) conflict is a complex process affected by dispositional, contextual and inter personal factors.</div> <div>The definitions indicate that conflict is multidimensional and so is of many types and varied causes. An obvious cause of conflict is disagreement over issues that lead to competition and struggle for scarce resources because of perceived threat to one’s interests. Specific causes depend on the environment and conflict could be found in all areas of life including family, workplace, and organizations/institutions. Organizational| institutional conflicts result mainly from the struggle for organizational resources. Workplace conflict can also result from poor communication, lack of employee motivation and/or unequal treatment in terms of allocation of duties/responsibility and authority or in the distribution of benefits (Morrison, 2008).</div>\n\nCONFLICT MANAGEMENT SKILLS OF NURSE TUTORS IN BASIC SCHOOLS OF NURSING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONFLICT MANAGEMENT SKILLS OF NURSE TUTORS IN BASIC SCHOOLS OF NURSING", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This study was carried out to assess knowledge, practice and factors influencing birth preparedness and complication readiness among couples in selected rural communities in Oji River. The objectives of the study were to determine knowledge of birth preparedness and complication readiness among couples in the communities studied, couple’s practice of birth preparedness and complication readiness, identify factors that hinder couples practices of birth preparedness and complication readiness and establish the relationship between couple’s socio-economic status and their practice of birth preparedness and complication readiness. A cross-sectional descriptive survey research design was used for the study in selected seven communities of Oji River L.G.A. Snowball non probability sampling technique was used to select subjects for the study. A sample of 470 was determined using the formula by Surish &amp; Chandrashekera. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze data at 0.05 level of significance. Results were presented in tables, frequencies, means and standard deviations. Findings revealed that majority of the couples 120 (78.7%) were knowledgeable on birth preparedness and complication readiness, knowledge did not translate to practice as less than 20% actually practiced the acceptable level of birth preparedness. Financial constraint was the significant factor that hindered couples practice of birth preparedness and complication readiness. All the socio-economic variable examined were associated with couple’s practice of birth preparedness and complication readiness. There was significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) in the average monthly income and educational qualification of the couples and their practice of birth preparedness and complication readiness. In conclusion, although most of the couple had good knowledge of birth preparedness and complication readiness, knowledge still did not translate to practice as few of them actually practiced the acceptable level of birth preparedness and complication readiness. Based on the findings, the recommendations that there is a need for slight shift in focus of maternal and child care projects of governments and need to improve transportation facilities suitable for pregnant women at rural communities which will improve outcomes in emergencies were made.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>It is true that birth of baby precedes celebration but it equally poses source of concern as pregnancy and childbirth is sometimes a perilous journey especially in the developing countries, where the risk of a woman dying from pregnancy and related complications is almost 40 times greater than that of her counterparts in developed countries (Benson &amp; Yinger, 2002). Maternal mortality remains a public health challenge world wide, and the global maternal mortality ratio of 525 per 100,000 live births annually is still unacceptably high (Hogan, 2010). A disproportionately high burden of these maternal deaths is borne by developing countries including Nigeria, with a maternal mortality ratio of 500– 1,000 per 100,000 live births (World Bank, 2013). These deaths arise from pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum complications. According to WHO (2009), maternal deaths are thought to occur in developing countries due to delay in deciding to seek appropriate care, delay in reaching an appropriate health facility, and delay in receiving adequate emergency care once at a facility. These delays may be reduced if pregnant women and their families are prepared for birth and its complications. Birth preparedness and complication readiness strategy is therefore, very relevant in this regard.This strategy can reduce the number of women dying from complications due to such delays by making a birth plan that constitutes birth-preparedness and complication-readiness measures for pregnant women, their spouses and their families (McPherson, Khadka, Moore &amp; Sharma, 2006).....</div>\n\nASSESSING KNOWLEDGE, PRACTICE AND FACTORS INFLUENCING BIRTH PREPAREDNESS AND COMPLICATION READINESS AMONG COUPLES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSING KNOWLEDGE, PRACTICE AND FACTORS INFLUENCING BIRTH PREPAREDNESS AND COMPLICATION READINESS AMONG COUPLES", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This study investigated the job satisfaction of professional nurses in public and private health sectors in Anambra State.

Nurses in public and private hospitals were satisfied from job control/ responsibilities. Also, it was found that opportunity for advancement guarantees job satisfaction to nurses in public and private hospitals. Based on the findings, it was recommended that hospital management should create a work environment that is free from dissatisfiers in order that nurses would carry out their duties effectively towards the actualization of organization’s goal.

Job satisfaction which is equally understood and sometimes referred to as “work satisfaction” has been variously defined in the literature. Job satisfaction is the extent to which an employee expresses a positive orientation towards a job. It also describes how content an individual is with his or her job. Job satisfaction has also been defined as a pleasurable emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one’s job, an affective reaction to one’s job and an attitude towards one’s job (Chimanikire, Mutandwa, Gadzirayi, Muzondo, &amp; Mutandwa, 2007; Thompson &amp; Phua, 2012). Job satisfaction is a worker’s sense of achievement and success on the job. It is generally perceived to be directly linked to productivity as well as to personal well-being. Job satisfaction implies doing a job one enjoys, doing it well and being rewarded for one’s efforts. Job satisfaction further implies enthusiasm and happiness with one’s work. Job satisfaction is the key ingredient that leads to recognition, income, promotion, and the achievement of other goals that lead to a feeling of fulfilment (Kaliski, 2007).</div> <div>Job satisfaction has continued to be a major area of interest in the study of industrial and organizational psychology because of the presumed and common-sense linkages between satisfaction and other mainstream concepts.</div> </div> \n\nANALYSIS OF JOB SATISFACTION OF PROFESSIONAL NURSES IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF JOB SATISFACTION OF PROFESSIONAL NURSES IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/>National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) is a system of healthcare financing introduced by<br/>Federal Government of Nigeria to help reduce the risks and minimize the costs of<br/>healthcare.

The civil servants had a positive perception of the NHIS programme (Overall<br/>Mean = 2.81). Majority of the respondents (60%) accessed care under the scheme. Findings<br/>from the study also showed that the civil servants who utilized the scheme had a better<br/>perception of the programme (mean = 2.84) when compared to those who didn’t (P =<br/>0.038). Education was significantly associated with knowledge and positive perception of the<br/>programme. There was no association between grade level and knowledge of NHIS<br/>programme. In addition, their perception of the programme was not dependent on their<br/>gender.

The current concern with financing, and the specific interest in health<br/>insurance is often the result of parallel trend; the recognition of basic healthcare for all<br/>citizens as a fundamental human right on the one hand, and the difficulties faced by<br/>governments in developing and maintaining resources to provide health care through<br/>general taxation revenue on the other (Mgbe &amp; Kelvin, 2014). World Health<br/>Organization (WHO) has been giving tremendous support and cooperation to nations<br/>that pursue their citizen’s welfare through health insurance. They further noted that,<br/>nations equally are channeling large chunk of their budget to the attainment of good<br/>health for their people.<br/>Health insurance can be categorized as social (or government) health insurance and<br/>private health insurance. Where a system is financed by compulsory contributions<br/>mandated by law or taxes and the system provisions as specified by legal status, it is<br/>social (or government) health insurance plan. On the other hand, private health<br/>insurance is usually financed on a group basis but most plans also provide for<br/>individual policies (Adeoye, 2015).<br/>Health Insurance, according to (Adeoye, 2015) is assuming the status of a global<br/>phenomenon. It was first introduced in Germany in 1883 under General Von<br/>Bismark’s old age and disability insurance scheme. Since then, health insurance has<br/>continued to gain prominence in the other industrialized nations like France, United<br/>Kingdom etc. Developing countries too have joined in beaming their health search<br/>light on health insurance. Prominent among them are Costa-Rica, Brazil, Bangladesh,<br/>15<br/>China, India, Pakistan, Thailand, etc. In Africa it has been introduced in Tanzania,<br/>Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, Zimbabwe etc (Agada-Amade, 2007).<br/>In Nigeria, the rising cost of medical care, coupled with poor funding of the health<br/>care sector by government, in addition to severe down turn in the Nigerian Economy<br/>in the 1980’s and 1990s resulted in the abysmal patronage of the orthodox medical<br/>and other healthcare or health institutions (Afoloyan-Oloye,2008). Most of these<br/>health institutions either down-sized or closed down completely and their health<br/>practitioner’s brain-drained for greener pasture. Majority of the people according to<br/>Afoloyan-Oloye (2008) resorted to patronizing alternative health care practitioners,<br/>such as the herbalists and the spiritualists. Mortality from common diseases became<br/>the order of the day. This resulted in government implementing various intervention<br/>designs which included the Bamako initiative, user-fee and Drug Revolving Fund.<br/>After several committees and commissions, the Federal Government approved the<br/>National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 1989 as a viable means of health care<br/>financing for the achievement of easy access to quality health care for the Nigerian<br/>people (Adeoye, 2015). It was formally launched on October 15, 1997 and the decree<br/>was signed into law in May 1999.<br/>National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) is a body established under Act 35 of 1999<br/>by the Federal Government of Nigeria to improve the health of all Nigerians at an<br/>affordable cost (Adeoye, 2015). NHIS according to Mgbe &amp; Kevin (2014), is a social<br/>security system adopted by Nigerian Government to guarantee the provision of<br/>needed health services to persons on the payment of token contribution to the<br/>common pool, at regular intervals. In the context of this study, NHIS is a system of<br/>health care financing introduced by Federal Government of Nigeria to address the<br/>problems of health care delivery which has been affected by challenges. It can be seen<br/>as a typical example of Public Private Partnership [PPP] in health care delivery in<br/>Nigeria. Its main goal is to enhance the health status of the citizens through provision<br/>of financial risk protection and customer satisfaction. The hope of the average<br/>Nigerian to have a reliable and affordable healthcare delivery system has been<br/>brightened with the take-off of the long awaited National Health Insurance Scheme<br/>(Mgbe &amp; Kevin, 2014).</p>                                                         \n\nKNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTION OF THE FEDERAL CIVIL SERVANTS TOWARDS HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTION OF THE FEDERAL CIVIL SERVANTS TOWARDS HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of nurses to information technology on nursing care delivery in Enugu. This write up studied knowledge of computer facilities, the level of knowledge of these computer facilities, whether the mentioned computer facilities are used in various places where they work. The relevance of information technology in nursing care delivery and factors hindering the use of ICT in nursing care delivery in Enugu were also studied. Sources of data for this study include library and questionnaire responses. Five health institutions were used, three government, one mission and one privately owned hospitals in Enugu metropolis. Questionnaires were distributed to 100 respondents from the five hospitals. Data collected were analyzed in tables and charts using percentage method or technique. From the research findings it was observed that the awareness about information technology and commonly used computer facilities such as internet and internet communications are high (96% and 94% respectively). The level of knowledge of these commonly used computer facilities among nurses in Enugu are still very low. In internet and internet communications, only 23% and 12% respectively had excellent knowledge while nobody (0%) had excellent knowledge in telenusring. Most of these computer facilities that were assessed are available and are in-use in the five hospitals that were used for this study. The rate of usage of GSM handsets and desktop/Laptop computers were 75% and 70% respectively while 67% and 62% used computer projectors and blood glucose analyzers. Among the five hospitals that were used for this assessment, non of them was found without these computer facilities. The relevance of information technology in nursing care delivery was assessed. Eighty five and seventy four percent (85% and 74%) of the respondents agreed that ICT aids student training, research and also is a good source of information on new diseases and treatment. Concerning faster diagnosis of diseases and easy/faster management of patients, 52% and 56% agreed that computer was an aid to such function. Some factors hindering the use of ICT in nursing care delivery were also identified. Such factors were inaccessibility to ICT facilities (71%), ineffective use of ICT at work place (69%), high cost of hard and software (65%). I hereby recommend continuing education for nurses in the area of ICT. This should be included in the curriculum for training nurses. Nurses should also make personal efforts to acquire ICT knowledge. All nurses should, therefore, be computer literate in order to embrace the information revolution that is going on now in the world.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.10INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>According to advanced learners dictionary of current English 5th edition, information technology is the study or use of electronic processes for storing information and making it available (IT). Information technology has become a vital component in health care delivery.</p> <p>Flynn (1998) defines information technology or system as an information system that provides procedures to record and make available  information, concerning part of an organization, to assist organization related activities.</p> <p>According to Davis (1999), information technology refers to sending, processing and receiving information through electronic means or computer. It is a flow of some sort of information carrying commodity in some network.</p> <p>There are no age limit or position limit in studying information technology. In October, 1999, the Guardian newspaper reported that the British prime Minister Tony Blair took his first tentative step into Information technology. He admitted his incompetence in computer usage. He then attended a two-hour computer training session in a shopping center to be instructed in word-processing, e-mail and the internet (Guardian 25 October 1999). There is need for everybody to become computer literate. This is important because the world has now entered the information age.</p> <p><strong>1.11RATIONALE/THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>This study employs the diffusion of innovation theory. It is a socio-psychological theory propounded by clerk Rogers. Diffusion of innovation theory is concerned with the manner in which a new technological ideas, artifact or technique, or a new use of old one, migrates from creation to use. Obviously, this theory has been useful in studies relating to information and communication technology, especially when it concerns the adoption and use of new technologies.</p> <p>The Diffusion of innovations theory will provide this study with useful framework in explaining how far the Nurses in Enugu have acquired the knowledge of information technology and their attitude towards the application in Nursing care delivery.</p> <p><strong>1.12STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Science has since reduced the world to a global village. This is the part and function of information technology. It is a common knowledge that information and communication technology (ICT) has come to facilitate and ease interactivity in health care delivery, Nursing diagnoses and treatment of ailments and disease, precision and accuracy in laboratory experiments, medical records keeping and drug preparation, monitoring of patient’s condition among others. Information and communication technology (ICT) is, therefore, vital for efficient discharge of duties in contemporary health institutions. What this means is that Nurses in the contemporary health and health related sectors must be ICT literate and compliance.</p> <p>Nurses should be familiar with relevant ICT applications in health care delivery.</p> <p><strong>1.13PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The motivation behind this study are</p> <p>i.            To determine the current levels of knowledge of information and communication technology among Nurses in Enugu.</p> <p>ii.          To determine Nurses understanding of the relevance of ICT to Nursing care delivery.</p> <p>iii.        To ascertain the level of usage of ICT among Nurses in Enugu.</p> <p>iv.         To find out the factors that are hindering the use of ICT among Nurses in Enugu metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.14RESEARCH QUESTIONS/HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The following research questions will guide this study.</p> <p>1)          What is the level of knowledge of computer facilities among Nurses in Enugu metropolis.</p> <p>2)          What is the attitude of Nurses about the relevance of information technology to Nursing care delivery?</p> <p>3)          What are the current levels of usage of information technology among Nurses in Enugu metropolis?</p> <p>4)          What are the factors militating against Nurses in using information communication technology in Enugu metropolis?</p> <p><strong>1.15SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The world has witnessed an information revolution, a combination of massive increase in the world’s inventory of information and technical development and means to cope with it. Information technology is the name given to the means of processing and transmitting information.</p> <p>Information technology is a subject that is very wide. There is hardly no sector of the economy that information technology is not being applied. For example in manufacturing, computers are used to do product design, product packaging. In engineering, computers are used to do different types of designs. In remote sensing and earth observation, satellite is a computer based technology in orbit for data transmission to the ground for interpretation. The world of commerce is far more automated than the actual production of goods. Banking, transportation and distribution of goods are being more transformed by electronics. The world of commerce is information intensive. It is required that information be made available on goods, their prices, their utility and the modern means for paying for those goods. Microcomputers are now widely used in hospitals and medical practice, medical research and medical  decision-making. The new technology offers new hope to the deaf, blind and the disabled. Diagnostic tests and laboratory analysis are quicker and easier.</p>                                                            \n\nEVALUATION OF KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF NURSES TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON NURSING CARE DELIVERY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF NURSES TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON NURSING CARE DELIVERY ", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background: In Nigeria, periodic national surveys report the practice of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in the general population to be over 50 %. However, little is known about EBF among professional working mothers, particularly its duration after maternity leave. Female workers are entitled to 12 weeks (84 days) of maternity leave with full pay in Nigeria, and this can be extended by two additional weeks in case of a caesarean or abnormal delivery. This study assessed the prevalence of EBF, as well as factors associated with the practice among professional working mothers in one of the ten regional capitals of Nigeria.</p> <p>Methods: The study was descriptive cross-sectional in design and employed a multi-stage sampling technique to sample 369 professional working mothers. The study was planned and implemented between January to July 2015. Study-specific structured questionnaires were used in the data collection over a period of one month. Some factors including demographic characteristics, types of facilities available at workplace to support breastfeeding, challenges to exclusive breastfeeding at the workplace and mother’s knowledge base on EBF, were assessed. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as feeding infants with only breast milk, without supplemental liquids or solids except for liquid medicine and vitamin or mineral supplements.</p> <p>Results: There was a near universal awareness of exclusive breastfeeding among respondents (99 %). Even though most mothers initiated breastfeeding within an hour of delivery (91 %), the EBF rate at six months was low (10.3 %). The study identified three elements as determinants of EBF; Those who did not receive infant feeding recommendation from health workers were less likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 0.45; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI] 0.27, 0.77), mothers who had shorter duration of maternity leave were less likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding (AOR 0.09; 95 % CI 0.02, 0.45), and those who had a normal delivery were almost 10 times as likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding (AOR 9.02; 95 % CI 2.85, 28.53).</p> <p>Conclusion: Given the high breastfeeding initiation, but low EBF continuation rate among professional working mothers, improved policies around maternity leave and breastfeeding friendly work environments are needed.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background to study</p> <p>The 2008 Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition indicated that suboptimum breastfeeding, especially not exclusively breastfeeding a child for the first six months of life, results in 1.4 million deaths and 10 % of the disease burden in children younger than five years in low-income and middle-income countries [1] . Other statistics indicate that one hundred and thirty-five million babies are delivered annually, but only 42 % (57 million) initiate breastfeeding within the first hour after birth, 39 % are breastfed exclusively during the first six months, and 58 % continue breastfeeding up to the age of two years [2] . Several studies have reported barriers accounting for this situation, including returning to work after delivery [3] . Others have stated factors that determine the success of exclusive breastfeeding even upon return to work, indicating that a supportive workplace and working environment are essential [4] . Yet, the Nigeria 2010 Population and Housing Census Report showed an increasing trend of women joining the labour force [5] . Guendelman et al. note that the challenge of balancing breastfeeding and paid work is an important reason for breastfeeding cessation in the first six months [6] . In Nigeria, the success of exclusive breastfeeding is subject to the nature of a women’s job and occupation, especially at places where women are engaged in industrial work away from home, and long working hours [7, 8] . Elsewhere, Magner, and Phillipi attribute cessation of breastfeeding within the first month to returning to work [9] . Aryeetey and Goh note that exclusive breastfeeding in Nigeria usually lasts for a median of about three months, which, incidentally coincides with the maternity leave period [10] . Cai et al. in their 2012 “global trends in exclusive breastfeeding” indicate that the early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding favours the use of commercial breast milk substitutes, often of poor nutritional quality [11] . Recently, Fosu-brefo and Arthur in their work titled “effect of timely initiation of breastfeeding on child health in Nigeria” acknowledged that interventions that improved child health and prevented childhood diseases included early breastfeeding initiation [12] . Also, the factors acknowledged locally in Nigeria, Ayton and colleagues have identified several others that are harmfully associated with effective breastfeeding, such as delays in and/or failure of early breastfeeding initiation [13] . Exploring the constraints to exclusive breastfeeding practice among working class Breastfeeding mothers in Southwest Nigeria, Agunbiade and Ogunleye note that early introduction of complementary feeding, based on false beliefs that it is only beneficial to infants less than six months, adversely affects breastfeeding initiation and sustainability [14] . In China and Western Kenya, several factors accounted for low EBF prevalence among working mothers. Early return to work, limited flexibility of work hours, lack of privacy [15] , as well as a feeling of being watched and judged, lack of support including networks, tiredness and emotional support at work [16] were cited as challenges facing working mothers. Mother’s work outside the home, father’s type of occupation (demanding occupations) which may limit their support for mothers to breastfeed and shorter maternity leave regulation also hindered EBF practice among professional working mothers in Vietnam [17] , who all intended to exclusively breastfeed. These studies report that although most working mothers leave the maternity ward breastfeeding exclusively, the practice is quickly abandoned, mostly due to work and employment related factors.</p> <p>Statement of problem</p> <p>Although breastfeeding may not be completely abandoned, its exclusivity was mostly interrupted by these factors. Some of the factors hindering exclusive breastfeeding initiation and practice in Nigeria and elsewhere include poor knowledge of mothers, lack of mother’s confidence, lack of skills about appropriate breastfeeding methods and challenges with other work problems during lactation [16, 18, 19] . These challenges may be amplified among working mothers in Nigeria, and could include giving substitutes other than maternal milk, early introduction of weaning foods, or shorter duration of EBF due to demands from work.</p> <p>While data indicate that only about 36 % of infants younger than six months are exclusively breastfed in developing countries [20] , national surveys concluded that Nigeria’s exclusive breastfeeding rate at six months is currently about 52 % [18] . Although higher than the national average, the exclusive breastfeeding prevalence of 60 % in the Upper West Region is lower than the desired national target. The popularity or otherwise of exclusive breastfeeding among gainfully employed women is yet to be characterized in this region of Nigeria. The current study therefore aimed to assess the prevalence, and predictors of exclusive breastfeeding among professional working mothers in the Upper West Regional capital of Nigeria.</p> <p>Objectives of the Study</p> <p>Specific Objectives</p> <p>Assess the level of Working class Breastfeeding mothers’ views about the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding;</p> <p>Determine the level of working class Breastfeeding mother’s views about barriers to exclusive breastfeeding;</p> <p>Significance</p> <p>It is hoped that the findings of the study will provide a current perceptual database that will inform all of us and more importantly the policy makers on the feelings and views of the mothers about exclusive breastfeeding so that appropriate alternatives to motivate the indulgence of exclusive breastfeeding and its support, would be developed by Working class Breastfeeding mothers, helpers and the populace of Nigeria.</p> <p>1.6 Operational Definitions: –</p> <p>These are precise descriptions of how to derive a value for characteristics the researcher is measuring.

Since nurses are the bedrock in the delivery of healthcare, they frequently need to be updated with adequate knowledge so that they, in turn, spread adequate information and skills to mothers and the community as a whole. However, the health and nutritional status of children and mothers are intimately linked. This means that mothers and their children form a biological and social unit; the health and nutrition of one cannot be divorced from another. Therefore, children have the right to access safe and nutritious food. These factors are important for achieving full potential growth and development. Women also have the right to adequate food and the right to decide how to feed their children and to have correct information and conditions that will enable them carry their decisions. They also have the right to maternity protection and nutrition (NIYCF, 2006-2010). Breastfeeding provides the healthiest beginning for the infant. With the risk of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV through breast feeding, health workers need guidance on how to address issues of optimal infant feeding on one hand whilst minimizing the risk of MTCT and the risk of infants dying from improper feeding practices on the other hand (NIYCF, 2006-2010). In the recent past with the unfolding detail about HIV/AIDS and MTCT, the need for consistent and clear messages in relation to optimal infant and young child feeding practices has become more apparent. The National Infant Young Child Feeding (NIYCF) operational Strategy builds on the past and continuing achievements in promoting optimal infant and young child feeding. These include exclusive breast feeding for six months and continued breastfeeding up to 2 years with introduction of appropriate timely complementary feeding, the implementation and monitoring of the International Code of Marketing of breast milk substitutes and the rights of working women to maternity protection. In the past decade, the government has implemented programmes aimed at improving the welfare of infants and young children. The government has 1 also enacted a legislation to reduce the marketing of breast-milk substitutes. Currently, various community-based initiatives (HIV positive living support groups, Home based Care support groups, etc), do not adequately include infant feeding issues in their agenda. However, recognition of these structures is cardinal for the implementation of various chosen successful breastfeeding initiatives in the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI). These include breast feeding and child survival and Baby Friendly Hospital Initiatives. Additionally, the effective referral system between health facilities and community needs to be strengthened where they do not exist.</p> <p>1.2 Statement of the Problem:</p> <p>There has not been a mechanism put in place to keep proper or concrete records on the activities as well as indicators of Exclusive Breastfeeding and mothers support groups in hospitals, polyclinics and health centres in Nigeria. There has however been occasional figures produced from special exercises or survey carried out. For instance, (World Linkages, Nigeria, July 2000; Country Profile), in a study in the upper East region in Nigeria, revealed that among children less than two months old, 43 percent are exclusively breastfed. By the fourth to the fifth month, the figure drops to 22 percent. Moreover, on the average, globally, only 39 per cent of babies breastfeed exclusively, even in the first four months of life (UNICEF; WABA, 2003).</p> <p>1.3 Research Questions</p> <p>The question therefore is what the contemporary views of mothers and helpers about exclusive Breastfeeding at University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) are, though without previous concrete reports or record in place.</p> <p>Do the breastfeeding mothers know how important the exclusive breastfeeding is and how to do it?</p> <p>Do they have confidence and where do they turn to when they face difficulty?</p> <p>Are people around them such as fathers and grandmothers supportive especially when mothers have to resume employment soon after delivery?</p> <p>1.4 The Purpose of the Study:</p> <p>The purpose of the study is to ascertain the current feelings and views of a cross-section of the Breastfeeding mothers on a MCH clinic day at University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH), about exclusive Breastfeeding in order to develop appropriate strategies.</p> <p>1.5 Significance</p> <p>It is hoped that the findings of the study will provide a current perceptual database that will inform all of us and more importantly the policy makers on the feelings and views of the mothers about exclusive breastfeeding so that appropriate alternatives to motivate the indulgence of exclusive breastfeeding and its support, would be developed by Breastfeeding mothers, helpers and the populace of Nigeria.</p> <p>1.6 Objectives of the Study</p> <p> 1.6.1 Main objective</p> <p>The main objective of the study is to find out the perception on exclusive breastfeeding among postnatal mothers.</p> <p> 1.6.2 Specific Objectives</p> <p>Assess the level of Breastfeeding mothers’ views about the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding;</p> <p>Determine the level of breastfeeding mother’s views about barriers to exclusive breastfeeding;</p> <p>Find the feelings towards exclusive breastfeeding</p> <p>Identify the behaviour of participants;</p> <p>Investigate any kind of support for breastfeeding mothers on exclusive breastfeeding.</p> <p>1.7 Operational Definitions: – These are precise descriptions of how to derive a value for characteristics the researcher is measuring. It also entails how specific these characteristics are ;</p> <p>Exclusive breastfeeding – This means giving a baby only breast milk, and no other liquids or solids, not even water unless medically indicated. This should be for the first 6 months (NIYCF, 2007).</p> <p>Exclusive replacement feeding – This is the process of feeding a child who is not breastfeeding with a diet that provides all the nutrients the child needs until the child is fully fed on family foods. Infant formula is recommended for exclusive replacement feeding when AFASS (Acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe) is met (NIYCF, 2007).</p> <p>Heat Treated Expressed Breast milk – This means that a mother expresses breast milk and heats it so that the HIV present in breast milk is destroyed making it safe to feed the infant (NIYCF, 2007),</p> <p>Wet Nursing -This refers to breastfeeding by another woman, who is HIV-negative.</p> <p>This may only be considered in special situations such as in case of an orphaned infant and</p> <p>the family can not meet AFASS. The wet nurse should be tested every three months (NIYCF, 2007).</p> <p>Infant – A baby under one year of age or from birth to 12 months of age (NIYCF, 2007),</p> <p>Knowledge – To have information in one’s mind as a result of experience or because you have learned or been told (Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, 2005).</p> <p>Attitude – The way one thinks, feels or behaves about somebody or something (Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, 2005).</p> <p>Bottle feeding – Feeding an infant from a bottle, whatever is in the bottle including expressed milk (NIYCF, 2007).</p> <p>Breast milk substitute – Any food being marketed or otherwise represented as a partial or total replacement for breast milk, whether or not suitable for that purpose (NIYCF, 2007).</p> <p>Complementary feeding – Child receives both breast milk or a breast substitute and solid (or semi-solid) food, recommended from the time the baby is 6 months old (NIYCF, 2007).</p> <p>Complementary food – Any food, whether manufactured or locally prepared; suitable as a complement to breast milk or to infant formula when either becomes insufficient to satisfy the nutritional requirements of the infant (NIYCF, 2007).</p> <p>Mixed feeding – Partial breast feeding and giving some other milk (NIYCF, 2007).</p>\n\nKNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF NURSING MOTHERS ON EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF NURSING MOTHERS ON EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1     Background of Study</p> <p>Primary Health Care forms the bedrock of the health-care services of a country. It is the quality of health care available to the majority of the population that determines the health status of the country and is the best indicator for the level of social development of the country. The important conditions of Primary Health-Care Services are that they should be: Efficient with regard to cost, techniques and organization; readily accessible to those concerned; Acceptable to the community served; at a reasonable cost. Health-care services should be available in a manner and language that is suitable to the community and population it serves and accommodating of local traditions and customs, and at a price which the population can afford. Patient satisfaction has been linked to increased patient compliance, continuity of care, better clinical outcomes, and greater service utilization and risk management. Patient satisfaction is thus a key marker for the quality of health-care delivery and an important indicator for evaluation and improvement of health-care services. Studies of Patient Satisfaction in health care originated in the USA during the 1950s,the earliest studies attempted to identify patient characteristics such as age, gender, and race to predict patient satisfaction levels (Apostle and Oder 1967;Bertakis et al. 1991). Another group of studies analysed health-care attributes such as nursing care, physician care, etc. to identify attributes that influence overall patient satisfaction (Ware et al. 1975; Ross et al. 1993; Dansky and Brannon 1996; Oswald et al. 1998). DrVeera Prasad in his comparative study of patient satisfaction said that there are five determinants of patient satisfaction.</p> <p>Reliability: The ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately.</p> <p>Responsiveness: The willingness to help the patients and provide prompt service.</p> <p>Assurance: The knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to convey trust and confidence.</p> <p>Empathy: The provision of caring and individualized attention to patients.</p> <p>Tangibles: The appearance of physical facilities, equipment, personal, and communication materials.</p> <p>A study was carried out to identify which attributes of a primary health-care experience access, staff care and physician care, and which aspects of each attribute are most significant in patients’ response to the services they receive. Analysis showed that among the three attributes, physician care was most influential, closely followed by the staff care, with access having least influence.However, it is the combination of all these factors that influence patient satisfaction, and need to be assessed to ensure a positive experience at the health-care facility.</p> <p>Unfortunately, while several studies have been carried out which have explored the parameters of patient satisfaction in tertiary care centers and large hospitals in India, very little attention has been paid to studies of patient satisfaction at the primary care level, especially GPs running solo clinics, which form the bulk of private primary care services.</p> <p>Measuring client or patient satisfaction has become an integral part of health facility management strategies across the globe (Smith and Engolbracht, 2001). The success of a health facility depends on client perceptions of health care quality because of the impact it has on client satisfaction based on services provided by health professionals. Satisfaction of clients not only ensures compliance with treatment and instructions about their illness, but also influences utilization of health facilities.</p> <p>Turhal and others (2002) made a comment that ―in the last 20 years the old way of treating patients in the “disease centred” approach has changed to “patient centred” style. Now patients have more influence toward the care they receive and they are given opportunity to change the way care is delivered to them. Health care in Nigeria has over the years been characterized by poor provider-client relationship which has made clients and some health providers to raise serious concerns. Provision of high quality client-centred care is therefore one of the greatest challenges of the Ministry of Health (MOH). As a result of the concerns raised by clients and health providers, the issue of improving quality of health care attracted serious attention in 1989 during the Regional Directors’ conference. Subsequent to the conference, improving the quality of health care attracted attention of both policy makers and health care professional groups and efforts have been made to identify key issues for improving the quality of health care throughout the country.</p> <p>1.2     Statement of the problem</p> <p>Health facilities at all levels of care are required to provide quality health care that meets the expectations of their clients. This is however, not so throughout the country. Provider-client relationship has been very poor resulting in growing concern among clients about the quality of care. The MOH (2007) in its national health policy document identifies complaints from users about the abusive and humiliating treatment by the health providers and shortages of equipment, consumables supplies and some essential drugs as some of the challenges of the health services. The national health policy document reveals that some health facilities are efficient, delivering high quality services and being responsive to the needs of their clients, but many are not.</p> <p>To monitor and improve the quality of care by health professionals in the health facilities, the Nigerian Health Services recommends client satisfaction surveys by health facilities at least twice in a year.</p> <p>Even though, some client satisfaction surveys have been conducted, annual reports show that it has not been able to do it twice a year. It is therefore not known how sustainable quality improvement efforts have been throughout the year.The health centres and clinics in the country have not been conducting client satisfaction surveys.The level of quality of care by professionals is therefore not known in these facilities, hence this study on patient perception and satisfaction with healthcare professionals at primary health care facilities.</p> <p>1.3     Justification</p> <p>Client satisfaction data is an important tool for quality improvement.This study describes client perception and satisfaction with health care professionals as a means of measuring quality of health care in Enugu. In addition to evaluating client perception and satisfaction with services provided by health professionals, it also elicits which service areas are priorities for improvement. It will also help bridge the gap between clients‘ expectations and the actual service they receive. Seeking clients’ opinions of the current level of service will ensure client focus in service delivery. This is necessary in ensuring high level of quality of service delivery.</p> <p>This study will also help the health facilities to initiate policies and programs that can lead to improved client-provider relationship which will result in increased utilization and revenue generation. It will also serve as a baseline study, since no such study describing the quality of care across the various levels of care has been done in the area.</p> <p>1.4     Research Objectives</p> <p>The general objective of this study is to describe patient perception and satisfaction with healthcare professionals at primary health care facilities in Enugu. The specific objectives are:</p> <p>To describe and compare the perceived quality of care at the various levels of care in Enugu</p> <p>To determine the level of client satisfaction with health care professionals in the health facilities</p> <p>To identify the predictors of perception of quality of care and client satisfaction in the health facilities</p> <p>1.5     Research Questions</p> <p>The following research questions guided the study;</p> <p>What is the perceived quality of care at the various levels of care in Enugu?</p> <p>What is the level of client satisfaction with health care professionals in the health facilities?</p> <p>What are the predictors of perception of quality of care and client satisfaction in the health facilities?</p> <p>1.6     Limitation to Study</p> <p>The major limitations of the study were</p> <p>Interviews and FGDs were held on the health facility premises. This might cause clients to have the tendency to give higher ratings for fear of victimization even though they were assured of confidentiality.</p> <p>Interviewing caretakers of patients less than 15 years of age rather than the patients themselves might not give the true picture since their views may be different from that of the patients themselves.</p> <p>Only one health centre and one clinic were sampled due to resource constraints.</p>\n\nPATIENT PERCEPTION AND SATISFACTION WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AT PRIMARY CARE FACILITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PATIENT PERCEPTION AND SATISFACTION WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AT PRIMARY CARE FACILITIES", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1     Background to Study</p> <p>Exercise has become a vital part of many women’s lives. Although many women still prefer to engage in exercise during pregnancy, they are concerned about the possible adverse effects.</p> <p>The concerns about exercising during pregnancy relate to the dual stresses of pregnancy and exercise that might create conflicting physiological demands on the mother-to-be (Wiswell, 1996; Sternfeld, 1997). In contrast to the adaptations that occur during pregnancy, which are intended to nurture and protect the foetus, those that occur during exercise serve to maintain maternal homeostasis. Excessive physical activity during pregnancy may thus create conflicting maternal and foetal needs and may pose potential risks for the outcome of the pregnancy. On the other hand, the adaptations may complement each other and offer potential benefits (Sternfeld, 1997).</p> <p>The physiological changes that occur during exercise include: redistribution of cardiac output away from the visceral circulation to the exercising muscles and skin, depletion of energy stores and an increase in body temperature (Clapp, 1996). In addition, several other potential risks have been described, including teratogenic effects as a result of exercise-induced hyperthermia, decreased carbohydrate availability for the foetus, redistribution of uterine blood flow with subsequent foetal hypoxia, increaseduterine contractility with a possible increase in the risk for preterm labour, infertility, abortion, congenitalmalformation,cordentanglement,placental separation, premature membrane rupture, growth restriction, foetal trauma, foetal bradycardia, difficultlabour, as well as maternal musculoskeletal injury (Clapp, 1996; Sternfeld, 1997; Stevenson, 1997; Clapp, 2000; Borg-Stein, Dugan &amp; Gruber, 2005).</p> <p>Exercise recommendations during pregnancy have evolved over the last several decades (Borg-Stein et al., 2005). Until the 20th century physical activity during pregnancy had been discouraged primarily because of theoretical concerns of exercise-induced injury and adverse foetal and maternal outcomes (Dempsey, Butler &amp; Williams, 2005). Consequently many saw pregnancy as a state of confinement in which women were not encouraged to engage in recreational physical activity (Dempsey et al., 2005). Results from animal studies published before the 1970’s clearly supported these concerns, which led to a variety of restrictive regulations regarding exercise(Clapp, 1996; Dempsey et al., 2005). Women were instructed to limit their involvement in exercise and non-exercisers were told not to initiate exercise when pregnant (Borg-Stein et al., 2005). In contrast, research findings published since the 1970’s do not support these concerns (Clapp, 2000; Dempsey et al., 2005). In fact, findings of studies completed since 1985 have demonstrated no adverse maternal or foetal effects in healthy women engaged in mild and moderate exercise activities (Clapp, 1996; Henriksson-Larsen, 1999; Riemann &amp;Kanstrup-Hansen, 2000; Dempsey et al., 2005;), but rather, showed somewhatfavourable effects (Wiswell, 1996; Sternfeld, 1997; Clapp, 2000; Frey, 2002). The influence of the past 30 years of research can clearly be seen in the significant changes of the American College ofObstetriciansandGynaecologists (ACOG) guidelines, published in 2003 (Committee on patient education of the ACOG, 2003). These guidelines recommend moderate exercise, 30 minutes or more per day, on most, if not all days of the week for women with low risk pregnancies.</p> <p>1.2     Statement of Problem</p> <p>Pregnancy and delivery are normal physiological processes. During pregnancy and after pregnancy so many physiological and psychological changes occur and sometime mothers are worried and stress regarding these. But exercise does wonder during pregnancy. It helps prepare the mother for child birth by strengthening the muscles and building endurance, and makes getting her body back in shape once the baby’s born much easier. Body releases a hormone called relaxing during pregnancy which loosens the joints in preparation of delivery , so mother need to take care with the choice of exercises and pay attention to technique . It’s important to find exercises that won’t injure her or harm the baby. Ideal exercise gets her heart pumping, keeps her supply, manages weight gain and prepares her muscles for the hand work of labour and delivery without causing undue physical stress for her or her baby.</p> <p>Postnatal period demands a lot a physical and psychological adaptation. While some exercise is very good for a new mother, doing too much too soon can be harmful also. Current medical practice recommends that pregnant women should most assuredly engage in some sort of exercise regimen while pregnant. Exercising during pregnancy is good for the mother. Pregnant women who exercise tend to have reduced risk of obesity, gestational diabetes, and hypertension.</p> <p>One study was conducted on effect of selected antenatal exercise on the nature and outcome of labour in 39 primipara mothers during antenatal period in a selected hospital .An experimental method was used. The study concluded that antenatal exercise taught were effective in terms of outcome of labour in both mother and baby.</p> <p>Another study was conducted, to investigate the effect of an exercise programme, including specific stabilizing exercises, on pain intensity and functional ability in women with pregnancy related low back pain. Randomized method is used. The study concluded that a specific exercise program decreased back pain intensity and increased functional ability during pregnancy.</p> <p>The researcher from taking knowledge from experts realized that the knowledge regarding antenatal and postnatal exercise is very important for antenatal mothers and their health. So, the need for this study to evaluate knowledge of the effect of regular pelvic floor exercises on maternal health among women of reproductive age.</p> <p>1.3     Research Objectives</p> <p>The general objective of this study is to evaluate the knowledge of the effect of regular pelvic floor exercises on maternal health among women of reproductive age. The following specific objectives were formulated for the study;</p> <p>1.    To investigate the level of women’s knowledge on the effect of pelvic floor exercises on maternal healthof women of reproductive age in Benue State</p> <p>2.    To analyse women’s views and perception of the effects of pelvic floor exerciseson their maternal health in Benue State</p> <p>3.    To assess the positive and negative effects of pelvic floor exercises on women’s maternal health in Benue State</p> <p>4.    To assess the practice level of exercises by women of reproductive age in Benue State in a bid to increase maternal health.</p> <p>1.4     Research Questions</p> <p>The following research questions were formed from the objectives of the study.</p> <p>1.    What is the level of women’s knowledge on the effect of pelvic floor exercises on maternal healthamong women of reproductive age in Benue State?</p> <p>2.    What are women’s views and perception of the effects of pelvic floor exerciseson their maternal health in Benue State?</p> <p>3.    What are the positive and negative effects of pelvic floor exercises on women’s maternal health in Benue State?</p> <p>4.    Are the women of reproductive age improving maternal health using exercises (pelvic floor exercises) in Benue State?</p> <p>1.5     Significance of the Study</p> <p>The outcome of this study would be significant to women of child-bearing age in Benue State and Nigeria in general in the following ways:</p> <p>1.    The findings of this study would provide information on the care of maternal health of women of reproductive age through regular exercises (pelvic floor exercises in this case).</p> <p>2.    The findings of this study would help policy makers and the health sector to understand problems militating against maternal health among women of child-bearing age in Benue State and provide a way forward via regular exercises.</p> <p>3.    It would provide a basis for further research to other interested researchers. Also, the findings of this study would contribute to existing knowledge on the effect of regular pelvic floor exercises on maternal health of women of reproductive age; knowledge and awareness level.</p> <p>1.6     Basic Assumptions</p> <p>This study was based on the following assumptions:</p> <p>1.    Adequate and regular exercises are necessary to protect and promote the maternal health of women of reproductive health.</p> <p>2.    Place of residence can constitute a strong barrier to practice of exercises and related activities among women of reproductive age.</p> <p>3.    Level of education and knowledge can constitute a strong predictor of exercise practice for maternal health among women of reproductive age.</p> <p>4.    The attitude and perceptions of women of reproductive age in Benue State can affect their practice and proper information on exercise for maternal health.</p> <p>1.7     Scope of Study</p> <p>The study was focused on the knowledge of the effect of regular pelvic floor exercises on maternal health among women of reproductive age in Nigeria using Benue State as a case study.</p> <p>1.8     Delimitation and Limitation of the Study</p> <p>Delimitation</p> <p>This study was delimited to the knowledge of the effect of regular pelvic floor exercises on maternal health among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in six Local Government Areas selected from the three Senatorial Zones in Benue State. They include Katsina-Ala, Vandeikya (Zone A); Gboko, Makurdi (Zone B), and Ogbadibo, Otukpo (Zone C). Specifically, only women of reproductive age attending antenatal and postnatal clinic at the General Hospitals in the selected Local Government Areas were involved in the study.</p> <p>Limitation</p> <p>Uncooperative attitude of some of the respondents constituted a limitation in this study as some of the women of reproductive age did not return their questionnaire. The researcher only made do with responses of the respondents whose questionnaire were correctly completed and returned.</p> <p>1.9     Definition of Terms</p> <p>Maternal Health:Maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. While motherhood is often a positive and fulfilling experience, for too many women it is associated with suffering, ill-health and even death.</p> <p>Pelvic Floor Exercises:Pelvic floor exercises strengthen the muscles around the bladder, sexual organs, and back passage.Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles can help stop incontinence, treat prolapse, and make sexual activities better.Both men and women can benefit from doing pelvic floor exercises.</p>\n\n KNOWLEDGE OF THE EFFECT OF REGULAR PELVIC FLOOR EXERCISES ON MATERNAL HEALTH AMONG WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  KNOWLEDGE OF THE EFFECT OF REGULAR PELVIC FLOOR EXERCISES ON MATERNAL HEALTH AMONG WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>The study tittled Psychoactive Substance Use Among Young People was designed to determine prevalence and patterns of Psychoactive Substance use among young people in Nigeria.

A significant number of untimely deaths and accidents have been linked to the activities of persons under the influence of one psychoactive drug or the other (Shelly, 2010).</p> <p>Drug abuse is viewed by different authorities in various forms. Neeraja (2011) defined substance abuse as the dependence on a drug or other chemical substances leading to the effect that are detrimental to the individual’s physical and mental health or the welfare of others. According to Smelzer, Bare, Hinkle, and Cheever (2008) substance abuse is a maladaptive pattern of drug use that causes physical and emotional harm with the potential for disruption of daily life. From these definitions, it can be deduced that substance abuse is the misuse of one or more drugs which could be prescribed by a health practitioner with the intention to alter the way one feels, thinks or behaves and it is associated with consequences which include physical and emotional harm to the person.</p> <p>The African Symposium (2010) viewed substance abuse as the improper use or application of drugs by a person without proper knowledge of the drugs and without due prescription from a qualified medical practitioner. This definition focuses on psychoactive drugs. All drugs can be abused to an extent that it turns into addiction when the drug user is unable to stop the use of the drugs despite the harmful effects on the user’s social, personal and economic lives. The problem of substance abuse is so grave that though it was originally conceived as the problem of a ‘select few’, it has extended beyond the usual characteristics of abusers being males, adults and urban based people, to now include females, youngsters and rural dwellers (Rocha, 2009). These abusers erroneously believe that drugs enhance their performance, put them in good mood etc. The accompanying problems of this act constitute a major threat to the wellbeing of the society (Ajala, 2009).</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background to the Study</p> <p>Psychoactive Substance use and dependence cause a significant burden to the individuals and societies throughout the world. The World Health Report (2010) indicated that 8.9% of the total burden of disease comes from the use of psychoactive substances. The report showed that tobacco accounted for 4.1%, alcohol 4%, and illicit drugs 0.8% of the burden of disease in 2010. Much of the burden attributable to substance use and dependence is the result of a wide variety of health and social problems. Data from the (World Health Organization, 2011) show large-scale seizures of cocaine, heroin, cannabis and amphetamine-type stimulants in different parts of the world. Availability of cocaine, heroin and cannabis depends on the level of cultivation in source countries and on the success or failure of trafficking organizations. However, even with increased levels of law enforcement activities, there always seems to be enough available to users. According to (UNODC, 2011) estimates show that about 200 million people make illicit use of one type of illicit substance or another.</p> <p>Psychoactive substance use is a social problem that has spread and increased rapidly in  educational institutions especially among secondary school students (Neeraja, 2011).  This social problem is considered an issue of serious concern as it adversely affects the lives and performance of students involved as well as the harmonious functioning of the entire structure of the society. Use of psychoactive drugs and other associated problems are inimical to the survival and effective their performance, put them in good mood etc. The accompanying problems of this act constitute a major threat to the wellbeing of the society (Ajala, 2009).</p>\n\nPSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCE USE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCE USE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Hypertension is an important public health challenge at Auchi Nigeria. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological survey was to determine hypertensive patients’ knowledge, perceptions, attitudes and life-style practices so as to optimize their health and treatment needs. We examined a cohort of 108 randomly selected hypertensive by means of a self-structured questionnaire and a detailed interview. Analysis was by statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) and chi- square was used for significance tests at 0.05 level. More males 60 (55.6%) than females 48 (44.4%) were assessed. Their age range was 35 – 80 years (mean = 59.05 ± 9.06 years), the modal age group was 56 – 60 years (24.1%). Sixty-six respondents (61%) knew hypertension to be high blood pressure (BP), 22 (20%) thought it meant excessive thinking and worrying while 57 (53%) claimed it was hereditary. Forty-three (40%) felt it was caused by malevolent spirits, 32 (30%) believed it was caused by bad food or poisoning. A few (18%) knew some risk factors. Symptoms attributed to hypertensionwere headache, restlessness, palpitation, excessive pulsation of the superficial temporal artery and “internal heat”, but 80 (74%) attested to its correct diagnosis by BP measurement. Although 98 (90.7%) felt the disease indicated serious morbidity, only 36 (33.3%) were adherent with treatment and fewer practiced life-style modification. Thirty-two (30%) knew at least one antihypertensive drug they use. Psychosocial factors like depression and anxiety fear of addiction and intolerable drug adverse effects impacted negatively on patients’ attitude to treatment. We conclude that patients’ knowledge of hypertensionin Auchi is low and their attitudes to treatment negative. Patient education, motivation and public enlightenment are imperative.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background of Study</strong></p> <p>Hypertension remains a major global public health challenge that has been identified as the leading risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Kearney, Whelton, Reynolds, Muntner, Whelton&amp; He, 2004). It increases hardening of the arteries, thus predisposing individuals to heart diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, stroke, heart failure and kidney failure. Hypertension is the commonest non-communicable disease in the world and all races are affected with variable prevalence. Castelli (2004) explained that its prevalence is on the increase in developing countries where adoption of western lifestyle and stress of urbanization, both of which are expected to increase morbidity associated with unhealthy lifestyle are not on the decline. Andreoli, Carpenter, Grigs and Loscalzo (2004) were of the opinion that hypertension produces disruptions in health, disability and death in the adult population worldwide. Ejike, Ezeanyika and Ugwu (2010) stated that hypertension causes one in every eight deaths worldwide, making it the third leading killer disease in the world. They also estimated that about one billion adults, the world over, had hypertension in the year 2010 and the number is expected to rise to 1.56 billion in the year 2025 if positive intervention programme is not made. Aram, George, Henry, Williams, Lee, and Joseph (2003) indicated that fifty million Americans have high blood pressure, approximately one in three adults.</p> <p>In United States of America, approximately twenty eight (28) to thirty one per cent of adults have hypertension (Fields, Burt &amp; Cutler (2004). Of this population, 90 to 95 per cent have primary hypertension (high blood pressure related to unidentified cause). The remaining five to tenper cent of this group have secondary hypertension (high blood pressure related toidentified cause). In China, almost 130 million people aged 35-74 years are estimated to be hypertensive(Camel &amp;Delene, 2006). Similarly in Ghana, studies revealed a hypertension prevalence of forty per cent among rural dwellers and eight per cent to thirteen per cent in the urban areas. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is the most rapidly rising cardiovascular disease and affecting over 20 million people (Kadiri, 2005). He also stated that in Nigeria, hypertension is the commonest non-communicable disease with over 4.3 million Nigerians above the age of fifteen years classified as being hypertensive.</p> <p>Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure is the persistent blood pressure in the arteries above ninety millimetres of mercury (mmHg) between the heart beats (diastolic) or over 140 millimetres of mercury (mmHg) at the beats (systolic) (Aquilla, 2008). According to Hyman and Parlik (2003), hypertension is the persistent raised levels of blood pressure in which the systolic pressure is above 140 mmHg and diastolic pressure above 90 mmHg. The normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mmHg; blood pressure between 120/80 and 139/89 is called ‘Pre-hypertension, and a pressure of 140/90 or above is considered high (abnormal) blood pressure. According to Expert Committee on Non-Communicable Diseases (1993), blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg is considered normal for a 30 year old person, while blood pressure of 140 mmHg is considered high for such a person. Similarly, blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg is considered normal for a 60-year old person, while blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg is high for such a person. Hypertension is sometimes called “the silent killer” because people who have it are often symptom-free. In this study, hypertension is perceived as a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg among adults. The top number which is the systolic pressure corresponds to the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts and pumps blood forward into the arteries. The bottom number which is the diastolic pressure represents the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes after contraction. The diastolic pressure reflects the lowest pressure to which the arteries are exposed. Blood pressure is normally measured at the brachial artery with a sphygmomanometer (pressure cuff) in millimeters of mercury (mmhg) and given as systolic over diastolic pressure. Hypertension is classified into two namely; primary and secondary hypertension.</p> <p>According to Stanler (2004), hypertension is categorized into primary and secondary hypertension. Primary hypertension has an unknown cause and accounts for ninety per cent to ninety five per cent of all hypertension cases (Chris, 2009). This type of hypertension is strongly associated with lifestyle. Usually, the patients do not have many signs and symptoms but may experience frequent headache, tiredness, dizziness or nose bleeds. Although the cause is not known, obesity, smoking, alcohol, diet and heredity play a role in essential or primary hypertension.</p> <p>Secondary hypertension has a known cause and accounts for five per cent to ten per cent of all hypertension cases. Chris (2009) maintained that the most common cause of secondaryhypertension is an abnormality in the arteries supplying blood to the kidneys. Other causes include airway obstruction during sleep, stress, diseases and tumors of the adrenal glands, lifestyle, spinal cord injury, hormone abnormalities (oral contraceptive estrogen replacement), thyroid disease, toxemia of pregnancy, renal problems such as vascular lesion of renal arteries, diabetic neuropathy, pains as well as anxiety and hypoglycemia. There are some factors which predispose adults to hypertension.</p> <p>The risk factors of hypertension are genetic factor which can be inherited from parents, age which when the body does not retain the amount of elasticity as it used to in the early years of life, obesity which is an increase in weight of over ten per cent above normal body index due to generalized deposition of fat in the body, excessive salt intake which increases blood pressure, stress which produces chemical substances that cause generalized vasoconstriction, oral contraceptive which contains estrogen that causes salt retention that increases the volume of blood, sedentary lifestyle which has the tendency of increasing body weight and directly raises blood pressure, elevated levels of plasma lipids particularly cholesterol, excessive alcohol consumption which increases blood pressure and tobacco use (cigarette smoking) that contains nicotine which causes constriction of the blood vessels.</p> <p>The signs and symptoms of hypertension recognized by Thatch and Schultz (2004) include occipital headache, dizziness, restlessness, failing vision, shortness of breath, and rapid increased heartbeat. Adults should possess the knowledge of risk factors in order to prevent hypertension. This will help them recognize and prevent or treat hypertension when these signs occur.</p> <p>Knowledge is used to cover such related terms as facts, information, understanding, awareness, insight, wisdom, reasons, comprehension, meaning, concept and experience (Albelum, 1987). It is an organized body of knowledge shared by people. Nnachi (2007) conceptualized knowledge as the ability to understand or comprehend phenomena, the acquisition of positive information by the exercise of some capacity which humans presumably have in common. Health knowledge could be said to mean putting into reality the art of mobilization of resources by an individual, intellectually, physically and emotionally. Hamburg and Russell (2000) opined that health knowledge and understanding of related factors have a favourable effect on quality of overall well-being. They went further to state that one’s exposure to proper health knowledge will influence positively the person’s health attitude and practice, and thus, one could rightly say that knowledge is the key to optimum well-being. Umaru (2003) pointed out that knowledge comes about as a result of learning through cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains. In this study, knowledge is referred to as all understanding and familiarity gained by learning and experience that will enable adults to recognize risk factors as well as recognizing and use of preventive measures of hypertension. Knowledge of hypertension is an important prerequisite for an individual to implement desirable behavioural practices towards its prevention. Lack of suchknowledge will lead to aggravated health problems. Adults should therefore, possess adequate knowledge of risk factors of hypertension in order to prevent the disease.</p> <p>Risk factors are defined by Lothar, Gottfried and Heide (2011) as individual characteristics which affect the person’s chances of developing a particular disease or group of diseases within a defined future time period. According to Lucas and Gilles (2003), risk factor is anything that has been identified as increasing an individual’s chances of getting a disease or developing a condition. They will be considered to be at risk of developing hypertension, those with habits or characteristics which increase the likelihood of developing hypertension. Risk factors in this study, refers to the characteristics, conditions or behaviors such as excess salt intake and smoking which increase the probability of hypertension to occur. When risk factors are related to hypertension, they are known as risk factors of hypertension. Risk factors of hypertension are of two types: those ones that can be changed and those that cannot be changed. The risk factors that can be changed are obesity, excess salt intake, smoking, environmental stress, oral contraceptives, sedentary lifestyle, elevated levels of plasma lipids and unregulated secretion of aldosterone. Risk factors that cannot be changed are genetic predisposition, age and gender. Adults should have adequate knowledge of the risk factors to be able to prevent hypertension.</p> <p>Preventive measures are interventions directed to avert the emergence of specific disease, reducing their incidence and prevalence in population. Starfield, Hyde, and Gervas (2007) defined preventive measures as all measures that limit the progression of a disease at any stage of its course. In this study, preventive measures is referred to as all the activities whose primary purpose is to promote, restore and maintain health, and those practices which are directed towards preventing hypertension among adults. There are two types of preventive measures; primary and secondary. Primary prevention is the intervention that averts the occurrence of a disease or actions taken prior to the onset of disease which removes the possibility that a disease will occur. It signifies intervention in the pre-pathogenesis phase of a disease or health problem. It may be accomplished by measures designed to promote general health and well-being, and quality of life of adults (health promotion) or by specific protective measures (specific protection). Secondary prevention is action which slows the progression of a disease at its incipient stage and prevents complication. Salama (2011) opined that the specific intervention in secondary prevention is early detection of hypertension which involves screening test. It attempts to arrest the disease process, restore health by seeking out unrecognized disease and treating it before irreversible pathological changes take place especially among adults.</p> <p>Adulthood is the longest period of a man’s life. Hornby (2001) defined an adult as a person who has grown to full size or strength, intellectually and emotionally mature, and legally a person old enough to vote or marry. Ebiringa and Nwagbo (1997) defined an adult as someone who has reached the age of maturity, who covers his nakedness, who lives on his own, who can answer avillage call and who is taxable. They went further to state that an adult is someone who has developed a sense of perspective, more balanced in thinking, and is responsible for his own actions and that of others. Samuel (2006) defined adulthood as the period whereby an individual has acquired all the adolescent developmental tasks, reached accepted age bracket and is responsible for his actions without parental or social restrictions. Samuel (2006) also categorized adults into three stages; young adulthood (21- 40), middle adulthood (41-65) and older adulthood (65 years and above). Young adulthood which commences at around 21 to 40 years is the period when full physical fitness is generally experienced. It is a stage of critical transition. Adults in this age group are filled with vitality and enthusiasm. Middle adults falls within the ages of 41 to 65 years which is a period of pleasant plateau (Ejifugha, 2003). Adults within this group are at a stage of physical and psychological development. Adults in this group tend to eat too much and may fail to take regular exercise. Many are overweight and actually obese. Psychological stress causes adults in this group to smoke, drink and abuse drugs. Older adults are between the ages of 65 years and above. The factors in ageing set in to influence the individual gradually which may cause cardiovascular diseases like hypertension. In this study, an adult is referred to as an individual who has reached the age of maturity and falls within the age bracket of thirty five years and above.</p> <p>There are many variables that may impinge on knowledge of hypertension. Literature shows that studies on knowledge of hypertension examined socio-demographic factors of age, race, level of education, parity, gender, income, location, occupation and marital status (Hamdan, Saeed, Kutbi, Choudhry&amp;Nooh, 2010). However the present study is concerned with demographic factors of age, gender, location, and level of education.</p> <p>Age has been identified as a strong factor that that can limit the ability of adults to acquire adequate knowledge of hypertension. Age determines growth, development, maturity and death. Age brings about maturity and maturity puts one in a position to rationalize, concretize, accept or reject concept, information, habit, attitude and practice (Ejifugha, 2003). It is believed that the more one add years to life, the more knowledge he acquires and the more exposed to situations that can cause health problems including hypertension. Adults because of their exposure and experience must have come to understand the concept of hypertension, signs and symptoms, risk factors and preventive measures of hypertension and because of lack of exposure or experience may not adequately acquire the knowledge of diseases (Bagunyoke, 2003) such as hypertension.</p> <p>Gender has influence on knowledge of hypertension. Akinkugbe (2003) observed that women have more hypertension than men. However, after menopause, the incidence of hypertension due to arteriosclerosis in women rapidly increases than in men and even become higher in old age. From adolescence through 54 years, men have a much greater risk of developing hypertension compared with women of the same age. The reverse is the case after 54 years.</p> <p>Women then are seen to have more incidence of hypertension due to the disappearance of female stronger hormone that provides protective effect against hypertension.</p> <p>Location is an environmental factor which may limit the ability of adults to seek adequate knowledge of hypertension. Hamdan, Saeed, Kutbi, Choudhry and Nooh (2010) indicated that hypertension was significantly associated with age, gender, geographical location. Similarly, Lech and Piotr (2009), stated that hypertension was more frequently diagnosed among rural than urban adults. The adults in urban areas have more opportunities and access to attend seminars, health talks, workshops and medical check ups on hypertension (accessibility to health information). Unfortunately, those in the rural areas may not have such opportunities as such programmes may not exist in the rural areas. These programmes are in most cases accessible to a smaller privileged group in the society, who are living in well-developed towns, at the expense of greater majority who wallow up in diseases and ignorance in rural areas.</p> <p>Studies have indicated that level of education is associated with knowledge, which may include the risk factors and preventive measures of hypertension. According to Hamdan, Saeed, Kutbi, Choudhry and Nooh (2010) observed that adults who were more knowledgeable adopted positive lifestyles, while the iliterate adults adopted unhealthy lifestyles. The higher the educational attainment, the higher the acquisition of knowledge, attitude and behaviour, while the lower the level of education, the lower increase in knowing risk factors and prevention measures of hypertension. Similarly, Myo, Thaworn, Janthila, Nongluk ,Suchart , Wilawan , Phatchanan , Puangpet, Nara , and Apiradee (2012) reported that those with primary school education were likely to be aware of hypertension than those who did not have primary school education. The variables of age, gender, location and level of education were examined in the study. Knowledge of hypertension by adults will surely influence their health behaviour. Therefore, some behaviour change theories will be applied to explain knowledge of hypertension.</p> <p>This study was anchored on three theories. These are the critical knowledge theory, health belief model, theory of reasoned action. According to Diagnam (1992), Critical knowledge theory states that when an individual is ignorant or holds a belief about a health matter, the health educator attempts to change or ascertain the individual’s level of knowledge towards the health matter or concept through questioning the respondent.</p> <p>The health belief model has it's focus on explaining and predicting preventive health behaviour by focusing on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals (Rosenstock, Strecher and Beckar, 1999). This is useful because the model examined the perceptions, beliefs and behaviours of adults and to provide information on the lifestyle practices related to preventing hypertension. Adults who believe that certain lifestyles such as excess salt intake and inactivity can predispose them to hypertension will achieve good health by avoiding such lifestyles.</p> <p>Theory of reasoned action show how attitude impacts on behaviours. It states that a person’s attitude towards a particular behaviour is influenced by belief outcome of the behavior. Adults who develop positive attitude towards high salt intake, excess alcohol and inactivity consumption are likely going to develop hypertension; conversely, those who have negative attitude may not get hypertension. The study was carried out in Auchi in Edo State.</p> <p>Owerri senatorial zone is in Imo state located in the South Eastern part of Nigeria. The senatorial zone covers around 1,700sqkm and shares common boundaries with Abia State by the east, and Rivers State by the south. It also shares common boundaries with OhajiEgbema, Orlu, Obowo, Ihitte-Uboma, and Mbano local government areas all of which are in Orlu and Okigwe zones of Imo State. There are nine local government areas which make up Owerri Senatorial Zone (see Appendix A). The inhabitants are engaged in agriculture, businesses and civil service works. These activities occupy much of their time with little or no time left for them to have rest and take care of their health, and they undergo lots of stress which can lead to hypertension. Furthermore, there are places which serve as tourist attractions in the zone such as Mbari exhibition centre, Imo Concorde hotel and lots of hotels and guest houses where people come for relaxation. These places expose adults to excessive alcohol consumption. Owerri Municipal which is the major urban area is cosmopolitan being the Imo State Capital and commercial nerve centre. These activities made the location to qualify for the study.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Hypertension has been shown to have series of consequences, and adequate knowledge of risk factors can help in the prevention of hypertension. Therefore, adults in Owerri Senatorial Zone need to have the knowledge of hypertension to reduce the prevalence of hypertension disease, improve health and optimum well-being. But it is likely that adults in the area may or may not have adequate knowledge of hypertension. Evidence regarding the knowledge of hypertension does not seem to exist. Therefore, this study on knowledge of hypertension becomes necessary.</p> <p>Regrettably, most adults due to ignorance of risk factors and preventive measures of hypertension engage in unhealthy lifestyles such as excessive consumption of alcohol, sedentary lifestyle, excess consumption of sodium intake, tobacco and cigarette smoking, obesity, reduced intake of fruits and vegetables, stress and consumption of foods rich in cholesterol. These unhealthy lifestyle practices have increased the prevalence of hypertension in the world including Nigeria, which culminates into high cases of deaths. Hypertension is one of the problems affecting especially a great portion of the adult population and currently causes one in every eight deaths worldwide, making it the third leading killer disease in the world. Ejike, Ezeanyika and Ugwu (2010) estimated that about one billion adults had hypertension in the year 2010, and the number is expected to rise to 1.56 billion in the year 2025. In addition, hypertension is the commonest non-communicable disease in Nigeria with over 4.3 million Nigerians classified as being hypertensive. In Nigeria, many people lose their lives to hypertension. This is not an acceptable situation, considering the fact that hypertension is preventable and manageable to reduce its impact on the health and lives of people in Nigeria.</p> <p>However, some studies have been conducted on the knowledge of hypertension in many parts of the world including Nigeria. The literature reviewed showed that related studies were conducted among pregnant women, workers in banking industry, hypertensive patients, primary care patients, urban elderly and in rural communities, and in different countries. Incidentally, there are no studies, to the best knowledge of the researcher that have been carried out in Auchi in Edo State to determine the level of knowledge of hypertension among adults. In view of the above, the need arose to determine if adults in Auchi in Edo State have adequate knowledge of hypertension. This was the task of the present study.</p> <p>Despite effective therapies and lifestyle interventions, optimal prevention of hypertension remains very health challenge to health professionals especially in most developing countries like Nigeria. Kadiri (2005) noted that 4.3 million Nigerians are suffering from this silent killer disease called hypertension. The inability to adequately prevent or manage hypertension in Nigeria can be attributed to inadequate knowledge of hypertension. Thus reaching the healthy people vision 2020 objective may be difficult if necessary actions are not taken to prevent this disease. If health promotion programmes are to be appropriate and effective, adults’ knowledge of hypertension need to be identified. Therefore, the researcher was motivated to determine the level of knowledge of hypertension possessed by adults in Auchi in Edo State. This became necessary against the backdrop that identification of gaps in adults’ knowledge of hypertension is capable of aiding the development of adequate information to enhance the knowledgeand perception of hypertension and its management among clients/patients.Therefore, as part of a quality assessment to improve the management outcome of hypertensive patients, we evaluated by means of a descriptive, cross-sectional qualitative phenomenological survey, hypertensive patients’ knowledge, perception, attitudes and life- style practices in Auchi, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Purpose of Study</strong></p> <p>The general purpose of this research work is to assess the knowledge and perception of hypertension and its management among patients.

The study may help to develop a positive regard towards hypertension. The ministry of health may benefit from the study by discovering a gap in knowledge of the population, and emphasize strategies to teach the adult population on how to prevent the risk factors. It may also be useful to other researchers to carry out this study in areas where disease prevention measures and health promotion are needed with regards to hypertension.</p> <p>Answering the research questions associated with the research project offers insight into managing hypertension by revealing an understanding of individual’s health related knowledge, perceptions and behaviours.</p> <p><strong>1.6       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study covered all the local government areas in Auchi in Edo State. The study was restricted to adults between the ages of fifty years and above, and who were found within the urban and rural areas. The study was concerned with determining the level of knowledge and perception of hypertension and its management among patients. This consisted of the concept of hypertension, signs and symptoms, risk factors and preventive measures of hypertension. The demographic factors of age, gender, location and level of education as they relate to knowledge of hypertension were all explained.</p> <p><strong>1.7       Limitation of Study</strong></p> <p>The researcher faced a number of restraints in the course of carrying out this research project. They include; time constraints, financial constraints, uncooperative attitude of some of the respondents.

Furthermore, it is estimated that one third of all maternal deaths globally occur in just two countries, namely India and Nigeria (Mboho et al 2013). According to UNFPA (2012), in 2010, India was accountable for about 20% of global maternal deaths (56,000) and Nigeria, 14% (40,000). Meanwhile, disease, deformity and death are terms usually employed to describe the experiences of a vast majority of sub-Saharan African women during pregnancy and birthing (Harrison, 2001; Brookman-Amissah and Moyo, 2004; WHO, 2004a). Similarly, the majority of African women are often viewed as being at high risk of infections, injury and death during pregnancy and the periods surrounding it (Izugbara and Ukwayi, 2007). In recent time women in Nigeria have expressed worries about choices of childbirth especially the issues surrounding vaginal birth. The joy of every woman is to deliver her baby normally. Some decades ago the most available or preferred option for most women was vaginal birth. Some of the women had their babies at home with traditional birth attendants but quite often with difficult labour resulting from obstruction and the women died before any meaningful interventions. Today, however, many babies have been delivered successfully through caesarean section. This success story in not without criticism. Among women in the developing countries, caesarean section is still being perceived as a ‘curse’ of an unfaithful woman (Adeoye and Kalu 2011). The authors further assert that caesarean section is seen among weak women. In addition, caesarean section is surrounded with suspicion, aversion, misconception, fear, guilt, misery and anger among the women of South Western Nigeria (Adeoye and Kalu 2011). Furthermore, in most sub-Saharan African countries including Nigeria, caesarean section is being accepted reluctantly even in the face of obvious clinical indication (Adeoye and Kalu 2011). Despite the causes of maternal mortality often obstetric in origin, underlying cultural factors and beliefs also affect access to and use of health facilities and thus contribute to avoidable maternal deaths (Mboho et al 2013). Several studies have indicated how local beliefs and practices impact general health and childbearing. Some of these beliefs have been identified as contributing to the delays in accessing appropriate skilled help when complications arise in labour (Okafor 2000) It is necessary to note that the issue of vaginal birth is not only peculiar to developing countries but also in some developed countries. Women still choose vaginal birth after having caesarean section even in the case of post dates slated for elective caesarean section (Clift-Mathews 2010). The author further highlighted the fact that women desperately wished to go into labour before their appointment dates because not giving birth vaginally was a sign of ‘failure’. In addition; vaginal birth is something a number of women look upon as a rite of passage (Clift-Mathews 2010) Obstetrics in modern America is a contentious subject in general (Ecker 2013). Usually childbirth and action surrounding it whether medical or otherwise normally evoke strong emotions where discussion is often framed ideologically as a matter of nature versus technology. Hence the issue of caesarean section in particular is much contested issue (Ecker 2013). Even so, caesarean section rates are on the increase as evident in a number of western countries such as the United States of America and United Kingdom (McAra-Couper, Jones and Smythe 2010). In 1985, following the increasing disparity rate among nations in the number of caesarean births, the World Health Organisation (WHO) set out to determine an optimal rate of 15 percent as ideal. The postulated 15 percent by WHO would optimally prevent childbirth injuries and deaths. In addition, many women and babies would avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful surgery (Harvard magazine 2013). However, WHO has since modified this particular recommendation in 2009, stating that ‘the optimum rate is unknown but asserts that both very low and very high rates of caesarean sections can be dangerous’. In other words, the procedure should be done only when it is absolutely necessary. The editorial team of Academic Research International of Harvard Magazine concluded that there is need for a balance to be reached, that is, women should be allowed to have normal vaginal deliveries with as little intervention as possible. However, at the same time, the families, obstetricians will be ready to address any unexpected emergencies.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Traditionally, Nigerian women are unwilling to have CS because of the general belief that abdominal delivery is reproductive failure on their part regardless of the feasibility of vaginal birth after CS and the decreasing mortality from Caesarean sections. Imperative to the average pregnant woman irrespective of her level of education and parity therefore is CS. Available reports on knowledge of CS amongst women are mainly from tertiary health facilities situated in cities and in the southern parts of the country while little is known about the perception and acceptance of pregnant women towards Caesarean section in Igbinedion University Teaching Hospital in Edo State.</p> <p><strong>1.3  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <ol><li>To explore the perception and acceptance of pregnant women in Igbinedion University Teaching Hospital, Edo State toward caesarean section.</li> <li>To ascertain what is known about caesarean section and the reasons for dislike by our women.</li> </ol> <ol><li>To explore the perception and acceptance of pregnant women in Igbinedion University Teaching Hospital, Edo State state towards caesarean section.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4  RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the perception and acceptance of pregnant women in Igbinedion University Teaching Hospital, Edo State toward caesarean section?</li> <li>What is known about caesarean section and the reasons for dislike by our women?</li> <li>What is the perception and acceptance of pregnant women in Igbinedion University Teaching Hospital, Edo State towards caesarean section?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The findings from this study would be used in planning strategies towards improving the knowledge, perception and acceptance towards CS in the community in order to possibly reduce the delay in presentation to the health facility when CS is needed, improve utilization of this mode of delivery and limit the avoidable maternal and foetal complications.</p> <p><strong>1.6  SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study focused on the perception and acceptance of pregnant women towards Ceasarean section.

Some women and men will divorce, remarry and decide to have another child; others will bear children (wanted or unwanted) outside of marriage or be motivated to avoid it. The environmental and contextual scenarios are many; the individual trajectories even more diverse. The challenge for educational and health sectors is to meet these changing needs with comprehensive information about pregnancy risks, acceptable contraceptive options, and correct and consistent use. Interventions include countering beliefs in ineffective methods and overcoming unrealistic fears about contraceptive side-effects that adolescents may already have acquired.</p> <p>A sustained service package adapted to the specific and changing needs of individuals and couples and linked with other sexual and reproductive health inputs must be offered.8 The evidence base is by now quite extensive on how to create more user-friendly family planning environments, enhance client-provider interactions and other aspects of quality of care, and involve men as well as women in the discussion of contraceptive choices with respect to ease of use and need for partner cooperation, possible effects on sexual expression (e.g., coitus-dependent or independent methods), safety, efficacy, side-effects, acceptability, accessibility and cost.</p> <p>Guidelines have been established for counseling clients such as unmarried adolescents who need dual protection; couples wanting to use a natural method; couples wishing to postpone their first pregnancy or space subsequent pregnancies; women or men who want to use a method without their partners’ knowledge; postpartum and breastfeeding women; women receiving post-abortion care; women who have had unprotected intercourse (including rape victims); individuals or couples looking for long-acting reversible or permanent methods; and women approaching menopause. The evidence base has also expanded greatly with respect to the medical aspects of contraception for male and female users. Method-specific medical eligibility criteria have been established for women of all reproductive ages who have particular health problems, such as heavy smokers and those with chronic diseases receiving long-term drug treatments (e.g. antihypertensive agents, antiretroviral drugs). Ongoing investigations are assessing the protective and risk factors of particular methods with respect to certain diseases (e.g., breast, cervical or testicular cancers, cardiovascular disease, endometriosis).</p> <p>Family planning is an important preventive measure against maternal and child morbidity and mortality. It is an essential component of primary health care and reproductive health. It plays a major role in reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. It confers important health and development benefits to individuals, families and communities and the nation at large. It helps women to prevent unwanted pregnancies and limit the number of children, thereby enhance reproductive health. By this, it contributes towards achievement of Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Target of the Health for all Policy.13 The MDGs call for 75% reduction in maternal mortality and two-thirds reduction in child mortality between 1990 and 2015. As such effective utilization of family planning services is critical for the attainment of these goals thus improving health and accelerating development across the regions.15Access to family planning also has the potential to control population growth and in the long run reduce green gas house emission with it associated risk.13 Similarly it has been estimated that preventing unwanted pregnancies by the use of family planning would avert a total of 4.6million Disability Adjusted Life Years.16 Despite the importance and benefits of family planning, it has been estimated that about 17% of all married women globally would prefer to avoid pregnancy but are not willing to use any form of family planning.17 As a result, 25% of all pregnancies are unintended particularly in developing region of the world. This results to an estimated 18million abortion taking place each year, thereby contributing to high maternal morbidity and injuries.14,17 Sub-Saharan Africa which is home to only 10% of the world’s women, contributes annually, 12million unwanted or unplanned pregnancies and 40% of all pregnancy related deaths worldwide. The contraceptive prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa is low, estimated at 13%, in spite of the evidence of the pivotal role of family planning, while in Nigeria the estimation is 8.0% with 17% unmet need for family planning. This greatly contributes to the high rate of unintended pregnancies leading to induced abortion with its consequent complications. Despite the fact that Nigeria constitutes only 2% of the world’s population, it has being shown to account for 10% of the world’s maternal deaths. There is relatively high fertility rate in suburban and rural Nigeria despite the efforts of government and other non-governmental family planning services providers. Even though the fertility rate is high, acceptance and utilization of modern family planning methods has been low due to various reasons. In Africa, provision of family planning services is hindered by poverty, poor co-ordination of the programme and dwindling donor funding. Additionally, traditional beliefs favouring high fertility, religious barriers, fear of side effect and lack of male involvement have contributed significantly in weakening family planning interventions among women.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>According to NDHS 2013, only 15 percent of currently married women in Nigeria are using a contraceptive method, indicating only a two percentage point increase from the 2003 NDHS. The majority of contraceptive users rely on a modern method (10 percent of currently married women), and 5 percent use traditional methods. Among the modern methods, injectables (3 percent), male condoms (2 percent), and the pill (2 percent) are the most common methods being used. The practice of all other modern methods is far less (under 1 percent). Interestingly, 3 percent use withdrawal as a method of contraception.</p> <p>The use of contraceptives varies by women’s background characteristics. The proportion of currently married women who are currently using any method of contraception rises with age from only 2 percent among women age 15-19 to 22 percent among age 40-44. The use of contraception then decreases among women who are age 45 and older. Among modern methods, use of condoms is more popular among women under age 35, while injectables are more popular among women age 35-44. Currently married women in urban areas are considerably more likely to use any method of contraception (27 percent) than women in rural areas (9 percent). Use is higher in urban than in rural areas for each of these methods. Contraceptive use among currently married women aged between 15 to 49 years in North West Nigeria is 4.3% while that of North East and North Central are 3.2% and 15.6% respectively. Use is higher in Southern Nigeria with South East (29.3%), South South (28.1%) and South West (38.0%). Gross disparities occur among the six (6) geopolitical zones as well as among states. Kano State has contraceptive use of 0.6% (lowest in the North) with only 0.5% using any modern method (pill- 0.2%, IUD- 0.2%, injectables- 0.1% while 0.0% use implants, male condom, LAM, standard days methods and female sterilization).</p> <p>There is a direct relationship between the outcome of pregnancy and family planning. The demographic transition theory states that only when fetal, infant, and child mortality rates are reduced it is likely that a family will accept family planning.29 Thus, improvement of maternal and child health services is a prerequisite for family planning. As a result, child spacing is a critical factor which influences the outcome of pregnancy. When women adhere to the World Health Organization recommended minimum inter-birth interval of 33 months between two consecutive live births, the incidence of prematurity reduces. Thus, prevention of rapid series of many pregnancies provides a greater possibility of reducing maternal, fetal, infant, and childhood mortality.30 In general, child spacing provides greater opportunities for nurturing the individual child thereby providing the possibility of preventing complications such as gastrointestinal infections and malnutrition during infancy and early childhood.30 Family planning may also improve the quality of life and raise the standard of living by decreasing the number of dependents requiring intensive personal care, education, food, shelter, and clothing, among others. Nevertheless, where family planning services may be available, its use may be limited due to a number of factors such as low literacy levels, socio-cultural beliefs favoring large families, and unavailability of services due to dysfunctional health services.31 Along with these dynamics in maternal care and contraceptive use patterns, there has been less progress in improving infant and child survival and primary care utilization. As of 2008, the North West and North East regions were the regions with the highest proportions of children 12-23 months who had never been vaccinated, 48.7% and 33.9%, respectively, and fewer than 15.0% had a vaccination card. Vaccination coverage rates in the four northern states of Zamfara, Katsina, Jigawa, and Yobe were all 5.4% and below.27 When their young children became sick with pneumonia, malaria or diarrhea, under half of all sick children were taken to a health facility for treatment. Infant mortality rate was 139 deaths per 1,000 births in the North West region and 126 deaths per 1,000 live births in the North East region, while under five mortality rate was 217 and 222 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively. Hence, this study on factors mitigating against family planning amongst women in rural communities a case study of Obibe Ezena community, Owerri North, Imo state.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Research Objectives</strong></p> <p>To assess the factors mitigating against family planning amongst women in rural communities a case study of Obibe Ezena community, Owerri North, Imo state, Nigeria, the following specific objectives were formulated;</p> <p>    To determine the level of knowledge of family planning among women of child-bearing age.</p> <p>    To determine the attitudes of rural women of child-bearing age towards family planning.</p> <p>    To determine the level of use of family planning products and services among rural women of child-bearing age.</p> <p>    To determine the factors associated with utilization of family planning services among women of child-bearing age.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>    What is the level of knowledge of family planning among women of child-bearing age in Obibe Ezena community, Owerri North, Imo state.?</p> <p>    What are the attitudes of rural women of child-bearing age towards family planning?</p> <p>    What is the level of use of family planning products/methods and services among rural women of child-bearing age?</p> <p>    What are the factors associated with utilization of family planning services among rural women of child-bearing age?</p> <p><strong>1.5     Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>The study covered women of child bearing age (15-49 years) residing in Obibe Ezena community, Owerri North, Imo state  during the period of 6 months. It determined the knowledge, attitude and factors mitigating against family planning services as well as assessed the determinants of utilization of family planning services.</p> <p><strong>1.6     Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>High fertility rate and inadequate spacing between births, can lead to high maternal and infant mortality. An estimated 600 000 maternal deaths occur worldwide each year; the vast majority of these take place in developing countries. WHO estimates that 13% of these deaths are due to unsafe abortion. Worldwide, where approximately 50 million women resort to induced abortion, frequently results in high maternal morbidity and mortality. Thus, family planning and spacing among births are one of the methods to avoid these deaths. Promotion of family planning and contraceptive use is highly adopted by the international community as one of the strategy to reduce the maternal mortality and to reach the Millennium Development Goals. Africa characterized by high rate of lack to contraceptive access reaching 57% and this lack lead to unwanted pregnancies, increased demand to abortion and death related to unsafe abortion.37</p> <p>In Nigeria, there is unaccepted high maternal mortality. Moreover, legally, politically and culturally access to abortion create internal dispute, therefore effective contraceptive programming should be the current and future approach to reduce the risk and unwanted pregnancies. Few published data exist concerning use of family planning services in Nigeria especially northern part where we have recently observed high maternal morbidity and mortality in this setting. This study will educate the public as well as provide literature on the subject matter.</p>\n\nFACTORS MILITATING AGAINST FAMILY PLANNING AMONGST WOMEN IN RURAL COMMUNITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS MILITATING AGAINST FAMILY PLANNING AMONGST WOMEN IN RURAL COMMUNITIES", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background of Study</strong></p> <p>Lassa fever is one of the diseases for which weekly epidemiological reporting to the health authorities is being done in Nigeria. A rapidly changing epidemiological pattern had been reported over the years (Ogbu, Ajuluchukwu and Uneke, 2007). It causes mortality and morbidity where outbreaks occur worldwide including Nigeria where it was first identified in 1969.</p> <p>Lassa fever is caused by a single stranded RNA virus (Healing and Gopal, 2001; Johnson et al.,1987). The main feature of this fatal infection is impaired or delayed cellular immunity leading to fulminant viraemia, usually starting as fever of unknown origin (Chen and Cosgriff, 2000). The natural host for the virus are multimammate rats (Mastomysnatalensis), which breed frequently and are distributed widely throughout West, Central, and East Africa (Healing and Gopal, 2001). Both zoonotic and human to human contacts are possible (Ogbu, Ajuluchukwu and Uneke, 2007).</p> <p>Population movements, poor sanitation, overcrowding, inadequate resources to manage victims and poor epidemic preparedness are some of the factors contributing to disease outbreak (WHO,2000). Increasing international travel and the possibility of use of the Lassa virus as a biological weapon may have escalate the potential for harm beyond the local level, and stressed the need for greater understanding of Lassa fever and more effective control and treatment programs.</p> <p>Osun State is geographically close to Edo State that has persistently been having the highest number of both suspected and confirmed cases of LF in Nigeria in past years (NCDC,2012). With the symptoms of LF mimicking that of malaria which is endemic in Nigeria, the potential of missing the diagnosis of LF is high. Primary care workers in both public and private clinics are often the first set of personnel to handle suspected cases of Lassa fever which is also a possible source of nosocomial infection. In situation where health workers are not adequately equipped with requisite knowledge and materials to handle cases of LF, transmission and outbreak of the infection is likely. This informed the choice of Primary Health Care (PHC) workers as respondents in this study.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Though some studies have reported a fairly good knowledge of health workers about LF, many of such studies had health care workers from highly specialized health facilities as their respondents, with attitude to preventive measures still described as poor (Ajayi et al.,2013). This is happening in the midst of poor practice of universal precaution among Nigeria health workers (Kermode et al., 2005), though practice of universal precaution had improved over the years (Amoran and Onwube, 2013). This study assessed knowledge, attitude and perceptionof Lassa fever among people attending primary health care in Osun State in Southwestern Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this research work is toassess the knowledge, attitude and perceptionof Lassa fever among people attending primary health care in Osun State in South-western Nigeria. The specific objectives are as follows;</p> <ol><li>To assess the knowledge of Lassa fever among people attending PHC in Osun State</li> <li>To assess the attitude and perception of Lassa fever among people attending PHC in Osun State</li> <li>To assess the association of knowledge, attitude and perception with socio-demographics of respondents</li> <li>To identify causes, symptoms and consequences of Lassa fever in Osun State</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were formulated based on the objectives of this research project.</p> <ol><li>What is the level of the knowledge of Lassa fever among people attending PHC in Osun State?</li> <li>What is the attitude and perception of Lassa fever among people attending PHC in Osun State?</li> <li>Is there any association of knowledge, attitude and perception with socio-demographics of respondents?</li> <li>What are the causes, symptoms and consequences of Lassa fever in Osun State?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5     Scope of Study </strong></p> <p>This research project assessed knowledge, attitude and perceptionof Lassa fever among people attending primary health care, using the Osun State in South-western Nigeria. Hence this research project is limited to Osun State in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6     Significance of Study </strong></p> <p>This research project will be of immense benefit to communities and health sector shareholders who are involved in policy decisions in the academia. The research project will have relevance to policies and major decisions made with regards the healthsector.</p> <p>Also this work will serve as a reference to the works of future researchers who might be interested in studying this subject matter.</p> <p><strong>1.7     Operational Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Lassa Fever</strong>: an acute and often fatal viral disease, with fever, occurring chiefly in West Africa. It is usually acquired from infected rats.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge</strong>: is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning.</p> <p><strong>Perception</strong>: the ability to see, hear, or become aware of something through the senses.</p> <p><strong>1.8     Limitations of Study</strong></p> <p>This research project was limited by certain factors such as time, finances, uncooperative attitude of some of the respondents etc. These constituted limitations in this study as some of the respondents did not return their questionnaire. The researcher only made do with responses of the respondents whose questionnaire were correctly completed and returned. </p>\n\nKNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PERCEPTION OF LASSA FEVER AMONG PEOPLE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PERCEPTION OF LASSA FEVER AMONG PEOPLE", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>                                                          INTRODUCTION</p> <p>This chapter  reviews in brief, Health Care Associated Infections (HAI), elements required for transmission of infectious agent within a health care setting (chain of infection, sources of infection, susceptible host, mode of transmission, portal of entry and portal of exit), HAI among health-care workers, Universal Precautions (UP), Body Substances Isolation (BSI) and Standard Precautions (SP).</p> <p>1.1 HEALTH CARE- ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS (HAI):</p> <p>Health-care associated infection (HAI), also referred to as nosocomial infection and hospital acquired infection, is defined by Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an “infection caused by a wide variety of common and unusual bacteria, fungi, and viruses during the course of receiving medical care”(CDC, 2012). It either occurs while patients receive care or may develop after discharge. It also involves occupation infection among staff. HAI can also be defined as an “infection occurring in patients during the process of care in a hospital or health care facility which was not present or incubating at the time of admission. This includes infection acquired in the hospital, but appearing after discharge and also occupational infections among staff or facility” (WHO, 2012).HAI is considered an important public health problem (WHO, 2012). Globally, hundreds of millions of patients are infected by HAI every year in both developed and developing countries. According to WHO, its prevalence in developed countries varied between 3.5% and 12%, while in developing countries it varied between 5.7% and 19.1% (WHO, 2012). The highest occurrence of HAI were in acute surgical, orthopedic wards and Intensive Care Unit (WHO, 2002). The prevalence rate of ICU-acquired infection in high-income countries was 30%, while in middle and low-income countries, it was at least 2-3 times higher than that in high -income countries(WHO, 2009; WHO, 2012).</p> <p>The consequences of HAI at patients’ level imply more suffering, more complications, more treatments, and increase in hospitalization periods. For example, in Europe duration of hospitalization increased to nearly 16 million extra days (WHO, 2012).This is in itself considered a risk factor for acquiring HAI, and it means an increase in costs (WHO, 2012). In addition, it increases economic burden on the health care systems of countries. For example, in England, the annual financial costs topped 1.3 billion euro’s, while in the United States of America, the costs amounted to approximately 3.5 billion euro’s and 7 billion euro’s in Europe (WHO, 2012; WHO, 2012; Agozzino et al., 2012).</p> <p>1.2 HEALTH-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS AMONG HEALTH CARE WORKERS NURSES:</p> <p>HAI  can  affect  both  patients  and  health-care  workers. It   involves  Occupational  infections among nurses. Due to  the  nature  of  their occupations, the major occupational hazard is the transmission of blood-borne disease such as hepatitis B and AIDS by being exposed to injuries caused by contaminated sharp objects such as scalpels and broken glass and needle stick (CDC, 2012). Nurses can be infected by HAIs while dealing with patients or providing them with health treatment. They can play a role in the widespread of infections. For example, the nurses played an important role in the amplification of the outbreak of Marburg viral hemorrhage fever in Angola (WHO, 2015). The mode of transmission depends on many factors such as immunity of HCW and amount of blood transferred during injuries (CDC, 2012). According to WHO, nearly three million HCW are exposed to percutaneous blood borne pathogens each year worldwide; 2 million of those were exposed to HBV ,0.9 million to HCV and 170, 000 to HIV. These sharp injuries resulted in 15,000 HCV, 70,000 HBV and 500 HIV infections. About 90% of these events happened in the developing countries (WHO, 2014). The infectious agent is transmitted to nurses mainly via droplet: direct contact or contact with inanimate contaminated objects by infectious material. The risk of transmission of infectious agents would increase if infection control practice and standard precautions were not applied (WHO, 2013).</p> <p>1.3 SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Solutions of this problem include the following (WHO, 2012):</p> <p>    Determination of the local factors of the HAI burden.</p> <p>    Encouragement of the reporting and surveillance system.</p> <p>    Improvement of education  and  training of nurses in applying safety precaution.</p> <p>4.Implementation and application of standard precaution which is simple and low-cost but helpful in controlling spread of HAI as it saves money and saves life.</p> <p>1.4 UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS (UP):</p> <p>In 1983, CDC disseminated a document called (Guidelines for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals). This document included a section about precautions that must be taken when dealing with blood and body fluid of suspected patient infected by blood-borne pathogen (CDC, 2001).In 1985, in response to HIV /AIDS epidemic(CDC, 2007), CDC developed precautions to be applied to all patients irrespective of their blood-borne infection status. They were called universal precautions. These precautions are defined as ” a set of precautions devised to prevent, and minimize accidental transmission of all known blood-borne pathogens including HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus to/from health care personnel when providing first aid or other health care services” (Vaz et al., 2010). These universal precautions can also be defined as an “approach to infection control to treat all human blood and certain human body fluids as if they were known to be infectious for HIV,HBV and other blood borne pathogens” (NIOSH,2016). These precautions apply to blood, body fluid containing visible blood, semen, cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, peritoneal and amniotic fluid but don’t apply to feces, nasal secretion, sputum, sweat, tears, urine and vomits unless blood appears (Vaz et al., 2010).</p> <p>1.5 BODY SUBSTANCES ISOLATION (BSI):</p> <p>BSI appeared in 1987. This precaution supposed that all moist substances except sweat (execrations and secretions) were infectious (not just blood in UP) (Vaz et al., 2012). It depended mainly on using gloves, and it was advised to use clean gloves before dealing with or touching mucous membranes or contact with body fluids or moist substances, but after removing gloves there would be no need for hand washing if there was recommended(CDC, 2007; Vaz et al., 2010). UP and BSI were presented nearly in the same period.Some hospitals adapted UP while others adapted BSI. This problem and other problems required additional precautions to prevent transmission of diseases that are transmitted via airborne and droplet routes. However, there was no agreement on the washing of hands after using gloves. The existence of such problems led to emergence of another system of precautions called Standard Precautions (SP) (Vaz et al., 2012).</p> <p>1.6 STANDARD PRECAUTIONS (SP)</p> <p>The main principles of Universal Precautions and Body Substance Isolation practice were mixed by CDC in a new precaution system called Standard Precautions (SP) which now has replaced the “Universal Precautions”. Standard precautions are defined as “group of infection prevention practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed diagnosis or presumed infection status” (CDC, 2012). These precautions are the basic level of infection control precautions which are to be used, as a level of precautions (CDC, 2012; WHO, 2013). The fact is that “standard precautions” are recommended when delivering the care to all patients,regardless of their presumed infection status. It is also recommended that when handling equipment and devices that are contaminated or suspected of contamination, and in situations of contact risk with blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions except sweat, without considering the presence or absence of visible blood and skin with solution of continuity and mucous tissues. They included precautions against agents that are transmitted by the following routes of transmission: air-borne, droplet and contact routes (CDC, 2007; Vaz et al., 2013).</p> <p>The aims of standard precautions are the following: prevention and/ or reduction of transmission of HAI, and, at the same time, protection of nurses from sharp injuries. These aims can be achieved by the application of SP measures which consist of the following elements: hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (gloves, gown, gaggle, facemasks, head protection, foot protection and wearing face shields) and prevention of sharp injuries (CDC, 2015; WHO, 2012).</p> <p>1.6.1 HAND HYGIENE:</p> <p>Hand washing is the most important element of SP measures. This concept includes hand washing with soap (plain or antiseptic soap) and water or rubbing hands by using alcohol-based products without using water.</p> <p>Hand hygiene is recommended in following situations (WHO, 2013):</p> <p>i.After direct contact with patients</p> <p>ii.Before direct contact with patients.</p> <p>iii.After exposure to blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, non-intact skin, and contaminated items.</p> <p>iv.After contact with patients surrounding</p> <p>v.Before doing aseptic tasks like using an invasive device.</p> <p>1.6. 2 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENTS (PPE):</p> <p>The second part in the SP is PPE. It is defined as a group of barriers that are used alone, or in combination, to prevent transmission of infectious agents to mucous membrane, skin, airways and clothing of nurses when they are in contact with infectious agents. It is also used when contamination or splashing with blood or body fluids is anticipated and it is important to protect nurses from getting infections during contact with patients. This PPE should be found in each hospital, and the selection of this PPE is dependent on the nature of procedures, skills of nurses, nature of patients and mode of transmission. PPE includes the following: disposable gloves, face protection (masks, safety glasses, goggles) and gowns or aprons ) (Vaz et al., 2010; WHO, 2012).</p> <p> GLOVES</p> <p>Gloves are used while dealing with or touching blood, secretion, body fluids, execration, impaired membranes and mucous membranes, handling contaminated equipment and when in contact directly with patients who are infected with disease transmitted by direct contact. After removing them, hand hygiene should be done. In addition to this, nurses must know that gloves have to be changed if there was risk of cross contamination when dealing with the same patient and before going to another patient to prevent transmission of infections and prevent the occurrence of HAI (WHO, 2010). Removal of gloves has to be considered.</p> <p>ISOLATION GOWN</p> <p>This is worn to protect the clothes and skin of nurses from contact and contamination with blood or body fluid. The gown covers the body from neck to mid-thigh or below to prevent contamination of skin or clothe (WHO, 2010). Removal of gown has to be considered.</p> <p>FACE PROTECTION (MASK,GOGGLES AND FACE SHIELD)</p> <p>MASK:</p> <p>This must be used when there is a possibility for splashing or spraying of blood or body substances,and when nurses are doing procedures requiring sterile condition to prevent transmission of infection or infectious agents to patients. In addition to this, sometimes patients must wear mask especially if patient is suffering from coughing to limit spreading of his or her infection (CDC, 2010; WHO, 2012; WHO, 2013). Mask must be removed in a correct way as described in Figure 1.</p> <p>GOGGLES:</p> <p>Infectious agents can enter body from mucous membrane in eyes, by direct route through exposure to infectious agents from splash of blood or from cough, or by an indirect way through touching of the eye by contaminated hands. Many types of infectious agents are transmitted in this way including both viruses (for example, adenovirus) and bacteria (for example, hepatitis C) (CDC, 2010).</p> <p>FACE SHIELD</p> <p>Face protection can be used with other PPE if there is potential splashing of blood, body and respiratory secretions. Face shield can be worn as an alternative to goggles but face shield covers more face area than goggles which covers only the eyes (CDC, 2010).Like other PPE, caution  must be taken when removing face protection, taking into account its removal after removing gloves.</p> <p>1.7 SHARP INJURIES (SI) :</p> <p>SI are defined as “an exposure to event occurring when any sharp penetrates the skin” (CDC, 2012). These include needles, scalpels, broken glass, and other sharps. This term is interchangeable with percutaneous injury. It is considered a serious hazard in hospitals because it may allow the contaminated blood that has pathogen to be in contact with nurses. SI and NSI lead to infection. They expose nurses to blood- borne pathogens which mean ” pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human blood and can cause disease in humans. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus” (CDC, 2012). SI and NSI are considered a major source of Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection among HCWs. Nearly (39%) of cases of HCV that occurred worldwide happened among HCWs, while hepatitis B virus (HBV) formed (37%) (Goniewicz et al., 2012). Furthermore, needle stick injuries can transmit more than twenty types of infections such as malaria, syphilis and herpes (Elizabeth 2012).</p> <p>SI and NSI are challenges that threaten health workers especially nurses and form a significant risk in professional nursing. This is due to their daily activities which may expose nurses to NSI and SI. These activities or procedures include the following: recapping needle, suturing, placing intravenous line, drawing blood, failing to get rid of used needles in puncture-resistant sharps containers, using needles or glass equipment to transfer body fluid between containers, disassembling needle or sharp device, giving injections to patients, filling injection, opening the lid of the injection and many others (CDC, 2012; CDC, 2013). These tasks and activities of nurses in daily work may expose them to SI or NSI. Therefore, to prevent transmission of blood borne pathogens to nurses after being exposed to such injuries, they should quickly  wash the wound with water and soap. On the other hand, squeezing the wounds is not recommended as this will not reduce the risk of blood- borne pathogen. In case of the splash of blood or body fluid touches the nose or the mouth or the skin, they must flush these splashes with water and in case of blood or body fluid comes in contact with the eye, they should irrigate eyes with clean water or saline. Then they should inform the supervisor about injury to begin a reporting system (incidence report). At the same time, they should test the source patient for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and AIDS. After that, infected nurses should receive the appropriate treatment, and post exposure prophylaxes (PEP) should be taken if the source patient was unknown or the source patients’ test was positive (CDC, 2007; NHMRA, 2010).</p> <p>Sharp injuries and needle stick injuries are costly; these injuries have direct and indirect cost at the same time. The direct cost includes the cost of laboratory test of exposed nurses and source patient, in addition to the cost of treatment that may be required or post exposure prophylaxis. On the other hand, the indirect cost includes loss of nurses, loss of productivity, loss of time during reporting or taking of treatments and cost for replacing the infected nurses (NIOSH, 2011). According to CDC’s estimation, there were nearly (385,000) SI cases yearly among HCWs, and most reported cases occurred among nursing staff, but laboratory staff, physicians and other HCWs were also injured (NIOSH, 2011). Nearly half of SI were not reported; this was due to many reasons: lack of time to report, lack of knowledge of the reporting procedure, possibility of getting in trouble for having the exposure, belief the source patient was low for hepatitis B or hepatitis C or AIDS,and underestimation of the importance of reporting</p> <p>1.8 SHARP DISPOSAL CONTAINERS (OR BOX):</p> <p>Sharp objects must be disposed in separate containers in every hospital to prevent risk of transmission of infection. These containers are called sharp disposal containers and they must be puncture-resistant, liquid –proof, closed when not used and sealed and when (75%) of them are filled. They should be put nearby work place and close to place where sharp is used. This would reduce the occurrence of recapping needles and needle-stick injuries that are associated with recapping (OSHA, 2011;WHO,2012).</p> <p>1.9 PROBLEM STATEMENT</p> <p>Nurses get in contact with patients on a daily basis, so they are exposed to sharp injuries and many types of infections due to the nature of their occupation. It is important to follow standard precautions to reduce transmission of infections. In Palestine, despite of the availability of protocol for infection control in hospitals, it is applicable in varied degree from hospital to hospital. In addition, after reviewing documents from Palestinian Health Information Centre in MOH, it doesn’t have any statistics regarding nurses’ knowledge and practice of SP measures and those related to SI among health care workers. In addition, it doesn’t have any statistics regarding health care workers  who have SI or who acquired infection during work. As an expected outcome , this study will identify the importance of nurses’ knowledge about SP measures and those related to SI. Also it will highlight the size of problem of stick injuries among  workers during work.</p> <p>1.10 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</p> <p>This research, the first of its kind to be done in governmental hospitals in West Bank, to assesses knowledge and practice of SP measures and those related to SI among health care workers. Globally, many studies have been conducted about knowledge and practice of SP measures and those related to sharp injuries. Safety of Nurses and patients is considered an important issue in controlling and limiting the transmission of infectious disease between health care providers and patients. Following such standard precautions, which are easy and simple, would reduce the transmission of many types of contagious disease, thus reducing the economic burden of treating these diseases.</p> <p>This study also calculated SI and NSI among participants. It is important to know prevalence of SI and NSI because needle sticks and sharps injuries represent a significant hazard in professional health care providers  and exposure to blood and body fluid has been considered as part of nurses’ job. It is expected that this study will play an important role in highlighting the importance of knowledge and compliance with SP among health care workers during daily work. It is also expected to highlight the size of the problem of SI and NSI.</p> <p>1.11 OBJECTIVES</p> <p>Main objective :</p> <p>To assess health care worker’ knowledge and compliance with standard precaution measures and those related to sharp injuries and their compliance with those related standard precautions.</p> <p>Specific objectives :</p> <p>    To compare mean of score of knowledge about standard  precaution  measures  and  those  related  to  SI  among  different educational level of health care workers in federal teaching hospital, Edo-ekiti.</p> <p>2.To compare mean of score of practice of standard precaution measures and those related to SI among different educational level of health care workers in federal teaching hospital, Edo-ekiti .</p> <p>3.To identify the correlation between health care workers’ knowledge and their practices of standard precaution measures in federal.</p> <p>4.To identify the correlation between health care workers’ knowledge and their practices of standard precaution measures related to sharp injuries.</p> <p>5.To identify level of health care workers’ knowledge of SP measures, those related to SI which might be attributed to variables of years of experience, place of work and gender of participants.</p> <p>6.To estimate the prevalence of sharp injuries and needle stick injuries among nurses in the target hospitals.</p> <p>7.To identify the percentage of needles sticks as a result of sharp injuries.</p> <p>    HYPOTHESES:</p> <p>1.The nurses don’t have a good level of knowledge about SP and those related to SI</p> <p>2.There is no difference in mean of knowledge of SP measures and different educational level of nurses.</p> <p>3.There is no difference in mean of practice of SP measures and different educational level of nurses.</p> <p>4.There is no difference in mean of practice of SP measures related to SI and different educational level of nurses.</p> <p>5.There is no difference in mean of knowledge of SP measures related to SI and different educational level of nurses.</p> <p>6.There is no linear relationship between nurses’ knowledge and their practice of SP measure related to SI.</p> <p>7.There is no linear relationship between nurses’ knowledge and their practice of SP measures.</p> <p>8.There is no association between good level of nurses’ knowledge about SP measures related to SI and their years of experience, place of work and gender.</p> <p>                                  REFERENCES</p> <p>[1] World Health Organization [WHO] .

A descriptive, research design with a quantitative approach was applied to determine the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices of nurses regarding infection prevention and control within a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. The population for the study was nurses working in clinical environment at a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. 312 nurses were the total population of nurses at this tertiary hospital of which n= 140 (70%) were registered nurses, n= 80 (56%) enrolled nurses, n= 47 (33%) registered midwives, n= 23 (16%) enrolled midwives, n= 10 (7%) certified midwives and n= 12 (8%) registered mental health nurses. According to table 3.1, n= 31 nurses participated in the pilot study (10% of N= 312) while n= 196 nurses participated in the main study (70% of N= 281). The sampling method that was utilized in this study was stratified simple random sampling. This method of sampling enabled the study population to have an equal and independent chance of appearing in the study sample. The current study revealed that 76.4% (table 4.13) of nurses did not receive appropriate vaccination regarding infection prevention and control. Furthermore, 61% (table 4.13) of the nurses indicated that personal protective equipment is not always accessible. Therefore, both patients and nurses are exposed to hospital acquired infections. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>1.2    PROBLEM STATEMENT<br/>1.3    STUDY OBJECTIVES<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5    STUDY QUESTIONS/HYPOTHESES<br/>1.6    SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>REVIEW OF RELATED AND RELEVANT LITERATURE<br/>2.1    INTRODUCTION<br/>2.2    CONCEPTUAL CLARIFICATIONS<br/>2.3    THEORETICAL STUDIES<br/>2.4    EMPIRICAL STUDIES<br/>2.5    RELATED LITERATURES<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>RESEARCH METHODLOGY<br/>3.1    RESEARCH DESIGN<br/>3.2    STUDY AREA<br/>3.3    SOURCES OF DATA<br/>3.4    POPULATION OF THE STUDY<br/>3.5    SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION<br/>3.6    INSTRUMENTATION <br/>3.7    RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF INSTRUMENT<br/>3.8    METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>DATA PRESENATATION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION<br/>4.1    DATA PRESENTATION<br/>4.2    DATA ANALYSIS<br/>4.3    DATA INTERPRETATION<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.1    SUMMARY<br/>5.2    CONCLUSION<br/>5.3    RECOMMENDATION<br/>REFERENCES<br/>APPENDIX<br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/></strong></p> <p><strong> INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong> 1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>Infection-related diseases are still the main cause of death in Nigeria, according to the 2013 health profile acquired by the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2013) statistics. The burden of disease in Nigeria  includes HIV, TB, Malaria, other infectious diseases and respiratory infections. Expansion of the infection prevention and control movements occur due to the increase in infection occurrences in the country. This increase in infection-related disease’s impact the increase health financing in Nigeria with a government contribution to health care of 57.5% above the figures budgeted for (WHO, 2014).</p> <p>Infectious patients are admitted into hospitals and therefore hospitals have become common settings for transmission of diseases. In hospitals, infected patients are a source of infection transmission to other patients, health care workers and visitors (Sydnor &amp; Perl, 2011). Nosocomial infection, also known as hospital-acquired infections is one of the leading causes of death and has much economic cost due to increased hospitalization and prognosis (WHO, 2015). According to WHO (2010), Hospital acquired infection is defined as an infection occurring in a patient during the process of care within a health care facility which was not present or incubating at the time of admission. These infections are those occurring more than 48 to 72 hours after admission and within ten days after hospital discharge (Collins 2008:2). Due to the admission of patients with different organisms, the hospital environment has become saturated with highly virulent organisms, namely: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenic, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aureginosa and Hepatitis viruses that survive in a hospital. These organisms cause diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening conditions such as sepsis (Sydnor, &amp; Perl, 2011).</p> <p>The Nigeria Ministry of Health has indicated that Ebola virus disease epidemic is a public health risk as  neighbouring country are suffering from the diseases and therefore preparedness in infection prevention and control measures should be strengthened. Efficient knowledge, good attitude and best practices by nurses in infection prevention and control may contribute to decreasing in infection rate in the hospital.</p> <p>The Nigeria policy on health has stipulates that the health care institution should provide a safe environment for the patients in their care. Hospital nurses form the backbone of infection prevention and control, therefore possibly, will either contribute to infection transmission or prevent and control infection. According to Damani (2012), the environment in which a patient is nursed must be planned to reduce the risk of transmission of infection. Infection prevention and control measures aim to protect the vulnerable people from acquiring an infection while receiving health care (Damani, 2012). Lack of knowledge, bad attitudes and poor practices amongst nurses in the prevention and control of infections can lead to hospital-acquired infections.</p> <p>In clinical practice, the researcher has observed cases where nurses handle contaminated linen with bare hands, put needles in the patient’s mattress after giving injections, do not clean the stethoscope between patients and do not wash hands regularly in the clinical environment. Poor infection prevention and control practices among nurses increase the rates of hospital-acquired infections.</p> <p>Hand hygiene is the single most important intervention to prevent transmission of infection and should be a quality standard in all health institutions. An attitude of not washing hands among individuals involved in the provision of health care can increase the rate of hospital-acquired infections. In a study that was conducted in India, where Nair, Hanumantappa, Hinemath,Siraj and Raghunath (2013:3) assessed knowledge, attitude and practices of hand hygiene among medical and nursing students at a tertiary health care centre, the majority of students had poor knowledge with regard to hand hygiene.</p> <p>Lack of knowledge among nurses can increase the rate of hospital-acquired infections. This is supported by a study that was conducted in Zimbabwe by Tirivanhu, Ancia and Petronella (2014:73) who determined the barriers of infection prevention and control practices among nurses at the Bindura provincial hospital. The study revealed that the majority of nurses’ lack knowledge on infection control principles as only n= 14 (28%) of n= 50 (100%) nurses had excellent knowledge on infection control principles, n= 21 (42%) of n= 50 nurses did not utilize the infection control manuals. Infection control workshops were poorly organised as 68% of the nurses did not attend any workshop on infection prevention and control practices (Tirivanhu et al., 2014). Hayeh and Esena (2013:47) assessed the infection prevention and control (IPC) practices among health workers at Ridge Regional Hospital in Accra (Ghana). The study showed that knowledge in IPC practices among health care workers was moderate 51% (n= 204), as availability and access to material for IPC practices at the facility was 58% (n= 118) and overall compliance with IPC guidelines was 54% (n= 110).</p> <p>The World Health Organisation (2016) has indicated that surgical site infections at this particular tertiary hospital in Nigeria are a research priority as there was an increase in wound infections of those people who had surgery at this hospital and this coincides with the researcher’s experiences and proposal. Therefore, this study determined the knowledge, attitude and practices of nurses in infection prevention and control within a tertiary hospital in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/></p> <p>A research problem is an area of concern in which there is a gap in the knowledge base needed for nursing practice (Burns &amp; Grove 2011:146). The researcher has observed that nurses do not apply infection prevention and control measures in the hospital setting which is required to ensure patient safety. Lack of knowledge, attitude and practices in infection prevention and control contribute to high rates of hospital-acquired infections (Jain, Dogra, Mishra, Thaku and loomba, 2012 &amp; Hayeh and Esena, 2013). Uncontrollable nosocomial infection contributes to prolonged stay, morbidity and mortality which put stress on health care economics of the country (Mishta, Banerjee &amp; Gosain, 2014).</p> <p><strong>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/></p> <p>1.What is the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices of health care workers in infection prevention and control in Miaduguri ?</p> <p><strong>1.4 AIM OF THE RESEARCH</strong><br/></p> <p>In order to address the research question, the aim of the study is to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices of nurses regarding infection prevention and control in Maiduguri.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong><br/></p> <p>Based on the aim, the following objectives have been set for the study to determine:</p> <p>1.The knowledge of  midwifes  in infection prevention and control in Miaduguri.</p> <p>2.The attitude of midwife  in infection prevention and control in Maiduguri.</p> <p>3.The practices of midwife  in infection prevention and control in Maiduguri</p> <p>4.To make recommendations to the risk programme and policies in Maiduguri</p> \n\nKNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF INFECTION CONTROL AMONG MIDWIVES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF INFECTION CONTROL AMONG MIDWIVES", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The problem of every hospital when the targeted objective is not achieved is that there is something wring either with health care givers, the patients or the general public.

This study aimed at examining how regular disposal of waste can affect the health status of traders in Akpan Andem Market. To assess the availability of sanitation facilities and its effect on health status of traders in Akpan Andem Market. To examine the availability of regular water supply and its impact on health status of traders in Akpan Andem Market. The target population for the study was two thousand  stall owners in Akpan Andem Market, Uyo while the accessible population was 100 respondents which were drawn using Simple Random Sampling Technique to participate in the study. Data were collected using questionnaires comprising of 21 items. Data obtained were analyzed using percentages and frequency which were presented in tables and charts. The findings of the study revealed that 95% of the respondents linked Diarrhea, catarrh, cough, malaria, cholera with lack of environmental hygiene due to inadequate sanitation facilities, irregular water supply and irregular waste disposal system. From the findings, the researcher concluded that if sanitation facilities, regular water supply and proper waste disposal system are made available in Akpan Andem Market, environmental hygiene and health status of traders will be improved. The researcher therefore recommended among others that government and management of Akpan Andem Market should provide the necessary sanitation facilities such as adequate water supply, good toilet facilities and disposal system and effective drainage system. This will improve environmental hygiene and minimize serious health problems among traders in Akpan Andem Market.</p>\n\nENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE AND HEALTH STATUS OF TRADERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE AND HEALTH STATUS OF TRADERS", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>1.1   Background to the Study</p> <p>The rapid growth of world population in recent times has received widespread attention especially in Africa where the highest crude-birth rates are found. The present population of Nigeria is between 90 and 100 million persons or perhaps even larger with the annual growth rate of 3.3 percent (Oni, 2006).</p> <p>If the current population estimate is something to go by, much population analysis already regards Nigeria as being over populated. Based on the contest, the Federal Government recently formulated a policy on the nations population. These include management and control of our human population with guided skills, goals, policies, plans, programmes and projects for the improvement of human quality (Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria 2010).</p> <p>We cannot dismiss as presumptuous the adverse effects of uncontrolled reproduction on women and such risk factors as childbirth before 18 years or after 35 years of age where as in the rich developed nations of the world, population growth rate has diminished as women and men have chosen to have fewer children, in developing nations like Nigeria, the growth rate remains high as only few couples limit the number of their children. Global and Regional Estimates of the Incidence of Unsafe Abortion and Associated Mortality in (2000) WHO (2004). This is probably because children are seen as the most valuable assets from God as such they are accepted whenever they come.</p> <p>There is the concern that Natural resources are not unlimited and uncontrolled therefore, population growth may result in crisis, statistics which statistics central statistical Agency: ICF International (2006). Shows that majority of the world’s people are neither adequately fed nor housed. The sad reality is that people that are less able to care for their children are having more children than those who have the means to support them (Shuaib $ ï Oghdoh 2010).</p> <p>There is a growing concern among individuals and nations alike, to limit their family size and population respectively. (Nelson, Tom $ Timothy,. Soc. Sc. 2011). There is the need for adequate nutrition, housing and better quality of life. Health policy and the strategic framework and plan in 2012 was a major step by the Federal Government to reduced the unacceptable high levels of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and to ensure the necessary improvement in access to quality reproductive health services at all levels. One of the major steps to achieve the declared objectives of reproductive health policy is to promote access to information on family planning, encourage wider choices of contraceptives methods and to encourage the development of new initiatives that would support availability of commodities and supplies at the service delivery points. All the stakeholders believed that availability of commodities (contraceptives and condoms for (HIV/AIDS) is critical to the success of the reproductive health, population and HIV/AIDS programmes.</p> <p>Therefore, in creating the necessary awareness for family planning, it is equally very vital to ensure a regular supply of the commodities at all levels.</p> <p>Family Planning emerged as a population control measure. The services were initially provided by independent agencies and private individuals provide the services in Nigeria. There is growing acceptance of the fact that men and women need so that they can protect themselves and make informed decisions regarding their reproductive health Dwger J. C. (2002). Inspite of the advantages of family planning, rumours and misinformation about family planning are widespread. Despite the awareness resistance persists, some people fear that when young people are educated about sexuality, providing them with family planning information will lead to irresponsibility and promiscuity on the other hand. Women of child bearing age are reluctant to seek information or help from their family or professional settings. They therefore do not got the information they need. Olugbenga-Bello, Abodunrin $ Adeomi (2011).</p> <p>Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria (2001) stated that experience of Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria in 34 states out of the 36 states of Nigeria shows that women are very poorly informed about reproductive health and family planning.</p> <p>For centuries, family planning has been a thing of concern as people tried to find ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Attempts to prevent these pregnancies have met oppositions both in the ancient and modern times Ali, Rozi $ Mahmood (2004). However, several researchers had been carried out resulting in the emergence of different methods of family planning to meet the varying needs of individual users.</p>\n\nATTITUDES OF WOMEN TOWARDS UTILIZATION OF MODERN CONTRACEPTIVES <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ATTITUDES OF WOMEN TOWARDS UTILIZATION OF MODERN CONTRACEPTIVES ", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 Background to the Study </p> <p>The difference between food intake and utilization determines the nutritional status of the individual. Change in food consumption and the biological utilization will directly or indirectly reflect in the nutritional status. The nutritional status can be normal, under nutrition or over nutrition. The under and over nutrition are considered as malnutrition. The nutritional status of the under-five might be affected by some factors ranging from busy schedule of the primary care giver to inability to provide enough food and needed health care to maintain normal nutritional status. The determinants of the nutritional status may differ based on regions, communities, or even over time. To proffer necessary recommendations or solve any nutritional problem in an area, it will be important to determine the nutritional status and the underlying causes.</p> <p>Efforts have been made both nationally and internationally by governmental and non-governmental organizations to maintain normal nutritional status but poor nutrition remains a major link to diseases and reduced life-span. According to Mamulwar, Rathod, Jethani,  Dhone,  Bakshi, Lanjewar et al. (2014), one quarter of the under-five children are stunted. Many factors have been implicated to influence the nutritional status. Poor diet and disease are considered as immediate factors but there are underlying factors like food security, caring practices of the mother, healthy environment and assessment of health facilities. The underlying causes are also considered to have basic causes which are seen as socio-economic and political conditions (Asegedech, 2014).</p> <p>Nutritional status of the under-five is of great importance since this period of life is considered as pivotal for adequate growth (Badake, Maina, Mboganie, Muchemi, Kihoro, Chelimo, &amp; Mutea, 2014). Under-nutrition could be described as weighty medical condition characterized by a deficient bodily nutrition (energy, essential proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals in a diet) as a result of inadequate food intake or faulty assimilation. Over 10 million children of under-five are lost annually due to diseases that can be prevented and even easily treated. Most of these illnesses and majority of these deaths occur in developing countries because of the poor economy of such Countries (Black, Morris &amp; Bryce, 2003). Malnutrition cause more over 30% of all children’s deaths who are under-five(United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2009). According to Badake, Maina, Mboganie, Muchemi, Kihoro, Chelimo and Mutea, (2014), assessing the growth of children is a good parameter to look at the development of the children and this also gives insight about food security in the area and assess to good health services.</p> <p>Poor nutritional status has called for different programmes and interventions in different sectors in order to improve the nutrition status. Sequel to this, experts from different fields are strategizing and evaluating various interventions that have nutrition components (Macias &amp; Glasauer, 2014). Assessing nutritional status is the easiest indicators for assessing the impact of interventions that are nutrition focused and this can be done using various methods. Assessing nutritional status entails a deep understanding of what people consume and the determinants of people’s nutritional habits. The nutritional status can then be traced to have a myriad of determinants.</p> <p>Different factors have been implicated to affect the nutritional status of the under-five and there are repeated episodes of diseases that are often seen among these children. Some of the factors include inadequate food availability, poor caring capacity of the caregiver, lack of basic education, poor health systems, poor housing and environmental conditions. Communities that are unable to satisfy the basic needs of its citizens are likely to generate more individuals with poor anthropometric indices.</p> <p>Several strategies have been put in place to maintain adequate nutritional status of the children (e.g. exclusive breastfeeding). 17% has been found to be the exclusive breastfeeding rate in Nigeria and it has also been documented that 21% of mortality among the under-five can be traced to breastfeeding patterns that do not follow the set standard (Ojofeitimi, 2016). Adequate diet and health care during first few years of life is fundamental for child’s development and this help to maintain adequate or normal nutritional status. Early in life, irreversible drop in linear growth and psychological impairment can occur when there is problem with food consumption or utilization (Alamu, Atawodi &amp; Edokpayi, 2011). Growth is most rapid in the early years of life and this may not be comparable to any other time after birth. Since good nutrition has been identified to play a pivot role in growth particularly in the early years of life, it is important to assess the nutritional status of the under-five and the associated determining factors.</p> <p>The need for food by mankind most especially the growing up children has been emphasized over the years (Adegun, Ajayi-Vincent, &amp; Alebiosu, 2013). The nutritional status is solely dependent on the adequate and right consumption of nutrients from foods and the body’s ability to make use of them adequately to meet its metabolic needs of health and fitness. At early stage of growth, several biochemical activities that affect growth and development are going on in the body and these require nutrition. When there are inadequate nutrients available for these activities then there is likelihood of developing stunted growth and development (Adegun, Ajayi-Vincent, &amp; Alebiosu, 2013).</p> <p>To find solutions to the nutritional related problems that are common in the early stage of life, it is very necessary to determine the nature, magnitude and determinants of malnutrition. Anthropometric measurements are accepted widely as key indicator of the nutrition status of the community. Anthropometric indices are also suggestive of the socio-economic level. The anthropometric measurements include measurement of weight for age, height for age, weight for height and measurement of mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). The integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) approach for the classification of nutritional status will be used in this study.</p> <p>According to Hunger Facts (2015), globally about 795 million individuals are undernourished. The vast majority (98%) of these undernourished reside in the developing countries. Under-nutrition among the under-five remains a problem faced by different parts of the world. Close to 50% of all deaths among under-five are attributable to under nutrition. This implies that there is unnecessary loss of about 3 million young lives every year (Hunger Facts, 2015). In Sub-Saharan Africa, close to 50% of children particularly the under-five are malnourished and deaths from such nutrition related condition is on the increase (FAO, 2008). Nutrition related problem in Sub-Saharan Africa has added more to the burden of childhood morbidity and mortality. However, the information available on the nutritional status of the under-five in informal settlements can be considered as little and inadequate (Olack, Burke, Cosmas, Bamrah, Dooling, Feikin &amp; Breiman, 2011).</p> <p>Reducing nutritional related problems among children particularly the under-five is a huge challenge that is being faced by different countries particularly the underdeveloped and the developing countries. In Kenya, the percentage of stunted children among the under-five is 35%, 14% were considered to be severely stunted while underweight was 16% (low weight-for age) and severely underweight was 4%. The core factor responsible for all these nutrition related health challenges as conceived by different researchers can be linked to food access issue, infections of various degrees and forms, maternal/paternal factor, socio-economic factors and other related factors.</p> <p>Nigeria (especially the rural areas) is one of the developing countries that are affected by this nutrition-related problem. This might be related to causes that are found in other regions of the world like poor access to food, primary care giver factor, socio-economic factor, area of abode and other related factors. The Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (2003) put the rate of stunted growth among the under-five years to be 38%, underweight to be 29% while wasting was 9.2%. Several factors can be considered to have caused these nutritional deficiencies. According to the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) Nigeria (2007), 7% is the rate of compliance of mothers to exclusive breastfeeding of their children who are less than 6 months.</p>\n\nNUTRITIONAL STATUS OF UNDER-FIVE CHILDREN AND ASSOCIATED FACTORS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF UNDER-FIVE CHILDREN AND ASSOCIATED FACTORS", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 Background to the Study</p> <p>Infection control is an aspect of healthcare delivery that deals with the curtailment of the spread of infection within the healthcare set-up, be it from patient-to-patient, patient-to-staff, staff-to-patients or staff to staff. According to World Health Organisation (WHO, 2011) the components of infection prevention and control are as follows: organisation, technical guidelines, human resources, surveillance, microbiology laboratory support, environment, evaluation and links with public health and other services. Organisation involves setting up a programme, formation of the infection control committee and inter-professional team, which should include physicians, nurses, microbiologists, epidemiologists, infection control specialists, information specialists and others. The committee must have a good working relationship with one another, because their work entails collaboration with other departments, staff and programmes. Technical guidelines involve developing, disseminating and implementing technical evidence-based information in preventing the risks of infection. Human resources involve training and re-training of health care personnel in preventing infections and the training of infection control professionals. It guarantees a pool of adequate staff responsible for infection prevention and control activities.</p> <p>Surveillance is the tracking of demonstrated or suspected spread of infection. It involves the collection of data on epidemic and detection of outbreaks as well as the assessment of level of compliance with infection control practices, response to outbreaks and documentation of the situation of healthcare associated infection. Surveillance is important in that it causes early detection, identification, isolation and intervention, and results in effective infection prevention. Microbiology laboratory supports generate data, standardised laboratory techniques and promotes interaction between infection control activities. The environment refers to the minimum requirements for infection control. It includes water, ventilation, hand-hygiene equipment, placement of patient as well as isolation facilities, sterile supply storage, building conditions and renovation activities. Evaluation has to do with monitoring, assessment and report of infection prevention and control outcomes, processing and strategizing at national level and in healthcare facilities. It mirrors the impact of the infection control programmes. Links with public health and other services ensures proper coordination and collaboration between staff and departments in the events of mandatory reporting and activities such as waste management and sanitation, bio-safety, occupational health, patients and consumer’s care and the quality of health care (Hebden, 2015; Stempliuk &amp; Eremin, 2015; WHO, 2011).</p> <p>There are various sources of infections. Healthcare associated infections (HAI) are infections that develop in the course of healthcare and results in aggravating illnesses and may lead to deaths, extends the duration of hospital stay, and calls for more interventions at an added cost to the one already expended by the patient’s initial disease. Its occurrence is an indicator of the quality of patient care, adverse event and an issue of patient safety. The sources includes adverse drug events, surgical complications, microorganism isolates, antimicrobial resistance, decreasing trends in intensive care units, exogenous microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoan from other patients, endogenous flora of the patients- residual bacteria residing on the patient’s skin, mucous membrane, gastro intestinal tract, respiratory tract, inanimate environmental surfaces, contaminated objects, patient room touch, surfaces, equipment, medication, individual patient, medical equipment, devices, hospital environment, contaminated drugs and foods and hospital flora in the healthcare environment. Other sources include doctors’ white coats, nurses’ uniform, hospital garments, privacy drapes, stethoscopes, bed rails, common hospital surfaces, contaminated water, compromised immune system, negligence or poor attitude of hospital staff, hands of health care workers. It could be from patient to patient, patient to environment, staff to patient, renovation works in the hospital (Hans, 2012; Stubblefield, 2014; WHO, 2011).</p> <p>Healthcare workers generally are at risk of infection, because they constantly come into contact with infected materials such as tissues, fluid, blood and blood products. There are several infection control measures aimed at controlling the spread of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B and C, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other life threatening infections. Moreover, the hospital waste itself is a potential source of infection hence the need for proper infection control measures. It has been found that healthcare workers do not adhere strictly to the various infection control measures, probably because they do not recognise such, or they lack adequate knowledge, or could be due to poor attitude towards infection control measures, including non-availability of materials and equipment (Amoran &amp; Onwube, 2013).In a study conducted at the Federal Medical Center (FMC), Gombe, in North Eastern Nigeria among nurses, it was found that some respondents were not aware that standard precautions is applied to all patients, and majority of the respondents have poor knowledge of the components of standard precautions (Saidu, Habu, Kever, Dathini, Inuwa, Maigari et al, 2015).</p> <p>Standard precautions are infection control measures that are put forward by the United States Centre for Disease Prevention &amp; Control (CDC), in 1996. By complying with standard precautions, a lot of infections can be avoided, such as occupational exposure to pathogens. While some health workers are familiar with the infection control measures, some are not. This may be due to lack of awareness or knowledge and moreover, the attitude that some who are familiar with the infection control measures, show towards practice is not encouraging. When one considers the importance of adequate knowledge and practice of infection control measures, by the healthcare workers, one cannot but think of what to do to improve on that knowledge and practice. Jain, Dogra, Mishra, Thakur and Loomba (2012), in their study among doctors and nurses in a tertiary care hospital, found that there is lack of knowledge and practice regarding basic infection control measures. This deficit in knowledge can be improved through educational intervention. Wasswa, Nalwadda, Buregyoya, Gitta, Anguzu and Nuwama (2015), in their study on implementation of infection control in health facilities in Uganda, found that with prior training on infection control, the respondents were more likely to wash their hands. Level of education and a prior nosocomial infection experience will have a role in the practice of infection control measures. In-service training on infection control measures will boost the practice of infection control measures.</p> <p>Amoran and Onwube (2013) found that inadequate workers’ knowledge on infection control and environment related problems are crucial issues that need urgent attention. According to Gebresilassie, Kumei, and Yemane (2014) in their study, “there is suboptimal and inconsistent practice of standard precautions in the healthcare setting that put patients and healthcare workers at significant risk of acquiring infections”. They also emphasized the need for in-service training for the healthcare workers on infection control. Adly, Amin and Abd El-aziz, (2014) found that intervention influenced the compliance of nurses with infection control measures, because of the knowledge gained during the intervention or training programme. There is a standard of infection control measures that can guarantee infection safety among health workers and patients.</p> <p> 1.2 Statement of the Problem</p> <p>Healthcare workers generally are at risk of infection. WHO (2006), reported that among the 35million health workers worldwide, about 3 million sustain percutaneous exposures to the blood borne pathogens each year, including 2 million to Hepatitis B virus (HBV), 0.9 million to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 170,000 to Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These injuries may result in 70,000 HBV; 15,000 HCV and 5,000 HIV infections. Nurses are at higher risk of being infected with blood-borne pathogens from clinical blood exposure through injuries with sharp instruments and needle-stick injuries if infection control measures are not strictly followed. This is because they are usually the first contact with a patient on arrival in the hospital and provide 24 hour patient care. Studies have also shown evidence of clinical nurses becoming infected due to occupational exposure (Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, 2012).  Abdulraheem, Amodu, Saka, Bolarinwa &amp; Uthman (2012), in their study, among health workers in North Eastern Nigerian found that the level of knowledge and implementation of standard precautions is below standard to guarantee infection safety. They concluded that there is still much to learn and implement when it comes to infection control measures. </p> <p>Furthermore, in some health institutions, the researcher observed that some nurses do not adhere to the components of standard precautions while providing nursing care. For example, few nurses were observed not to wash their hand after removing gloves and before commencing another procedure. In some of the wash hand basins in the outpatient department, liquid soap is not available for health workers and patients to wash their hands. When blood or body fluids are spilled on the floor, the house keepers do not decontaminate with hypochlorite solution before mopping with soap and water. The health institutions infection control units are not well equipped to function effectively to ensure compliance to standard precautions. It is in the light of the gaps that the researcher became interested in planning a training programme on knowledge, perception, attitude and practice of infection control for nurses at Babcock University Teaching Hospital (BUTH), Ilisan-Remo, Ogun state.</p> <p>1.3 Objective of the Study</p> <p>The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of a training programme on infection control among nurses. The specific objectives are to:</p> <p>assess the effectiveness of the training programme on knowledge of participants about</p> <p>infection control;</p> <p>determine the effectiveness of the training programme on perceptions of participants</p> <p>about infection control;</p> <p>document the effectiveness of the training programme on attitudes of participants</p> <p>towards infection control;   </p> <p>implement a training programme on infection control; determine the level of skills possessed and practice of participants on infection control; assess the effectiveness of a training programme on infection risk reduction and ascertain if there is any difference between the self-reported practices and the actual</p> <p>      observed practices of infection control in the experimental group.      </p> <p>1.4 Research Questions</p> <p>This study attempted to answer the following research questions:</p> <p>What are the effects of training programme on attitudes of participants? What are the effects of training programme on the perceptions of participants? What are the effects of training programme on the knowledge of participants? What is the effect of the training programme on infection risk reduction?</p> <p>1.5   Hypotheses</p> <p>These three hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance:</p> <p>Ho 1.         There is no significant difference in the mean knowledge score of infection control between the experimental group and the control group.</p> <p>Ho 2.         There is no significant difference in the mean practice score of infection control between the experimental group and the control group.    </p> <p>Ho 3.         There is no significant difference between the self reported practice and observed practice of infection control in the experimental group.</p> <p>1.6 Scope of the Study</p> <p>This study focused on the knowledge, attitude, perception and practice of infection control among nurses. Specific areas are; hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), handling sharps/injection safety, cleaning and disinfection as well as waste management. The independent variable is the training package, and the dependent variables are the participants’ knowledge, attitude, perception and practice.</p> <p>1.7 Significance of the Study</p> <p>The importance of the training programme to nurses, patients, hospital and society cannot be over emphasized. The training programme may improve infection control practices among nurses. The practices include: hand washing, donning and removing PPE for example, gloves, gown, mask, eyewear, and injection safety. The study may also improve the knowledge of nurses on the components of standard precautions. Training and practicing standard precautions may lead to a situation where nurses actually feel more protected from the risk of exposures to HIV and Hepatitis, and are more likely to provide improved “physical care”. Nurses also experience less fear and are less judgmental towards patients, thus less likely to stigmatise or discriminate patients, leading to improved “psychosocial or emotional care” when rendering care to patients with highly infectious diseases.  </p> <p>In the practice of standard precautions, all patients are assumed to be possible sources of infection and must be handled professionally in that regard. The importance of this programme to the hospital is that the patients that receive care are not likely to have nosocomial infection. This may in turn allow the hospital to have recognition which may attract more patronage by Ogun state indigenes and beyond.</p>\n\nNURSING INTERVENTION FOR THE PROMOTION OF INFECTION CONTROL IN TWO TEACHING HOSPITALS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NURSING INTERVENTION FOR THE PROMOTION OF INFECTION CONTROL IN TWO TEACHING HOSPITALS", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0 Background to the Study</p> <p>Hypertension is the most common non-communicable disease and the leading cause of cardiovascular disease in the world. Many people with hypertension are unaware of their condition making treatment infrequent and inadequate, which is responsible for it poor control and not always taken seriously (Neutel &amp; Campbell, 2008). Majority who are suffering from hypertension have a type of hypertension called essential hypertension or type one hypertension. Heredity and unhealthy lifestyle have been widely acceptable has being responsible for this type of hypertension. This has become a menace especially in Africa because of the adoption of western lifestyle, coupled with its challenges of unhealthy environment, poverty, lack of health seeking behaviour, lack of health insurance and sedentary life lived by many.</p> <p>According to Seven Joint National Committee Criteria (JNC7), the precise rule for the treatment of hypertension begins with lifestyle modifications and ends with medication. Unfortunately, many patients diagnosed to be hypertensive don’t usually have proper knowledge about lifestyle modification. Studies on lifestyle modifications have revealed that modifications such as weight loss, taking Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, exercising and reducing salt consumption would be effective in lowering blood pressure and reducing its complications especially the rate of morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases (Jafari, Shahriari, Sabouhi, Farsani &amp; Babadi, 2016).</p> <p>Lifestyle modification is advised for all hypertensive, in respective of pharmacological treatment, because it may abolish or even reduce the need for medications. The goal of prescribed lifestyle changes is to lower blood pressure. This lifestyle changes also offers a lot of health benefits and better outcomes for common chronic diseases (Huang, Duggan &amp; Harman, 2008). Yet studies have showed that ignorance and lack of knowledge and awareness are some of the barriers to having a healthy lifestyle and not controlling and preventing high blood pressure. It is assumed that increased knowledge about the role of lifestyle in the occurrence of high blood pressure would cause people to start modifying their lifestyles and enhance their preventive behaviours as supported by the results of a study which says `when the score of knowledge in high blood pressure patients increases by one, their score of practice would increase by 0.12. (Jafari, Shahriari, Sabouhi, Farsani &amp; Babadi, 2016).</p> <p>However, studies have shown that improving knowledge and awareness alone could not be enough to control the effects of diseases by itself but by increasing the score of attitude toward high blood pressure through reinforcement, systolic and diastolic blood pressures would decrease significantly. There are a lot of other barriers that can prevent individual to modifying their lifestyle but studies have showed that increased knowledge, attitudinal and change of perceptions will all lead to practice of lifestyle modification (Jafari, Shahriari, Sabouhi, Farsani &amp; Babadi, 2016).</p> <p>The recommended lifestyle modification such as, moderate alcohol intake, weight loss of 3% to 9% of body weight, the DASH diet, regular aerobic exercise, and reduced dietary salt are lifestyle modification that controls blood pressure. Depending on the type of intervention, blood pressure reduction of 3 to 11 mm Hg systolic and 2.5 to 5.5 mm Hg diastolic, are believed to have great influence on blood pressure reduction and ability to potentiate antihypertensive drugs. The recommended diet called DASH diet is low in total and saturated fat, sugar, sugary drinks, refined carbohydrates, and red meat  but high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, poultry, fish and low-fat dairy products. This DASH diet has long been documented to lower weight, risk of type 2 diabetes, heart rate, apolipoprotein B, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and is accompanying by a lower incidence of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality (Lochner, Rugge &amp; Judkins, 2006).</p> <p>In a premier trial, it was also documented that a reduction of 14.2/7.4 mmHg in blood pressure is attained when DASH diet is accompany by salt reduction and alcohol, aerobic exercise and weight loss, which also reduces the prevalence of hypertension from 38% to 12% over the period of six months. Reduce salt consumption by hypertensive patents, possibly the   single most important hypotensive measure, entails regularly checking food labels for salt content, staying away from processed foods, and using spices and herbs for flavour. It is generally acceptable that personal efforts from the patients and reinforcing and enabling environment from health personnel will lead to a great success in diet and behavioural modification (Nicoll &amp; Henein 2010).</p> <p>Knowledge and practice of lifestyle modification among patients with high blood pressure has however been showed to be inadequate in some studies. In UK, Nicoll and Henein (2010) in their study revealed that many hypertensive patients are unwilling to accept that their lifestyle practices or choices have made a worthwhile contributed to their condition and may refuse advice to change, this may be true of other hypertensive patients. Therefore, health education about hypertension, its consequences and lifestyle modification is been advocated to begin as early as possible in population identified to be at risk (American Heart Association, 2010).</p> <p>1.1 Statement of the problem</p> <p>Despite the treatment guideline and numerous drugs available for the treatment of hypertension, having patients bringing their blood pressure under control has always been a mirage. Part of the guidelines for the treatment of hypertension is lifestyle modification. In terms of economic burden, morbidity, mortality, poorly controlled blood pressure is a considerable important public health concern among older adult in the world. High blood pressure is the leading and most significant modifiable risk factor for, stroke, heart diseases, renal diseases and retinopathy. Recent recommendations for the prevention and treatment of hypertension has placed importance on modifying lifestyle. It has been proven that lifestyle modifications that is capable of lowering hypertension include increased physical activity, weight loss, reduced sodium intake. This include, a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products reduced in total and saturated fat (Al-wehedy, Abd Elhameed, &amp; Abd El-Hammed, 2015).</p> <p>Despite the above fact, it’s been documented in several studies that most hypertensive patients don’t have enough knowledge about lifestyle modification. In a study carried out among 101 participants on perception and practice of lifestyle modification in South-East Nigeria, it was revealed that about 87.1% of the participant were not aware that exercising regularly is part of lifestyle modification while 60% were not aware that alcohol intake should be of moderate consumption. The roles of unsaturated oil and reduction in diary food intake, vegetables, and fruits in the control of blood pressure were not aware by 80% and above. A little above 60% practiced salt restriction among 88% that has some knowledge of salt restriction. This is also applicable to the few with knowledge of weight reduction, regular exercise, fruit intake, cigarette smoking and alcohol moderation, respectively.  The study shows there was a negative relationship between diastolic and systolic blood pressures and the level of practice. This typifies that knowledge level and practice of lifestyle modifications were poor among the studied participants. (Okwuonu, Emmanuel &amp; Ojimadu, 2014).</p> <p>This is in congruence with the researchers experience with patients, colleagues and family members who are diagnosed to be hypertensive, and are far away from modifying their lifestyle. This may be due to lack of adequate knowledge, belief and lack of reinforcement and enabling environment motivating them to modifying their lifestyle as documented. Jafari, Shahriari, Sabouhi, Farsani &amp; Babadi, (2016), postulated that having knowledge or a partial knowledge and awareness alone will not lead to a change in health behaviours and practical application of knowledge but enhancement of awareness through appropriate educational programs. Therefore, this study is aimed at bridging the gap in knowledge and practice of lifestyle modification through a training programme.</p> <p>1.2 Objective of the Study</p> <p>The main objective of this study, is to determine the effect of a training programme on the knowledge and practice of lifestyle modification programme among hypertensive patients attending out-patient clinics in Lagos. The specific objectives are to:</p> <p>determine the existing knowledge level of high blood pressure and lifestyle modification among hypertensive patients in both groups; determine the level of reported practice of lifestyle modification among hypertensive patients in both groups; Implement a lifestyle modification programme among hypertensive patients and determine the effect of a training programme on knowledge and reported practice of lifestyle modification among hypertensive patients in experimental group.</p> <p> 1.3 Research Questions</p> <p>What is the existing knowledge level about hypertension and lifestyle modification among hypertensive patients in control and experimental group? What are the reported lifestyle modification practices among hypertensive patients in both groups? What is the effect of a training programme on post intervention knowledge of hypertension, lifestyle modification and self-reported practice among hypertensive patients in experimental group?</p> <p>1.4 Hypotheses</p> <p>The hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance</p> <p>H1:       Patients who attend the training programme will demonstrate high knowledge of hypertension and lifestyle modification than those who did not</p> <p>H1:       Patients who attend the training programme will report improved practice of lifestyle modification</p>\n\nEFFECT OF A TRAINING PROGRAMME ON KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS ATTENDING OUT-PATIENT CLINICS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF A TRAINING PROGRAMME ON KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS ATTENDING OUT-PATIENT CLINICS ", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p> INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0 Background to the Study</p> <p>Healthcare waste threatens the public health due to its contagious nature. Most healthcare facilities are located in the heart of the cities and therefore, healthcare waste that are not correctly managed can cause dangerous infection and pose potential threat to the nearby environment, health workers, patients and to the public (WHO, 2014). Dehghani, Azam, Changani and Fard (2008) noted that Healthcare Waste (HCW) if not appropriately managed can be a serious threat to human health due to their infectious attributes.  Nigeria, one of developing countries, has health issues that are competing for limited resources; it is not amazing that healthcare waste management receives less attention and precedence than it merits (Stephen, &amp; Elijah, 2011). Therefore, there is a serious challenge in developing countries, where there are no Institutional provisions for healthcare waste management. Clinical wastes are disposed openly in the dumpsite along with municipal waste and the practice make the members of the community gain access to it which may lead to outbreak of infectious diseases (Alagoz,  Kocasay, Abah, &amp; Ohimain, 2010) . Cheng, Sung, Yang, Lo, Chung and Li (2009) noted that as small as healthcare waste is in proportion to the total community waste, its management is considered an important issue worldwide. World Health Organization (2014) reported that 15% of total waste generated in the healthcare facility is hazardous and must be properly segregated at the point of generation to prevent the whole healthcare waste becoming 100% hazardous. The World Health Organization estimates that each year there are about 8 to 16 million new cases of Hepatitis B virus (HBV), 2.3 to 4.7 million cases of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 80,000 to 160,000 cases of human immune deficiency virus (HIV) due to unsafe injections disposal and mostly due to very poor waste management systems.</p> <p>Across the globe, the risk associated with Healthcare Waste (HCW) and its management has gained tremendous attention from health practitioners and non practitioners. If healthcare facilities know the types and quantities of clinical waste generated, it will help them in planning, budgeting adequate revenue for the management of hazardous waste (Bongayi, 2013). A study conducted by Olubukola (2009) in two General hospitals at Lagos reported that due to lack of quantification of healthcare waste, there was no waste reduction plan in the hospitals.</p> <p>This lack of plan for healthcare waste management eventually leads to inadequate waste segregation at point of use, collection, storage and final disposal. This poor healthcare waste management practice creates health hazards for health workers, patients and the environment. Identified gaps like lack of colour code bags for segregation of healthcare waste at point of use, lack of guidelines on segregation and disposal for health workers lead to poor healthcare waste management in hospitals. The mismanagement of healthcare waste by healthcare facilities does not pose health hazard to health workers and patients alone but also to patients’ visitors and the community where they are improperly disposed by contaminating the soil, air and water. Healthcare facilities are supposed to protect the health of people in their environment, not to be a creator of potential health hazard for them.</p> <p>Furthermore, increase in patient turned-out has increase the generation of healthcare waste. Mboguwe, Mimereki and Magashula(2008) also reported that increase in population results to increase in healthcare facilities that lead to increased healthcare waste generation. It is expected that because of this increase, more attention should be paid to and priority given to proper healthcare waste management in Abeokuta South Local Government (ASLG). Management of healthcare waste continues to present an array of challenges especially as economic situation of the country deepen daily therefore, healthcare waste management has become a concern.</p> <p>So many studies have been conducted on healthcare waste management but little or no work has been done concerning segregation of clinical waste which is a vital aspect in healthcare waste management (Coker, Sangodoyin, Sridhar, Booth, Olomolaiye, 2009). Segregation of waste is crucial in healthcare waste management because it is the first step in clinical waste management. Segregation of healthcare waste helps in reduction of the quantity of waste that is hazardous. Once  healthcare waste are segregated, collection will be easy, proper storage will be done and disposal of infectious waste carried out  in the way that it will not pose any harm to health workers, patients and the environment (WHO, 2014). Proper management of healthcare waste depends on good organization, sufficient funding and active participation of trained personnel. It was observed that healthcare facilities were not spending resources on clinical waste management Healthcare facility must allocate resources for colour coded bags and training of generator of healthcare waste for proper segregation and disposal for its sustainability. The intention of this study is to assess healthcare waste management practices at health facilities in Abeokuta South Local Government.</p> <p>1.2     Statement of the Problem</p> <p> Indiscriminate dumping of untreated hospital waste in Municipal bins increases the chances of survival and mutation of pathogenic microorganism population in the municipal waste, which can lead to disease epidemics and increased incidence of communicable disease in the community. The prevalence of infectious disease like Hepatitis B, C, Measles, Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, Tuberculosis, Chickenpox, Cholera and others has also been traced to the inappropriate segregation and disposal of hospital waste (Sreejith, 2008).In Ogun State, the researcher observed that the healthcare facilities neglected healthcare waste management in the area of segregation and disposal. Materials required for segregation and disposal of these hospital wastes are not provided by the constituted authority, thus these pose a serious threat to the health workers, patients, environments and the community at large. There has been recent cases of hospital acquired infectious diseases among health workers which has been traced to contamination from healthcare waste, leading to untimely death of some of these health workers.</p> <p>The indiscriminate dumping of hospital waste among domestic waste make the community members easily access it. A tour of these health facilities shows the absence of waste management facilities such as incinerators, autoclave, and microwave. Therefore, it is most likely that medical wastes are dumped at municipal site; this practice may lead to outbreak of communicable diseases. It is in the light of these problems identified above that the researcher developed interest in assessing healthcare waste management practices among health workers in Abeokuta South Local Government of Ogun State. The result of this study will be used to improve the healthcare waste management in health facilities in Abeokuta South Local Government. It will also provide empirical data to policy makers, researchers and other concern bodies to develop effective healthcare waste management policy in Abeokuta South Local Government and the country as a whole.</p> <p>1.3      Objective of the Study</p> <p>The main objective of this study is to assess the waste management practices of health workers in four healthcare facilities in Abeokuta South Local Government Area of Ogun State. The specific objectives are to:</p> <ol><li>identify different types of waste generated in Healthcare facilities in Abeokuta South Local Government (ASLG);</li> <li>determine the level of knowledge of health workers on Healthcare waste management and its segregation;</li> <li>assess the healthcare waste management as practiced by health workers and</li> <li>determine how healthcare wastes are finally disposed off, by the healthcare facilities in</li> </ol> <p>             ASLG.</p> <p>1.4       Research Questions</p> <ol><li>What are the types of Healthcare wastes generated at health facilities in ASLG?</li> <li>What is the level of knowledge of health workers on healthcare waste management?</li> <li>What is the practice of healthcare waste management by health workers?</li> <li>What is the final disposal of healthcare waste practiced by healthcare workers in ASLG?</li> </ol> <p>1.5       Hypothesis</p> <p>Ho1:   There is no significant relationship between knowledge and practice of respondents on      </p> <p>           Healthcare waste management in ASLG.</p> <p>1.6       Scope of the Study</p> <p>            The study focused on generation, segregation and final disposal of healthcare waste in healthcare facilities in Abeokuta South Local Government.

This is as a result of advancement in technology and patient’s demand for quality in response to increasing health care cost. Stress is considered a normal part of life which is necessary occasionally as a push to increasing functional capacity, but when it is experienced over a prolonged period it becomes detrimental to health leading to a decline in productivity ( Salleh, M.R., 2008) .</p> <p>Stress can be defined as a particular relationship between the person and the environment that is assessed by the person as taxing or exceeding his or her resources and endangering his or her well-being (Irving, J.A. et al., 2009). Stress on its own does not have any damaging effect on an individual; however individuals’ assessment of an event, their perceptions and interpretations give meaning and their coping ability determines whether events are viewed as threatening or positive. Personality traits also influence individual reaction to stress because what may be strenuous to one person may be stimulating to another (Robinson, M. D. et al., 2011).</p> <p>As far back as the mid-1950s, stress was regarded as an occupational hazard and occupational stress cited as a significant health problem (Jennings, B.M., 2009) while in the 1960s, patient’s care, decision making, taking responsibility, and change were identified as sources of anxiety among nurses which predisposed them to work stress (Menzies, 1960). Nurse’s role has long been regarded as stress-filled based upon the physical labor, human suffering, work hours, staffing, and interpersonal relationships that are central to what the work nurses do (Lukpata, F. E. et al., 2013).</p> <p>This stressful nature of nursing can ultimately lead to job dissatisfaction and burnout (Arafa, M.A., 2003). This statement is in line with some studies which conclude that the provision of health care services is demanding both physically and psychologically ( Ilhan, M.N., 2005). Nursing occupies a conspicuous position among the professions that have been identified as the most stressful worldwide as nurses relate with humans mostly in times of pain, suffering and death (Lukpata, F</p> <p>.E. et al., 2013).</p> <p>Nurses work tirelessly rendering care to critically and chronically ill patients who are between life and death in an environment where there is lack of tolerance for error (Rowe, J., 2003), all these can exert intense psychological and physical pressures on the health care giver leading to stress or burn out syndrome.</p> <p>Among health care professionals, nurses have been found to be most prone to burnout (Abushaikha, L. and Saca-Hazboun, H., 2009). This is more so because nurses are expected to deliver humane, empathetic, culturally sensitive, proficient and moral care, in working environments with limited resources, reduced supply of nurses and increasing responsibilities. Such imbalance between providing high quality care within an environment of limited resources leads to stress (Khamisa, N., 2015).</p> <p>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Job satisfaction and burnout among health care providers are important issues since they affect turnover rates, staff retention and ultimately the quality of patient care (Atencio, 2003). Burnout has been defined as “a syndrome of physical and emotional exhaustion, involving the development of stress which can lead to the development of negative self-concept, negative job attitudes and loss of concern for clients”. Burnout has also been associated with high employment turnover, excessive absenteeism, negative job attitudes, low morale and a reduction in willingness to help others (Abushaikha, L. and Saca-Hazboun, H., 2009).</p> <p>The way that an individual views and processes stress determines how much stress is felt and how close the person is to burnout. Perceptions of job stress and burnout are not just a product of work conditions because not all workers, exposed to the same conditions, develop burnout or perceive stress (Robinson, M. D. et al., 2011).</p> <p>An individual can be exposed to few stressors but be unable to process the stress well and thus experience burnout. Another person, however, can be exposed to a significant amount of stressors, but process each well, and avoid burnout. How close a person is to a state of burnout is greatly dependent on individual differences (Truby, B., 2009)</p> <p>According to psychological theories, stress is determined by the balance between the perceived demands from the environment and the individual’s resources to meet those demands (Ursin, H. and Eriksen, H.R., 2004)</p> <p>The International Council of Nurses (ICN) (2008) declares that nurses, doctors, and laboratory technicians experience the highest job related stress with 45 percent reporting that their jobs are quite or extremely stressful. Likewise, the International Labour Organization has identified nursing as an industry with relatively. Theses problems make it necessary to examine the influence of stress on work behavior among Nurses in Federal Medical Centre Abeokuta.</p> <p>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY     </p> <p>The general objective of this study is to investigate the influence of stress on work behavior among Nurses in Federal Medical Centre Abeokuta.
