Organisms islated include micrococcus, Bacillus and proteus. Soyabean paste was produced and divided into three portions, one portion was inoculated with the pureculture from caster beanseed \"ogiri\" the second portion was inoculated with caster bean seed \"ogiri\" (COSO) the rd part, the control was left without inoculation. Each of the three portions was subdivided into two to produce salted and non salted samples, and coded as SPCS (say pure culture salted) and SPCUS (Soy pure culture unsalted), SCOS (saywild fermented salted salted) and SWFUS (say wild fermented unsalted). Using Hedonic scale, a 9 \" man untrained panelists, were used to conduct sensory evaluation on the raw \"ogiri\"and \"ogiri\" with 7.5 point followed by the SCOUS with 7 points.</div> <div>There was no significant difference at 1% and 5% level for the sensory evaluation carried out.</div> </div> <div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></div> <div>TITLE PAGE</div> <div>APPROVAL PAGE</div> <div>DEDICATION</div> <div>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</div> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div>INTRODUCTION</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></div> <div>LITERATURE SURVEY</div> <div>ORIGIN AND BRIEF AGROMIC HISTORY OF CASTOR BEAN SEED</div> <div>2.1 INDUSTRIAL UTILIZATION OF CASTOR OIL BEAN SEED</div> <div>2.2 CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS IN CASTOR BEAN SEEDS.</div> <div>2.3 IMPORTANCE OF MICROORGANISMS IN CASTOR BEAN SEEDS</div> <div>2.4 ORIGIN OF SOYABEN</div> <div>2.5 INTRODUCTION OF SOYABEN IN NIGERIA.</div> <div>2.6 STORAGE / PROSESSING F SOYABEN INTO VARIOUS TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS.</div> <div>2.7 VALUES OF SOYABEAN PRODUCT</div> <div>2.8 TYPICAL ISOFLAVONES CONTENT OF SOYAFOOD (PER 100g).</div> <div>2.9 NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION OF SOYAMILK (PER 100g)</div> <div>2.10 AMIND ACID IN SOYAPROTIEN</div> <div>2.11 UNDESIRABLE COMPOSITIONS OF </div> <div>2.12 FERMENTATION TRADITIONAL</div> <div>2.13 FERMENTATION</div> <div>2.14 FACTORS AFFECTING FERMENTATION</div> <div>2.15 FERMENTE VEGETABLE PROTEIN</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></div> <div>MATERIALS AND METHODS</div> <div>3.1 SOURCE OF RAW MATERIALS</div> <div>3.2 SAMPLX PREPARATION METHODS</div> <div>3.3 MEDIA USED</div> <div>3.4 CULITUE OF SAMPLES</div> <div>3.5 BIOCHEMICAL TESTS</div> <div>3.6 SUGAR FERMENTATION TESTS</div> <div>3.7 CHARACTERISTICE OF ISOLATES</div> <div>3.8 SENSORY EVALUATION OF THE SAMPLES</div> <div>3.9 PROXIMATE ANALYSIS OF THE PROCED SOYAOGIRI AND CASTOR BEAN JEED OGIRI.</div> <div>3.10 PROTEIN CONTENT DETERMINATION</div> <div>3.11 FAT CONTENT DETERMINATION</div> <div>3.12 TOTAL ASH DETERMINATION</div> <div>3.13 CRUDE FIBRE DETERMINATION</div> <div>3.14 MOISTURE CONTENT DETERMINATION</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></div> <div>4.1 MENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA ISOLATE FROM ANALYSED CASTOR BEAN SEED OGIRI</div> <div>4.2 TABLE FOR GENERAL ACCEPTABILITY OF THE THREE MAIN SAMPLES</div> <div>4.3 TABLE IN.</div> <div>4.4 DISCUSSION</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></div> <div>5.0 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION</div> <div>5.1 CONCLUSION</div> <div>5.2 RECOMMENTATION</div> <div><strong>REFERENCES</strong></div> </div>\n\nPRODUCTION OF \"OGIRI\" FROM SOYABEAN USING MICRO ORGANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR FERMENTATION OF CASTOR BEANS SEED \"OGIRI\" (COMMERCIAL \"OGIRI\")<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION OF \"OGIRI\" FROM SOYABEAN USING MICRO ORGANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR FERMENTATION OF CASTOR BEANS SEED \"OGIRI\" (COMMERCIAL \"OGIRI\")", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study was carried out to determine the functional properties of cassava flour produced using different drying method namely sundried and oven dried. The flours were obtaining from cassava (Manihot Esculent Crantz) by peelings, washing, cooking, slicing or chopping, drying, milling  and sieving. The flours obtained were evaluated for functional properties. The flours samples have functional properties ranging from pH dilution 6.35% to 6.65%, bulk density 0.66g/m to 0.72g/ml, water absorption capacity 3.00 to 5.00ml, oil absorption capacity 1.76% to 0.88%, emulsification capacity 42.64% to 45.26%, gelation capacity point 10m to 15ml, gelation temperature 600 to 700c and 2.29 pas to 2.09pas viscosity measurement. The result of this study showed that the drying methods have effect on functional properties of the two different drying method of cassava flour. </em></p><p><br/><em><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>\r\n

women of child bearing age. Six (6) research questions were formulated and questionnaires were administered to one hundred (100) respondents in order to gather data for the research. Results showed that the pregnant women are aware of the importance of good nutrition to a child bearing mother. It was discovered that the level of education among child bearing age mother does affect their level of food intake in the area of study. The result also revealed that poor food intake can lead to malformation of the unborn child.

Nutrition is a fundamental pillar of human life, health and development throughout the entire life span (World Bank, 2006). Proper food and good nutrition are essential for survival, physical growth, mental development, performance and productivity, health and wellbeing. However, the nutrition requirement varies with respect to age, gender and during physiological changes such as pregnancy. Pregnancy is such a critical phase in a woman’s life, when the expecting mother needs optimal nutrients of superior qualities to support the developing fetus. Naturally, the urge to eat more is experienced by nearly all pregnant women.</p> <p>Pregnancy is considered to be a delightful experience for the expectant mother. Evidences manifested that adequate intake of nutrition is a key component for individual’s health and well-being, particularly during pregnancy. It is well documented that inadequate maternal nutrition results in increased risks of short term consequences such as; Intra Uterine Growth Restriction(IUGR), low birth weight, preterm birth, prenatal and infant mortality and morbidity. Moreover, excessive intake of nutrients during pregnancy can lead to some pregnancy complications (such as, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, macrosomia, distocia and higher prevalence of cesarean section). On the other hand, as the long run outcomes, inadequate intake of nutrients were found to have pathophysiologic or metabolic depict that will appear as disorders of child growth and development as well as adult chronic disease after a long period of quiescence. (Rocco PL, Orbitello B, Perini L, Pera V, Ciano RP,2005)</p> <p>According to Nagiebs (2003) opined that eating well during pregnancy means do more than simply increase how much the mother eats. The mother must also consider what she eats. The ability of mother to provide nutrients and oxygen for her baby is a critical factor for fetal health and its survival. Failure in supplying the adequate amount of nutrients to meet fetal demand can lead to fetal malnutrition. The fetus responds and adapts to under nutrition but by doing so it permanently alters the structure and function of the body. Maternal over nutrition also has long-lasting and detrimental effects on the health of the offspring.</p> <p>Naomi M (2010) Malnutrition is one of the most serious health problems affecting children and their mothers in Ethiopia. Undernourished mothers face greater risks during pregnancy and childbirth, and their children set off on a weaker developmental path, both physically and mentally. Undernourished children have lower resistance to infection and are more likely to die from common childhood ailments as diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections. Those who survive may be locked into a vicious cycle of recurring sickness and faltering growth, often with irreversible damage to their cognitive and social development. Malnutrition prevents individuals and even the whole country from achieving full potential, and is closely related with survival, poverty and development. The incidence of dietary inadequacies as a result of dietary habits and patterns in pregnancy is higher during pregnancy than at any other stage of the life cycle. It was shown that, nutrition knowledge was predictive of change in dietary habits and health advices encouraged expectant women to advance their food intake positively.  </p> <p>Several studies including Villar has indicated that the correlation between poor maternal nutritional status and adverse birth outcomes is complex and are influenced by many biologic, socioeconomic, and demographic factors, which vary widely in different populations. It is therefore, the promotion of women’s health and other preventive health care practice should start before birth, during intrauterine life and extends throughout different phases of their lives in order to sustain their reproductive health in general. The importance of maternal nutrition during pregnancy has long been recognized. The National Academy of Science in America issued a report that reviewed studies of reproductive experience concluded that adequate prenatal nutrition was one of the most important environmental factors affecting the health of pregnant women and their babies. (Villar J, Merialdi M, Abalos E, Carroli G, et al., 2003)</p> <p>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>According to UNICEF (2009), each year, more than half a million women die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Nearly 4 million newborns die within 28 days of birth. Many of the 200 million women who become pregnant each year, most of them in developing countries, suffer from ongoing nutritional deficiencies repeated infections and the long term cumulative consequences of under nutrition during their own childhood years.</p> <p>Many women suffer from a combination of chronic energy deficiency, poor weight gain in pregnancy, anemia, and other micronutrient deficiencies, as well as infections like HIV and malaria. Poor nutrition diminishes a woman’s productivity, causing repercussions for herself, her family, her community, and the broader society. Maternal malnutrition is influenced not only by lack of adequate nutrition but also influenced by factors like socio demographic factors, nutritional knowledge of mothers during pregnancies. It is on this ground that this research work investigate into the awareness of good nutrition during pregnancy among women of child bearing age.</p> <p>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Specific objectives</p> <p>1.   To assess the awareness of pregnant mothers with regard to nutrition in the pregnancy.</p> <p>2.   To investigate how good nutrition enhances pregnancy.</p> <p>3.   To find out if poor nutrition affects the unborn child and the mother.</p> <p>4.   To determine if lack of awareness of good nutrition by the mother have any effect on the feotus.</p> <p>5.   To identify the strategies to ensure good nutrition during pregnancy.</p> <p>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>The following research questions were formulated by the researcher to guide the research study.</p> <p>1.           Are child bearing age mothers aware of the necessary food intake during pregnancy?</p> <p>2.           How does good nutrition enhance pregnancy among mothers of child bearing age women?</p> <p>3.           Does poor nutrition among child bearing age women affect the proper development of the unborn child?</p> <p>4.           Does lack of awareness of good nutrition by a child bearing age mother have any effect on her and the feotus?</p> <p>5.           What strategies should be put in place to ensure awareness of good nutrition during pregnancy for child bearing age mother?</p> <p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The benefits that could be derived from the outcome of this research work are as follows:</p> <p>1.           It will serve as a source of information and awareness to pregnant women on the type of food they should eat during pregnancy.</p> <p>2.           It will provide useful information for midwives and health care provider on how to educate the women on the type of food they should consume during pregnancy.</p> <p>3.           The result of the research work will also be important to health officials, ministry of health and the general public on how to take balance diet during pregnancy by a pregnant woman.</p> <p>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The study is based on the awareness of good nutrition during pregnancy among women of child bearing age in Benin City, Edo State.

The work of nutrition educators takes place in colleges, universities and schools, government agencies, cooperative extension, communications and public relations firms, the food industry, voluntary and service organizations and with other reliable places of nutrition and health education information.</p> <p>        The American Dietetic Association (ADA) published a position paper regarding the nutritional needs of teenagers. This paper stated that the health of adolescents is dependent on normal dietary intakes and that the provision of foods that contain adequate energy and nutrients was essential for physical, social and cognitive growth and development.</p> <p>        Adequate nutrient intake during adolescence is very important for many reasons. Adolescence is a particularly unique period of life because it is a time of intense physical, psychological and cognitive development.</p> <p>        Adolescence is a transition phase to adulthood. The age of adolescence encapsulates a window of time when bodies are metamorphosing and evolving into that of an adult. It is a time when the adolescent tries to establish his own identify yet desperately seeks to be socially accepted by his peers (Lulinski, 2001). During adolescence hormonal changes accelerate growth in height. Growth is faster than at any other time in the individual’s life except the first year (Brasel, 1982). Increased nutritional needs at this juncture relate to the fact that adolescents gain up to 50% of their adult weight, more than 20% of their adult height and 50% of their adult skeletal mass during this period (Brasel, 1982). The adolescent therefore face series of serious nutritional challenges which would impact on this rapid growth spurt as well as their health as adults. However, the adolescent remain a largely neglected, difficult to-measure, hard-to-reach population. Consequently, the needs, particularly those of adolescent girls are often ignored (Kurz and Johnson-Welch, 1994).</p> <p>        At this developmental stages, protein requirements maximal. Increased physical activity, combined with poor eating habit and other considerations, for example, menstruation, oral contraceptive use and pregnancy contribute to accentuating the potential risk for adolescents of poor nutrition.</p> <p>1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>        Poor nutritional choices and practices have been shown to increase during adolescence; the need for nutrition education becomes clear. It is important that health educators look into nutrition education and its impact on the dietary habits of adolescent females. Several studies have been conducted that show how nutrition education impacts the dietary habits of adolescents.</p> <p>        These studies have reviewed the effect of nutrition education on adolescent athletes and have analyzed how nutrition education impacts snack patterns.</p> <p>        The main nutritional problems affecting adolescent populations in particular include under-nutrition in terms of stunning and wasting. Others are deficiencies of micronutrients such as iron and vitamin a, obesity and other specific nutrient deficiencies (Kurz and Johnson-Welch, 1994).</p> <p>        Adolescents because they are still growing, who enter into marriage with poor nutritional status are likely to give birth to smaller infants than mature women of the same nutritional status (WHO, 1995) because of the competition for nutrients between the growing adolescent and the growing fetus (Scholl et al, 1990) andpoorer placental function (Colson, 1987). Undernourished adolescent girls and women give birth to underweight and often stunned babies. These infants are less able to learn as young children and are more likely themselves to be parents to infants with intrauterine growth.</p> <p>        Retardation and low birth weight. However, they are less able to generate livelihoods and are less equipped to resist chronic diseases in later life. Such lifecycle and intergenerational links demand sustained, long term ameliorative action (ACC/SCN, 2000) which this study aims to provide.</p> <p>1.2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <ol><li>To assess the impact of nutrition education on the nutritional intake of female secondary school students.</li> <li>To educate adolescent girls about sources of nutrient and balance diet.</li> <li>To help improve the eating habits of adolescent girls.</li> <li>To serve as a guide to nutrition educators and dieticians</li> <li>To recommend nutrition education as part of the curriculum of secondary school in Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p>1.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>          The aim of this study is to outline the importance of nutrition education to improving the nutrient intake of adolescent girls.</p> <p>        One particular group of interest is the adolescent female few studies have reviewed the impact of nutrition education on the dietary intakes of the average adolescent female. In the present study, the effect of a term long nutrition education class on the dietary habits of adolescent females in secondary schools in Benin City was examined. This study compared dietary intakes of female students who completed a nutrition education class to female students who did not. The findings in the present study are important in that they help nutrition educators and dietician understands if adolescent female who are provide with a one term time period will develop better eating habits than females who do not receive nutrition education.</p> <p>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>        This research questions will be on socio-demographic characteristics of adolescent girls, their dietary habits and nutritional knowledge.</p> <p>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        This study shall be restricted to secondary school in Egor L.G.A, Edo State of Nigeria only in the realization of similar condition facing female students in other states of Nigeria. The survey shall be on nutrient intake only of adolescent girls.</p> <p>        Nutrition education lectures shall be held for the subjects and pamphlets and handouts shall be used to facilitate the lectures.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF NUTRITION EDUCATION ON THE DIETARY HABITS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF NUTRITION EDUCATION ON THE DIETARY HABITS", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS.</p> <p>CHAPTER  ONE</p> <p>DIFINITION</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>CHAPTER  TWO</p> <p>2.1       DIFFERENT METHODS OF PRODUCTION OF PROTEN HYDROLYSATE USING ENZYMATIC AND CHEMICAL METHODS    </p> <p>2.2              USES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES IN FOOD SYSTEM</p> <p>2.3              ADVANTAGES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES OVER NATIVE PROTEIN</p> <p>2.4              LIMITATIONS OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES IN FOOD SYSTEM</p> <p>2.5              METHODS OF DEBITTERING THE HYDROLYSATES</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>CONCLLISION</p> <p>REFERENCES</p> <p>CHAPTER  ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Definition:       Protein hydrolysate could be defined as the end product of protein hydrolysis using chemical and enzymic methods.</p> <p>Protein hydrolysate have many uses in specialty foods such as non allergenic infant formular, diets foods and other special nutritional foods.</p> <p>The drawback of many hydrolysates such as Soya or Casein hydrolysates is the bitter taste that develops when they are hydrolysated into small peptides with protease enzymes.</p> <p>Protein maldigestion which is often associated with cystic fibrosis and allergy to milk protein may be overcome by replacing intact in the diet with synthetic amino acid mixture, or with enzymic protein hydrolysates. Hydrolysates may be the treatment of choice for two reasons. The amino acids and small peptides constituents of protein hydrolysates have been shown to be more readily ascribed from the small intestine than their equivelent pure amino acid mixture, more over, protein hydrolysates are considerably less expensive than synthetic amino acid mixtures. Nonetheless, protein hydrolysates suffer from a serious drawback, namely, the occurrence of a bitter taste which develops during the course of the enzymic hydrolysis.</p> <p>Murray r (1952) demonstrated that a treatment of enzymic casein hydrolysates with activated carbon resulted in a substantial improvement in the taste of preparations. However, authors regarded this method of improving the taste as impractical due to the simultaneous loss of a large proportion of the hyptophan during treatment. A different approach was presented in move recent studies in which a casein hydrolysate relatively free of bitter taste was obtained by the sequential employment of papa in and of pig’s kidney homogenate – the latter serving as a source of exopeptidases. However, extended time periods of hydrolysis were required, which necessitated the use of dolor form to control bacterial growth.</p> <p>There is a variety of food and biomedical applications for protein which have been solubilized by enzymatic hydrolysis. Their enhanced solubility, heat stability, and resistance to precipitation in acidic environs, where many proteins are insoluble, offer attractive features to biochemists and nutritionists involve the research and development of high protein food formulations.</p> <p>Applications of these valuable protein supplements may have merit in the diet of persons with digestive disorders, pre and post operative abdominal surgical patient, geriatric and convalescent feeding , and for other who for various reasons do not ingest a well balanced diet. Unfortunately, the use of enzyme – treated hydrolysates in dietary food applications has in many instances, been limited due to the presence of bitter flovour component. The unpalatability of these hydrolysate  arises mainly from the formation of bitter peptide and amino acids liberated during the hydrolytic process. The bitterness appease to be closely related to the content and sequence of hydrophobic amino acids in the peptides.</p> <p>Further hydrolysis of pepsin digested soy protein using a bacterial proteins or an exopeptidase, reduced bitterness. Also, chemotropic plastering protein hydrolysates. Similarly, clegg and Mc Millan (1974) have reported that a combination enzyme treatment of case in using papain for 18 hr followed by the addition of a homogenate of swine kidney cortex, also produced a hydrolysate with reduced bitterness.</p> <p>As another approach to resolving the bitter flavor problem, it seemed reasonable to attempt flavor improvement of protein hydrolysates by reducing the hydrophobic peptide and amino acid content of the digests. It was recognize many years earlier that activated carbon would absorb the aromatic  amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenycalaline. At a later date, Murrgy and Baker utilized carbon to treat a commercial enzymic hydrolysate of casein and reported the taste was greatly improved. A bitter tasting polypeptide fraction was elutated from the carbon.</p> <p>Various phenol-formaldehyde resins with structures similar to carbon are available commercially and are used in a wide variety of ion-exchange and absorbent applications. Therefore the ability of a phenol-fomaldeliyde resin polymer to interact preferentially with the monoplane groups present in hydrophobic peptide was determined from the findings a hydrophobic chromatography process for debittering protein hydrolysates was developed.</p> <p>It has been well documented that the main problem in the preparation of soluble hydrolysate from protein such as casein is the difficulty in preventing the formation of bitter peptides or in removing them from the hydrolysate. Among several studies on casein hydrolysates the process developed by clegg and Mc Millan (1974) using skim milk as substrate, should be mentioned. By hydrolyzing skim milk protein with papain, a bitter testing hydrolysate is formed which is rendered bland by subsequent hydrolysis with exopeptidase from pig kidney tissue. Unfortunately, the procedure is both lengthy and costly. Anther costly debittering process involves hydrophobic chromatography of enzymatic protein hydrolysate on hexyls sepharose. An extraction method using azeotropic secondary butyl alcohol by which complete removal of bitter compounds is also achieved.</p> <p>In the course of a study aimed a producing at a reasonable cost, bland, soluble skim milk hydrolysate without a significant loss of nutritional value, a comparison was made of adsorption methods of debittering pronase- and ficinhydroly-zed skim milks. The result of the comparison and the partial identification of the bitter peptides formed in the skim milk hydrolysates is reported. Due to the minimum changes in taste and appearance afforded to soft drinks or fruit juices by addition of this treated skim milk, the resultant beverages are expected to appear and taste like the original beverages with almost full nutritional value of skim milk.</p> <p>It is widely known that bitterness sometimes is produced in sake and other fermented products, so decreasing their qualities. This bitterness is produced by bitter peptides and their derivatives formed during the ageing process of these fermented products. Enzymatic hydrolysis of protein also produces bitter peptides very often to decrease the value of the products.</p> <p>Since those bitter peptides are known to be produced by enzymatic hydrolysis, several attempts to reduce the production of bitter peptides during the enzymatic hydrolysis process by changing the enzymes and or conditions of the reactions have been made.</p> <p>Skim milk, soybean casein, whey protein concentrate (NPC) and casein hydrolysate of course composed of amino acids. Because a debittering method for bitter peptides was being looked for protein and peptides could block the bitterness. Creaming powder, Vegetable oil and margarine are fatly substances, which could block hydrophobic groups of bitter peptides by their character to reduce the bitterness. Some acidic amino acids were added in order to confirm their ability for masking bitterness, Asp, Glu and tau being used for the study. Although taurine (Tau) is not an acidic amin acid, it has a very strongly acidic function. Taurine was expected to reduce the bitterness as well as other acidic amino acids or peptides.</p> </div>\n\nPRODUCTION AND USES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES AN REMOVAL OF BITTERING PRINCIPLES IN IT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION AND USES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES AN REMOVAL OF BITTERING PRINCIPLES IN IT", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> CHAPTER ONE:     INTRODUCTION <p>1.1       Food packaging definition</p> <p>1.2       History of food packaging</p> <p>1.3       Reasons or purpose of food packaging</p> <p>1.4       Types of food packaging</p> <p>1.5       Functions of food packaging</p> <p>1.6       Role of packaging</p> <p>1.7       Characteristics</p> CHAPTER TWO:    LITERATURE REVIEW <p>2.1       Effect of food packaging material on our environment </p> <p>2.2       Littering</p> <p>2.3       Health Effect</p> <p>2.4       Pollution Effect</p> CHAPTER THREE <p>3.1       Summary and conclusion</p> <p>3.2       Recommendation</p> <p>References or Bibliography</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0              INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Food packaging is just one among ways of food preservation for when food is been packaged, it is set for shipment and marketing. Food Technologist who must have a good knowledge of technology materials, labour equipment, money research, engineering and management is in any food-processing establishment.</p> <p>Particularly, food packages purposely protect the products from environment hazards throughout the period of the shelf life. Some industries can even be instituted purposely for food packaging. For these facts, every Food Technologist must acquire the knowledge of packaging principle and practice as to meet up with the specific requirement of food in order way to retain its quality, throughout the processing of storage and distribution and even specified the demands in which the food imposed on the packages.</p> <p>Though, it the sole responsibility of the specialist who can design and manufacture these packages. And because of that, the packages physically protect and maintain quality of the product, and it attracts the consumers and even be within an average at economic cost.</p> <p>1.1       PACKAGING DEFINITION</p> <p>It is an overall stages in production of product planning involving designing and producing the container or wrapper of the product. The following can serve as a definition of packaging. Packaging could also be an elaborated mattress where you sleep on and the sheets and blanket covering it came out from packaging.  Packaging also is likened to a cereal you have for breakfast and the milk and sugar on it, which in packages. Packaging materials are towels, soap toothpaste, colognes and lotion and the clothes you wear a you get ready to tale the days activities, all comes in packages. Food packaging materials could be defined as you go through the day nearly everything that you touch eat use or with which arrived in a package.</p> <p>Food packaging   materials can be enlisted as common place such as intergal part of our existence which tends to take things for granted, ignoring their presence and contribution of our every daily lives. It is prescribed as military supplies; where more general sense, are purchased for the use of government agency services. It is also an embodiment of a dynamic of a center where people are socially engaged for the day.</p> <p>Packaging is explained as merely preserved food over a past few years which have become a tool of marketing operations.</p> <p>1.2       HISTORY OF FOOD PACKAGING</p> <p>An early man developed his own packaging technology by using leaves for wrapping purposes in Nigeria such as cocoyam, banana, and plantain and “uma” leaves. Again the skin of a goat for the first flexible packaging material in the environmental through transport of water and wine. Early containers were made by placating rushes or reeds and small wooden casks produced by methods similar to those used by coopers today which is evidenced. </p> <p>Ancient Egyptians were masters of art of preservation and this is demonstrated in tombs of pharaohs, not only in the preservation of bodies but also on other materials. However, it is just beginning with modern packaging as original from industrial resolution changed the structure of society and concentrated through large members of people in the town, cities so altering their habits and creating a great demand for similar quantities of various products in large replications.</p> <p>Today packaging must do much more than merely preserve food and over the past few years which have seen packaging more and more become a tool of marketing operation.</p> <p>It protects the meat product from microbial contamination’s, light, physical damage or chemical changes. Moreover a good job of packaging with the proper type of packing material may also enhance the appearance of the products and make I t more appealing to the consumers.</p> <p>It again has a multi-purpose functions for food product primary manufacturer protect the food product by keeping it  in good condition and preserve the flavour until it researchers the consumer.</p> <p>It is essentially suitable forms of packaging products to a finished level. Food material used for packaging must not contaminate the product. It must also be effective in preventing the products from deteriorating.</p> <p>1.2.2        TYPES OF FOOD PACKAGING MATERIALS</p> <p>(i)                 Foil – 0015 –</p> <p>(ii)               Laminates</p> <p>(iii)             Coasted sheets</p> <p>(iv)             Films</p> <p>(v)               Metals</p> <p>(vi)             Plastics</p> <p>(vii)           Traditional</p> <p>(viii)         Industrial</p> <p>i           Foil – 0015</p> <p>ii          Laminates of one or more of the above materials</p> <p>iii         Coasted sheets</p> <p>iv         Films M.S.A.P (moisture resistant sealable anchors well to product, transparent)</p> <p>v          Metals such as tin plate, tinfree steel and aluminum</p> <p>vi         Plastics which including a variety of homogeneous films, coasted films, laminates with other plastics, papers or metals (eg aluminum)</p> <p>vii        Papers, paperboardsm fiber boards</p> <p>viii       Traditional. This cannot withstand rough handling but have no advertising potential and are not suitable in protecting the product in long distance distribution.</p> <p>ix         Industrial:  This is where material is used for packaging of food widely by including cartons, cups boxes etc.</p> <p>SELECTION OF PACKAGING MATERIALS</p> <p>            This depend intrinsically on natures and other properties of product and on the other consideration indicted above</p> <p>1.2.3    FUNCTIONS OF FOOD PACKAGING CONTAINER OF PRODUCT  </p> <p>Obviously, it act as a carrier by making it possible to move he product from the point where it is made to the point of final consumers. Examples are industrial gases, oxygen, propane carbondioxide and so on.</p> <p>PERFORMANCE:</p> <p>Sometimes utility or convenience features in packaging where most people acquainted with convenience features in packaging.</p> <p>COMMUNICATION:</p> <p>They must able to identify the product, inform the user, and motivated the consumer to buy the product, use it properly and purchase it again.</p> <p>CONTAMINAION</p> <p>It must keep the product clean and provide a barrier against dirt and other infection. It must provide protection of food against physical damage, moisture, oxygen and light etc.</p> <p>SMOOTHLY:</p> <p>It’s efficiently and economically utilized on the packaging line during the actual operation of putting the food into the package. This means that it must be designed to run an already buy line for a purpose.</p> <p>IDENTIFICATION</p> <p>It provide an identity information and sales appeal. The retail which must sell what they protect as well as what they sell.</p> <p>CONVENIENCE</p> <p>Degree should be built into convenience design which will not only supply the ultimate consumer with, say an easy opening, closing but must provide convenience at its intermediate stage in handling through warehouse and transport during distribution.</p> <p>1.3       ROLE OF FOOD PACKAGING</p> <p>There container product for your inspection abound in nearly every store you go into. Again large portion of some industries go into packaging about 70% of all glass produced in the United State is used for packaging, most of it is for food and beverages.</p> <p>About half of he fiber products made in the U.S. today go into packaging, appearing as paper and paperboard packages and corrugated paperboard shipping containers for a board range of product. The dollar value of those materials is frequently estimated to worth well over 0 billion which means when its materials passes through further manufacturing    steps, and the value of others services.</p> <p>1.3.1                                THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD PACKAGING MATERIAL</p> <p>1.         An oxygen barrier (for frozen and cured meats not for fresh) most present oxygen to present lowering quality.</p> <p>2.         Moldable and pliable at low temperature</p> <p>3.         Flavorless and tasteless</p> <p>4.         Kesistant to scuffing and tearing</p> <p>5.         High …. Strength</p> <p>6.         Adequate of labeling</p> <p>7.         Time saving and also low price</p> <p>8.         Most barrier moisture more through in form of vapour. Generally good moisture vapour barriers are good oxygen barrier.</p> <p>9.         It must also prevent us with stripability and attractive.</p> </div>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF FOOD PACKAGING MATERIAL ON THE ENVIRONMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF FOOD PACKAGING MATERIAL ON THE ENVIRONMENT", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> TABLE OF CONTENTS CHAPTER ONE <p>1.0       Introduction</p> <p>1.1              Suya as a traditional meat</p> <p>1.2              Aims and objectives</p> CHAPTER TWO <p>2.0       Literature Review</p> <p>2.1              Function Of A Package Meat And Meat Prodcut</p> <p>2.2              Different Packaging Materials And Their Properties</p> <p>2.3              Processing Of Suya</p> <p>2.4              Methods Of Proximate Analysis</p> <p>2.5              Results Of Proximate Analysis</p> CHAPTER THREE <p>3.0              Recommendation</p> <p>3.1       Use Of Different Packaging Mateiral In Industry</p> <p>3.2              Use Of Aluminum Foil As Packaging Material</p> <p>3.3              Metal Cans As Packaging Materials</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>References</p>  CHAPTER ONE  <p>1.0              INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Meat is a flesh of animals consumed for foods.  In the topics, the bulk of the meat consumed is derived from cow, sheep, cattle, pigs, camel etc.  The other aspect of a dead animal such as the offal’s (kidney, liver, intestine etc) and the skin are often consumed, but one not termed meat; which ever part of it is meat is usually consumed for its high quality protein content essential for body growth and repairs.</p> <p>The proportions of meat derived foods that one consumed are related to the general, affluence of the society in which he lives. Meat consumption in the developed countries is more than in less developed countries is more than in less developed countries. Ihekoronye, A. I and Ngoddy, P.O. (1985)</p> <p>The most common meat product include Beef (cow), pork (pig), mutton (sheep) and they are commonly used in making sausages, burgers, meat rolls suya meat and sometimes, they are eaten like that. The food technologist is not only interested in those products, but also mostly interested in the process leading to the slaughtering of animals final quality of meat or meat product is usually influenced by both.</p> <p>SLAUGHTER FACTORS AND THE INITIAL HEALTH OF THE ANIMAL</p> <p>Animal for slaughtering must be healthy and usually not so old. This requirement is necessary if a high quality product is to be obtained.</p> <p>Suya is popular roasted and smoked sliced beet product, suya is a traditional meat product originating from the Northern part of Nigeria; and it has gained considerable acceptability and popularity in the south too. It is produced by community meant into straws and passing with slight pressure through sticks. The meat is sprinkled with spices, groundnut oil, dry pepper and heat treated by a process involving dry cooking (roasting) by heat from a burning wood or charcoal. Kafidiya, O.O. (1981)</p> <p>            Suya meat is an ideal source of animal protein and its inclusion in a balanced diets should go a long way towards improving nutrition, but  technological problems need to be overcome before the product can be successfully and safely  processed, packaged and presented to the consumer Igene, J. O. (1982).</p> <p>            Increased demand for convenience foods has resulted in expansion of the processed meat industry. The consumption of suya has been accelerated, especially in southern Nigeria. The traditional method of producing suya is processed with the view to effecting some modifications where necessary to improve hygiene, palatability, characteristics and shelf stability. Kafidya, O.O (1981).</p> <p>            The recent up range of food prices in Nigeria has been the result of a number of complex circumstances, both domestic and international.</p> <p>            A substantial amount of the diet protein in the nation is obtained from crops. The level of animal protein in take is only about 17 percent of this total protein consumed by the average Nigerian, which is far from minimum recommended this situation could be improved by developing the food processing sector, especially meat and meat products.</p> <p>            The high quality of meat protein is well established and is essential in the maintenance to a healthy population. Development in the quantitative as well as qualitative production of suya could have a remarkable impact on the animal protein nutrition in Nigeria in view of the diverse and cheap sources of raw materials for suya processing. Suya is within the reach of most members of the population due to its unit price and as such contributes to a growing proportions of the much needed animal protein.</p> <p>            The process of economic development in any society pre-surposes a structural and social transformation of immense proportions such a transformation requires changes in the attitudes of people, changing the techniques of production and changes in preferences. Consumers expect amongst other things that the food available to them be cheap, clean, safe, unadulterated, reasonable priced and handled under sanitary conditions; for this to be possible, systematic machinery needs to be developed so that the  technological demands of the products as well as consumer are satisfied.</p> <p>            A prime source of long term productivity gains is technological innovation. New methods, new materials and new machines contribute to a faster rate of gain in output per man hour. Rapid organization has continued to raise income in the nation and has led to the changes in the nation an has led to the changes in the nature of demands for food with growing emphasis on convenience food such as ‘suya’. A revolution in the aesthetic qualitative and quantitative production of suya is one way by which Nigerian improves the level of protein nutrition of its people.</p> <p>            In many of the major urban area of the country, the number of suya meat, the number of suya meat has increased tremendously over the past decade, while consumption has become improved with respect to ethnicity, re4lijorn, socio- economic factor or sex. Unfortunately, however, suya production is still at its technology standard, in which the production me4thords that have been in use for the past generation are yet to be replaced or modernized to cope with increasing demand.</p> <p>            AS demand for improve suya becomes apparent, there is a need to focus more attentions on the search for ways to reduce the drudger in the suya industry. While government and foundation have expended millions of naira on research over the years to improve productivity of agriculture’s, research expenditure in the area of suya processing, packaging, storage and distribution has been  non-existence, and the reason can be advanced for this phenomenon, it can be argued that the decision to transform any mode of production is basically economic. Such dissension involves:</p> <p>i)          Availability of a more efficient production method.</p> <p>ii)         Calculation of the real benefit to be gained by effecting the change.    </p> <p>            Although millions of people may be engaged in the production of suya, the industry has a slow rate of growth. At the moment, knowledge about the economic of the current procurement and production methods is the suya industries are non-existent. Nor is there any adequate scientific information abuo9t the nutritional and health effects of suya meat. No information exists as the health hazards or otherwise which is increased consumption of the product might stand foe the consumption population.</p> <p>            In fact, in the recent study by Igene and Mohammed (1981), it was reported that 74 percent of those surveyed expressed great dissatisfaction regarding the unhygienic conditions prevailing in the places where suya is processed and dispensed to consumers and 84 percent of those surveyed strongly believe that suya processed and dispensed in unhygienic surroundings could cause serious health bazaar risks to consumers. This is the big image problem of suya amongst the enlightened Nigerians (who incidentally could spend much money on suya but turn their back on the product for sanitary reasons).</p> <p>THE MAJOR AREAS IN WHICH RESEARCH IS URGENTLY NEEDED INTO MANY ASPECTS OF SUYA PRODUCTION</p> <p>            Although, technical progress is the key to increasing food production. Information is necessary on research into many aspects of suya production and packaging. Among the major areas in which researchers is urgently needed are</p> <p>i)          A survey of the economic of suya production.</p> <p>ii)         Determination of consumer preferences and attitudes to the product.</p> <p>iii)        Microbiological attributes or characteristics of the health and nutritional importance.</p> <p>iv)                Level of employment generation and mobility in the industry.</p> <p>v)                  Detailed scientific analysis and properties of the product in relation to accepted standards in the food and drug trade.</p> <p>vi)                Research into product development and packaging of improved suya product as well as more efficient techniques of suya processing, preservation  and storage.</p> <p>What emerge therefore from a resolution of the items (i - vi) which constituted a technological barrier would obviously lead to progress and technological innovation.</p> <p>1.1         SUYA AS A TRADITIONAL MEAT</p> <p>suya is a traditional product and any innovation in technology must take cognizance of the nature of the product as such. A structural transformation of the suya industry is what is needed at the moment because the present procedure may not take advantage of available technology for obvious reason.</p> <p>            In the structural transformation one can imagine a situation whereby entrepreneurs and government could invest in the suya industry, thereby raising production above then primary level as well as taking production “off the streets” with the solely purpose of commercialization. The industry has many technological needs and it is possible indeed likely that some of these needs could only be meet through investment by entrepreneurs or government indigenous technological innovation.</p> <p>            Suya, being a traditional meat product would require certain technological innovation which could not be imported and which is not already in use in other industries. This is the crux of the matter. For technological innovation to succeed in the suya business, it must not only be efficient but also must conform to the traditional nature of the product to a large extent. It is therefore important that the critical requirement of the industry be conveyed to the engineering community if their efforts are to result in innovation which can succeed in the market place.</p> <p>            The food industry cannot survive in isolated place from the engineering society / community. Innovation is needed in the development of indigenous machinery and processors to enhance fabrication processing packaging and storage. The way to improve the suya industry therefore rests squarely on a structural transformation or the mode of procurement, processing, packaging and distribution.</p> <p>1.2              AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>The aims and objectives of this project to</p> <p>i)          Producing good quality suya meat.</p> <p>ii)         Packaging of suya meat in different packaging material e.g. foil paper, cellophane and cans to investigate the effect of the various packaging materials or the quality attribute of the suya meat.</p> <p>iii)        Carrying out method of processing suya by chemical and microbiological analysis in each case.</p> </div>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION ON THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS PACKAGING MATERIAL ON THE QUALITY ATTRIBUTES OF SUYA (MEAT)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION ON THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS PACKAGING MATERIAL ON THE QUALITY ATTRIBUTES OF SUYA (MEAT)", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>            This research work explored the concept of food security and its relationship to national development studies indicate that food security, which is the availability of adequate meals for man’s consumption as he desires, is an essential ingredient for the development of any nation.

It primarily that human body requires for the transmission of food borne disease and toxicants, which invariably threatens public health.</p> <p>Disease caused by contraindicated food constitutes one of the most wide, spread and worrisome health problems of the contemporary world. It has personal, national and global socio – economic consequence. As the saying goes a healthy nation is a prosperous nation.</p> STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <p>Food security in a nation is expected to contribute in our small way to transformation the nations economy and induce rapid development.       </p> <p>            Baid (1999), commented that lack of food security in any nation will not only slow down the nations development, but will seriously disrupt a carefully, planned national development programmed.</p> <p>Therefore the statement of the problem is that, could lack of adequate food supply be responsible for the unrest and constant rioting and agitation almost the labour force and youths in Nigeria, which is a factor that hinders national development? Number of families suffering in poverty and starvation due to the fact that there is no enough provision for food availability, accessibility and nutritional discrimination analysis?    </p> <p>In today’s world where the global economy is dominated by a few large national economics grouping, the smaller nations are finding it difficult to complete, as well as to harness adequate resources for their development this undoubtedly must be the plight of Nigeria. So what could be done to help this situation? Education could be the answer, because knowledge present is ignorance banished.  </p> PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <p>Sizer and Whiney (2000) stated that in chronic starvation lie the frustration, tension and envy of masses of people who will ultimately resort to violence. Thy therefore take solace in looting, fighting, drugging, robbery and burning of houses.</p> <p>            Therefore the purpose of the study is aims at educating the consumer on the importance of a nation being food secured and how to improve household food security.   </p> <p>Ø  To enable the consumers and bodies governing food resolutions engage in regular talks on the importance of food security to individuals, families, the community and the nation as a whole through regular classroom teaching, mass media and community meeting.</p> <p>Ø  To enable the government to put more fund and machinery into agriculture.  </p> SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY <p>            This research works is important to individuals of all categories.</p> <p>Ø  To enable the individual to acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes require knowing their right as consumers and descern or judge information and consuming intelligently within their means or available resources.</p> <p>Ø  To provide the necessary information about the food they buy e.g. expiry dates, weight, brand names, cost and where to purchase them. </p> <p>Ø  It is also importance to the government do that it will enable the government to plan ahead in case there is food scarcity</p> RESEARCH QUESTION <p>Ø  Have you heard of the word food security?</p> <p>Ø  Is lack of storage facilities a problem to food security?</p> <p>Ø  Do you secure your food for future purpose?</p> <p>Ø  Do consumers have right on proper practice of food?</p> <p>Ø  Does food availability eliminate poverty?</p> DEFINITION OF TERMS <p>FOOD: This is any substance that people or animals eat or drink for maintains of life and growth.  </p> <p>SECURITY: Freedom or protection from danger or worthy.</p> <p>AVAILABILITY: Things that can be used to obtain or use to achieve something.</p> <p>ACCESSIBILITY: Means things that can be reached, the opportunity or right to use.</p> <p>PRESERVATION: Means method of preventing food deterioration.</p> <p>ADDICTIVES: Means any substance including any source of radiation expected to result that substance or its bye products becoming a part of its characteristics.</p> <p>CLEANLINESS: This means the application of good sanitary practice in the handling of food, which reduce the incidence of spoilage.</p> <p>NUTRITION: Means the scientific study of food and its utilization in the body.</p> <p>POVERTY: The state of being poor. </p> <p>UTILIZATION: The process of using ones ability to achieve much from little.</p> </div>\n\nFOOD SECURITY AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPLICATION FOR HOME ECONOMICS  EDUCATION <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FOOD SECURITY AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPLICATION FOR HOME ECONOMICS  EDUCATION ", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>Abstract</p> <p>a comparative study was done on the physico-chemical and antioxidant properties of some culinary herbs and local spices. Piper Guiness (Uziza), Xylopia aethopica (Uda), Monodora Myristica (Ehuru) and TrtraleuraTetraopera (Oshsho).  The proximate analysis of these spices  were done to determine their moisture content, ash content, crude fat crude fibre and protein content. Extraction of the Oleorasin from the spices and soybean oil were done using soxhlet extraction unit with hexane as solvent. Imi of each of the Oleorasin samples of the spices was pipette into 100ml of soybean oil into four different test tubes labeled A,B, C and D. sample E contains 100ml of soybean oil with 150ppm of Butylated Hydroxyl toluene while the untreated soybean oil (sample F) was used as the control. The test-tube were shaked, plugged with cottonwood and kept at room temperature in a rack. The peroxide value of the sample were monitored for tightly for eight weeks, the thiobarbituric acid 9TBA) value were also determined on the tenth and twelfth weeks respectively. The peroxide value of the sample for the eighth week were recorded as follows: A (10), B (8) C (8), D (11), E (10) and F (22) respectively. From these results, it shows that all the spices were below the range of detectable rancidity.

With modernization and the development of patent medicines, the use of natural cures and elixirs decrease in popularity.</p> <p>Nowadays, disillusionment with synthetic drugs, artificial additives and their possible sides effects has given great rise in popularity to many natural products, be it for culinary, medical or cosmetics purposes. In line with the world wide trend for eco-consciousness, the popularity of natural cosmetic purposes. In line with the world wide trend for eco-consciousness, the popularity of natural cosmetic products, such as those sold in red earth and the body shop, attests to the current trend (Broadhurt CL, 2000).</p> <p>Spices are defined as those aromatic plants and their parts, fresh or dried, whole or ground, that are primarily used to impart flavour and fragrances to foods and drink (Prosea 1986). The term is used in a wide sense and includes the culinary herbs. Spices are indispensable in the culinary art, used to create dishes that reflect the history, the culture and the geography of a country. Well-known examples are  curry powder, housing live five spices powder) Pizza herbs and fines herbs (Polansky mm, 2000) spices oils and spice oleoresins are also indispensable in the food and beverages manufacturing industry, the perfumery and cosmetic industry and the pharmaceutical industry. Some spices and derivative possess antioxidant and antibiotic properties, which has increased interest in the commercial exploitation of aromatic plants for food preservation and crop protection with the growing demand natural and organic products and the increasing clamour to dispense with synthetic flavours and artificial food colouring, the future for spices seems bright.</p> <p>According to Pearson 1976 herbs and spices consist of the dried leaves, flowers, buds fruits, seeds, bark or rhizomes of various plants. They are incorporated in foods only in small amounts but they make important contributions towards the odour and flavour due to the presence of the volatile oil 9essentail oil) and fixed oil, local examples include Piper guineense  (Uzuza), Xylopia gethiopica  (uda), Mondora myristica (Ehuru,Tretaphleura tetraptra  (Oshsho) and capsicum frutescens (Ose Nsukka).</p> <p>An antioxidant is defined as any substance which is capable of delaying, retarding or preventing the development in food of rancidity or other flavour deterioration due to oxidation,. Antioxidant are only one means of fending packing or there are others such as vacuum packaging or packing under an inert gas to exclude oxygen and refrigeration, freezing, both of which greatly reduce the rate of authorization. Furthermore, it is seldom realized how little oxygen is need to initiate and maintain the oxidation process or how difficult and expensive it can be to remove the last traces of air from a product.  For these reasons it is quite common to combine the use of antioxidants with inert gas packing using an antioxidant should be seen as one of several measures available, but used properly, it is generally effective, easily applied and inexpensive.</p> <p>The prime justification for using an antioxidant is one of need an antioxidant can extend the shelf-life of a food, reducing wastage and complaints, it can reduce nutritional losses (oil soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A, are  prone to oxidation)) and a very important point for the food technologist, it can widen the range of fat which can be used.  Using an antioxidant enables the food manufacturer to smooth out differences in the stability of fats/oils and renders the food product less specific in terms of ingredient requirements. This offers more scope for cost control without jeopardizing the product quality of shelf-life,  without an effective antioxidant, lard for instance, would find far fewer uses.</p> <p>Antioxidants serve two principle functions.</p> <p>1.         They break the oxidation chain by containing the free radicals or acting as hydrogen donor.</p> <p>2.         They direct the breakdown of peroxides into stable substances that do not promote further oxidation (Ihekornye and Ngoddy 1985).</p> <p>An ideal antioxidant meets the following demands:</p> <p>1.                  Safe in use.</p> <p>2.                  Should impart no odour, flavour or colour.</p> <p>3.                  Effective of low concentration.</p> <p>4.                  Should be easy to incorporate</p> <p>5.                  Should survive cooking process.</p> <p>6.                  Should be available at now cost-in-use.</p> <p>(Allen and Haninlton, 1989), John and Peterson, (1974), summarized the general used and properties of herbs and spices as the ability to:-</p> <p>1.                  Give flavour to a flavourable base.</p> <p>2.                  Impart a different flavour character to the basic product.</p> <p>3.                  Disguise objectionable intrinsic flavour and boost intrinsic flavour which would otherwise be too weak.</p> <p>According to Ikekornye and Ngoddy, (1985) the effectiveness and optimal utilization of a spice for its various uses depends on certain factors such as method of growing, harvesting sorting, storage and ultimately processing techniques.</p> <p>Traditionally, spices are sued to prepared food for nursing mothers, it is believed to be very useful in cleaning the uteral lining after child birth. It is believed to have contract the womb to its normal size after birth. It is used in preparing native concoction for the treatment of convulsion and “jedi-jedi” in infant, a diseases which gives rise to greenish stool, stomach upset and inflamed.  It is generally used in treating some minor ailment such as stomach upset, headaches, malaria, bronchitis and many others (Uba, 1997).</p> <p>1.1       OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>Herbs and spices are known to be incorporated in food only in small amounts but they make important contributions towards the odour and flavour due to the presence of the volatile oil (essential oil) and fixed oil and little or on work has been done on most local culinary herbs and spices. The aim of this project is to extract these oleoresin and essential oils in herbs and spices that impart flavours and fragrances present for the manufacture of foods, beverages, perfumery, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, and to determine the antioxidant properties of these local spices and herbs for food products, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.</p> </div>\n\nTHE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL AND ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES OF CULINARY HERBS AND LOCAL SPIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL AND ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES OF CULINARY HERBS AND LOCAL SPIES", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p> ABSTRACT</p> <p>            A study was carried out on the physico – chemical properties of fluted pumpkin seeds (Telferia occidentalis) flours.  The 1st two flour samples were obtained by boiling for 1 hr in 0.5% solution for Nacl, and .5% solution of Na2 S04 respectively.</p> <p>The 2nd two samples were obtained by soaking for 12 hrs in 0.5% soln of Nacl, and 0.5% soln of Na2 So4respectively.  The control was neither soaked; F4, F6, F5, F7, and F8 respectively.  All the samples were dried milled and sieved to obtain their respectively flours.  The flour samples were defatted using n-hexane.

<p>1.0              INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Pumpkin is a common name of the genus cucurbitae of the Gourd Family.  It includes the pumpkins and squashes.  Although the names are often used interchangeably, pumpkins in the United Kingdom usually refer to cucurbita maximum and it’s varieties, in the U.S. it means curcurbita pepo.  The most popular of this is a vine bearing orange fruits or pumpkin used as a piefilling.</p> <p>Pumpkin is any several prickly vine with large lobed leaves and yellow flowers, in the genus cucurbita of the order violates.</p> <p>Pumpkin is commonly applied to the large orange coloured fruit, the curcurbita species is used when ripe as a table vegetable in pies.  The flesh is some what coarse and strongly flavoured, hence generally not served as a baked vegetable.</p> <p>Fluted pumpkin (Telfaria accidentalis) belongs to the family cucurbitaceae.  It is known as “Ugu” in Igbo, “Umee” in urchobo “Ubon” in Efik and “Iroko” in Yoruba language.  It is widely eaten in the first zone of the southern Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.  Both mature and immature leaves and the young shoots are frequently eaten as a pot herb.</p> <p>The seeds are cooked whole or ground up and used as soup thickener.  They have agreeable almond like flavour very nutritious and highly rich in oil of potential industrial value.   The seed also contains relatively high amount of minerals and vitamins required in human nutrition.</p> <p>The amino acid of the protein are deficient in the sulphur containing amino acid.  (Asiegbu 1987).</p> <p>The wide shortage of animal protein in developing countries had continued to attract research interest in plant protein of high abundance.</p> <p>However the ultimate success of utilizing plant protein in food formulation depend largely upon it’s functional properties some of these functional some of these functional properties include water and oil absorption capacity, gelation property, Emulsification, protein solubility, bulk density (Fagbemi and Oshodi 1991).</p> <p>Considerable work had been done on it’s cultivation and diseases (Maduewsi 1977).  Seed biological chemical ecology cultural practices and fatty acid composition of the oil in the seed.  Both the essential and non essential amino acid of fluted pumpkin is higher than that of colocyn this citrullus.</p> <p>Fagbemi and Oshodi (1991) examined the chemical composition and functional properties of the defatted seed flour, it’s protein isolate nutritionally valuable minerals and compare with other oil seed flour, isolated being based in food formulation.  (Fagbemi and Osgodi 1991).  Previous studies on the functional properties of the fluted pumpkin had been done on the raw seed (dried sample. Fagbemi and Oshodi 1992, search on the forces affecting the thermal beheviour of protein, may provided methods of improving the functional behaviour of oil seed proteins in food system.      Heating to denature some protein had been reported to be justifiable or desirable in thermal destruction of functional agents and deteoretion of enzyme and in enhancing the digestibility of the component proteins in oil seed.</p> <p>Processing effects on functional properties is desirable for designing appropriate refining, extraction and drying methods for the preparation of the functional properties.  There is need to study salt and processing effect on the functional properties of some vegetable protein to enhance their optimum utilization.</p> <p>This present work is aimed at the following</p> <p>1)        To study the effect of processing on the proximate composition of the fluted pumpkin seed flour.</p> <p>2)        To study the effect of salt on protein solubility of the defatted fluted pumpkin seed flour.</p> <p>3)        To investigate processing effect the foaming capacity and stability of defatted fluted pumpkin seed flour.</p> <p>4)        Study the effect of pH and processing on the foaming capacity and stability of defatted seed flour.</p> </div>\n\nEFFECTS OF SOME SALTS (NACL AND NA2 SO4) ON FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF PUMPKIN SEED  (TELFARIA OCCIDENTALS) FLOOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF SOME SALTS (NACL AND NA2 SO4) ON FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF PUMPKIN SEED  (TELFARIA OCCIDENTALS) FLOOR", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM)<br/>1.1.1 ORIGIN AND DISTRIBUTION</strong><br/>Despite many years of investigation, it has not been possible to determine accurately when and where the first cultivated wheat originated. At the beginning of recorded history, wheat was already an established crop whose origin was unknown (Anon 1953). There is however some evidence that cultivation of wheat started about 6,000 years ago in the 5yria – Palestine area and spread to Egypt, (ran, India, China, Russia, Turkey and Central Europe from where it spread to other countries and continents. Countries that produce wheat today include Russia, Switzer land United State of America, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England, Poland, Netherlands, Norway, Swedan, South Africa, Peru, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Newzealand and Nigeria. 9Shellenberger, 1969, Olugbemi etal 1992).<br/>In addition, wheat flour has uniques properties that differs it from other flours in containing a considerable proportion of gluten which makes wheat flour suitable for bread making and other bake products. This composition of gluten present has a bearing on the “strength” and water holding properties of the flour. The two protein that form the greater part of the guten are gluternin and gliadin while the latter appear to be identical in strong and weak wheat, the former exists in different varieties.</p> <p><strong>1.1.2 STRUCTURE OF WHEAT KERNEL</strong><br/>The main feature of the wheat kernel can be best described in terms of the rounded or dorsal side and a vertical or crease side (Shellenberger, 1969). A deep groove a crease extends the entire length of the wheat kernel. At the apex or the small end of the grain there are many short fine hairs called brush hairs. The outer bran or seed coat consist of three layers known as epidermis.<br/>Wheat grain has the following average percentage composition. Endosperm 85% of the whole grain from which the flour is derived bran 12.5%, germ 2.5%. the composition of wheat flour however varies considerably according to the class of wheat, its country of origin, proportion of the outer part removed by the particular milling process (Ehias, 1972, Nelson 1985). The outer partcontain more protein, fat fibre and ash then the starchy endosperm. The proportion of each of these constituents decreases as the extraction percentage gets less.<br/><strong><br/>1.2 CULTIVATION OF BAMBARA GROUNDNUT</strong><br/>It is mostly monocropping in a selected plot of land with suitable sandy soil 82% of households in North central are 67% in kavango planted Bambara groundnut in 1993. Estimating an average of 1400m2 per farm cropped with Bambara groundnut, the total production areas sums up to around 3000ha. Production figure are very variable, depending on the rainy season. Due to wide spacing 10 – 12 plants/m2 and lack of improved varieties yield rarely exceed 500kg/ha. Taking 250kg/ha as an overall average of the total production to 750t/year.<br/>This does not satisfy the market requirements and a considerable amount of Bambara groundnut is informally imported from Angola and sold with local materials on tradition markets. Seed size is an important factor for the marketing of Bambara groundnut.</p> <p><strong>1.1.3 USES</strong><br/>1. The dried mature seed cab be converted into paste, steamed and eaten with vegetable soup or sauce. <br/>2. The form in which the Bambara groundnut seed is commonly consumed is moin-moin usually referred to as ‘Okpa’ in the eastern states of Nigeria.<br/>3. Dried and roasted Bambara groundnut can be used to make soup, flour and porridge.</p> <p><strong>1.1.4 USES OF WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS</strong><br/>1. Wheat is perhaps the most popular cereal grain for the production of bread, cake and other pastries in baking industries. <br/>2. Wheat bran is used mainly for the formulation animal feed.<br/>3. Farinha, shorts, semolina, semovita, flour from wheat are used for other preparation purpose.<br/>4. It can also be used as an ingredient in breakfast, cereal, macaroni, adhesives and other products.</p> <p><strong>1.2 BAMBARA GROUNDNUT (VOANDZEIA SUBTERAEA)<br/>1.2.1 ORIGIN</strong><br/>Bambara groundnut belongs to the family of flowering plant called leguminosease. It is an important legume consumed in Nigeria especially in Enugu State and some other Northern States. The Bambara groundnut is native to West Africa. Some wild species are found in North Eastern Nigeria and Northern Cameroon. It has different name’s in different parts of Africa. It is called ‘Okpa by the Igbos. Bambara groundnut is an important article of commerce in Nigeria. It grows extensively in Northern Nigeria but eaten mostly in eastern Nigeria. A large volume of trade is undertaken between the growing and the consuming population.<br/>Bambara groundnut seed vary in shape, size and colour of the seed coat (Ojimelumelukwe (1985) differentiated between four cultivars with respect to the seed coast, colour and size. Seed may be round cream or russet brown smooth taste. The seeds have white elliptical helium with seed eight ranging between 280 and 320g.</p> <p><br/><strong>1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br/>1. To investigate on the effect of storage time on the functional properties of Bambara groundnut and wheat blend for cake prior.<br/>2. To determine effect of storage time on the nutritional quality of the flour blend for cake production.<br/>3. To determine the significant of supplementation in nutritional content of food products.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF STORAGE TIME ON THE FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF WHEAT BAMBKA GROUNDNUT BLEND<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF STORAGE TIME ON THE FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF WHEAT BAMBKA GROUNDNUT BLEND", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>Fufu is a dough – like consistency prepared from predominantly starchy material by pounding the boiled material or by cooking a non-gelatinized powder or paste icold o hot water (krama and maz 1972)<br/>This is usually eaten with soup or (ownueme, 1978) Ngoddy and Ihekoronye 1985)<br/>Fufu is important in Nigerian food utilization patterns. It is regarded as “perfect” food all over.<br/>Africa (Desikacha, 1975) is thus regarded real in companion to other dishes like garri.<br/>Fufu could be made from yam, retted cassava flour, yam flour by pounding boiled tuber or stirring the flour into boiling water (Ihekoeronge and Ngoddy 1985)<br/>Another type of fufu (tuwu) is also made from maize, millet or sorghum flour only or mixed with the starch material example cassava flour which will serve as binding agent.<br/>Cassava constitute very important high energy food crops because of the starchy content. It is often coveted into other products (Okechukwu et al, 1990) some of the conversion involve moisture uptake steeping or moisture loss drying.<br/>Many households and industrial products that can be made from cassava include meal, chips, flour, pellets and starch is produced in large factories where the sequence of operation can be summarized as follows.<br/>Washing of the roots, peeling, grating, extracting the starch setting / washing the starch, refining the starch are generally based on filtration and centrifugation.<br/>In recent years a considerable mechanize means of manufacturing garri, fufu, lafun etc. the roots are peeled, greed, pressed, sieved, roasted and sieve without the involvement of manual operation or different ways of preparing it and other products.<br/>(IITA, 1994, FURO, 1976)</p> <p><strong>THE FUTURE OF CASSAVA IN NIGERIA.</strong><br/>In Nigeria, other countries of the world’s future, modified starches that are specially formulated for individual application will continue to find new uses.<br/>Whenever you cassava. In your product, you will be assisting the diversifying the economy and improving the livelihood of millions of poor farmers and rural processors. Nigeria the would largest producer of cassava has to take urgent step to develop the utilization of cassava and to sustainable commercialize the crop.<br/>In the industries listed below are cassava bye – products which the industries use in the production.</p> <p><strong>(1) TEXTILES: </strong>Cassava starch is used in the stages of textile processing, sizing the yarn stiffen and protect it during weaving, improving colour consistency during, printing, and making the fabric durable and shining at finishing.<br/><strong>(2) PAPER INDUSTRIES:- </strong>Modified starch from cassava is used in wet stage of paper making to flocculate the pulp. In order to improve the rate and the reducing the pulp loss. Native and modified cassava ink consumption to improve print quality.</p> <p><strong>PLYWOOD:</strong> Glue made from cassava starch is a key material in plywood manufacturing. the quality of plywood depends having on the glue that is used.</p> <p><strong>PHARMACEUTICALS:-</strong> Native and modified starches are used as bounders, filers and disintegrating agents for tablet production.</p> <p><strong>SWEETNERS:-</strong> Glucose and fructose made from cassava starch are used as substrates for sucrose in jams and canned fruits cassava based sweeteners are preferred formulators for their improved processing characteristics and product enhancing properties.</p> <p><strong>BIODEGRADEABLE PRODUCTS:- </strong>Cassava starch can be used as a biodegradable polymer to replace plastics in packaging materials.</p> <p><strong>MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE:-</strong> The starch is a common source for non – glutamate in Asia, it is used to enhance flavour in food e.g Ajinomoto.<br/>Confectionery modified cassava starch are often donates starch derivatives and are also used for confectionery for different purposes. Such as thinking and glancing cassava starches are used such as glues and gums.</p> <p><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br/>(1) The aim of this research work is to produce an instant fufu flour for fufu productions by four different varieties of cassava inoder to know the variety that is good for fufu production.<br/>(2) To determine the chemical composition of the four varieties of cassava.<br/>(3) The physic – chemical and organoleptic properties is determine in order to get the quality and nutritional composition it contains.<br/>(4) To know the variety that the papanelist considers best so from there you will know from result the one the consumer will buy ad that will be more marketable so that you’ll also make gams also.</p>\n\nPHYSICO CHEMICAL AND ORGANOLEPTICPROPERTIES OF FLOUR AND FUFU PROCESSE FROM CASSAVE VERIETIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PHYSICO CHEMICAL AND ORGANOLEPTICPROPERTIES OF FLOUR AND FUFU PROCESSE FROM CASSAVE VERIETIES", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Micro organisms associated in fermentation of castor bean seeds “ogiri” (COSO) were investigated.

Using Hedonic scale, a 9 – man untrained panelists, were used to conduct sensory evaluation on the raw “ogiri”and “ogiri” with 7.5 point followed by the SCOUS with 7 points.<br/>There was no significant difference at 1% and 5% level for the sensory evaluation carried out.</p> <p>CHAPTER  ONE</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></em><br/>“Ogiri” is a local condiment inform of oily paste with strong putrial and ammonial odour made from some fermentation vegetable proteins (oil seeds).<br/>It is a popular soup condiment in many parts of Nigeria particularly in Enugu Anambra, Imo,Ondo River states, Benue-plateau states.<br/>“Ogiri” can be in various form such as solid, semi solid (paste) depending on the type of raw material (legeime seed) used in the production of it.<br/>Hwever, when it is in solid form, it can be put into shapes like circlus (flat) triangular and quadrilaterals.<br/>Types of Ogiri are dawadawa “Iru,” “Ogiri, nwan,” “Igba – Apara,” “Ukpaka (ugba)”, “Ogiri - sara” onwuka (2003).<br/>However, “dawadawa” and “Ogiri” are used as condiments in soup, sauce and porridge and ogiri act as soup “dawadawa” and ogiri act as soup condiments as well as food flavour. “Ugba” (ukpaka) is commonly used to suppliment a variety of food in the eastern (especially Anambra and Imo)<br/>States of Nigeria, it is frequently mixed with yam or with tapiocal (Abacha) and also with stock – fish and serve during important ceremonies. Some people even it those flawaring agents raw as they are.<br/>In Nigeria and in some African countries, people who use ogiri as flavouring agent are only concerned in the nutritive value of the ogiri not minding their microbial load. Although a food will not be selected volubility and consumed less it appeals to the consumer in terms of appearance mouth feel and flavour (ogbo V.N (1999). Though ogiri has an un welcoming flavour and an unattractive presentation (ogbou V.M), yet its addition to food as spaces makes the food very palatable.<br/>Most of these condoment used as flavouring agent content vegetable proteins which are usually rich in glutamine and asparagine and these can either be engymatically or chemically hydralysed to glutamic asid and asportic acid by micro – organisms other products of the hydrolysis are Alain Agirine and proline (Obi E.I.2003). The delaminated proteid has a lower iso-electirc point and therefore are are easily soluble in foods systems ogbogu (1999), it has also been reported that levels of deamination as low as 2-6% could enhance the fuctional properties of these ammonacids.<br/>Ihekoronye and Ngoddy (1985) stated that the functional properties of these aminoacids as giving nice flavour to food.<br/>The processing of the oil seeds is still at the traditional level.

The term fermentation is an energy yielding metabolic process that involves the decomposition of carbohydrate in the absences of oxygen.<br/>Loius pastent stated that physiological process permitting certain organism to live and grow in the absence of air is referred to as anaerobic fermentation which in the preserve of oxygen it is called aerobic fermentation. Nweke A.E (1999) reported that fermented foods are those in which their production depend on the activities of microorganism.<br/>Micro-organisms play an important role in modifying the substrates physically, sensory and nutritionally (Aweke 1999).<br/>Members of fermenting organisms are important; for instance, Bacillus and coagulates negotiable the fermented (utrullu vulgarist and)(Ricinus communis) seed in ogiri preparation; Ogbogu (1999) and African oil bean seed in ugba preparation, presopis African for the preparation of okpehi a seasoning agent temper an Indonesian fermented vegetable protein food prepared from soyabean in which Bacilus spp have been found to be responsible for the fermentation.<br/>These organisms have some properties that enable them to ferment these substrate some of these properties are made available by the organisms themselves as metabolic product in the living organisms or as a component of the endotoxin released when the organism is already dead.<br/>Some of them can be protoelytic their action while some lipolytic, others athylolytic ogbogy, V.N.

Flour confectionery describes a large range of flour based goods other than bread manufactured from batter sponge or dough by mixing, kneading and may be created by fermentation, chemical or other means resulting in puff/flaky short or sweet product. Those that have their moisture content reduced to make them exceptionally brittle or crops are generally regarded as biscuits. (Okaka, 1997)<br/>The word biscuit come from the Latin word Biscuit meaning twice cooked, baking at high temperature followed by drying at lower temperature (Okaka, 1997). The term biscuit and cookie are synonymous. The American Encyclopedia described biscuit as a form of bread baking soda as a raising agent rather than yeast.<br/>Biscuit are a common feature of southern us cousine which can be served as a side dish with meal or as a breakfast item. Biscuit is also said to be essentially bakery confectionery dried down to low moisture content name derived from Latin word for twice cooked, made from soft flour, mostly rich in fat and sugar and consequently of high energy content of 420 to 510kcal per 100g they are cherished by people of all ages and used at different meals and occasions as part of breakfast, snacks etc. they are eaten with butter and jam or jelly or as a part of a dish called “Biscuit and gravy”. Biscuits are also eaten covered in pizza sauce and cheese. Many varieties exist, both sweet and savoulry often produced in industrial quantities by large food companies. Sweet biscuit are commonly eaten as snack and may contain chocolate fruit, jam or nuts (peanuts). Savoury biscuits are plainer and commonly eaten with cheese following a meal<br/>The simplest form of biscuit is a mixture of flour and water but may contain fat sugar and other ingredients mixed together into a dough which is rested for a period, passed between rollers to make a sheet. The sheet is then stamped out baked, cooled and packaged. Biscuits are generally made from wheat flour but according to the topic of this project, “use of composite blends for biscuit making”. Some raw materials other than wheat have to be used in producing the flour for the biscuits. In order to get a superior product especially for crackers, the following factors are of importance – choice of flour for sponge and dough, selection of fermentation environment and the baking conditions. It is therefore necessary to search for raw materials that give flour of light quality.<br/>Biscuits are classified based on their degree of enrichment and processing or by the method adopted in shaping them. Based on the enrichment criterion are hard dough, soft dough and batter biscuit respectively. (Okaka; 1997). Soft wheat is used in making flour for most biscuit and the softness is de to lower protein (gluten) content when compared with the hard wheat. Based on this fact, raw materials are chosen from other legumes such as Peanut and Roots such as cassava. Since they contain protein though in lesser quantity and quality.<br/>Peanuts are one of the leading agricultural crops of the world and belong to the family leguminous. It is a source of edible oil and plant protein. The characteristic feature of legume seed protein is that they are markedly deficient in methionine and tryptophan. Infact, methioine is t he first limiting essential amino acid in almost all the legume grains. Peanuts contain about 26% to 35% protein with the peanut meal containing a large amount of nutritionally essential amino – acid. The seeds are nutritional and contain vitamin E, Niacin, folacin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, riboflavin, thiamine, potassium etc (Ogbo; 2002). Peanut also contain a significant load of  resveratrol, a strong antioxidant which inhibit lipid peroxidation of low – density lipoprotein (LOL), prevents the cytotoxicity of oxidized (LDL) and protects cells  against lipid peroxidation. Hydrophilic aid lipophilic properties, it can as well provide more effective protection than other well known antioxidations such as vitamin C and E.<br/>Peanut is used for different purposes, food (raw, roasted or b oiled, cooking oil), animal feed and industrial raw material. There are four varieties of peanut:- Virginia, Peruvian runner, Valencia and Spanish.<br/>Cassava, one of the raw materials is an indigenous and stable food of millions of Nigerian people. The few misconceptions related to cassava especially with regard to its low nutritional value and its toxicity have been effectively challenged by National ad International Research Institutions. National Institutions like University of Agriculture Umedike in Umuahia who have succeeded in producing many Tropical Manioc Selection (TMS) varieties with an added advantage of low cyanide.<br/>Despite the obvious advantages of cassava like being easily propagated by stem cutting. Relatively high yielder and excellent source of calories, cassava remained for some time a neglected crop in agricultural research and development activities to an extent not commensurate with its importance as food. However, some developments within the past 15 years have enhanced interest in the crop and research priority has been given to research on its improvement, increased production and utilization.<br/>First, the International Society for Tropical Root and Tubers Crops was founded in 1967 to encourage research, increased production and utilization and exchange of information on tropical root and tuber crops including cassava yams, sweet potatoes and avoids. Second, among the International Institutions (International Institute for Tropical Agriculture – IITA – in Nigeria, and he International Centre for Tropical Agriculture – CIAT in Colombia) that have programmes giving high priority to research on the improvement, production systems, storage and utilization of cassava and other related training.  Roots and Tubers Expansion Programme (RTEP was also put in place to develop and source for alternative uses of cassava as industrial raw material and create enabling market environment. High Quality unfermented flour”, including fortified cassava flours are now more accessible because of the improved processing and technological methods for processing cassava. These technologies can be used to produce particle / whole substitute for wheat flour from 540 100 percent in bakery and confectionery products such as biscuit, chin-chin etc. and some of these snacks have no noticeable change in texture, flavour, aroma nor colour.<br/>The cassava flour is fortified with peanut butter in this project because of its high protein content, vitamins like vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant. The manufacture of good biscuit therefore depends mostly on the selection of correct flour for each type ad applying processed which are compatible such processes a re mixing, accretion and fermentation, laminating, baking and cooling (Okaka, 1997:- p. 155).</p> <p><strong>1.2     AIM / PURPOSE </strong><br/>As everybody including the federal government is putting effort together to induce foreign exchange conservation by means of local material utilization. It has been decided to carryout some work on cassava and peanut blend in order to use them as substitute for imported wheat in making flours for biscuit manufacture. Peanut butter is also added to complement the necessary amino acids.<br/>The result of research carried out and test conducted by Roots and Tubers Expansion Programme show that it is possible to produce acceptable biscuits of comparable standard to that of wheat flour biscuits using composite flours from the above named legume and Roots.<br/>Wheat whose flour is the major material used for biscuit manufactures in most countries of the world traditionally employ wheat for biscuits and similar products. Although wheat flour is generally employed as the basic ingredients in biscuit manufacture. Wheat is uniformly grown all over the world and being a temperature crop, it only grows under certain climatic conditions. Consequently, biscuit manufacture industries in countries where wheat does not grow have to import the grain or the flour.<br/>In countries, Nigeria, to be precise, wheat is cultivated though not in appreciable quantity due to climate conditions, a large sum of foreign exchange is spent on importation especially with the present rate of growth of biscuit and allied industries in Nigeria (Federal Office of Statistics, Lagos Nigeria). There are a lot of industries (confectionery) although the date is not yet readily available, all based on wheat flour. Foreign exchange spend as at 1982 are huge amount of money. Therefore success in this trend of supplementation will save a huge sum of money being spend annually on wheat importation and could now be utilized to improve other sector of the country’s economy.<br/>The aim of this project work therefore is to reduce or stop totally the extensive importation of wheat, thereby broaden the food base of Nigerians. The commercial and industrial implication will bring economic benefits to all biscuit consumers by making the product more readily available. Supplementation of imported wheat flour with cassava flour will save millions of naira in foreign exchange.<br/>It is also estimated that the use of these composite blends (cassava flour and peanut butter) will result in the production of biscuits that are less expensive and highly nutritive than those produced before.<br/>It will also create new employment opportunities as well as economic self-reliance both at the industrial and house – hold level of cassava processors.</p>\n\nUSE OF COMPOSITE FLOUR BLENDS FOR BISCUIT MAKING PEANUT CASSAVA FLOUR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " USE OF COMPOSITE FLOUR BLENDS FOR BISCUIT MAKING PEANUT CASSAVA FLOUR", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong>.</li> </ol> <p>Canteen services stated way back in the 18th centaury, food and snacks are served as to the taste of the client. It may be seen as a place in the military, factory, camp, school etc. where people may buy food, drinks, sweets etc to eat. As advancement has set in, more services are rendered aside the normal buying and selling of food in modern canteens.</p> <p>According to the Ministry of Health annual report, 75% of sicknesses admitted in hospital are results of unhealthy food (MOH 2007), majority of which are food serve in the canteen all over the country. It suggests that eating from canteens without basic health consideration is like signing your own death warrant.</p> <p>Health often said is wealth, we should pay critical attention to the food we eatand the environmental condition under which we eat if only we want to create wealth. Nowadays, children are becoming far more overweight in suburban schools, and on a personally view the schools canteens are a definite place to blame. If you look at an average school canteen, there is no respect for the weight of the child or no help for providing the healthier option; it is all about making money to fund a business. Ways of making the canteen healthier will be discussed and the worst offenders to canteen obesity. Canteens are terrible; people line up with their money, walk in and buy whatever food they want. There is no mother in their ear saying to purchase a healthier option; there is just a child who wants to walk in and purchase the best tasting and in most cases fattiest options. As a personal view, to reduce problems like obesity people who have the power to should try and bring in healthier options, and encourage kids to eat them. There are endless possibilities to making canteens healthier, you can just ban unhealthy food, you can make it super expensive so know child can afford it or want to buy it, or you can just ban the canteen in general. But unfortunately these options won’t work because as much as people want to get rid of the obesity in children you have to think of the people who work at the canteen, as it is their job. A more productive way of improving canteens is having both options to healthy and the bad but making the healthy items appeals more to people. Or from a different approach you can have the unhealthy food but make it smaller in amounts, so you will be having less unhealthy foods, and then the students will be reduced to no choice but buy healthy food or accept there own home made meals, where the parents can control the healthiness of their children</p> <ol><li><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong>.</li> </ol> <p>It is without doubt that many Ghanaians students one way or the other eat food from a canteen and food cooked in their home as well. In the tertiary institution as Ho polytechnic, canteen services serve food ranging from breakfast to supper to snacks, special meals are also served to customers.</p> <p>Ghana like most developing countries; is struggling with the means to provide a comprehensive solutions to bad health as a result of bad eating conditions. The current system of ensuring sanitation in the food served in the canteen, restaurant, chop bars, etc. has proven woefully inadequate for the objectives circumspect</p> <p>Places where better food in the Ghanaian context are served in a hygienic condition are very expensive to customers, hence majority of students, lecturers and non-lecturers in the universities, polytechnics and colleges are unable to afford. In this regard eating food cook by oneself has proven to be more beneficial in taste, cost, health, preferences, etc.</p> <p>Consequently many students in the colleges, polytechnics and universities preferred preparing their own food. These have being easy due to the increasing supply of gas cylinders and burners. These gadgets are fast and convenient in the cooking and quite affordable.</p> <p>Many canteens are subsequently getting out of business because they lack modern facilities; there is no better furniture, sometimes food is served in the open air with flies all around. As the existing once are weeping for customers, others all about joining the search for customers. This in one way has drastically changed the canteen service. In spite of this some customers complain bitterly of being served left over meal on regular basis.</p> <p>The government through the school feeding programme is advocating on serving better meal to children for massive nourishment but, this programme covered only primary education which is even a pilot project. However the senior high school boarding house students repeatedly complain of rotten meal.</p> <p>Whiles lecturers and non-lecturers (believed to have money) drive extensively to far distant to enjoy good meals from expensive and luxurious canteens; the less privilege who were believed to be student tends to eat anything money can buy. These has be deviled the canteen service in all institution; the basic even to the tertiary institutions.</p> <ol><li><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH.</strong></li> </ol> <ol><li>To determine whether there is any significant differences in the food bought by student, lecturers and non-lecturers.</li> <li>To determine whether there is any significant differences in the factors which influence the population to eat from the school canteen.</li> </ol> <ol><li><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong></li> </ol> <p><strong>Null hypothesis</strong>: there is no difference between all k populations.</p> <p><strong>Alternative hypothesis</strong>: there is at least difference in two of the k populations.</p> <p>Mathematically;</p> <p>H0: K1= K2= K3= 0</p> <p>Hı: Ki≠ 0; where ί=1, 2 and 3</p> <p>Where ki =students lecturers, and non-lecturers.</p> <ol><li><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong>.</li> </ol> <p>The study will bring us a fore insight into the importance of a hygienic condition and the best food to be served. The research will bring to light the socio-economic benefits of better feeding. The researches will additionally increased knowledge in both condition of service and the type of food to be served.</p> <p>The analysis of this project will provide vital information that will be useful to the government in policy and in decision making specifically to the Ministry of Health (MOH) which is directly responsible for the provision of public health services delivery in terms of policy formulation, monitory and appraisal regulation of the health services.</p> <p>This study will also provide useful information on the popular perceptions regarding the food bought by lecturers, non-lecturers and students.</p> <p>Furthermore the study will be useful to groups or organizations currently working in Ghana and other developing countries in developing national policies on the evaluation and regulation of the food hygiene and proper eating habits in promoting safe, effective and affordable product to all citizens.</p> <p>Finally the research seeks to educate and give possible suggestions to the people on food and other   health related issues.</p> <ol><li><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ol> <p>The primary aims of these researches are to analysis and evaluate the conditions under which food is served and the time it is served and to find out whether there is any significant difference in the food bought by students, non-lecturers and lecturers,</p> <ol><li><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ol> <p>This research is carried out in the Ho polytechnic community.

INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Nut crops such as walnut (juglas Nigra) and pecans (carya illinoenosis) have potential for small parts of Virginia. Growing and handling are specialized, and while marketing is hands oriented, demand can be good For fresh high quality nuts used both for eating out of hands and for cooking purposes (Carlson  Jones 1940) there are many different edible net species found and gathered in the wild such as hickory (Shell Dark – Shag Dark, Carya sp) chest nut (Juglan Cineralal) is another once plentiful native nut but because of chest nut Blight Diseases, it is now a rare found in the woods (Cornel Disnmic Johnson 1970)</p> <p>English walnut also called (Carpathan Peisan Walnut, Juglaus regia) almond  (</p> <p>prunus amygida cus ) and nazdnut (corylvs avellena) represent significant activated and nut production, yet they are limited to specific adaptive areas. California the leading producer of English walnut as well as almonds, while Oregon growers produce 95% of all hazel/nuts (lmore in 1977). In the east, hazelnut are also retrend to as fiibrerts and there are several wild species found with a slumbly habits of growth. Nut production on Eastern filberts is variable and highly affected by weather conditions in the winter typically flowers (cat kins) open in late winter to yearly spring and thought frost tolerant, they can be damaged by hand freezing weather (Hamel,   Dictoskey 1975)</p> <p>Commercially sputhern pecan (also known as paper sheel type) is the most important nut crop for the Eastern US, followed by wild gathered natives black walnuts the pecan industry is centered in the south and south easts, with Creogia a leading state and in the Sothern plans, many acres are raised in Texas and okahlahoma and even as tarwest as new Mexico (Harloro , , Harrar,  Harden  white 1996) variety development for southern Pecans has been extensive and they are renow for their large size and very thin shells however as a starting  points, good site selection is imperative for success one must have an understanding of the frost potential and season growing length as related to the flowering and fruiting characteristics of the chosen variety.

The Northern pecan is a native of the olio, Wabash and upper Mississippi inver basins and in recent years a number of outstanding selection have been made from the world, this Northern pecan is know for its high ,quality nut meats houch has more oil content and better flavor than the southern types, they do however have been much smaller units in comparison (country man et al 1985) while Native (Southern) pecan are not as common in Nigeria as in the Midwest may find adaptability in many parts of the states, including middle and southern Premont regions, Northern pecans are noted for their cold hardness, later flowering to avoid frost, and reduced nut maturely periods as compound to the southern pecan (Chenoweth  1995 black walnut) the Northern pecan selection have fair to good nut size (through at best 50 – 60% of the southern pecan). In addition the widow for grafting is narrow, and the propagator needs to have on hand the scion (top) wood of the selected variety colour the sap begins to flow. Recently several keger nurseries have begun wider propagation of northern pecan and black walnut and certain named varieties are now available as poilted and pre grafter tries.

Among the plant species, gain legumes are considered as the major source of directly proteins.</p> <p>They are consumed would wide, especially in developing and under developed countries where consumption of animal protein may be limited as a result of economic, social, cultural or religious factors (Esenwah and Lkenebomeh, 2008).</p> <p>Locust bean is proteins Protein-Eenergy-Malnutrition (PEM) is a serious problem facing most developing nations as a result of inadequate in take of good quality protein source such as meat, fish and poultry product, which are out of reach to many populaces due to poor economy increase in population pressure and others natural calamities such as drought and flood ladeji et al., 1995; Nordeide et al, 1996). In these nations about 60% of the population suffers PEM, which results to high rate of mortality, permanent brain damage and decrease in learning capability of children (Abdullahi, 2000).</p> <p>Apart from protein, legumes provide a high proportion of complex carbohydrates, starch, edible oil and fibre (Pirman et al, 2001,  Chau et al; 1998).</p> <p>African locust bean seeds are rich in protein and usually fermented to a tasty food condiment called dawadawa which is used as a flavour intensifier for soups and stews and also adds protein to a protein – poor diet.</p> <p>Among the leguminous plants used by man particularly in some African countries, is the African locust bean tree (<em>Parkia</em> <em>biglobosa</em>). The seeds are well known for their uses in the production of local condiment commonly known as Dadadawa (Hausa) or Iru (Yoruba). Furthermore, Parkia biglolose is such plant legumes with an outstanding protein quality and its protein and amino acid composition has been reported (Nordeide et al., 1996; Ega et al., Glew et al., 1997; Cook et al., 2000; lockeett et al., 2000).

Most of the snacks consumed are high in carbohydrate. The use of composite flour has been encouraged since it reduces the importation of wheat.</p> <p>          Biscuits, which are usually produced from cereal flours (mainly wheat) are consumed extensively all over the world, including the developing counties, where protein and caloric malnutrition is prevalent particularly among women and children. The increasing phenomenon of urbanization coupled with the growing number of working mothers, have contributed greatly to the popularity and increased consumption of snack foods (Singh et al; 1989). However, this increasing importance of snack foods such as biscuit in today’s eating habits has not been fully exploited in the developing countries. This is probably as a result of the prohibitive cost of baked products (Tsen et al; 1973). Since this crops is not currently cultivated in the tropics, there is need to look inwards for local raw materials with optimum nutritive value and good processing characteristics, to substitute wheat in baked products.</p> <p>          Cassava (Manihot esculenta L) is the staple food of the poorer section of the population of many tropical counties rich in carbohydrate and has minute quantities of protein, vitamins and minerals (Ihekoronye and Ngoddy, 1985) which can result in malnutrition in some areas where it is the main item of diet (Kay, 1987). Although supplementation is necessary, it is not the solution of the elimination of micro nutrient deficiency disorder but rather the simple and most sustainable approach is fortification of staple food with limiting micronutrient (Ihekoronye and Ngoddy, 1985). Therefore the nutritional value of cassava root and its products such as cassava flour can be improved through food composites and fortification with other protein-rich crops with a reasonable amount of fats, vitamins and minerals (Enwere, 1998). One of such crops is the African yam bean.</p> <p>          The African yam bean known as Odudu, Azama or Okpodudu by the Igbo’s belongs to the family Febaceae, which was formally classified under the sub-family Papillionoides (Anon, 1979). As a legume, it has an excellent supply of B-vitamins (Apata &amp; Ologhobo, 1990). African yam beam will result in a more nutritious diet / snacks.</p> <p><strong>1.1     SCOPE / LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is anticipated that in carrying out a study of this nature, there are limitations involved in the study. The writer encouraged a lot of unforeseen problem due to limited time given, the writer was unable to gather enough and sufficient facts which are relevant to the study.</p> <p>Secondly, there was financial problem. The writer was not able to buy some of the materials like Bakery pastry booklets, get in touch with Bakery industry managers, travel for some researches etc. the polytechnic library was not fully equipped of most relevant materials that would have assisted the writer.</p> <p><strong>1.2     SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Production of biscuit form wheat flour, cassava flour and African yam bean composite flour is used in every production sector of Bakery industry that specialized in Biscuit making.</p> <p>          The government ahs estimated that the average Nigeria that consumed biscuit everyday is approximately 5,500 millions in different location in the country. Biscuit is named as often, the fastest and cheapest food that sustains hungry easily, with increased technological capabilities. Bakery industry has extremely similar production and services that is characteristically without distinguishing the name of the product food substance.</p> <p>          In a nutshell, the study is important in the following areas: To the Researcher:</p> <p>i        It enables the researcher acquire knowledge on how biscuit can be produced from composite flour</p> <p>ii       It enables the researcher acquire knowledge on different ways of using wheat, cassava and African yam bean flour in production of major pasting floured.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of this study is therefore, to produce biscuit from various blends of wheat flour, cassava flour and African yam bean flour and to determine the sensory properties of the biscuit. Meanwhile, the acceptability of biscuit baked from the flours with a view to increasing the level of the wheat flour, cassava flour and African yam bean composite flour for biscuit production as this will lead to higher utilization of cassava thereby reducing post harvest losses.</p>\n\nPRODUCING AND SENSORY EXAMINE THE BISCUIT USING WHEAT FLOUR, CASSAVA FLOUR (ABACHA FLOOR) AND AFRICAN YAM BEAN FLOUR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCING AND SENSORY EXAMINE THE BISCUIT USING WHEAT FLOUR, CASSAVA FLOUR (ABACHA FLOOR) AND AFRICAN YAM BEAN FLOUR", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Complementary foods were formulated using sorghum, African yam bean and crayfish. The nutrient composition, functional properties and organoleptic attributes of the formulated complementary foods were investigated. The different flours were combined in the ratios of; 70:20:5, 80:15:5, 75:20:5, of sorghum, African yam bean and crayfish respectively. Cerelac, a commercial sample served as control. Porridges were prepared from the composite blends for organoleptic evaluation. Standard methods were used to analyze the composite flours. The protein content of African yam bean and crayfish flours complemented the sorghum protein and improved the nutritional quality of the formulated food. The result of the functional properties showed no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) in both bulk density and viscosity. Sensory evaluation revealed that the porridge from the control was preferred over the others. Among the blends, the porridge made from 70:20:5 sorghum / African yam bean / crayfish was preferred over the others. The study showed that composite blends from sorghum, African yam bean and crayfish are nutritionally adequate and possess good functional properties which are required for the preparation of complementary foods for infants.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In developing countries like Nigeria, complementary foods are mainly based on starch tubers like cocoyam, sweet potato or on cereals like maize, millet and sorghum. Children are normally given these staples in the form of gruels that is either mixed with boiled water (Igyor <em>et al., </em>2011).</p> <p>     Sorghum is an important food crop grown on a subsistence level by farmers in the semi arid tropics of Africa and Asia. It is the principal food crop grown in Northern Nigeria (Zakari and Inyang, 2008). Sorghum like other cereals is predominantly starchy and remains a principal source of energy, protein, vitamins and minerals. Sorghum grows in harsh environments where other crops do not grow well, just like other staple foods, such as cassava, that are common in impoverished regions of the world. It is usually grown without application of any fertilizers or other inputs by a multitude of small _holder farmers in many countries FAO (1999).</p> <p>     African yam bean <em>(Sphenostylis stenocarpa)</em> is an underutilized legume crop that is predominantly cultivated in Western Africa. It produces nutritious pods, highly portentous seeds and capable of growth in marginal areas where other pulses fail to thrive (Enwere, 1998). It has the potential to meet the ever increasing protein demands of the people in this region.</p> <p>     Crayfish, also known as crawfish, freshwater lobsters, to which they are related; taxonomically, they are members of the <em>super families Astacoidea and parastacoidea</em> (Hart 1994). The greatest diversity of crayfish species is found in Southeastern North America, with over 330 species in nine genera, all in the family Cambraridae (Tennessee Aquatic Nuisance 2007). A further genus of astacid crayfish is found in the Pacific Northwest and the headwaters of some rivers east of the continental Divide. Many crayfish are found in lowland areas where the water is abundant in calcium, and oxygen rises from underground springs (Thompson <em>et al.,</em>2007).</p> <p>     Since many African mothers use gruels made from sorghum as complementary foods, for their infants, due to their inability to afford the cost of nutritional superior commercial meaning foods, this work was conducted to evaluate the nutrient composition, functional and organoleptic properties of complementary foods from sorghum, roasted African yam bean and crayfish locally formulated into flour blends.</p> <p><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>To determine the nutrient composition, functional and organoleptic properties of complementary foods from sorghum, roasted African yam bean and crayfish.</p>\n\nNUTRIENT COMPOSITION FUNCTIONAL AND ORGANOLEPTIC  PROPERTIES OF COMPLEMENTARY FOODS FROM SORGHUM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NUTRIENT COMPOSITION FUNCTIONAL AND ORGANOLEPTIC  PROPERTIES OF COMPLEMENTARY FOODS FROM SORGHUM", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Production of jam is a process being advocated for the preservation of our seasonal fruits during their fruiting period. This work is aimed at producing jam without the combination of fruits and to produce without adding colourants or flavour and the important parameters for the preparation are firm ripe fruits rich in pectin sugar and acid as these contributes towards the formation of good firm gel, these jam was produced using banana (Musa nagensium). The proximate composition is as follows protein 5.95%, carbohydrate 83.6%, fat 1.0%, moisture 7.95%, Ash 1.5%. The sensory evaluation test showed that the jam produced, was highly accepted by the judges as there was no significant different in the overall acceptability, apart from the fact that the colour wasn’t as bright as required due to the fact that the production was nut carried out on the day of purchase of the banana. There wasn’t any different between the produced and the purchased. The banana was used successfully to replace strawberry and other fruits that are used in the production of jam. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>ORIGIN, HISTORY OF CULTIVAT OF BANA (Musa nagensium).</strong></p> <p>Edible Musa spp. Originated in south eastern Asia from the India east and south to northern Australia.</p> <p>Early Filipinos probably spread banana east word to the pacific Island, includes Hawaii, prior to recorded history. Westward, banana like followed the major trade routes that transported other fruits and it’s known to have arrived east Africa around 500 AD. Banana were met carried to Europe until the 10th century, and Portugal’s traders obtained it from wets Africa not Asia, during the age of discovery. Plants were taken from West Africa to the Canary Islands and South America in 10th century, and spread throughout the Caribbean with settlements of the area in the 16th – 17th centuries. Bananas are now grown patriotically more countries than any other fruits crop in the world.  </p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF BANAMA (Musa nagensium)</strong></p> <p>Musa is the type of genus of the banana family (Musaccae), which contains 25 – 80 specie of banana and plantain. Both are important throughout the world for food, shelter, medicine and even clothing. In production, banana is the second largest fruit crop in the world, grown in warm tropical climate across the globe. Banana and plantain are often said to grow on trees, but actually it’s a pseudo stern (false stem). The fruit also develops without pollination, which means that banana and plantains are “Virgin” Fruits, and are technically berries.</p> <p>Their evident importance bananas and plantains necessary world wide. Their leaves are used for plates, home made umbrella and thatching (roofing); the pseudostems are made into rafts and benches. The fibers obtains from the pseudostem are used for fishing line in west Africa and fibric in the Philippines. In India, some banana fiber is even made into paper. Ash of dried peels from both bananas and plantain is used for dyeing and making of soap.</p> <p>Various parts of the banana plant are medicinal, and used to treat anything from dysentery to burns and insect bites. These plants also contain natural antibiotics and fungicides and are used as animal food and fertilizer.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>NUTRITIVE VALUE OF BANANA (Musa nagensium)</strong></p> <p>Besides its YUM factor, banana is a power house of nutrients. All its nutritional value and heat benefits are preserved in a natural way by its peel.</p> <p>Banana is easily digestible and has many health benefits to other. Below is some of it nutritive benefits.</p> <p><strong>POTASSIUM</strong></p> <p>A single medium sized banana contains approximately 467mg of potassium and only a negligible 1mg of sodium. Potassium is important for regulating blood pressure and decreasing the risk of high blood pressure and it’s related conditions.</p> <p><strong>CALCIUM</strong></p> <p>Rich in calcium, 100g banana capable of supplying the body with 5mg of calcium. Calcium is essential for the information, as well as upkeep of strong bone and teeth, and for the smooth functions neurotransmitter release and muscle contraction.</p> <p><strong>CARBOHYDRATES</strong></p> <p>Banana are very high on energy, and are usually eaten. Other minerals are: Iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium and fluoride are all found in the banana. Each of these minerals help different body functions and boom the immune system.</p>\n\nPRODUCTION OF JAM USING BANANA ITS NUTRITIVE VALUE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION OF JAM USING BANANA ITS NUTRITIVE VALUE", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <div> <p>            Fix locally sourced citrus fruit (orange citrus sinners) tangerine (citrus reticulate) lemon citrus lemoni) (Lime (citrus aurantifolis) and Grape (citrus paradist) were mixed together to produce mixed fruit drink.

Fruits are also plant parts which have aromatic  and fragrant characteristics and are usually sweet or sweetened before eating. They may also be processed into other fruits  bevcarge marmalades, fruit butters, vinegar, nectars wine pastes price and preserves (Ihekoronye 1999). Processing method used for any fruit depends on the fruit type (janick et- al 1981)</p> <p>There are also different kinds of tropical fruits available for the production of fruit juices and they are pineapple, grape lime lemon shaddock oranges paw- paw  tangerine all these are used for the different purpose depending on the type of drink that is desired, one mature and fully ripe. The chief nutritional contribution of citrus juices other than the calorific energy supply by their natural sugar content is vitamin C which is the anti scurvy vitamin. These facts proves that the possibility that fruit drinks might be substituted  for break fast serving. All the ready to serve canned juice and a few of the other in contrast contained substantial    amount of vitamin C.</p> <p>Various authorities have estimate that 25- 80 % fresh fruit and vegetable produced are lost at harvest in tropical regions which include a large proportion of developing countries, losses can be of  considerable  economic and social importance.

At the beginning of recorded history, wheat was already an established crop whose origin was unknown (Anon 1953). There is however some evidence that cultivation of wheat started about 6,000 years ago in the 5yria – Palestine area and spread to Egypt, (ran, India, China, Russia, Turkey and Central Europe from where it spread to other countries and continents. Countries that produce wheat today include Russia, Switzer land United State of America, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England, Poland, Netherlands, Norway, Swedan, South Africa, Peru, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Newzealand and Nigeria. 9Shellenberger, 1969, Olugbemi etal 1992).</p> <p>In addition, wheat flour has uniques properties that differs it from other flours in containing a considerable proportion of gluten which makes wheat flour suitable for bread making and other bake products. This composition of gluten present has a bearing on the “strength” and water holding properties of the flour. The two protein that form the greater part of the guten are gluternin and gliadin while the latter appear to be identical in strong and weak wheat, the former exists in different varieties.</p> <p>1.1.2 STRUCTURE OF WHEAT KERNEL</p> <p>The main feature of the wheat kernel can be best described in terms of the rounded or dorsal side and a vertical or crease side (Shellenberger, 1969). A deep groove a crease extends the entire length of the wheat kernel. At the apex or the small end of the grain there are many short fine hairs called brush hairs. The outer bran or seed coat consist of three layers known as epidermis.</p> <p>Wheat grain has the following average percentage composition. Endosperm 85% of the whole grain from which the flour is derived bran 12.5%, germ 2.5%.  the composition of wheat flour however varies considerably according to the class of wheat, its country of origin, proportion of the outer part removed by the particular milling process (Ehias, 1972, Nelson 1985). The outer partcontain more protein, fat fibre and ash then the starchy endosperm. The proportion of each of these constituents decreases as the extraction percentage gets less.</p> <p>        CULTIVATION OF BAMBARA GROUNDNUT</p> <p>It is mostly monocropping in a selected plot of land with suitable sandy soil 82% of households in North central are 67% in kavango planted Bambara groundnut in 1993. Estimating an average  of 1400m2 per farm cropped with Bambara groundnut, the total production areas sums up to  around 3000ha. Production figure are very variable, depending on the rainy season. Due to wide spacing 10 – 12 plants/m2 and lack of improved varieties yield rarely exceed 500kg/ha. Taking 250kg/ha as an overall average of the total production to 750t/year.</p> <p>This does not satisfy the market requirements and a considerable amount of Bambara groundnut is informally imported from Angola and sold with local materials on tradition markets. Seed size is an important factor for the marketing of Bambara groundnut.</p> <p>1.1.3 USES</p> <p>1.     The dried mature seed cab be converted into paste, steamed and eaten with vegetable soup or sauce. </p> <p>2.     The form in which the Bambara groundnut seed is commonly consumed is moin-moin usually referred to as ‘Okpa’ in the eastern states of Nigeria.</p> <p>3.     Dried and roasted Bambara groundnut can be used to make soup, flour and porridge.</p> <p>1.1.4 USES OF WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS</p> <p>1.     Wheat is perhaps the most popular cereal grain for the production of bread, cake and other pastries in baking industries.   </p> <p>2.     Wheat bran is used mainly for the formulation animal feed.</p> <p>3.     Farinha, shorts, semolina, semovita, flour from wheat are used for other preparation purpose.</p> <p>4.     It can also be used as an ingredient in breakfast, cereal, macaroni, adhesives and other products.</p> <p>1.2    BAMBARA GROUNDNUT (VOANDZEIA SUBTERAEA)</p> <p>1.2.1 ORIGIN</p> <p>Bambara groundnut belongs to the family of flowering plant called leguminosease. It is an important legume consumed in Nigeria especially in Enugu State and some other Northern States. The Bambara groundnut is native to West Africa. Some wild species are found in North Eastern Nigeria and Northern Cameroon.  It has different name’s in different parts of Africa. It is called ‘Okpa by the Igbos. Bambara groundnut is an important article of commerce in Nigeria. It grows extensively in Northern Nigeria but eaten mostly in eastern Nigeria. A large volume of trade is undertaken between the growing and the consuming population.</p> <p>Bambara groundnut seed vary in shape, size and colour of the seed coat (Ojimelumelukwe (1985) differentiated between four  cultivars with respect to the seed coast, colour and size. Seed may be round cream or russet brown smooth taste. The seeds have white elliptical helium with seed eight ranging between 280 and 320g. </p> <p>1.3    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>1.     To investigate on the effect of storage time on the functional properties of Bambara groundnut and wheat blend for cake prior.</p> <p>2.     To determine effect of storage time on the nutritional quality of the flour blend for cake production.</p> <p>3.     To determine the significant of supplementation in nutritional content of food products.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF STORAGE TIME ON THE FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF WHEAT/BAMBKA GROUNDNUT BLEND<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF STORAGE TIME ON THE FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF WHEAT/BAMBKA GROUNDNUT BLEND", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Production of jam is a process being advocated for the preservation of our seasonal fruits during their fruiting period. This work is aimed at producing jam without the combination of fruits and to produce without adding colourants or flavour and the important parameters for the preparation are firm ripe fruits rich in pectin sugar and acid as these contributes towards the formation of good firm gel, these jam was produced using banana (Musa nagensium). The proximate composition is as follows protein 5.95%, carbohydrate 83.6%, fat 1.0%, moisture 7.95%, Ash 1.5%. The sensory evaluation test showed that the jam produced, was highly accepted by the judges as there was no significant different in the overall acceptability, apart from the fact that the colour wasn’t as bright as required due to the fact that the production was nut carried out on the day of purchase of the banana. There wasn’t any different between the produced and the purchased. The banana was used successfully to replace strawberry and other fruits that are used in the production of jam. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>ORIGIN, HISTORY OF CULTIVAT OF BANA (Musa nagensium).</strong></p> <p>Edible Musa spp. Originated in south eastern Asia from the India east and south to northern Australia.</p> <p>Early Filipinos probably spread banana east word to the pacific Island, includes Hawaii, prior to recorded history. Westward, banana like followed the major trade routes that transported other fruits and it’s known to have arrived east Africa around 500 AD. Banana were met carried to Europe until the 10th century, and Portugal’s traders obtained it from wets Africa not Asia, during the age of discovery. Plants were taken from West Africa to the Canary Islands and South America in 10th century, and spread throughout the Caribbean with settlements of the area in the 16th – 17th centuries. Bananas are now grown patriotically more countries than any other fruits crop in the world.   </p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF BANAMA (Musa nagensium)</strong></p> <p>Musa is the type of genus of the banana family (Musaccae), which contains 25 – 80 specie of banana and plantain. Both are important throughout the world for food, shelter, medicine and even clothing. In production, banana is the second largest fruit crop in the world, grown in warm tropical climate across the globe. Banana and plantain are often said to grow on trees, but actually it’s a pseudo stern (false stem). The fruit also develops without pollination, which means that banana and plantains are “Virgin” Fruits, and are technically berries.</p> <p>Their evident importance bananas and plantains necessary world wide. Their leaves are used for plates, home made umbrella and thatching (roofing); the pseudostems are made into rafts and benches. The fibers obtains from the pseudostem are used for fishing line in west Africa and fibric in the Philippines. In India, some banana fiber is even made into paper. Ash of dried peels from both bananas and plantain is used for dyeing and making of soap.</p> <p>Various parts of the banana plant are medicinal, and used to treat anything from dysentery to burns and insect bites. These plants also contain natural antibiotics and fungicides and are used as animal food and fertilizer.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>NUTRITIVE VALUE OF BANANA (Musa nagensium)</strong></p> <p>Besides its YUM factor, banana is a power house of nutrients. All its nutritional value and heat benefits are preserved in a natural way by its peel.</p> <p>Banana is easily digestible and has many health benefits to other. Below is some of it nutritive benefits.</p> <p><strong>POTASSIUM</strong></p> <p>A single medium sized banana contains approximately 467mg of potassium and only a negligible 1mg of sodium. Potassium is important for regulating blood pressure and decreasing the risk of high blood pressure and it’s related conditions.</p> <p><strong>CALCIUM</strong></p> <p>Rich in calcium, 100g banana capable of supplying the body with 5mg of calcium.

It is a good source of good nutrient such as macronutrients (carbohydrates protein, and fats) and micronutrients (minerals and vitamins) that are essential for human health.</p> <p>Its origin dates back to the Neolithic era and is still one of the consumed and acceptable staple food products in all parts of the world.</p> <p>The word bread is used to describe the whole range of different varieties of bread which may vary in weight, shape, crust hardness, c  \\rumb cell structure, softness, colour and eating quantity.</p> <p>There are many combination and proportion of types of flour and other ingredients and also different traditional recipe and modes of preparation of bread. Bread may leavened by different processes ranging from the use of naturally occurring microbes (sourdough recipe) to high pressure artificial aeration method during preparation or baking. However, some products are left unleavened either for preference or for traditional or religions reasons.</p> <p>In Nigeria, bread has become the second most widely consumed non-indigenous food products after since. It is consumed extensively in most homes, restaurants and hotels. It has been hitherto produced from wheat as a major raw material. In Nigeria, wheat production is limited and wheat flour is imported to meet the local flour needs for baking products. Thus, huge amount of foreign exchange is used every year for the importation of wheat. Effort has been made to promote the use of composite flour in which flour from locally grown gaps replace  a portion of wheat flour for use in bread, thereby decreasing the demand for imported wheat and helping in producing bread.</p> <p>Composite flour is a mixture of wheat with other materials replacing substantially a portion of wheat flour to form suitable flour for baking purposes. The idea of composite flour began by food and Agricultural organization (FAO) in 1960s to reduce the important dependency of developing countries. (Onyeku et al; 2008, Sibel  2006; Owuamanam, 2007). There is now a substantial quantity of composite bread in the market, such bread requires at least 70% wheat flour to be able to rise because wheat contains gluten.</p> <p>Wheat in conventional flour, rich in gluten, which makes a better preference for bread baking. It is however expensive because it is not grown in Nigeria due to the unfavourable climatic condition using huge foreign exchange (Igbabu Biana Dooshima, 2014).</p> <p>The unbridled importation of food by developing countries is detrimental to their local economy and threatens food security. Many developing countries spend large proportion of their foreign exchange earnings on food especially wheat. It is therefore, of economic importance if wheat importation is reduced by the substitution with other locally available raw materials (Onyeku et al; 2008) such as cassava, maize, potato and other carbohydrate flour.</p> <p>High quantity cassava flour has been identified as a local alternative to substitute part of wheat flour in composite flour in Nigeria due to high production of cassava in Nigeria. In Nigeria, cassava is one of the most important crops in terms of production energy intake and contribution to Agricultural GDP. The possibility of using starchy tubers as part of bread production instead of 100% wheat flour depends on their chemical and physical properties. Those in bakery sector have given reasons for the slow adoption of this technology, including ease of deterioration of cassava bread due to high moisture content and microbial load, fear of the presence of toxic components in cassava and finally bulkiness.</p> <p>Of interest in this project work is the production of bread using wheat and cassava flour blends flavoured with ginger.</p> <p>Ginger, an antioxidant have been chosen in this work to be used an a flavouraing agent. Ginger does not only serve an a flavouring agent but also has health benefit.</p> <p>The new study published in LWT-food science and technology suggests that enriching bread with ginger could boost its antioxidant content without having adverse effect on any functional or sensory properties due to potential health benefits, ginger has gained considerable attention as a botanical dietary supplement in both U.S and Europe in recent years, especially for the use in treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions. Gingerols  are group of phenols found  in ginger that are suggested to offer health benefit (Nathan Gray, 2010).</p> <p>1.2<strong> OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>-     To produce bread using composite flours of wheat and cassava flavored with finger of varying ratios.</p> <p>It is hoped that the result will increase the utilization of cassava flour and will reduce the pressure on wheat flour for the production of bread and other bakery products that are of good and acceptable quality.</p> <p><strong>1.3 BREAD</strong></p> <p>       Bread is an age long product and a staple food prepared principally by baking dough of flour. Bread is a food product that is universally accepted as a very convenient of form food that has desirability to all population both the rich and poor, rural and urban.</p> <p><strong>1.3.1 Nutritional value of bread</strong></p> <p>       Bread supplies a significant portion of the nutrients required for growth, maintenance of health and well-being. It is an excellent source of proteins, vitamins, minerals, fiber and complex carbohydrate. It is also low in fat and cholesterol. Bread is quite bulky,  so it takes longer to digest and therefore more satisfying and less fattening than fats, sugars and alcohols commonly consumed in excess. All bread are nutrition’s and the difference between them in nutritional value are not significant if we eat a balance diet.  </p> <p><strong> 1.4 WHEAT AND ITS NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION </strong></p> <p>       Wheat flour contains from 65-70% starch, but it’s most important value lies in its 9 -14% protein content. Gliadin and gluten are the principal proteins, constituting approximately 8% of the gluten. Cellulose, fats and sugar total less that 4%.</p> <p><strong>Endosperm</strong>:  The inner part of the wheat kernel (about 83% of the kernel) consists mostly of starch and it is the source of white flour. Of the nutrients in the whole kernel, the endosperm only contains about 43% of the pantothenic acid, 32% of the riboflavin, 12% of the niacin, 6% of the pyridoxine, 3% of the thiamine and 70-75% of the protein.</p> <p><strong>Bran</strong>: Of the nutrients in the whole kernel the bran (in addition to vital unabsorbable fiber or roughage) contains about 86% of the niacin, 73% of the pyridoxine,  50% of the pantothenic acid, 42% of the riboflavin, 33% of the thiamine and 19% of the protein.</p> <p><strong>Germs: </strong>Of the nutrients in the whole kernel, the germ contains about 64% of the thiamine, 26% of riboflavin, 21% of the pyridoxine, 7% of the pantothenic acid, 2% of the niacin and 8% of protein.</p> <p><strong>1.4.1 Health benefits associated with wheat</strong></p> <p>In the words of Beuchat, L.R. (1999) wheat bring with itself loads of health benefits that can be discussed as follows</p> <p>-     Bread, which is made of wheat flour, is extremely nourishing which gives strength and vitality to people with high appetite. It also helps in curing nose bleeding when wheat is dissolved in milk and sugar is consumed by the victim.</p> <p>-     It is a rich source of vitamin B and basic amino acids including argentine and lysine.</p> <p>-     Wheat also helps in curing constipation and also beneficial for people suffering from cancer.</p> <p>-     The whole grain in wheat helps in preventing diabetes as it influences the insulin level through maintaining the body weight.</p> <p> <strong>1.5 NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF CASSAVA FLOUR</strong></p> <p>Cassava is good and cheap source of carbohydrate. After sugarcane, is considered the highest producer of carbohydrate.</p> <p><strong>1.5.1 Health Benefits of Cassava</strong></p> <p>-     Cassava has nearly twice the calories than potatoes, highest for any tropical starch rich tubers and roots. 100g root provides 160 calories. Their calories mainly comes from sucrose forming the bulk of  the sugars in tubers, accounting for more than 69% not the total sugars.</p> <p>-     Cassava is a moderate source of some the valuable B- complex group of vitamins such as folate, thiamin, pyridoxine (vitamin B-6), riboflavin and pantothenic acid.</p> <p>-     The root is the chief source of some important  minerals like zinc, magnesium, copper, iron and manganese for many inhabitants in the tropical belts.</p> <p>As in other roots and tubers cassava too is free from gluten. Gluten free starch is used in special food preparations for celiac disease patients.</p> </div>\n\nPRODUCTION OF BREAD  USING WHEAT AND CASSAVA BLEND FLAVOURED WITH GINGER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION OF BREAD  USING WHEAT AND CASSAVA BLEND FLAVOURED WITH GINGER", "id": 24}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study was carried out to extract essential oils from cashew shell and its kernel and to characterize the oils; with the view to ascertain their suitability for consumption and other uses. Soxhlet apparatus was used for the extraction using hexane as solvent. The physical and chemical properties of the extracted oil were analyzed. The percentage oil extracted from the shell of the cashew was found to be 25.5% while that extracted from the kernel was 11.8% oil. The results of the physical analysis showed that the cashew kernel oil (CKO) is light yellow while the Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL) is dark brown. The boiling points for shell and kernel oil were 920c and 950c respectively. The cashew kernel oil is non-toxic and the properties of CNSL conformed, to a greater extent, to that exhibited by linseed oil. This suggests its application in the processing and manufacturing industries. The kernel oil conformed both in its physical and chemical properties to those of groundnut and melon oil and thus could be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Essential oils are volatile oils, which occur in some trees. Theyoccur in the leaves, blossoms, fruits, trunks, stems and/or roots of the bearing trees. However, very few of the great number of essential oil bearing species are being used for commercial production of the oils.</p> <p>Though they are called oils, they are quite distinct from the traditional vegetable oils, because they are very light, non- greasy, absorbed quickly into the skin and above all, very volatile [ 1]. A number of essential oils are exploited by chemical and allied industries as a source of specific compounds for subsequent transformation to a wide range of synthetic products such as aroma chemicals, flavours, vitamins and pesticides. They are also valuable in the manufacture of essential balms, medicated ointments, soaps, perfumes, shampoos and other cosmetics. Various methods exist for the recovery of essential oils, which include mechanical expression, effleurage, maceration, steam distillation, water distillation, water and steam distillation and supercritical fluid extraction. Most essential oils currently in use by cosmetic, food, perfumery and pharmaceutical industries in Nigeria are imported. Perhaps, this is due to the fact that there are virtually little or no local manufacturers of these all-important industrial intermediates in Nigeria.</p> <p>Therefore, for the aforementioned numerous uses of essential oils coupled with the high cost of their importation, significant increase in demand by chemical and allied industries and availability of abundant raw materials in Nigeria, there is the need to develop appropriate technology for local production of essential oils. This can assist in reducing the large amount of money being spent on the importation of these oils and if scaled-up to industrial level, it will also provide a base for essential oils exportation which could in turn make Nigeria improve its foreign exchange savings and earnings.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The most important product of the cashew tree is the nut, which is used as confectionery. Cashew shell nut liquid (CNSL), which is of great industrial importance is obtained from the seed pericarp by steam distillation or extraction. When unprocessed or improperly roasted, the cashew nut is very astringent (Abitogun and Borokini, 2009); the complete roasting makes all the allergens inactive. Cashew nut is a high value edible nut which yields two “Oils” one of these found, between the seed coat or pericarp and the nuts.</p> <p>Hence, this work intends to solve the problems of extraction and production of essential oil from cashew nuts.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to investigate the extraction and production of essential oil from cashew nuts. Therefore, the specific objectives are as follows;</p> <p>1. To examine the features of essential oil</p> <p>2. To extract essential oil from cashew nuts</p> <p>3. To determine the physical properties of the essential oil produced</p> <p>4. To determine the chemical properties of the essential oil produced</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE of the study</strong></p> <p>The significance of this research cannot be overemphasized. This is because the research will reveal methods of extraction and production of essential oil from cashew nuts.</p> <p>       It will also benefit student of science Laboratory Technology because it serves as a secondary material for students who will be interested in similar topic.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Almost no significant advancements have been made for the utilization of the cashew nut. There is hardly any literature available, particularly with regard to the extraction and production of essential oil. The present research is to develop a new low-cost and effective extraction and production of the essential oil. The scope of the present investigation is as follows:</p> <p>1. The features of essential oil</p> <p>2.  Extraction of essential oil from cashew nuts</p> <p>3.

Among the different bakery products is the cake. Cakeis a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. In its oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads but now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate and share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards andpies. Typical cake ingredients are flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, a liquid, and leavening agents, such as baking soda and/or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings includedried, candied or fresh fruit, carrot, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit (Modestus, 2011 and Akubor, 2011).</p> <p>Cakes are an important baked product in human diet and are usually eaten with soft drinks, juice or tea and are also used as weaning food for infants. Carrot on the other hand is grown on a large scale in Northern Nigeria (Asagbara and Oyewole, 2010). However, it is widely consumed in all parts of Nigeria. Indeed, the consumption of carrot in Nigeria has increased tremendously in recent years because of the increased awareness of its benefits. Among vegetables, carrot is the best source of carotene which is the precursor of vitamin A, an essential nutrient for maintaining health (Heiman, 2010). Carrot also contains oxycarotenoids such as leutin, which has been shown to be protective against colon cancer in man and woman (Jonas, 2011). Appreciable amounts of other vitamins, minerals and anthocyanins are also found in carrot. Though, in Nigeria, local utilization of carrots is mostly limited to direct unprocessed eating. Carrot can be dehydrated, Therefore, dehydrated carrot could be processed into flour for foods to increase vitamin A and mineral contents. Since carrot is a valuable micronutrients source, drying techniques to be employed for this purpose should ensure maximum nutrient retention. With these considerations in mind it means that the production of cake with the blend of carrot and wheat flour will make a rich nutrients food. Therefore, this study will present the production and assessment of acceptability of cake from a blend of carrot and wheat flour.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The preparation of carrot flour Fresh and well graded carrot fruits, wheat flour and other ingredients for the production of carrot cake is a necessity. Hence, the study intends to solve the problems of achieving an enrich tasty carrot cake. Hence, it seeks to solve the problems of;</p> <p>1. Lack of knowledge for carrot cake production</p> <p>2. The acceptability of carrot cake</p> <p>3. Inadequate ingredients for carrot cake production</p> <p>4. To provide a simple an efficient recipe for carrot cake production</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this project is to present a study on the production and assessment of acceptability of cake from a blend of carrot and wheat flour.</p> <p>       Therefore, the specific objectives are as follows;</p> <p>1.

Differences in chemical and physical properties of soybean cultivars are not taken into consideration in soyfood processing. Information on these characteristics could help food industries obtain products with better functional, nutritional and sensory qualities with greater cost‑benefits (Sbardelotto &amp; Leandro, 2008).</p> <p>Soybean (<em>Glycine max </em>(L.) Merrill) is a particularly good source of protein (35–42%) and fat (16–27%). This makes the soybean one of the most valuable and most commonly cultivated crops (Kumar et al., 2006). The soybean shares the flaw of many plants from the<em>Fabaceae </em>family, namely it is prone to mechanical damage occurring during threshing,<br/>cleaning, drying, transportation, storage and processing. Knowledge of the physical properties of soybean seeds is therefore particularly important for the optimization of harvesting, drying storing and processes (Rybiński et al., 2009). Unlike cereal grains, soybean seeds have two cotyledons between which a gap may be formed if the water content is low. This leads to an increased susceptibility of<br/>the seeds to damage like, for example, breaking in half<br/>(Shahbazi et al., 201).</p> <p>According to their different uses, soybean cultivars are classified as grain‑type, which are conventional<br/>soybeans for oil and animal feeding, and food-type,<br/>which are those for human consumption in fermented<br/>foods and non-fermented foods (tofu, soy flour and soy milk) (Liu, 1999). Therefore, soybean cultivars for human consumption should present special chemical and physical characteristics.</p> <p>In view of the above this project intends to carryout an analysis of physical and chemical properties of soya bean.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this work was to analyze the physical and chemical properties of soybean.</p> <p>Other objectives are;</p> <p>1. To carryout analysis of the physical properties of soya bean</p> <p>2. To determine the chemical properties of soya bean</p> <p>3. To evaluate the physical and chemical properties of soybean cultivars for food processing</p> <p><strong>1.3 Justification of the Study</strong></p> <p>Soybean is an important source of high-quality protein. Soybean cultivars with high protein content allow the production of foods with superior nutritional value and yield, such as soy milk and tofu. To make superior nutritional value and yield products particularly rely on the indepth knowledge of the physical and chemical properties. Therefore, this work will reveal the physical and chemical properties of soybean which will aid anyone with the knowledge of soybean and its physical and chemical properties.</p>\n\nANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SOYA BEAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SOYA BEAN", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Complementary foods were formulated using sorghum, African yam bean and crayfish.

Children are normally given these staples in the form of gruels that is either mixed with boiled water (Igyor <em>et al., </em>2011).</p> <p>Sorghum is an important food crop grown on a subsistence level by farmers in the semi arid tropics of Africa and Asia. It is the principal food crop grown in Northern Nigeria (Zakari and Inyang, 2008). Sorghum like other cereals is predominantly starchy and remains a principal source of energy, protein, vitamins and minerals. Sorghum grows in harsh environments where other crops do not grow well, just like other staple foods, such as cassava, that are common in impoverished regions of the world. It is usually grown without application of any fertilizers or other inputs by a multitude of small _holder farmers in many countries FAO (1999).</p> <p>African yam bean <em>(Sphenostylis stenocarpa)</em> is an underutilized legume crop that is predominantly cultivated in Western Africa. It produces nutritious pods, highly portentous seeds and capable of growth in marginal areas where other pulses fail to thrive (Enwere, 1998). It has the potential to meet the ever increasing protein demands of the people in this region.</p> <p>Crayfish, also known as crawfish, freshwater lobsters, to which they are related; taxonomically, they are members of the <em>super families Astacoidea and parastacoidea</em> (Hart 1994). The greatest diversity of crayfish species is found in Southeastern North America, with over 330 species in nine genera, all in the family Cambraridae (Tennessee Aquatic Nuisance 2007). A further genus of astacid crayfish is found in the Pacific Northwest and the headwaters of some rivers east of the continental Divide. Many crayfish are found in lowland areas where the water is abundant in calcium, and oxygen rises from underground springs (Thompson <em>et al., </em>2007).</p> <p>Since many African mothers use gruels made from sorghum as complementary foods, for their infants, due to their inability to afford the cost of nutritional superior commercial meaning foods, this work was conducted to evaluate the nutrient composition, functional and organoleptic properties of complementary foods from sorghum, roasted African yam bean and crayfish locally formulated into flour blends.</p> <p>AIM AND OBJECTIVE</p> <p>To determine the nutrient composition, functional and organoleptic properties of complementary foods from sorghum, roasted African yam bean and crayfish.</p>\n\nNUTRIENT COMPOSITION FUNCTIONAL AND ORGANOLEPTIC PROPERTIES OF COMPLEMENTARY FOODS FROM SORGHUM ROASTED AFRICAN YAM BEAN AND CRAYFISH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NUTRIENT COMPOSITION FUNCTIONAL AND ORGANOLEPTIC PROPERTIES OF COMPLEMENTARY FOODS FROM SORGHUM ROASTED AFRICAN YAM BEAN AND CRAYFISH", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>a comparative study was done on the physico-chemical and antioxidant properties of some culinary herbs and local spices.

With modernization and the development of patent medicines, the use of natural cures and elixirs decrease in popularity.</p> <p>Nowadays, disillusionment with synthetic drugs, artificial additives and their possible sides effects has given great rise in popularity to many natural products, be it for culinary, medical or cosmetics purposes. In line with the world wide trend for eco-consciousness, the popularity of natural cosmetic purposes. In line with the world wide trend for eco-consciousness, the popularity of natural cosmetic products, such as those sold in red earth and the body shop, attests to the current trend (Broadhurt CL, 2000).</p> <p>Spices are defined as those aromatic plants and their parts, fresh or dried, whole or ground, that are primarily used to impart flavour and fragrances to foods and drink (Prosea 1986). The term is used in a wide sense and includes the culinary herbs. Spices are indispensable in the culinary art, used to create dishes that reflect the history, the culture and the geography of a country. Well-known examples are  curry powder, housing live five spices powder) Pizza herbs and fines herbs (Polansky mm, 2000) spices oils and spice oleoresins are also indispensable in the food and beverages manufacturing industry, the perfumery and cosmetic industry and the pharmaceutical industry. Some spices and derivative possess antioxidant and antibiotic properties, which has increased interest in the commercial exploitation of aromatic plants for food preservation and crop protection with the growing demand natural and organic products and the increasing clamour to dispense with synthetic flavours and artificial food colouring, the future for spices seems bright.</p> <p>According to Pearson 1976 herbs and spices consist of the dried leaves, flowers, buds fruits, seeds, bark or rhizomes of various plants. They are incorporated in foods only in small amounts but they make important contributions towards the odour and flavour due to the presence of the volatile oil 9essentail oil) and fixed oil, local examples include Piper guineense (Uzuza), Xylopia gethiopica  (uda), Mondora myristica (Ehuru, Tretaphleura tetraptra  (Oshsho) and capsicum frutescens(Ose Nsukka).</p> <p>An antioxidant is defined as any substance which is capable of delaying, retarding or preventing the development in food of rancidity or other flavour deterioration due to oxidation,. Antioxidant are only one means of fending packing or there are others such as vacuum packaging or packing under an inert gas to exclude oxygen and refrigeration, freezing, both of which greatly reduce the rate of authorization. Furthermore, it is seldom realized how little oxygen is need to initiate and maintain the oxidation process or how difficult and expensive it can be to remove the last traces of air from a product.  For these reasons it is quite common to combine the use of antioxidants with inert gas packing using an antioxidant should be seen as one of several measures available, but used properly, it is generally effective, easily applied and inexpensive.</p> <p>The prime justification for using an antioxidant is one of need an antioxidant can extend the shelf-life of a food, reducing wastage and complaints, it can reduce nutritional losses (oil soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A, are  prone to oxidation)) and a very important point for the food technologist, it can widen the range of fat which can be used.  Using an antioxidant enables the food manufacturer to smooth out differences in the stability of fats/oils and renders the food product less specific in terms of ingredient requirements. This offers more scope for cost control without jeopardizing the product quality of shelf-life,  without an effective antioxidant, lard for instance, would find far fewer uses.</p> <p>Antioxidants serve two principle functions.</p> <p>1.         They break the oxidation chain by containing the free radicals or acting as hydrogen donor.</p> <p>2.         They direct the breakdown of peroxides into stable substances that do not promote further oxidation (Ihekornye and Ngoddy 1985).</p> <p>An ideal antioxidant meets the following demands:</p> <p>1.     Safe in use.</p> <p>2.   Should impart no odour, flavour or colour.</p> <p>3.    Effective of low concentration.</p> <p>4.    Should be easy to incorporate</p> <p>5.    Should survive cooking process.</p> <p>6.    Should be available at now cost-in-use.</p> <p>(Allen and Haninlton, 1989), John and Peterson, (1974), summarized the general used and properties of herbs and spices as the ability to:-</p> <p>1.   Give flavour to a flavourable base.</p> <p>2.  Impart a different flavour character to the basic product.</p> <p>3.  Disguise objectionable intrinsic flavour and boost intrinsic flavour which would otherwise be too weak.</p> <p>According to Ikekornye and Ngoddy, (1985) the effectiveness and optimal utilization of a spice for its various uses depends on certain factors such as method of growing, harvesting sorting, storage and ultimately processing techniques.</p> <p>Traditionally, spices are sued to prepared food for nursing mothers, it is believed to be very useful in cleaning the uteral lining after child birth. It is believed to have contract the womb to its normal size after birth. It is used in preparing native concoction for the treatment of convulsion and “jedi-jedi” in infant, a diseases which gives rise to greenish stool, stomach upset and inflamed.  It is generally used in treating some minor ailment such as stomach upset, headaches, malaria, bronchitis and many others (Uba, 1997).</p> <p>1.1    OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>Herbs and spices are known to be incorporated in food only in small amounts but they make important contributions towards the odour and flavour due to the presence of the volatile oil (essential oil) and fixed oil and little or on work has been done on most local culinary herbs and spices. The aim of this project is to extract these oleoresin and essential oils in herbs and spices that impart flavours and fragrances present for the manufacture of foods, beverages, perfumery, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, and to determine the antioxidant properties of these local spices and herbs for food products, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.</p>\n\nTHE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL AND ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES OF CULINARY HERBS AND LOCAL SPIES PIPE GUIEENSE (UZIZA) XYLPIA AETHPICA (UDA) MONODORA MYRISTICA (EHURU) TETRAPELURA TETRAPTERA (OSHOSHO)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL AND ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES OF CULINARY HERBS AND LOCAL SPIES PIPE GUIEENSE (UZIZA) XYLPIA AETHPICA (UDA) MONODORA MYRISTICA (EHURU) TETRAPELURA TETRAPTERA (OSHOSHO)", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p><p>   INTRODUCTION </p> <p>Fruits are part of a plant that houses  seeds or flesh covering of nuts or succulent they are pulpy in character often juice and since they develop from flowers of plants they consist of the ripened seed or seeds with some edible tissue attached    ( Iheoronye and Ngoddy 1985).

Examples of heavy metals include Mercury (Hg), Cadmium (Cd), Arsenic (As), Lead (Pb), Chromium (Cr), Thallium (Ti). Heavy metals are natural components of the earth’s crust.  They cannot be degraded or destroyed.  To a small extent they enter bodies via food, drinking water and air.  For food analyst they are termed contaminants which are undesirable materials, which have been added to advertently before, during or after processing of foods.  Heavy metals are dangerous because they tend to bioaccumulate.  Bioaccumulation means an increase in the concentration of the chemical in biological organism overtime compared to the chemical concentration in the environment, compounds accumulate in living things anytime they are take up and stored faster than they are broken down or excreted.</p> <p>During the early life most substances that people were likely to encounter in their daily lives were derived with little modification from the earth, the animals, vegetables, crops or the mineral sources. Today, there is an extensive existence of synthetic chemical in the environment a class, which was not present until their creation by human scientific and industrial effort.  The domination of chemicals is increasing in our lives, can we imagine life without Agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, preservatives, colourants, plastics, etc. (Envis Newsletter, 2002).  Heavy metals can enter a waste or even from acidic rain breaking down soils and many heavy metals into streams, lakes, rivers and ground water. The presence of the most undesirable elements in foods can usually be attributed to any of the following causes:</p> <p>·        Natural occurrence e.g. deposition in the liver of animals.</p> <p>·        Sprays used as insecticides during cultivation e.g. Lead arsenate.</p> <p>·        Accidental contamination due to confusion of materials of similar appearance.</p> <p>·        Food may dissolve metals from the equipment and containers e.g. from Tin plate, foils, solders galvanized iron and cheap enamels and glazes.  Fermented dairy products such as yoghurt are among the recreational drinks taken paramount to boost appetite and could also be taken at leisure.  Yoghurt is a fermented milk product, which has its origin in Eastern Europe, but it is now consumed throughout the world.  The French called it “milk of eternity” as it was believed to have therapeutic powers and gave life to those who consumed it.</p> <p>Yoghurt is about the most consumed milk product in Lagos State which may partly be accounted for by the fact that, it is the most readily available milk product and since cheese is difficult to come by in Lagos unlike the <br/> other parts of the country.  In the above sense the investigation of heavy metals should be a paramount and essential topic.  Because the toxicity of the heavy metals such as Lead causes miscarriage in pregnant women, sudden and infant death syndrome and stillbirth. (Boekx, 1986).  The increase in Lead in the body is also known for its devastating effects on brain development (Bryee – Smith and Stephenes, 2001).  Chromium causes kidney and liver damage and Cadmium also causes renal problem, anaemia and reproductive failure. (Murthy and Reha 2001).  Heavy metals such as Lead, Cadmium and Chromium have been recognized to be potential toxic within specific limiting values, a considerable potential hazard exit for human nutrition.</p> <p>The metals are useful to man, but their usefulness depends on the chemical specification for examples their salts could be used as preservatives, disinfectants, fumigant and so on in the industries producing yoghurt.</p> <p>1.1    <strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>·        To detect the occurrence of heavy metals, Lead, Chromium, Cadmium contaminating yoghurt sold in Lagos market.</p> <p>·        To determine the concentration of these heavy metals in yoghurt sold in Lagos market.</p> <p>·        To give review on the health implication of these heavy metals at high concentration.</p>                                                           \n\nINVESTIGATION ON THE OCCURENCE OF HEAVY METALS IN YOGHURT SOLD<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATION ON THE OCCURENCE OF HEAVY METALS IN YOGHURT SOLD", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Food Irradiation is the process of exposing food to ionizing radiation to disinfect, sanitize, sterilize, preserve food or to provide insect disinfestation. (wikipedia.org)</p> <p>Food irradiation is sometimes referred to as cold pasteurization or electronic pasteurization to emphasize its similarity to the process of pasteurization. Like pasteurization of milk and pressure cooking of canned foods, treating food with ionizing radiation can kill bacteria and parasites that would otherwise cause food borne diseases. (wikipedia.org; www.cdc.gov)</p> <p>By irradiating food, depending on the dose, some or all of the microbes, fungi, viruses or insects present are killed. This prolongs the life of the food in cases where microbial spoilage is the limiting factor in shelf life. Some foods (e.g. herbs and spices) are irradiated at such high doses (5kGy or more) that they show microbial counts reduced by several orders of magnitude. It has also been shown that irradiation can delay the ripening or sprouting of fruits and vegetables and replace the need for pesticides.</p> <p>Studies have shown that when Irradiation is used as approved on foods:</p> <p>·                    Disease-causing germs are reduced or eliminated.</p> <p>·                    The food does not become radioactive</p> <p>·                    Dangerous substances do not appear in foods</p> <p>·                    The nutritional value of the food is essentially unchanged. (www.cdc.gov)</p> <p>In the food industries, specific types of radiation treatments are used, they are Radurization, Radicidation, and Radappertization. However, in the actual process of irradiation, three different irradiation technologies are used namely; gamma irradiation, electron-beam irradiation and x-ray radiation. (www.cdc.gov)</p> <p>The dose of irradiation is usually measured in a unit called the Gray, abbreviated (Gy). This is a measure of the amount of energy transferred to food, microbes or other substances being irradiated. To measure the amount of irradiation something is exposed to, photographic film is exposed to irradiation at the same time.</p> <p>The killing effect of irradiation on microbes is measured in D-values. One D-value is the amount of irradiation to kill 90% of that organism. For example, it takes 0.3kGy to kill 90% of Escherichia Coli, so the D-value of E.coli is 0.3 kGy. (www.cdc.gov).</p> <p>A distinctive logo has been developed for use on food packaging, in order to identify a product as irradiated. This symbol is called the “radura” and is used internationally to mean that the food in the package has been irradiated. (www.cdc.gov)</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>FOOD IRRADIATION DEVELOPMENTS</strong></p> <p>There is a widening gap in the less developed countries (LDC’s) of Africa, Asia and Latin America between the growth rates of population and food production. Yet, in LDC’s over a quarter of the harvested food is lost due to wastage and spoilage. In Nigeria, very high losses of foods, especially highly perishable foods such as fish, fruits, vegetable and some dietary staples such as yam, maize, millet and sorghum occur in the time lag between harvest and consumption and during storage. There is, therefore, the need for greater utilization of the available appropriate technologies of food preservation in these countries (Aworh, 1986).</p> <p>In the last three decades a new technology, food irradiation, has been developed which has the potential of reducing food losses in LDC’s (Aworh, 1986).</p> <p>Research on Food irradiation dates back to the turn of the 20th century. The first US and British patents were issued for use of ionizing radiation to kill bacteria in foods in 1905. Food irradiation gained significant momentum in 1947 when researchers found that meat and other foods could be sterilized by high energy and the process was seen to have potential to preserve food for military troops in the field. To establish the safety and effectiveness of the irradiation process, the U.S. Army began a series of experiments with fruits, vegetables, dairy products, fish and meat in the early 1950’s. (www.ccr.uc davis.edu).</p> <p>In 1958, Congress gave the FDA authority over the food irradiation process under the 1958 Food Additive Amendment to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA has approved food irradiation process for wheat, potatoes, pork, spices, poultry, fruits, vegetables and red meat (www.ccr.uc davis.edu).</p> <p>Food irradiation was recognised by the United Nations which established the Joint Expert Committee on Food Irradiation. Their first meeting was in 1964. The committee concluded in 1980 that “irradiation of foods up to the dose of 10kGy introduces no special nutritional or microbiological problems”. (www.ccr.uc davis.edu).</p> <p>In 1999, the World Health Organisation determined the dose limitation at very high dose is palatability etc. Irradiation should be considered parallel to cooking in all aspects of safety. (www.ccr.uc davis.edu).</p> <p>Tremendous progress has been made, in the past few decades, in the design and construction of safe radiation facilities and chances of radiation accidents are now very remote provided that personnel have been properly trained in the operation of radiation facilities (Aworh, 1986).</p>\n\nIRRADIATION AS A MEANS OF PRESERVATION IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IRRADIATION AS A MEANS OF PRESERVATION IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>        <strong>                                                                        PAGES</strong></p> <p>Title page                                                                 i</p> <p>Certification                                                             ii</p> <p>Dedication                                                               iii</p> <p>Acknowledgement                                                    iv</p> <p>Table of Content                                                      vi</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0      Introduction                                                     1</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.0      History of Nutritional Disorder                         5</p> <p>2.1   Literature Review                                             5</p> <p>2.2   Diagnosis of Nutritional Disorder                     8</p> <p>2.3   Causes and Symptoms                                    9</p> <p>2.4   Effect of malnutrition                                       10</p> <p>2.5   Effect of protein Energy Malnutrition               11</p> <p>2.6   Classes of Food, deficiency, Symptom, Causes        14</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0   Material and Methods                                      18</p> <p>3.1   Method Identifying Kwashiorkor                      19</p> <p>3.2   Prediction of Nutritional Status of Chemical   </p> <p>        analysis of Urine and Anthropometric method 20</p> <p>3.3      Method of Detecting Anaemia                          21</p> <p>3.4      Method of Detecting Iodine Deficiency             22</p> <p>3.5      Method of Detecting Vitamin A deficiency        23</p> <p>3.6      Method of detecting Ricket and osteomalacia 24</p> <p>3.7      Method of detecting scurvy                              25</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p>4.0   Results and Discussion                                   27</p> <p>4.1   Symptoms and control of Protein Energy        </p> <p>        Malnutrition                                                    27</p> <p>4.1.1Kwashiorkor                                                    28</p> <p>4.1.2Marasmus                                                        30</p> <p>4.2      Symptoms and control of Anaemia                  32</p> <p>4.3      Symptoms and control of vitamin A deficiency 33</p> <p>4.4      Symptoms and control of vitamin C                 35</p> <p>4.5        Symptoms and control of ricket and osteomalacia         36</p> <p>4.6      Symptoms and control of Goiter                      38</p> <p>4.7      Symptoms and control of pellagra                   40</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.0   Conclusion                                                      42</p> <p>5.1   Recommendation                                             42</p> <p>        REFERENCES                                                 44</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Nutritional disorder can be defined as the disease caused by nutritional imbalance, either over nutrition or under nutrition.  Nutritional disorder may result from eating too much of little of foods of a particular nutrients such as vitamins or minerals.  (www.studenttechnology.com.). When food lack one or more of the common nutrients in food, one disease condition or another may result.  These diseases are called “deficiency  disease”.  (Akinjayeju,  1999).</p> <p>Under nutrition as nutritional deficiency, refers to any change in the structure or function of body cells and tissues as a results of lack of one or more nutrients and or calories in the body.   Nutritional deficiencies are of two main types namely:- Primary and Secondary deficiency.  The nature and types of deficiency diseases that may occur depends on the type of nutrient the body lacks.  (Akinjayeju, 1999).</p> <p>The most common deficiency disease is that relating to inadequate protein in diet and general shortage or lack of food thereby resulting in the inability to meet body’s energy requirements.  Such, diseases is referred to as protein calorie – malnutrition (PCM).  This diseases is common in infant and children, especially those below age six where it manifests as either Kwashiorkor (as a result of low intake of protein or deficiency of certain essential amino acid) or marasmus caused by energy and protein shortage. (Akinjayeju, 1999).</p> <p>Nutritional disorder can affect any system in the body and the sense of sight, taste and smell.  Malnutrition begins with changes in nutrient level in blood and tissues (www.studenttechnology.com.).</p> <p>In addition to the deficiency diseases, there are certain specific nutritional disorders, which are of great concern in developing countries including Nigeria.  The World Health Organisation has identified three of such nutritional diseases, which she said deserves special attention and highest priority on a global referred to as “hidden hunger” include -: Iron deficiency anaemia, vitamin A deficiency, vitamin c deficiency, vitamin D deficiency and iodine deficiency disorder.

Tigernut tubers were washed, soaked for 96h, dried and milled into flour (300µm). Three weaning foods; STF1 (Tigernut: 75%; soybean: 15%); STF2 (Tigernut: 65%; Soybean: 25%); STF3 (Tigernut: 55%; Soybean: 35%) with 10% full cream powdered milk (FCM) each  were prepared to yield formulated weaning food (FWD).

FWDs contained higher (P&lt;0.05) amounts of protein, ash, fat, fiber, energy and mineral contents than the control. STF3 recorded higher (P&lt;0.05) ash, protein, fiber, calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron and zinc.  Among the FWDs, STF3 had higher (P&lt;0.05) panelists ratings for all the sensory attributes and it compared favorably with the control.</p> <p>STF3 was rated higher (P&lt;0.05) for overall acceptability compared to the control.

Although all the formulated diets met the benchmark for infant food, taking into consideration the dietary profile and sensorial ratings, STF3 (Tigernut 55%; Soybean 35%, 10% milk) was found to be the most promising formulation. This indicates that underutilized tigernut tubers could be exploited to produce adoptable household cheap weaning food with soybean that can compare favorably with commercial brand. This could be a sustainable way of curbing malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa.<br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 background to the study</strong></p> <p>Infants and young children suffer from malnutrition in most developing countries. The growth of infant in the first and second year of life is very rapid and breast milk alone cannot meet the child’s nutritional requirements.  The infant needs supplementary feeding starting from 46 months (Achinewhu, 1987; Ijarotimi and Famurewa, 2006). Many brands of preparatory foods have been developed and marketed; however these brands are too expensive and therefore are beyond the economics of low income families. The high price of proprietary weaning food and animal proteins combined with faulty feeding practices are mostly responsible for aggravating malnutrition among children (Dutra-de –Olivera, 1991). Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) generally occurs during the crucial transitional phase when children are weaned from liquid to semi solid or fully adult foods. Children therefore require nutritionally balanced calorie-dense supplementary foods in addition to mother’s milk (Berggren, 1982; Cameroon and Hafvander, 1971). Several studies have reported that most of the weaning foods consumed by children in many parts of developing nations are deficient in essential macro and micro nutrients (Levin et al., 1993; Brabin and Coulter, 2003; Milward and Jackson, 2004). In view of this nutritional problem, several strategies have been used to formulate weaning food (Lalude and Fashakin, 2006; Ijarotimi and Ashipa, 2006; Ijarotimi and Bakare, 2006) through a combination of locally available under-ultilized food crops that complement each other.</p> <p>Tigernut (Cyperus esculentus) is an underutilized readily available crop in Nigeria. It belongs to the family of Cyperaceae, which produce rhizomes from the base and are somewhat spherical. The tubers contain significant amount of protein, fat, minerals and vitamins (Alobo and Ogbogo, 2007; Oladele and Aina, 2007). In addition, tigernut tubers could be used for the treatment of flatulence, indigestion, diarrhea, dysentery and excessive thirst (Chevallier, 1996). The use of such readily available underexploited crop to complement with legumes such as soybeans in developing a simple household low cost weaning food hold promise in alleviation  of infant  malnutrition. The challenge therefore is to develop a nutrient dense supplementary infant food from locally available underutilized crops that could be adoptable at the household level. </p> <p><strong>1.2 Uses Of Soybeans</strong></p> <p>When the farmer sells soybeans to a grain dealer, the beans may then go to a number of ultimate destinations. When processed, a 60-pound bushel will yield about 11 pounds of crude soybean oil and 47 pounds of soybean meal. Soybeans are about 18% oil and 38% protein. Because soybeans are high in protein, they are a major ingredient in livestock feed. Soybeans are processed for their oil (see uses below) and meal (for the animal feed industry). A smaller percentage is processed for human consumption and made into products including soy milk, soy flour, soy protein, tofu and many retail food products. Soybeans are also used in many non-food (industrial) products.</p> <p>Some soybeans are needed to produce another crop each year. High quality soybeans are grown, harvested and purchased by the seed industry to be used as seed for the next year’s crop.  Researchers in the seed industry focus on developing new soybean varieties with outstanding characteristics including high yield, lodging resistance, nematode resistance, herbicide tolerance, and many other desirable characteristics.</p> <p><strong>Food for Humans</strong></p> <p>Nearly all soybeans are processed for their oil. Soy processors (such as Cargill &amp; ADM) take the raw soybeans and separate the oil from the meal. The oil may be refined for cooking and other edible uses, or sold for biodiesel production or industrial uses. The processors bake the high-protein fiber that is left after the oil is removed and sell it for animal feed.</p> <p>Soybean oil is used in cooking and frying foods. Margarine is a product made from soybean oil. Salad dressings and mayonnaises are made with soybean oil.</p> <p>Some foods are packed in soybean oil (tuna, sardines, etc.)  Baked breads, crackers, cakes, cookies and pies usually have soybean oil in them.</p> <p><strong>Feed for Animals</strong></p> <p>The high-protein fiber (that which remains after processing has removed the oil) is toasted and prepared into animal feed for poultry, pork, cattle, other farm animals and pets.  The poultry and swine industries are major consumers of soybean meal. Over half of the soybeans processed for livestock feed are fed to poultry, about one-quarter is fed to swine, and the rest is used for beef cattle, dairy cattle and pet food.</p> <p>Soy protein is increasingly found in fish food, both for home aquariums and for the fish grown for eating.  Most marine species were fed fish meal at one time, but the scarcity and increasing cost of fish meal has led producers to switch to high protein soymeal for a variety of marine species. Around the world, soy protein may be found in feed for most animals.</p> <p><strong>Other Uses</strong></p>                                                         \n\n EVALUATION OF THE PHYSICO CHEMICAL AN SENSORY PROPERTIES OF INFANT FOOD PRODUCED FROM MAIZE, SOYBEAN AND TIGER NUT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  EVALUATION OF THE PHYSICO CHEMICAL AN SENSORY PROPERTIES OF INFANT FOOD PRODUCED FROM MAIZE, SOYBEAN AND TIGER NUT", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>Soy yoghurt was prepared using soy milk as a base and banana flavour fruit juice as a supplement. Three different samples were made by blending 5% and 10% banana flavour with 95% and 90% soy yoghurt respectively and one sample from soy yoghurt only as a control. 0.05% dairy yoghurt was added to each of the samples as a starter culture and the effect of fortification of banana flavour juice on the sensory characteristics of soy milk based yoghurt was evaluated. The finding indicated that the highest score of sensory attributes was related to the sample made using 10% banana flavour and 90% soy yoghurt. Significantly different taste among other samples was observed on this product and together with the sample made using 5% banana flavour and 95% soy yoghurt, significantly different score for flavor and overall acceptability was observed.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Yoghurt is a dairy production that has more profits than milk. Digestive system in some of people has an allergy to lactose (sugar of milk), but lactose is transformed to lactic acid in yoghurt and dose not create allergy [8] .</p> <p>On the other hand , calcium of yoghurt is absorbed in body faster than milk. Because , lactic acid of yoghurt turns calcium to solution and absorbtion . therefor , yoghurt devotes calcium to body more than milk.[8]</p> <p>Yoghurt decreases event of bowel cancer remarkably and is more effective in absorbing minerals , proteins and vitamins of group bue to containing biological adequate conditions.the measurement of vitamines and salts in yoghurt is more than milk in the same volume , because dry matter of yoghurt is more than milk.yoghurt contains vitamins of B,C,A,D,E and all ingredients and features of milk.yoghurt strengthen abdomen and helps digestion of food and relax nerves due to containing vitamin B [1,2]</p> <p>Experts recommend to use of yoghurt with antibiotics because the majority of antibiotics are fatal for profit bacteria of digestive system and results in disorder in it.</p> <p>Based on investigations, the death of these bacteria can create high or medium dysentery.</p> <p>Yoghurt can help to back to natural conditions.it has been recommended that patients use at least 250 ml of yoghurt in their daily dietary when they use antibiotics more than two weeks.since both yoghurt and banana have high nutrition facts , the production of fruity yoghurt with banana flavor has been noticed [3] .</p> <p>Soymilk is milk produced from soybeans. Soybeans are generally considered to be a source of complete protein. A complete protein is one that contains significant amount of all the essential amino acids that must be provided to the human body because of the body’s inability to synthesize them. For this reason, soy is a good source of protein, amongst many others, for many vegetarians and vegans or for people who cannot afford milk and meat, since it is the least expensive source of dietary protein. The gold standard for measuring protein quality, since 1990, is the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) and by this criterion soy protein is the nutritional equivalent of meat and eggs for human growth and health. Soybean protein isolate has a biological value of 74, whole soybeans 96, soybean milk 91, and eggs 97 [5] . The increasing concern about fat and cholesterol content of animal milk is another factor promoting the selection of vegetable substitute for animal milk. Unsaturated fatty acid in the diet is recommended to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease [6] . Consumption of vegetable milk may also be beneficial in cases of lactose intolerance.</p> <p>Efforts have been devoted to exploiting soybean and soybean products for the manufacture of palatable food products [7] . Products obtainable from soymilk include soy yoghurt, soy cheese, soy ice cream and the likes. Enrichment of cereal-based traditional weaning food by complementing with soybean tempeh has been reported [8] .

Human nutrition now is concerned with the utilization of this food in the human system. Because both cases are referring to food, it shows that both terms are inter-related. Actually, food science plays significant roles in human nutrition as it broadens our horizon on the foods we consume. Some of the roles of foods science in human nutrition includes: food processing as it as shown variable ways in which one food commodity can be processed into different forms; food fortification and enrichment in which nutrients that were not present or that were present but lost during processing are added to the food at even greater levels; and also food preservation and storage which show us how to keep our foods safe for future use.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF FOOD SCIENCE IN HUMAN NUTRITION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF FOOD SCIENCE IN HUMAN NUTRITION", "id": 38}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PALM OIL PROCESSING</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>     It is generally agreed that the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) originated in the tropical rain forest region of West Africa (Ishiwu &amp; Iwouno, 2006). The main belt runs through the Southern latitudes of Cameroon. Cotedivire, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone. Togo and into the equatorial region of Angola and the Congo. Processing oil palm fruit for edible oil has been practiced in Africa for thousand of years and the oil produced, highly coloured and flavoured, is an essential ingredient in much of the traditional west Africa cuisine  (according to  Ishiwu &amp; Iwouno, 2006). The traditional process is simple, but tedious and inefficient.<br/> During the 4th to 17 centuries, some palm fruits were taken to the Americas and from there to the Far East. The plant appears to have thrived better in the Far East, thus providing the largest commercial production of an economic crop far removed from its centre of origin (Ihekoronye &amp; Ngoody, 1999). Palm oil is rich in carotenoids (pigments found in plants and animals) form which it derivers its deep red colour, and the major component of its glycerides is the saturated fatty and palmitic, hence it is a semi-solid, even at tropical ambient and a solid fat in temperate climates.

Nigeria alone produces 21,814 millions tons of yams per year, making it the worlds  largest yam producer. It is estimated that after six months in storage, up to 56% of the crop is lost due to rot. Polyphenol oxidase, a copper-containing metalloprotein, catalyzes the oxidation of phenolic compounds to quinines, which pr5oduce brown pigments in wounded tissues. This enzymes mechanism causes post harvest losses and mainly affects tropical roots and tubers. Characterization of the polyphenol oxidase could help to develop or to choose more effective methods for controlling browning of roots and tubers. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was isolated from water yam (Dioscorea alata) and purified by acetone precipitation and dialysis. The optimum pH for the acetone purified PPO catalyzed oxidation of catechol was found to be pH 6.8.<br/>Catechol is used to provide quinine compounds that are used to produce melanins. Tyrosine is used to synthesize melanins in humans. The application of lineweaver-burke analysis of enzymatic activity; water yam polyphenol oxidase (PPO) Vmax is 0.5 absorbance units per minute while km is 0.25m. Vmax is not measured in “absorbance units per minute”. Those units were chosen to simplify the experiment.    <br/>Table of contents<br/>Chapter one<br/>1.0 Introduction                                                 <br/>1.1 Aims and Objectives                                              <br/>Chapter two<br/>2.0 Literature review                                           <br/>2.1 Origin of yam                                                       <br/>2.2 General morphology of yam tuber                   <br/>2.3 Prospects and constraints of production and<br/>     Marketing                                                             <br/>2.4 Utilization                                                             <br/>2.4.1 Prospect and constraints of the utilization of<br/>       Yam                                                                  <br/>2.5 Distribution                                                   <br/>2.6 Polyphenol oxidase                                        <br/>2.7 Enzymatic browning                                               <br/>2.7.1 Browning control                                        <br/>2.7.2 Chemical antibrowning effectors                   <br/>2.8 Enzyme inhibition                                          <br/>2.8.1 Competitive inhibition                                  <br/>2.8.2 Noncompetitive inhibition                             <br/>2.8.3 Uncompetitive inhibition                                       <br/>2.8.4 Substrate and product inhibition                    <br/>2.8.5 Allosteric enzymes                                              <br/>2.8.6 Cooperativity (Homoallostery)                      <br/>Chapter three<br/>3.0 Materials and methods                                   <br/>3.1 Source of materials                                               <br/>3.2 Methods                                                              <br/>3.2.1 Extraction and purification of PPO                 <br/>3.2.2 PPO assay                                                 <br/>3.2.3 Browning and POD inhibitor                          <br/>3.3 To determine the nature of inhibition of<br/>     tyrosine on polyphenol oxidase in water yam     <br/>Chapter four<br/>4.0 Results and discussion                                    <br/>4.1 Discussion                                                            <br/>4.2 Results of determinations in Spectrophotometer <br/>4.3 Results of inverse of determinations of spectrophotometer                                  <br/>Chapter five<br/>5.0 Conclusion and recommendation             <br/>5.1 Conclusion                                                   <br/>5.2 Recommendation                                  <br/>References                                                <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.0 INTODUCTION:<br/>Yam (Dioscorea Spp),which is an annual or perennial climbing plant with edible underground tuber, is native to warmer regions of both southern and northern hemispheres (IITA,2004).Yam is an important food crop for many people in the yam zone of west Africa and a very important source of income in rural and marginal areas (Phaction,2002, Vernier, 1998).it has long served as the principal source of food and nutrition for many of the worlds poorest and undernourished house holds, and generally valued for their stable yields under conditions in which other crops may fail (Alexadratos,1995, Scott et al. 2000).<br/>Since several decades yam has been embedded in the population habit and has a socio-cultural significance (IITA, 2006). There are over 600 yam species grown throughout the world , but in west Africa the most economically important species are the white yam (Dioscorea  rotundata),yellow yam (Dioscorea cayenensis) and water yam (Dioscorea data ) (vernier, 1998).<br/>Dioscorea alata is wide spread in distribution being grown is wide spread in distribution being grown in tropics and subtropics of Africa, America, Asia and Caribbean. The tubers are nearly always single and very large weighing upto 60kg and measuring upto 2 meter in length. The dry matter of the yam tuber varies between 20-40% of which inturn consist of 60-80% of starch depending on the variety (Lebot et al., 2005).<br/>Despite its importance, yam including D. alata belongs to the neglected crops and many constraints limit its production. Due to the perishability of the crop, the tubers cannot be kept for more than a few weeks after harvesting, 50% of the crops may be lost within 6 months due to rot or germination if no stabilization processes are used, and this explains the volatility in fresh yam prices over the years (Vernier, 1998). Also, the high water content and fragility of fresh tubers affects transport and marketing costs.<br/>L-tyrosine is a conditionally essential aminor acid because under normal conditions the body synthesis sufficient quantities from phenylalanine. For those with phenylketonuria, however, a severe deficiency in the evizyme phenylalanine hydroxylase prevents conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, making tyrosine an essential amino acid for this population (Glaeser et al., 1979).<br/>Tyrosine is incorporated into proteins of all life forms and is a precursor for synthesis of thyroxin, melanin, and the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine. Food sources of tyrosine include fish, soy products, poultry, eggs, dairy products, lima beans, almonds, peanuts, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, wheat germ, oats, avocados, and bananas. Clinical conditions for which tyrosine supplementation may be of therapeutic benefit include depression, hypertension, stress, cognitive function and memory, parkinson’s disease, phenylketonuria, and narcolepsy (Melamed and Glaeser, 1980).<br/>Polyphenol Oxidase (PPOs) are a group of copper-proteins, widely distributed phylogenetically from bacteria to mammals, that catalyze the oxidation of phenolics to quinines which produce brown pigments in wounded tissues. PPO has been implicated in the formation of pigments, oxygen scavenging and defense mechanism against plant pathogens, and herbivory insects. Phenolic compounds serve as precursors in the formation of physical polyphenolic barriers, limiting pathogen translocation. The quinines formed by PPOs can bind plant proteins, reducing protein digestibility and their nutritive value to herbivores (Mayer, A.M. 1987). On the other hand, the oxidation of phenolic substrates by PPO is thought to be the major cause of the brown coloration of many fruits and vegetables during ripening, handling, storage and processing. This problem is of considerable importance to the food industry as it effects the nutritional quality and appearance, reduces the consumer’s acceptability and, therefore, causes significant economic impact, both to food producers and to food processing industry. It is estimated that over 50% of losses in fruits occur as a result of enzymatic browning and tropical and subtropical fruits and vegetables are the most susceptible to these reactions (Marshall et al., 2000).<br/>PPO is regarded to be a critical enzyme in food technology, and it has been intensively studied in several plants. It is known that plant PPOs are synthesized as preproteins and contain putative plastid transit peptides at the N-terminal region, which target the enzyme into chloroplast and thylcaloid lumen. PPO from some plants has been described as a multiple gene family (Mayer, 2006).<br/>Plant PPOs have broad substrates specificities and are able to oxidize a variety of mono, di or polyphenols. Phenolic compounds are natural substances that contribute to the sensorial properties (color, taste, aroma and texture) associated with fruit quality (Yoruk and Marshall, 2003).<br/>1.1 Aims and objectives<br/>To extract the enzyme polyhenol oxidase from yam.<br/>To dialyze the enzyme that was extracted<br/>To study the inhibitory effect of tyrosine on polyhenol oxidase in water yam.<br/> <br/>\n\nSTUDIES ON THE INHIBITORY EFFECT ON TYROSINE ON POLYPHENOL OXIDASE IN WATER YAM ABSTRACT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STUDIES ON THE INHIBITORY EFFECT ON TYROSINE ON POLYPHENOL OXIDASE IN WATER YAM ABSTRACT", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSING TECHNIQUES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOYMILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE</b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/> This study examined the effects of different processing techniques on the organoleptic quality of soymilk processing and storage. The utilization of soybean for the production of soy milk was studied. Soy milk was extracted from whole and dehulled seed, pasteurized and fermented. All soy milk samples were analyzed for proximate composition (moisture%, ash %, total solids, fat) and the organoleptic tests (color, thickness, appearance, body, texture, taste, smell, flavor and overall acceptability) of the soy milk samples were evaluated to determine the shelf-stability of the products during refrigeration and room temperature storage. The moisture, protein, fibre, fat, ash, carbohydrate and total solids of soy milk from whole and dehulled seed differed significantly (p&lt;0.05). There was marked variation in the % fat content of the products. The results of the sensory evaluation revealed that flavor with respect to taste and smell had significant influence (p&lt;0.05) on overall acceptability of soy milk product. The sensory properties of yam bean yoghurt samples were compared with soybean yoghurt. The sensory properties showed that sample stored at refrigeration temperature maintained good quality up to 16 days storage while samples stored at room temperature were of poor quality by the 4th day. The implication of these results is discussed. So, the soy milk manufacturers need to improve on the sensory properties in particular flavor and taste for better consumer acceptability. Also, they may improve on packaging by labeling to specifications that precisely represent the content and type.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>History of Soybeans<br/>Uses of Soybeans<br/>Composition of Soybeans<br/>Nutritional Quality of Soybeans<br/>Antinutritional Factors<br/>Trypsin Inhibitor<br/>Haemagluttins<br/>Soybeans Saponings<br/>Protein Quality of Soubeans<br/>Aims and Objectives<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature Review<br/>Milk from Soybeans<br/>Nutritional Value of Soybeans<br/>Essential Amino Acid Content of Soybeans<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Materials and method<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Result and Discussion<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>REFERENCES<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>His of Soymilk:  Soybeans belongs to the family leguminous, subfamily  papiliondase and the genus Glycine Max. (Ricker and Morse, 1984), other normendatures which have been used include phaseolus Max, Soja Max Piper and Soja hispide moech.<br/>It is not known when this remarkable legume, soybean was first cultivated in China. However as the first  legume of which a written record was made. This was in the books of the Emperor  Shen hung, dated 1800BC which describes the five principal and sacred crops of China, rice, bean, wheat barely and millet, lafter in his milliohm there were chinses writing, giving expert advice on growing soybean which was cultivated more extensively in North than in Southern China, it reached Hapan and other countries in East Asia at an early date.<br/>Soybean contain about 46%  protein and 18% fat, characteristics which have influenced it’s history: the ancient Chinese evolved  methods of making from it’s preparations with high protein content for example, Curd and Shoyu, Shoyu is a dark brown liquid made by fermentation of a combination of soybeans and cereals (F.A.O. 1970). The Chinese also ate soybeans as a  vegetable after it ahs sprouted.<br/>The soybean was first heard of in Europe in 1712 through the German Botanist Egelbant Kalmpfer who had visited Japan. In the 18th century, it was grown in some European botanical gardens (F.A.O, 1970), it is first appearance in the United States in 1804, when Commander Perry brought home two varieties from Japan (F.A.O, 1970).<br/>What was called the second stage in the history of soybeans did not begin until the first decade of the present century, when it become an important export from East – Asia at first mainly to Europe and alter to the importing countries was as a source of oil for soap making and other purposes and for the manufacture of livestock feed.<br/>Then the third stage began in the early nineteen thirties, it is silent feature has been the large stage cultivation of the soybean in the United States, combined with the application of Modern Technology which enable it to be put to a variety of uses both as food and folder and as raw materials for manufacturing processes, while soybean has to a considerable extent becomes an industrial crop in the United States, it continues to be grown in East Asia as a food crop processed for consumption by time honoured  methods. (FAO, 1970).<br/>The fourth stage began during the first decade of the 20th century A.D. at the period in which this crop was first introduced of soybeans in Nigeria shows that middle belt of the country to be the best producer of soybean production (Ezedinmma, 1964). In Nigeria, nearly all of the soybean production estimated at 30,000 tons is used for human food. A response to increase in demand for soybean for soybean as a source of protein and vegetable oil, national programme in Nigeria have explained their research on the crop. Since 1987 (IITA; Annual Report 1985) currently more feather have been added to the number of products that can be obtained from soybeans in Nigeria, such products like soymilk as it had been recently demonstrated at the food investigation centuries in Enugu.     <br/>Soymilk in the traditional sense is simply an aqueous extract of whole soybean, A detailed description of the technique used for the preparation of the soymilk as well as its composition will be found in chapter 3.<br/>Soymilk according to the nutritionist a possible substitute for cow or human milk particularly in the feeding of infant who are allegic to animal milk or where cows milk may be found to be two expensive or unavailable.  Miller, (1962) soybean or vegetable milk or flu-changin chinse is reported to have been developed and used in china before the Christian era (paker and Morse 1943) by the philosopher who was credited with the first step in the processing of tofu and yuba. Then, the traditional milk is made by soaking the bean in water overnight, wet milling the bean, heating the wet mash to improve flavour and nutritional value and filtration. The milk produce is sold to the public in streets and canteens in china in 1984.<br/>In recent years large scale production ha evolved along with commercial marketing of soymilk in Hongkong, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Sinapere, Malaysiaa and not the United States (Babara, 1984). <br/>Uses of Soybeans<br/>Soybeans are a native crop of Eastern Asia where they have `served as an important part of the diet for centuries. The Japanese for example obtain 12 – 13% of their dietary protein from soybean product, for many of their traditional soy foods, the oriental people soak soybeans in water and then grind or cook them.<br/>Hot water extraction of ground beans yields soybean milk  which is consumed as such or is treated with calcium salts to precipitate the protein plus oil in the form of bean curd or tofu, fermentation of cooked soybeans yield products including soy sauce, misso, notto and tempheh.<br/>Except for soy sauce, one of the traditional oriental foods is consumed in significant amounts in this country. Soybeans are a relative new corner to the American scene. They have only been gown in quantity since the late 1920’s when soybean processing become an established industry, the two major products were oil and defaulted meals.<br/>In the mid – 1`930’s large  portion of the oil began to be used for foods such as shortening, margarine, cooking oil mayonnaise and salad dressing, because of its high protein content and good nutritional value, when properly processed, the meal was used primarily  for animal feeds.<br/>Soybeans have expanded in the last 30 year from a minor crop to a major cash crops. Indeed in value to the farmer soybeans now rank second to corn and above wheat, potatoes, oats, cotton and a  variety of other crops better known to the consumers, only within the last ten years however, have every many edible products. Containing soybean derivatives been directly associated with their source. In shortening their presence was “hidden” by statements similar to the followings. ‘A blend of hydrogenated vegetable oils or in salad dressing, merely “vegetable oil or a blend of vegetable oil”. Today a long list of foods containing soybean derived product can be prepared by careful reading of the labels in the supermarket, yet most of these are even not specifically identified as soybean. Product from corn, wheat, oats and many other commodities are so labeled for example corn flakes, wheat, garn, oatmeal, but not soybean. There are several reasons for this an enmity, soybean have a short history of sue in the U.S.A. the flavour and texture of soybean products are comparatively strange to people outside the orient.<br/>Although the Chinese and Japanese have covered soybeans into a variety of products most of these foods have little physical or flavour identity with the original bean. Some people agree that green soybean are a delicious dish when properly harvested and cooked but their sale and the sale and the ale of mature beans for baking are extremely small. Soybean products have problems related to their flavour and flavour stability to their ruction in foods and to their physiological effects. Despite these problems soybean oils have become a major material in our food industry. Soybean now supply more than half of the total visible fits and oils  consumed in the U.S.A<br/> Soybean composition (PREXIMATE), commercial soybean constitute and 2% hypocotyls and phumule. Proximate composition for whole beans and fractions are given in Table 1     <br/>TABLE 1: PROXIMATE COMPOSITION OF SOYBEANS AND SEED PARTS<br/>Fraction     Protein (Nx 6.25)    Fat %    Carbohydrate %    Ash %<br/>Whole bean    40    21    34    4.9<br/>Cotyledon    43    23    29    5.0<br/>Hall    8.8    1    86    4.3<br/>Hypocotyls    41    11    43    4.4<br/> <br/>        The constituents of major interest oil and protein make-up about 60% of the bean, but about one third consist of carbohydrates including polysaccharides, stachyose (3.8%), raffinese 1.1% phosphatides, sterols, ash and other minor constituents are also depend on variety, soil fertility and weather conditions.<br/>NUTRIENTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SOYBEAN<br/>          Over 50 years ago Osborne and Mendel (1980) found that rates grew poorly when feed with raw soybean meal and that dry head did not improve the nutritional value of the meal.<br/>        Rates grew normally, however when the meal was cooked on a steam for 3hrs. In the past 50yrs a vast literature was developed on the nutritive properties of soybean protein, but moist heat is still used to improve the nutritional quality of soybean protein product for foods and feeds.<br/>        The literature on this subject is often confusing and contradictory ; two recent reviews gives concise summaries of pertinent work for the last 30yrs. Alleged antinutritional factors and protein quality therefore are discussed only briefly.<br/>Antinutritional factors  <br/>        Since moist heat readily inactivates the anti-growth factors raw soybean meal, many workers believe that the factors are proteininhibitors and hemagluthins, non protein components such as sapynins have b suggested as anti-nutritional factors but recent work does not support this view.<br/>TRYPSIN INHIBITORS<br/>          More than five trysin inhibitors are reported for soybeans but only two-the kenitz and the Bowman Birk inhibitors have been purified and studied in details Kaw soybean meal contains 1.4% kunity inhibitor and 0.6^ Bowman-Birk  inhibitor.<br/>        Although both inhibitors are active against boline trypsin the kunity inhibitor has any how activity the esterase activity of human trypsin. The activity of human trypsin however is inhibited to a significant extent by kunity inhibition when case is sued as a substrate to measure proteolytic activity. It is not known whether ingestion of the inhibiters affects the presence in humans.<br/>        From the practical standpoint, Trypsin inhibitors do not appear to be a serious problem in feeds and food since they are largely inactivated by moist heat. Condition of heating time, temperature, moisture content and particle size influence the rate and extent of trypsin inhibitors inactivation for example, atmospheric steaming (1000C) inactivates more than 95% of the trypsin inhibitor activity of raw, defatted soybean flakes in 15mins. Protein efficiency shows an accompanying increase in this same time and flakes of 19% moisture gave a higher protein efficiency ratio than flakes of 5% moisture. In contrast, steaming whole soybeans chips, or cotyledons for 20mins only partially inactivated trypsin inhibitors apparently because of the large particle size. Atmospheric steaming inactivates most of the trypsin inhibitor in whole soybeans in 15mins. In initial moisture content is 20%. If the beans are soaked in water overnight 60% moisture 25mins. In boiling water sufficient to inactivate the inhibitors. Small but measurable trypsin inhibitors activity  can often be deflected after heating the known stability of Bowman-kirk inhibitor suggested that the residual inhibitor may be of this types. Measurements of residual chymotrypsin inhibitor activity would clarify this point because the Bowman-kirk inhibitor is a strong inhibitor of chymotrtpsin.<br/>        At recent study reports trypsin inhibitor activity commercial protein isolate but no inhibitor was detected in canned frankfurters containing 1.5% isolate. The heat treatment during canning inactivated the residual inhibitor.<br/>        Many of the conclusion drawn from studies on kunity inhibitor must be viewed with some reservations because of the heterogeneity of certain commercial preparation even when crystallized five times. The possibility that a protein impurities or a tightly bound non-protein impurity is responsible for some of the biological properties of the inhibitor has received slight  consideration until recently.<br/>        Hemagglatinins –Soybean contain at least four proteins capable of causing clumping of red blood cells of rabbits and rates in invitrotests. These proteins are designated haemagluttinins;  these proteins are in many legumes. Defected soy flour contains about 3%  lemaglutinins. The major hemagluttinin in soybeans has been insolated and characterized. It is a glycoprotein containing 4.5% mannose and 1% glucesanine and has a molecular weight of 110,00 and appear to contain two polypeptide chains. The ability of hemaggluttinins to cause clumping of red blood cells in a test tube serves as a useful assay procedure but there is no evidence that agglutination of red cells occurs when hemagluttinins are ingested. Hemagglutinins is readily inactivated by pepsin; thus it probably does not service passage through the stomach. Furthermore, undigested hemagglutinin would have to be absorbed from the intestine to come into contact with red blood cells an occurrence which seems unliky because of the high molecular weight of the hemagglutinin.<br/>        Soybean hemagglutinins are readily inactivated when maximum growth response is obtain. Hemagglutinins this ;present no known problems in foods of preparation includes proper heating of the soy ingredient at some step of processing.<br/>        Soybean saponings – saponins are complex glycosides of triterpenoid alcohols and occur in soybeans to the extent of 0.5% and because of their polarity, the saponins are insoluble in hexane and remain in defatted meal; defatted meal contains 0.6^ saponins. Although antinutritional properties have been ascribed to soybean saponins, recent studies show t hem to be harmless when ingested by chicks rates and nice aft 0.5 to 3% of the diet. At the highest level the saponins content was about three fold higher than in a 50% soybean meal supplemented diet. Neither saponings nor sapogenine were found in blood  of rates, mice or chicks kept in diet containing  20% soybean seed, thus the saponins are not absorbed thy remain intact until they leave the enzymes in the colon. The saponin inhibit various enzymes including cholinesterase and chymotrypsin but inhibition is not specific. Soyprotein and other dietary protein will also bind saponins. Approximately 0.4% saponins were obtained from a laboratory preparation of soyprotein isolate when isolates where ehated in dilate and solutions crystalline bit apparently modified. Saponins were obtained. The effect of interaction of the saponins with soy protein is still unknown, the saponins are an extremely complex mixture and only limited separations have been obtained to date.<br/>        Protein quality of soybean.<br/>        Until the 1960’s information on the nutritive value of soybean protein was largely limited to defatted flakes, meals and flours. Moreover most of the studied were concerned with use of soybean means as an animals feed. Since commercial introduction of concentrates and isolates in 1959 and their increasing use in foods, these fractions have received considerably more attention studies with human, however, are still limited. The quality of soy protein depends on several factors:-<br/>Amino acids composition<br/>Presence of anti-nutritional factors<br/> Overall composition of the diet<br/>Nutrient requirement of the species involves. Item a, b, and c are of primary importance in considering the various soy protein forms as protein sources.<br/>In the preparation of isolates for example fractionation occurs; this results in a change in amino acid  composition as well as in removal of the antinutritional factors occurring in the whey, items of and e are of greater importance when a specific food is being considered i.e. an infant food dietary item or a soack food nutritional requirements for an infant differ greatly from the needs of an adult who may be trying too loose weight.<br/>Aims and objectives of the project    <br/>The processing of soybeans into soymilk is aimed at gaining consumer acceptance of the legume by removal of the toxicants that contain and also improving organoleptic qualities of soymilk with special consideration to some adverse effect of these operation in soymilk  quality.<br/>This project re views the effects of different methods used in the processing of soybeans into soymilk on the quality of the milk produced during processing and storage.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSING TECHNIQUES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOYMILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSING TECHNIQUES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOYMILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ANALYSIS OF TOTAL PROTEIN AND OIL IN CITRULLUS LANATUS (EGUSI BARA) <br/>AND BIG GOARD LIKE TYPE (EGUSI IGBA), MELON PROTEIN CONCENTRATION<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Freshly harvested melon seeds i.e. (i)Citrullus lanatus (ii) Moniordica charantia (iii)Big goard like type was plucked and processed for its seed protein concentrates with a view to evaluate its proximate analysis using standard analytical techniques.

The amino acid profile reveals favourable nutritional balance with the presence of essential and non essential amino acid except that Tryptophan, Selenocystine, Norleveine and ammonia are not detected. <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.1    HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF MELON<br/>        The melon, whose scientific name is cucumis melo, is a climbing plant of the family cucub, taceqe. The word melon indicates both the fruit and the plant that is largely cultivated as its fruits are edible, sweet and flavoured.<br/>        Melons can be eaten raw, both as an appetizer and as a dessert and cooked, in jams of fruits: this type of fruit and vegetable product is considered ripe and of a good quality if it is flavoured.<br/>        The melon is a summer fruit that can be ovoid or roundish according to the varieties cultivated: it is rich in water, sugars and fiber that have nutritional and refreshing properties.<br/>        This fresh fruit brings energy without being heavy: for this reason and for its beautiful radiant colour, the melon is one of the fruits that are symbol of summer.<br/>        Furthermore, the melon is particularly suitable in slimming diets, as it is low in calories. Melons are also slightly laxative, because of the fibres contained and are therefore useful to fight the sedentary life and to help the more lazy intestines; moreover, the melon is slightly diuretic and is suitable for people who suffer from anaemia, thanks to its great content of iron.<br/>        Apart from the features already mentioned, the melon is also an excellent tonic for the circulation: in fact, with only half a melon high blood pressure can be controlled. This is due to the high percentage of mineral salts such as iron, phosphorus, sodium and calcium, but mainly potassium that permit to control more than other mineral salts blood pressure as well as to recreate the water supply lost with sweating. The consumption of half a melon or small whole melon each day can thus help to keep fluid the blood and to avoid the formation of grumes.<br/>        The melon is also rich in vitamin, A from which derives the typical orange colour of the flesh (the colour is due to the presence of the pigments carotenoids, very important from the health of eyes), and in vitamin C, very important for the nutrition of the skin that in summer is more than ever exposed to temperature stress and to the sunlight.<br/>        However, the melon can be consumed also by people suffering from celiac disease as it does not contain gluten (information received by the A/C Associazione Italiana Celiachia).<br/>        Another property of melon is found in their flesh that is very hydrating: in fact, if sliced, they can be used as a face mask with a nutritional and refreshing effect after sunbathing. The flesh of melons, in fact, absorbs the warmth of the skin recreating its right degree of hydration. It is necessary to know only few things to buy a good melon: it must be compact when held in one’s hand, with the typical smell of ethylene coming from the front; in general the ends must be soft not too much and the petiole must be bright green. Knocking on the surface of the melon, it must not emit any sound.<br/>        A melon is considered sweet when its content of sugar is around 13% while when the content of sugar is lower than 11% the fruit is not considered of a good quality. There are melons whose content of sugar can reach up to 18%, even though in this case, such a content of sugar could disguise the complex taste that makes the melon one of the most appreciated fruits in the world. In order to permit to the fruits to reach the ideal quantity of sugars, it is necessary to harvest them at the right moment: a fruit harvested too early or too late, in fact, will not reach the right level of sugars and thus the ideal taste or instead will absorb too much sugars.<br/>1.1.1 WHAT IS PROTEIN?<br/>        Protein is organic compound containing atoms of carbons, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. Nitrogen is the most essential part of protein . proteins are large complex molecule which plays diverse role in all organism. The make up higher percentage of the structure of living things and also take part in fundamental process that makes up life.<br/>        Protein is compound or component of all the living tissue (animals and plants).  And their molecules are much larger than those of carbohydrates and fats, proteins are not soluble in water but soluble in organic solvent. E.g Alkalines when boiled they coagulate easily. Proteins are made up of smaller unit called Amino acids. Before protein can be absorb into the body of an organism, there is need for it to be broken down unto its constituent which is amino acids.<br/>        However, before amino acids are formed, proteins are broken down to a series of compound of decrease complexity. These are protease, peptone and polypeptides. They are macro molecules and polymers.<br/>1.1.2 TYPES OF PROTEIN<br/>        Protein is made up of polypeptide chains. Some protein like myoglobin consist of only one peptide chain. Others may consist of  more than  one type for example Hemoglobin is made up of four chains, two of another kinds. The amino acid sequence is important since it determines the three dimensional structure of protein and hence its biological function.<br/>        Types of Protein based on Structure <br/>Fibrous protein<br/>Globular protein<br/>Conjugated protein<br/>The three dimensional structures refers to the way the polypeptides chains of a protein are arranged in space to form coils and sheets. And the x-ray crystallography shows that many of the polypeptide chains in protein have an x-helical structure.<br/>Fibrous Protein <br/>This type of protein is obtained from the primary structure of protein in sequences. They are also known as compact spheroids.<br/>They are maintained partly by hydrogen bond and partly by cross linkages which occur between the peptide chains. They have stable molecules and structural roles. They are found in the tissue of organism. Example is collagen (muscle protein). They  are the common constituent of anima connective tissue. They enable the physical structure of the hair, strength of ligaments and tendon.<br/>Globular Protein <br/>Globular protein hass irregular sequences of amino acids in their peptides structure. They have different shape being compact globules. They have twisted string rolled into a hall shape their molecules are not stable and they have metabolic roles within organisms.<br/>Globular protein are found in Ribonucleic (Enzyme). An enzyme protein must come in close contact with its substrate of bring about chemical change. That is the biological function.<br/>Conjugated Protein <br/>They contain protein and other chemicals in their structures, their protein present are called conjugated protein and the chemical present are non-protein referred to as the prosthetic group.<br/>1.1.3 PROPERTIES OF PROTEIN <br/>        Protein usually from colloidal solutions, when heated, the protein precipitate coagulates. This is due to irreversible changes in the molecular shape of the protein and are said to be DENATURED. This process is known as denaturation.<br/>        Protein can be denaturated by:<br/>Temperature above 1000- certain organic solvent and chemical reagents 2<br/>Variation in PH2<br/>Since the function of protein related to its shape, denatured losses its biological activities. Solution of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide (Hcl and NaoH) respectively.<br/>It can also be carried out using suitable enzymes. The amino acids obtained on. This is why living system operate within narrow temperature and PH ranges.<br/>Hydrolysis of protein: protein may be hydrolyzed to give amino acid by boiling them with hydrolysis can be separated and identified by using paper chromatography.<br/>1.1.4 OCCURRENCE OF PROTEIN <br/>        Proteins are found in all living system such as structural components and as biologically important substances such as hormones, enzymes and pigments. Protein in our food can be divided into two (2) classes:-<br/>First Class:- Which consist of essential amino acids. They are mainly origin, examples of foods are lean meat, fish, egg, milk, liver and cheese.<br/>Second Class Protein:- Which are mainly vegetables, protein which are found in vegetables such as peas, beans and leafs.<br/>1.1.5 IMPORTANT OF PROTEIN<br/>Proteins are mainly used as building materials by living things especially animals. Important substance in living systems like enzymes, hormones and immunoglobins are proteins.<br/>Protein may be used as source of energy. This happen during starvation. The protein in muscles first breakdown to amino acids. These are further broken down to produce intermediates that can enter the kreb’s cycle and lead to the production of ATP molecules.<br/>They help in sperm swimming in their tail and also in the movement of chromosomes during cell division. Proteins from the structure of organism, example, replacement of torn or worn out tissue.<br/>They form part of the organisms body of an organism. E.g. silk in spider, collagens that makes up the tendon compound of hair, bones, skin, finger and cartilages, e.t.c.<br/>1.1.6 SIGNS OF PROTEIN DEFICIENCY<br/>Diabetes:- This is cause by lack of insulin in the blood stream. Insulin is hormones which promoted the conversion of glucose to glycogen in the liver and allows the entry of glucose into the cell for oxidation in tissue reparation. Therefore, lack of insulin causes excess glucose in the blood stream.<br/>Kwashiorkor<br/>Lack of strong bone, teeth, coarsening of the skin, lack of shinning hair.<br/>TEST FOR PROTEIN <br/>Two methods shall be considered for this work<br/>The X anthropogenic test<br/>Trioxonitrate (v) acid test<br/> 1.2    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>        There are different types of melon and there are also different characteristics which can be recognized as the size, shape, savour and the nutritional constitution. Therefore the purpose of this study is to observe various melons (citrullus lanatus and Big goard like type) in Nigeria and alongside determine the protein content in each one, in order to make recommendation for its consumption and its inclusion in  human diet.  <br/>1.3    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        This work is carried out in order to know the approximately nutritional content and the proximate composition in the two (2) selected melons, the total protein (amino acid) of the nutritional evaluation obtain in different types of melon spices.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        There is always the need to investigate the amino acid content in various melons such as Citrullus lanatus (Egusi bara) AND Big goard like type Egunsi igba which would form part of food for people and animal browse in any parts of the tropic of where the plant is abundant or needed.<br/>        Therefore the significance of the study is to verify the amino acid content present in egunsi bara (citrullus lanatus) and Egunsi Igba (Big goard like type). This study will also create awarenessfor people to know and have the knowledge of how nutritive these melons are, and how to make use of these melons (Egunsi, bara and Egunsi Igba) to increase the nutritional value of the diet of poor people and the general as a whole.<br/><br/>\n\nANALYSIS OF TOTAL PROTEIN AND OIL IN CITRULLUS LANATUS (EGUSI BARA) AND BIG GOARD LIKE TYPE (EGUSI IGBA), MELON PROTEIN CONCENTRATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF TOTAL PROTEIN AND OIL IN CITRULLUS LANATUS (EGUSI BARA) AND BIG GOARD LIKE TYPE (EGUSI IGBA), MELON PROTEIN CONCENTRATION", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PRODUCTION AND EVALUATION OF BAKED AND EXTRUDED SNACKS FROM BLENDS OF MILLET, PIGEON PEA AND CASSAVA CORTEX FLOUR<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Millet flour (MF) and pigeon pea flour (PPF) were produced and blended in the ratio of 65:35 to obtain millet-pigeon pea flour blend (MPF). Wheat flour (WF) and MPF were used in ratios of 100: 0, 90:10, 80:20, 70: 30 and 60: 40 to produce cookies which were subjected to sensory evaluation, to isolate the best ratio (80:20). Cassava cortex flour (CCF) was produced and substituted wheat flour at different levels in the 80:20 (WF: MPF) blend to give various ratios of WF: MPF: CCF as 100:0:0, 80:20: 0, 75:20: 5, 70:20:10, 65:20:15, 60:20:20. These composite flour blends were used with baking ingredients to produce cookies and extruded snacks. Millet, pigeon pea and cassava cortex flour were analyzed for their proximate, minerals, vitamins and antinutrient contents. The MF, PPF, CCF, MPF and WF were also analyzed for their functional properties. The effects of cassava cortex incorporation, baking and extrusion cooking on the nutritional, antinutritional, microbial and sensory properties of the baked and extruded products were determined. The cookies were fed to albino rats to determine their effect on the biochemical parameters of the animals. Results obtained indicated that the chemical composition of the processed flour ranged from 7.35 to 9.50% moisture, 3.94 to 16.64% protein, 1.00 to 3.00% fat, 1.25 to 3.55% ash, 0.80 to 12.07% crude fibre, 67.86 to 77.39% carbohydrate, 83.6 to 326.8mg/100g phosphorous, 1.04 to 3.40mg/100g iron, 60.0 to 620.0mg/100g calcium, 34.06 to 232.76mg/100g potassium, 83.33 to 1666.67 (IU) Vitamin A, 1.0 to 2.0mg100g Vitamin B1, 0.00 to 0.08 vitamin B2 and 0.8 to 14.2mg/100g vitamin E. Residual anitnutrients in the flour ranged from 0.11 to 0.44% tannin, 1.0 to 1.3% phytate, 0.04 to 0.45Hu/gm hemagglutinin and 0.45 to 1.90% hydrogen cycanide. The functional properties of the flour showed some significant differences (p&lt;0.05) when compared with wheat flour. Cassava cortex flour incorporation significantly (p&lt;0.05) improved the ash, crude fibre and vitamin B2 contents of the cookies and extruded snacks. The protein values were reduced from 7.44% to 6.25% as CCF incorporation increased in the baked products; while the protein values improved to 12.26% at 5% level of CCF incorporation in the extruded products. Baking and extrusion further reduced the antinutrients in the formulated products to the following ranges 0.09 to 0.33% tannin, 0.63 to 1.13% phyate, 0.00 to 0.45 Hu/mg hemagglutinin and 0.20 to 0.73% hydrogen cyanide. The bacteria and mould count ranged from 0.2 x 10 to 0.8 x 102cfu/g, while there was no coliform growth in any of the samples.

Prior to 1986, the economy was highly regulated with government taking direct control of the \"commanding heights\" of the national economy. By the early 1980s, significant distortions were thought to exist in the economy with respect to pricing of tradeable items leading to sub-optimal allocation of resources in the economy. Hence, in 1986 an economic reform programme in the form of a Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) was embarked upon anchored principally on the deregulation of the economy and liberalization of trade. The targets of these measures were principally the relaxation or abolition of import licensing, tariff structure, price control, foreign exchange control and interest rates control. Reform processes such as those embarked upon in Nigeria in 1986 usually leads to \"a complete re-orientation of the economy\" (Olashore, 1991) and this was indeed the case in Nigeria where the deregulatory and liberalization philosophy remains the critical basis of economic policy despite the official abandonment of Structural Adjustment Programme in the 1990s. Spurred by globalization, which itself is essentially deregulation on a global level, the Nigerian economy has since remained anchored on free-trade, market mechanism and private sector orientation, the key instruments of the SAP that channeled in the reform of the economic philosophy underlining the Nigerian economy in 1986. Although the shift to economic deregulation and trade liberalization affected many sectors of the economy, its impact on the agricultural economy was one of the most acute and remarkable (Adubi, 1996; Ojo, 1994). The key features of agricultural production and the long tradition of governmental regulation of the sector became radically affected by the deregulation and liberalization philosophy with vital consequences for food security. Following over two decades of deregulatory practices, this research work reviews the strategies for food security in Oredo Locl Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria and the effects of this shift in economic philosophy on one aspect of human well being, namely, food security using trend examination and descriptive methods. The paper compares the food security status of the country before and after the adoption of deregulation as the dominant economic philosophy. It considers the lessons derivable from Nigeria's experience and proffer suggestions in this regard.<br/>In the recent time, there have been a lot of concerns expressed over the looming danger of food crisis in many nations, including Nigeria. The Food and Agricultural Organization, among others have been persistent in expressing these concerns for the global food crisis over the years. According to Food and Agriculture Organization, food security obtains when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life (FAO, 1996).The main goal of food security therefore, is for individuals to be able to obtain adequate food needed at all times, and to be able to utilize the food to meet the body’s needs. Food security is multifaceted. The World Bank (2001) identified three pillars underpinning food security. These are food availability, food accessibility, and food utilization. This means that a nation whose food production level is unable to satisfy these three criteria is said to be food insecure. Supporting this assertion, Maxwell (in Nana- Sinkam 1995:111) stated that a country and its people are food secured when their food system operates in such a way as to remove the fear that there will not be enough to eat. He further stressed that food security requires that the poor and vulnerable have secure access to the food they want. The World Food Summit plan of Action (1996) states that food insecurity occurs when;<br/>People experience a large reduction in their sources of food and are unable to make up the difference through new strategies.<br/>The prevalence of malnutrition is abnormally high for most time of the year, and this cannot be accounted for by either health or care factors.<br/>A large proportion of the population or group is using marginal or unsuitable strategies, and<br/>People are using “coping” strategies that are damaging to their livelihoods in the longer term or incur some other unacceptable cost, such as acting illegally or immorally.<br/>Nigeria’s situation on food security is highly precarious and pernicious as a significant percentage of the Nigerian population is left with only the bilious taste of poverty. Haruna, a member of the House of Representatives in an emotion laden speech in 2005 said, “People are dying and the hunger is simply unbearable. We need to tell ourselves the truth; there is hunger in the Land. Our people go to bed with empty stomachs (TELL: August 22, 2005:23). This lamentation persists till today in Nigeria. Given these criteria and scenario, Nigeria in the present circumstance can be said to be food insecure.  <br/>Food insecurity remains a fundamental challenge in Nigeria. The Food and Agricultural Organisation (2002) enlisted the country among countries faced with serious food insecurity problems. The vision of Nigeria to have physical and economic access to food on a continuous basis has therefore continued to remain a mirage (Adeyeye, 1997). As at 1986, about 14 million (16%) Nigerians were food insecure with majority being peasant farming households (Abalu, 1990). Over 40% of households across all agro-ecological zones in Nigeria face the problem of severe food insecurity (Mariya-dixton et al., 2004). A crucial issue in the development of a nation is the availability of food for the populace. Hence, food security becomes important in any consideration of the sustainability of the wealth of a nation (Osundare, 1999). Being a critical factor of economic growth and development of a nation, food security has involved a global concern that calls for the need to evolve strategies that are workable and sustainable for minimizing or possibly eliminating the obstacles against full realization of universal food security (Onyido, 1997). In the light of this, a foremost step towards remedying any food security problem would be to examine its characteristics nature among those affected. However, the concept of food insecurity is complex and goes beyond the simplistic idea of a countryâ€™s inability to feed its population. The main dimensions of food security in individual countries have not been subjected to serious analysis. In Nigeria, common approaches used to assess food security situations involve the use of bench mark food security requirements. For instance in a study on food security, Olayemi (1998) gave the threshold for food security as the ability of the household to meet 2260 kcal of energy and 65 g of crude protein per capita. In their own view, Joseph and Ajayi (2002) indicated that the recommended minimum nutrient requirement to be consumed per day per capita includes the 2191 kcal and 65-86 g crude protein out of which at least 35 g or 40% must be animal protein. Accordingly, the bench mark food security requirements approaches either classify a household as either a food secure or a food insecure household. However, these methods fail to examine the extent of the severity of food insecurity among households. Therefore, a more intensive approach for food security assessment is necessitated. This study adopts such an approach: The USDA (2000) approach for the analysis of farm household food security.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>        It has been on ground that people suffer from malnutrition as a result of food insecurity, thus researcher deem it fit to investigate different reasons associated with the strategies of food security in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State and suggest ways of improving the livelihood of the citizenry.<br/>There is insecurity of food as result of inadequate storage facilities such as refrigerator where perishable food can be stored.<br/>Inadequate finance to buy farm tools<br/>Damage of ozone layer depletion<br/>Environment pollution<br/>Population increase<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  <br/>        The purpose of the study is to create awareness and to educate the populace on the importance of a nation food secured and how to improve household food security.<br/>Specific objective<br/>To enable the government to put more fund and machinery into agriculture<br/>Adequate and delicate funding should be given to farmers. <br/>To enable the consumer and bodies governing food regulation and engage in regular talks on the importance of food security and the nation as a whole through regular classroom teaching mass media and community meeting.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Have you heard of the word food security<br/>Do you secure your food for future purpose<br/>Do consumers have right on properties of purchasing food<br/>Does food availability eliminate poverty<br/>Does food security have any effects on national development for home economics education?<br/>Is lack of storage facilities a problem to food security? <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The significance of this study is to guide parents, individuals, farmers, government and the society on the danger of food security. Food has caused so much havoc by consuming contaminated food prepared with addictives and chemicals that are injurious to health.<br/>        To provide the necessary information about food they buy e.g. expiry dates, brand names, weight lost and where to purchase them to know their right as consumes intelligently within their means of available resources.      <br/>The study is focused on the strategies for food security in Nigeria. This is because a sizeable proportion of Nigeria as population resides within the rural areas. In spite, of the invasion of the urban sector by rural and semi-rural population, about 70% Nigerians depend on agriculture and live in the rural areas (Okolocha, 1993; Abdullahi, 2002). Also, the bulk of those suffering from food insecurity remain in the rural areas (Fresco, 2000).<br/>This study assumes sizeable importance since knowledge drawn from the study could enhance the formulation of sound macro and micro policies necessary for the emergence of sustainable food security policies. It could also indicate those key variables (areas) that could be managed to better the food security status of the majority of the Nigerian populace who are mainly agrarian.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY    <br/>        This research work is titled “strategy for food security in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State” and it is restricted only to Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>FOOD: Food is any substance liquid or solid which when eaten and digested provide the body with the necessary nutrients.<br/>SECURITY: Protection from danger or wastes.<br/>AVAILABILITY: Things that can be used to obtain or use to achieve something.<br/>ACCESSIBILITY: Means things that can be reached the opportunity or right to use.<br/>ADDICTIVE: Means any substance including any source of radiation exposed to result that substance or its bye product becoming a part of its characteristics. <br/>POVERTY: The state of being poor<br/>UTILIZATION: The process of using one’s ability to achieve from little.<br/><br/>\n\nSTRATEGY FOR GUARANTEE FOOD SECURITY IN EDO STATE: CASE STUDY OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STRATEGY FOR GUARANTEE FOOD SECURITY IN EDO STATE: CASE STUDY OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AWARENESS OF GOOD NUTRITION DURING PREGNANCY AMONG WOMEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research work was designed to examine the awareness of good nutrition during pregnancy among women of child bearing age. Six (6) research questions were formulated and questionnaires were administered to one hundred (100) respondents in order to gather data for the research. Results showed that the pregnant women are aware of the importance of good nutrition to a child bearing mother. It was discovered that the level of education among child bearing age mother does affect their level of food intake in the area of study. The result also revealed that poor food intake can lead to malformation of the unborn child. Some recommendations were made by the researcher which includes the following: Health workers should embark on a proper sensitization of pregnant women on the importance of good nutrition during pregnancy. <br/>Government should sponsor giggles that centers on the usefulness of good nutrition among child bearing age mothers during pregnancy.  <br/>Seminars and workshops should be organized regularly for the pregnant women to educate them on the importance of good nutrition during pregnancy. <br/>Pregnant mothers should be encouraged to eat food rich in vitamins by the health workers/officials. <br/>Child bearing age mothers should be empowered by government financially to improve their health living. <br/>Based on the findings of the present study, it can be concluded that pregnant women had low level of nutritional knowledge level in the study area. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Introduction<br/>Background to the study<br/>Statement of problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Research Questions<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Scope/Delimitation of the study<br/>Limitation to the study<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO  <br/>Literature Review<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Methodology<br/>Research Design<br/>Population of study<br/>Sample and sampling techniques<br/>Research instrument<br/>Validity of the instrument<br/>Administration of the instrument<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR         <br/>Data Analysis and Interpretation<br/>Presentation of Data<br/>Analysis of data<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations<br/>Summary<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>REFERENCES     <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES <br/>   CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY  <br/>All human beings need a balanced amount of nutrients for proper functioning of the body system. Nutrition is a fundamental pillar of human life, health and development throughout the entire life span (World Bank, 2006). Proper food and good nutrition are essential for survival, physical growth, mental development, performance and productivity, health and wellbeing. However, the nutrition requirement varies with respect to age, gender and during physiological changes such as pregnancy. Pregnancy is such a critical phase in a woman’s life, when the expecting mother needs optimal nutrients of superior qualities to support the developing fetus. Naturally, the urge to eat more is experienced by nearly all pregnant women.<br/>Pregnancy is considered to be a delightful experience for the expectant mother. Evidences manifested that adequate intake of nutrition is a key component for individual’s health and well-being, particularly during pregnancy. It is well documented that inadequate maternal nutrition results in increased risks of short term consequences such as; Intra Uterine Growth Restriction(IUGR), low birth weight, preterm birth, prenatal and infant mortality and morbidity. Moreover, excessive intake of nutrients during pregnancy can lead to some pregnancy complications (such as, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, macrosomia, distocia and higher prevalence of cesarean section). On the other hand, as the long run outcomes, inadequate intake of nutrients were found to have pathophysiologic or metabolic depict that will appear as disorders of child growth and development as well as adult chronic disease after a long period of quiescence. (Rocco PL, Orbitello B, Perini L, Pera V, Ciano RP,2005)<br/>According to Nagiebs (2003) opined that eating well during pregnancy means do more than simply increase how much the mother eats. The mother must also consider what she eats. The ability of mother to provide nutrients and oxygen for her baby is a critical factor for fetal health and its survival. Failure in supplying the adequate amount of nutrients to meet fetal demand can lead to fetal malnutrition. The fetus responds and adapts to under nutrition but by doing so it permanently alters the structure and function of the body. Maternal over nutrition also has long-lasting and detrimental effects on the health of the offspring.<br/>Naomi M (2010) Malnutrition is one of the most serious health problems affecting children and their mothers in Ethiopia. Undernourished mothers face greater risks during pregnancy and childbirth, and their children set off on a weaker developmental path, both physically and mentally. Undernourished children have lower resistance to infection and are more likely to die from common childhood ailments as diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections. Those who survive may be locked into a vicious cycle of recurring sickness and faltering growth, often with irreversible damage to their cognitive and social development. Malnutrition prevents individuals and even the whole country from achieving full potential, and is closely related with survival, poverty and development. The incidence of dietary inadequacies as a result of dietary habits and patterns in pregnancy is higher during pregnancy than at any other stage of the life cycle. It was shown that, nutrition knowledge was predictive of change in dietary habits and health advices encouraged expectant women to advance their food intake positively.  <br/>Several studies including Villar has indicated that the correlation between poor maternal nutritional status and adverse birth outcomes is complex and are influenced by many biologic, socioeconomic, and demographic factors, which vary widely in different populations. It is therefore, the promotion of women’s health and other preventive health care practice should start before birth, during intrauterine life and extends throughout different phases of their lives in order to sustain their reproductive health in general. The importance of maternal nutrition during pregnancy has long been recognized. The National Academy of Science in America issued a report that reviewed studies of reproductive experience concluded that adequate prenatal nutrition was one of the most important environmental factors affecting the health of pregnant women and their babies. (Villar J, Merialdi M, Abalos E, Carroli G, et al., 2003)<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>According to UNICEF (2009), each year, more than half a million women die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Nearly 4 million newborns die within 28 days of birth. Many of the 200 million women who become pregnant each year, most of them in developing countries, suffer from ongoing nutritional deficiencies repeated infections and the long term cumulative consequences of under nutrition during their own childhood years.<br/>Many women suffer from a combination of chronic energy deficiency, poor weight gain in pregnancy, anemia, and other micronutrient deficiencies, as well as infections like HIV and malaria. Poor nutrition diminishes a woman’s productivity, causing repercussions for herself, her family, her community, and the broader society. Maternal malnutrition is influenced not only by lack of adequate nutrition but also influenced by factors like socio demographic factors, nutritional knowledge of mothers during pregnancies. It is on this ground that this research work investigate into the awareness of good nutrition during pregnancy among women of child bearing age.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>Specific objectives <br/>1.   To assess the awareness of pregnant mothers with regard to nutrition in the pregnancy.<br/>2.   To investigate how good nutrition enhances pregnancy.<br/>3.   To find out if poor nutrition affects the unborn child and the mother.<br/>4.   To determine if lack of awareness of good nutrition by the mother have any effect on the feotus.<br/>5.   To identify the strategies to ensure good nutrition during pregnancy.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>The following research questions were formulated by the researcher to guide the research study.<br/>1.           Are child bearing age mothers aware of the necessary food intake during pregnancy?<br/>2.           How does good nutrition enhance pregnancy among mothers of child bearing age women?<br/>3.           Does poor nutrition among child bearing age women affect the proper development of the unborn child?<br/>4.           Does lack of awareness of good nutrition by a child bearing age mother have any effect on her and the feotus?<br/>5.           What strategies should be put in place to ensure awareness of good nutrition during pregnancy for child bearing age mother?<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The benefits that could be derived from the outcome of this research work are as follows:<br/>1.           It will serve as a source of information and awareness to pregnant women on the type of food they should eat during pregnancy.<br/>2.           It will provide useful information for midwives and health care provider on how to educate the women on the type of food they should consume during pregnancy.<br/>3.           The result of the research work will also be important to health officials, ministry of health and the general public on how to take balance diet during pregnancy by a pregnant woman.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study is based on the awareness of good nutrition during pregnancy among women of child bearing age in Benin City, Edo State. The scope covers pregnant women in Edo State using Oredo Local Government Area as a case study.<br/>OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Knowledge: is awareness and understanding that one has gained on nutrition during pregnancy through learning and practice and pregnant women was considered to be knowledgeable if she correctly answered greater than or equal to 70% of the total knowledge assessing questions.<br/>Maternal nutrition: refers to the nutritional needs of women during the antenatal and postnatal period (i.e., when they are pregnant and breastfeeding) and also may refer to the pre-conceptual period (i.e., adolescence).<br/>Pregnancy: is state of carrying a developing embryo or fetus within the female body from a period of fertilization to delivery.<br/>

a public) secondary schools in Egor Local\r\nGovernment Area of Edo State. Nutrition education improved their mean nutrition\r\nknowledge scores significant (p‹0.01) from 11.17=1.42 to 19.16 =1.8 significant\r\nincrease in average daily intake of all the nutrients was found among all the\r\nadolescent subjects. The average contribution of carbohydrate, protein and fat\r\nto total energy also increased after imparting nutrition education. The dietary\r\nhabits were improved as the practice of meal skipping was found to\r\nsignificantly reduce after imparting nutrition education. Thus, nutrition\r\neducation is an effective measure to bring about the favourable and significant\r\nchange in adolescent nutrient intake. </i></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">TABLE OF CONTENT</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">CHAPTER\r\nONE                                                            \r\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Background of the study</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Statement of problem  </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Significance of the study</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Research questions</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Scope of the study</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Limitation of the study</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">CHAPTER\r\nTWO                                                                    \r\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Literature review</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Nutrition requirement of teenage girls</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Food intake pattern of Nigeria teenage girls</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Effect of poor dietary choice</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Impact of nutrition education on nutrition intake</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">CHAPTER\r\nTHREE                                                        \r\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Research methodology</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Design of study</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Population of study</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Sample and sampling techniques</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Instrumentation</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Validation of instrument</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Method of data collection</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Method of data analysis</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">CHAPTER\r\nFOUR                                                         \r\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Data presentation and analysis</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Socio-demographic characteristic of subjects</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Dietary habit data</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Nutrition knowledge scores</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Nutrition intake</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">CHAPTER\r\nFIVE                                                           \r\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Summary</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Conclusion</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Recommendation</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">REFERENCES\r\n                                                             \r\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">QUESTIONNAIRE      \r\n                                                                                    \r\n                  \r\n          CHAPTER ONE</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">INTRODUCTION </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">1.0 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        Nutrition\r\neducation is any combination of educational strategies, accompanied by\r\nenvironmental supports, designed to facilitate voluntary adoption of food\r\nchoices and other food- and nutrition- related behaviour conducive to health\r\nand well-being.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        Nutrition\r\neducation is delivered through multiple venues and involves activities of the\r\nindividual, community, and policy levels (Jones and Bartletti, 2007).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        This\r\ndefinition has been adopted by the society for nutrition education and\r\nbehaviour and was authored by Dr. Isobel Contento, a leading authority in\r\nnutrition education. The work of nutrition educators takes place in colleges,\r\nuniversities and schools, government agencies, cooperative extension,\r\ncommunications and public relations firms, the food industry, voluntary and\r\nservice organizations and with other reliable places of nutrition and health\r\neducation information.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        The American\r\nDietetic Association (ADA) published a position paper regarding the nutritional\r\nneeds of teenagers. This paper stated that the health of adolescents is\r\ndependent on normal dietary intakes and that the provision of foods that\r\ncontain adequate energy and nutrients was essential for physical, social and\r\ncognitive growth and development.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        Adequate\r\nnutrient intake during adolescence is very important for many reasons.\r\nAdolescence is a particularly unique period of life because it is a time of\r\nintense physical, psychological and cognitive development.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        Adolescence is\r\na transition phase to adulthood. The age of adolescence encapsulates a window\r\nof time when bodies are metamorphosing and evolving into that of an adult. It\r\nis a time when the adolescent tries to establish his own identify yet\r\ndesperately seeks to be socially accepted by his peers (Lulinski, 2001). During\r\nadolescence hormonal changes accelerate growth in height. Growth is faster than\r\nat any other time in the individual’s life except the first year (Brasel,\r\n1982). Increased nutritional needs at this juncture relate to the fact that\r\nadolescents gain up to 50% of their adult weight, more than 20% of their adult\r\nheight and 50% of their adult skeletal mass during this period (Brasel, 1982).\r\nThe adolescent therefore face series of serious nutritional challenges which\r\nwould impact on this rapid growth spurt as well as their health as adults.\r\nHowever, the adolescent remain a largely neglected, difficult to-measure, hard-to-reach\r\npopulation. Consequently, the needs, particularly those of adolescent girls are\r\noften ignored (Kurz and Johnson-Welch, 1994).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        At this\r\ndevelopmental stages, protein requirements maximal. Increased physical\r\nactivity, combined with poor eating habit and other considerations, for\r\nexample, menstruation, oral contraceptive use and pregnancy contribute to\r\naccentuating the potential risk for adolescents of poor nutrition.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        Poor\r\nnutritional choices and practices have been shown to increase during\r\nadolescence; the need for nutrition education becomes clear. It is important\r\nthat health educators look into nutrition education and its impact on the\r\ndietary habits of adolescent females. Several studies have been conducted that\r\nshow how nutrition education impacts the dietary habits of adolescents.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        These studies\r\nhave reviewed the effect of nutrition education on adolescent athletes and have\r\nanalyzed how nutrition education impacts snack patterns.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        The main nutritional\r\nproblems affecting adolescent populations in particular include under-nutrition\r\nin terms of stunning and wasting. Others are deficiencies of micronutrients\r\nsuch as iron and vitamin a, obesity and other specific nutrient deficiencies\r\n(Kurz and Johnson-Welch, 1994).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        Adolescents\r\nbecause they are still growing, who enter into marriage with poor nutritional\r\nstatus are likely to give birth to smaller infants than mature women of the\r\nsame nutritional status (WHO, 1995) because of the competition for nutrients\r\nbetween the growing adolescent and the growing fetus (Scholl et al, 1990)\r\nandpoorer placental function (Colson, 1987). Undernourished adolescent girls\r\nand women give birth to underweight and often stunned babies. These infants are\r\nless able to learn as young children and are more likely themselves to be\r\nparents to infants with intrauterine growth.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        Retardation\r\nand low birth weight. However, they are less able to generate livelihoods and\r\nare less equipped to resist chronic diseases in later life. Such lifecycle and\r\nintergenerational links demand sustained, long term ameliorative action\r\n(ACC/SCN, 2000) which this study aims to provide.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">1.2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">To assess the impact of nutrition education on the\r\nnutritional intake of female secondary school students.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">To educate adolescent girls about sources of nutrient and\r\nbalance diet.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">To help improve the eating habits of adolescent girls.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">To serve as a guide to nutrition educators and dieticians</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">To recommend nutrition education as part of the\r\ncurriculum of secondary school in Nigeria.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">1.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">         \r\nThe aim of this study is to outline the importance of nutrition education to\r\nimproving the nutrient intake of adolescent girls.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        One particular\r\ngroup of interest is the adolescent female few studies have reviewed the impact\r\nof nutrition education on the dietary intakes of the average adolescent female.\r\nIn the present study, the effect of a term long nutrition education class on\r\nthe dietary habits of adolescent females in secondary schools in Benin City was\r\nexamined. This study compared dietary intakes of female students who completed\r\na nutrition education class to female students who did not. The findings in the\r\npresent study are important in that they help nutrition educators and dietician\r\nunderstands if adolescent female who are provide with a one term time period\r\nwill develop better eating habits than females who do not receive nutrition\r\neducation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        This research\r\nquestions will be on socio-demographic characteristics of adolescent girls,\r\ntheir dietary habits and nutritional knowledge.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        This study\r\nshall be restricted to secondary school in Egor L.G.A, Edo State of Nigeria\r\nonly in the realization of similar condition facing female students in other\r\nstates of Nigeria. The survey shall be on nutrient intake only of adolescent\r\ngirls.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">        Nutrition\r\neducation lectures shall be held for the subjects and pamphlets and handouts\r\nshall be used to facilitate the lectures.</p>\r\n\r\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF NUTRITION EDUCATION ON THE DIETARY HABITS OF FEMALE SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF NUTRITION EDUCATION ON THE DIETARY HABITS OF FEMALE SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PRODUCTION AND ACCEPTABILITY STUDIES OF MALTED SORGHUM <br/>(SORGHUM BICOLOR) BISCUIT <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Biscuit was produced from malted sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and wheat flour blend.

Four samples of biscuit were produced using sorghum and wheat in the following ratios samples A; 30: 70, sample B; 50:50, sample C; 60:40, sample D; 100:0. Creaming method was used in biscuit production with specified ingredients. Proximate analysis of the product (biscuit) was determinate viz. moisture content for sample A; 2.5%, B; 3% C; 3.5%, D; 2%, fat content for the sample A; 15%, B; 16%, C; 17%, D, 15.5%, Protein content for A; 8.52%, B; 8.7%, C; 8.79%, D; 8.35%, Ash content for sample A; 0.5%, B; 1.0%, C; 1.5%, D; 0.5% and Carbohydrate content for A; 73.48%, B; 71.24%, C; 69.21%, D; 73.65% respectively. the sensory evaluation of the samples were carried out using hedonic scale. from the result, there was no significant difference at 5% level and 1% level between the four samples in terms of colour crispiness, flavour, and overall acceptance, but when compared with 100% wheat, there was a slight difference in texture of biscuits with “sorghum and wheat”, but from the score mean, sample B gave the best result.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0              Introduction <br/>1.1       Objectives of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0              Literature Review<br/>2.1       Origin of Sorghum <br/>2.2              Sorghum Utilization<br/>2.2.1        Production of Malted Sorghum Flour<br/>2.2.2        Malted of Sorghum<br/>2.2.3        Steeping<br/>2.2.4        Germination<br/>2.2.5        Kilning<br/>2.3              Method of Processing Wheat into Flour for Biscuit Making<br/>2.3.1        Wheat Flour Production<br/>2.3.2        Effects of Processing of Nutritional Value of wheat Flour<br/>2.3.3        Functional Processing of Nutritional Value of Wheat Flour<br/>2.4.0           Ginger<br/>2.4.1           The History of Ginger<br/>2.4.2           Ginger Cultivation<br/>2.4.3           Spices and Other Oils<br/>2.4.4           Ginger Processing<br/>2.4.5           Uses of Ginger<br/>2.4.6           Nutritional Composition<br/>2.5.0           Biscuit<br/>2.5.1           Definition of Biscuit<br/>2.5.2           Classification of Biscuits<br/>2.5.3           Hard Dough Biscuits<br/>2.5.4           Lean Hard Dough Biscuits<br/>2.5.5           Medium Hard Dough Biscuits<br/>2.5.6           Puff Hard Biscuits<br/>2.5.7           Lean Batter Biscuits<br/>2.5.8           Highly Enriched Biscuits<br/>2.5.9           Proximate Composition of Biscuits <br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>1.0              Materials and Method<br/>3.1       Sources of Raw Materials<br/>3.2              Raw Materials for Baking<br/>3.3              Equipment<br/>3.4              Chemicals <br/>3.5              Method for Processing Malted Sorghum<br/>3.6              Biscuit Production<br/>3.6.1        Proximate Analysis of the Prepared Biscuits<br/>3.6.2         Protein Determination<br/>3.6.3        Fat Determination<br/>3.6.4        Moisture Determination<br/>3.6.5        Total Ash Determination<br/>3.6.6        Carbohydrate Determination<br/>3.6.7        Sensory Evaluation of Prepared Samples<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>2.0              Results and Discussions<br/>4.1       Proximate Composition of the Test Biscuits<br/>4.2              Sensory Evaluation<br/>4.3              Discussion <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>            Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>            References<br/>            Appendix<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Biscuit may be defined as a thin flat baked product made from flour, salt, sweetening agent fat and preservatives. They are crisps, unleavened and sometimes sweet pastry produced light by the addition – F baking powder or soda, sometimes with chocolate or fruit in put (Achukoh; 1992). Biscuit can also be defined as a baked product having not less than 8% of flour content calculated (Hannemah, 1981). Okaka, 1997 stated that biscuits are termed “cookies” in USA but the Word biscuit means a small cake like bun.<br/>            According to Terrell, 1981 there are basically some ingredients that are used for biscuit production such as sugar, salt, milk, shortening flavour leavening. Egg improves the volume of biscuit as well as the taste and flavour. Egg and butter are also used for variety, these improves the quality of the products.<br/>Wheat flour is a critical and principal raw material in biscuit production its. Superiority over other cereals is due to the presence of gluten which inherently imparts all  the essential qualities to their products. The absence of this simple protein in non-wheat flour makes them unsuitable as substitutes for wheat flour. Unfortunately, wheat is a temperature crop, there fore, our tropical climate does not favour its cultivation. Flour which has high gluten content are classified as a strong hard flour, and therefore produces a strong dough and thus a strong biscuit is produced (Richtea), while flour with small gluten content produces a soft I weak biscuit (Digestive) Aerating chemicals, syrups and water were further added as one of the basis ingredients for biscuit making (Achukoh; 1992). The production of biscuits involves weighing, mixing, dough formation, kneading and rolling out, machining and shaping, prickling Bakino, cooling and packaging (Okaka, 1997).<br/>The malting potentials of sorghum grains can be utilized to produce soft dough biscuit. Germinated sorghum grains, develop alpha – amylase, carboxy peptidase, endo – beta – 1, 3 – glucanase, pentosanase, limit dextrinase and endo – protease in the grain during malting. Malting involves essentially steeping, germination and limiting cereals, seedling growth by kilning. During germination enzymes are produced for the degradation of starch and protein in the cereal grain. Malting yields higher proportions of hydrolytic enzymes such as X and B – amylases which may be either completely soluble or largely insoluble depending on the variety.<br/>Malted sorghum and wheat flour are used in order to check the baking potential of biscuit, malts produce from sweet sorghum and related variety usually contain insoluble amylase. The insoluble substances that make aqueous extraction impossible (Amori, 1 9 8 7) – Glucosidase in sorghum malt is also highly insoluble malt solid (Barry, and Dorota 1988).<br/>Malting causes a decrease in the density of caryposis in sorghum grain (Isola, 1992). Lower the amount of lysine from 0.25% in unmalted sorghum to 0.18% in sorghum malt (Ilori, 1989) and reduces the milling energy (Swanstoo et al, 1994).<br/>Time and temperature of storage influence the percentage soluble amylase in sorghum grain. For example, sorghum grain stored at 12t 23oc temperature for 2 to 3 years give higher levels of soluble amylase (between 57 – 73%) while nearly harvested grain give about 25%. Lowering the temperature to 7oc reduces the level of soluble amylase in the level of soluble amylase in the grains to about 37% after 3 years (Novellie et al, 1973).<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>To evaluate the acceptability of the biscuit made from malted sorghum and wheat flour blend and to reduce cost of production manufacturers, so as to break even and make gain.<br/>Malted sorghum flour has blended with wheat flour in the preparation of some confectioneries will go a long way in reducing he country’s heavy reliance on imported wheat and conserve the Nation Foreign Exchange. <br/><br/><br/>\n\nPRODUCTION AND ACCEPTABILITY STUDIES OF MALTED SORGHUM (SORGHUM BICOLOR) BISCUIT <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION AND ACCEPTABILITY STUDIES OF MALTED SORGHUM (SORGHUM BICOLOR) BISCUIT ", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE STATUS OF PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION OF CEREALS IN NIGERIA<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       Introduction<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0              Brief Description Of Various Types Of Cereals <br/>2.1       Maize<br/>2.2              Sorghum And Mihet<br/>2.3              Cotton Seed Meal<br/>2.4              Rice <br/>2.5              Wheat<br/>2.6              Nutritive Values Of Various Types Of Cereals<br/>2.7              The Processing Of Various Types Of Cereals And It’s Uses To Mankind<br/>2.8              Microbial Effects On Cereals<br/>2.9              Preservation/Storage<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0       Conclusion<br/>            REFERENCES<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>            Of all the plant on which man has depended for his food, cereal grains are by far the most important.  Since recorded history, cereals grains are the seed by cultivated grasses that include wheat, corn, 0at, barley, rye, rice, sorghum and millet.<br/>            There are a number of reasons why cereals have been important in man’s diet.  They can be grown in areas with diverse climatic and soil conditions.  They give yield peracre (0.4ha) as compared to most other crops and once harvested, their excellent storage stability combined with their high nutritive valuers make them most suitable for storage.<br/>            They are easy to be packaged and transported and can be used to produce a large variety of high desirable foods both for man and animals.<br/>            Cereal grains are the most important source of the world’s total food.  The grains are eaten in many ways, sometimes as a paste or other preparation of the seeds more often milled and further processed into flour, starch, oil, bran, syrup, sugar, etc.  They are also used to feed the animals that provide us with meat, eggs, millet, butter, cheese and a host of other foods.  Cereals grains are preserved in ways which make them to last long for processing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE STATUS OF PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION OF CEREALS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE STATUS OF PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION OF CEREALS IN NIGERIA", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF SOME MEHTODS ADOTPED IN YOGHURT PRODUCTION<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE:    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1     Background of the Study<br/>1.2     Aim and Objectives of the Study<br/>1.3       Significance of the Study<br/>1.4       Statements of the Problem<br/>1.5       Limitations of the Study<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Literature Review<br/>2.1     Properties and Characteristics of Yoghurt<br/>2.2       The evolution of Yoghurt<br/>2.3       Process and manufacture of Yoghurt<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1       Materials and Methods for Yoghurt Production<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>References<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>Yoghurt is a fermented milk product, produced with a yoghurt starter culture which is a mixed culture of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus in a 1:1 ratio. S thermophilus enjoys a faster growth than L hulgricus.  It adds flavours and aroma to the yoghurt, though both organisms in association produces lactic acid but acetaldehyde and dimethyl propanol, the chief favour component of yoghurt is produced by L bulgaricus.<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            Every producer be it private or public more especially profit making has objectives in mind to achieve, some of which are to sue a process/method that is convenient and hygienic for himself, workers and to the final consumer of his product (yoghurt).<br/>            Lack of research has landed many producers of yoghurt into confusion on the method and process of producing yoghurt, thereby producing a substandard yoghurt which may not meet the taste of the consumers like “mouth feel and appearance”.  They need to know the various methods and different materials that are used in yoghurt which will improve its general quality.<br/>            Moreover whichever method that is chosen must be economical in all aspect, so that the producers will have some profit after calculating the cost and the products retail price will not be too much for the average consumer to afford.<br/>1.2       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>            Many producers of yoghurt are confused on the methods and process of producing yoghurt, consequently, producing substandard yoghurt which may not meet the taste of the consumer.<br/>            However, this research work is aimed at developing appropriate process of producing yoghurts.<br/>            The research work is also aimed at solving the problems of different methods of processing yoghurt.<br/>            Also, it is aimed at assessing the economic aspect of the different methods of producing yoghurt which are economical in terms of the cost.<br/>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This project is important to all producers, students and researchers in food based discipline as it studies and assess different methods adopted in yoghurt production.  It will help students and researchers to know the various materials used in the production of yoghurt which will improve its general quality.<br/>            This research work will also provide suitable methods for the production of yoghurt, which will be economical (to cover the cost of materials used for production).<br/>1.4       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>            Yoghurt production is very expensive and most of its methods are tedious.<br/>Most yoghurt produced, cannot keep for a long time due to the inability of the producers to get the right materials fro the production of yoghurt.<br/>            The PH at which yoghurt is produced is also another problem, because if the right PH is not gotten and controlled and if it exceeds that PH level the taste will be too acidic and will not give that sour taste peculiar to yoghurt.  Also PH above four (4) favours the growth of some microorganism such as coliforms, staphylococci, pseudomonas etc.  These microorganisms can contaminate the milk, thereby making unfit for the consumers.  In food processing we have garbage in garbage out which means that if you starts with a pour raw material you are equally coming out with pour finished product.<br/>TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>Using our service is LEGAL and IS NOT prohibited by any university/college policies <br/>You are allowed to use the original model papers you will receive in the following ways: <br/>1.

There are a number of locally grown food stuff which easily meet the body’s nutritional needs. The important thing is to have the right combination of these foods in all meals.<br/>Malnutrition is described as the over or under consumption of food nutrient resulting in health disorder malnutrition is usually common even in well - to do families in the developing countries. It affects those individuals who are less knowledgeable of proper nutrition in the developed world.<br/>Over nutrition is the main source of malnutrition in many developed countries. Excessive consumption of fat and carbohydrate food is most often implicated in obesity. Obsessed people are more likely to involve in various disability and life expectancy is reduced.<br/>Many people lack the understanding of the function of food. One of the main aspects of this problems is the general false assumption that “full belly” is all t hat is necessary to provide good health. It is this “full belly” concepts and ignorance that causes many of the nutritional diseases in most countries.<br/>In many developing countries, malnutrition is the single most important public health problem. <br/>A person who is under nourished is more likely to fall victim to an infection diseases than a person of good nutritional status. Measles, diarrhea, tuberculosis, whooping cough is frequently fatal in young children if the child is poorly nourished.<br/>Malnutrition is known to lower the body’s resistance to infection. A malnourished child has a reduced ability both to form antibodies and to produce increased number of white blood cells. (Leucocytes).<br/>Infection makes malnutrition worse and poor intake of the nutrient increase the severity of infections diseases.<br/>Adequately nourished individual can often withstand the attack of parasites but those in a poor state of nutrition cannot.<br/>The effect of malnutrition on susceptibility to infection can affect a body even before it is born.<br/>Recovery of damaged tissue depends on the nutritional status of this subject. The more serious forms of malnutrition which universal among poor families and Nation result from consumption of poor diet over long period of time. This nutritional disorder is often referred as to under Nutrition. Deficiency of carbohydrates and protein in human diet is rare except among poorer families and is responsible for diseases called Kwashiorkor and marasmus were associated with marked cognitive effects.<br/>The predominant type of malnutrition in Latin America has changed dramatically during the second half of this century.<br/>However, this information above is sufficient to alert one of the possible hazard involved in malnutrition which can render man incapacitated in the society he belongs.

(Ricker and Morse, 1984), other normendatures which have been used include phaseolus Max, Soja Max Piper and Soja hispide moech.<br/>It is not known when this remarkable legume, soybean was first cultivated in China. However as the first  legume of which a written record was made. This was in the books of the Emperor  Shen hung, dated 1800BC which describes the five principal and sacred crops of China, rice, bean, wheat barely and millet, lafter in his milliohm there were chinses writing, giving expert advice on growing soybean which was cultivated more extensively in North than in Southern China, it reached Hapan and other countries in East Asia at an early date.<br/>Soybean contain about 46%  protein and 18% fat, characteristics which have influenced it’s history: the ancient Chinese evolved  methods of making from it’s preparations with high protein content for example, Curd and Shoyu, Shoyu is a dark brown liquid made by fermentation of a combination of soybeans and cereals (F.A.O. 1970). The Chinese also ate soybeans as a  vegetable after it ahs sprouted.<br/>The soybean was first heard of in Europe in 1712 through the German Botanist Egelbant Kalmpfer who had visited Japan. In the 18th century, it was grown in some European botanical gardens (F.A.O, 1970), it is first appearance in the United States in 1804, when Commander Perry brought home two varieties from Japan (F.A.O, 1970).<br/>What was called the second stage in the history of soybeans did not begin until the first decade of the present century, when it become an important export from East – Asia at first mainly to Europe and alter to the importing countries was as a source of oil for soap making and other purposes and for the manufacture of livestock feed.<br/>Then the third stage began in the early nineteen thirties, it is silent feature has been the large stage cultivation of the soybean in the United States, combined with the application of Modern Technology which enable it to be put to a variety of uses both as food and folder and as raw materials for manufacturing processes, while soybean has to a considerable extent becomes an industrial crop in the United States, it continues to be grown in East Asia as a food crop processed for consumption by time honoured  methods. (FAO, 1970).<br/>The fourth stage began during the first decade of the 20th century A.D. at the period in which this crop was first introduced of soybeans in Nigeria shows that middle belt of the country to be the best producer of soybean production (Ezedinmma, 1964). In Nigeria, nearly all of the soybean production estimated at 30,000 tons is used for human food. A response to increase in demand for soybean for soybean as a source of protein and vegetable oil, national programme in Nigeria have explained their research on the crop. Since 1987 (IITA; Annual Report 1985) currently more feather have been added to the number of products that can be obtained from soybeans in Nigeria, such products like soymilk as it had been recently demonstrated at the food investigation centuries in Enugu.      <br/>Soymilk in the traditional sense is simply an aqueous extract of whole soybean, A detailed description of the technique used for the preparation of the soymilk as well as its composition will be found in chapter 3.<br/>Soymilk according to the nutritionist a possible substitute for cow or human milk particularly in the feeding of infant who are allegic to animal milk or where cows milk may be found to be two expensive or unavailable.  Miller, (1962) soybean or vegetable milk or flu-changin chinse is reported to have been developed and used in china before the Christian era (paker and Morse 1943) by the philosopher who was credited with the first step in the processing of tofu and yuba. Then, the traditional milk is made by soaking the bean in water overnight, wet milling the bean, heating the wet mash to improve flavour and nutritional value and filtration. The milk produce is sold to the public in streets and canteens in china in 1984.<br/>In recent years large scale production ha evolved along with commercial marketing of soymilk in Hongkong, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Sinapere, Malaysiaa and not the United States (Babara, 1984).  <br/>Uses of Soybeans<br/>Soybeans are a native crop of Eastern Asia where they have `served as an important part of the diet for centuries. The Japanese for example obtain 12 – 13% of their dietary protein from soybean product, for many of their traditional soy foods, the oriental people soak soybeans in water and then grind or cook them.<br/>Hot water extraction of ground beans yields soybean milk  which is consumed as such or is treated with calcium salts to precipitate the protein plus oil in the form of bean curd or tofu, fermentation of cooked soybeans yield products including soy sauce, misso, notto and tempheh.<br/>Except for soy sauce, one of the traditional oriental foods is consumed in significant amounts in this country. Soybeans are a relative new corner to the American scene. They have only been gown in quantity since the late 1920’s when soybean processing become an established industry, the two major products were oil and defaulted meals.<br/>In the mid – 1`930’s large  portion of the oil began to be used for foods such as shortening, margarine, cooking oil mayonnaise and salad dressing, because of its high protein content and good nutritional value, when properly processed, the meal was used primarily  for animal feeds.<br/>Soybeans have expanded in the last 30 year from a minor crop to a major cash crops. Indeed in value to the farmer soybeans now rank second to corn and above wheat, potatoes, oats, cotton and a  variety of other crops better known to the consumers, only within the last ten years however, have every many edible products. Containing soybean derivatives been directly associated with their source. In shortening their presence was “hidden” by statements similar to the followings. ‘A blend of hydrogenated vegetable oils or in salad dressing, merely “vegetable oil or a blend of vegetable oil”. Today a long list of foods containing soybean derived product can be prepared by careful reading of the labels in the supermarket, yet most of these are even not specifically identified as soybean. Product from corn, wheat, oats and many other commodities are so labeled for example corn flakes, wheat, garn, oatmeal, but not soybean. There are several reasons for this an enmity, soybean have a short history of sue in the U.S.A. the flavour and texture of soybean products are comparatively strange to people outside the orient.<br/>Although the Chinese and Japanese have covered soybeans into a variety of products most of these foods have little physical or flavour identity with the original bean. Some people agree that green soybean are a delicious dish when properly harvested and cooked but their sale and the sale and the ale of mature beans for baking are extremely small. Soybean products have problems related to their flavour and flavour stability to their ruction in foods and to their physiological effects. Despite these problems soybean oils have become a major material in our food industry. Soybean now supply more than half of the total visible fits and oils  consumed in the U.S.A<br/> Soybean composition (PREXIMATE), commercial soybean constitute and 2% hypocotyls and phumule. Proximate composition for whole beans and fractions are given in Table 1          <br/>TABLE 1: PROXIMATE COMPOSITION OF SOYBEANS AND SEED PARTS<br/>Fraction     Protein (Nx 6.25)    Fat %    Carbohydrate %    Ash %<br/>Whole bean     40    21    34    4.9<br/>Cotyledon     43    23    29    5.0<br/>Hall    8.8    1    86    4.3<br/>Hypocotyls     41    11    43    4.4<br/>             The constituents of major interest oil and protein make-up about 60% of the bean, but about one third consist of carbohydrates including polysaccharides, stachyose (3.8%), raffinese 1.1% phosphatides, sterols, ash and other minor constituents are also depend on variety, soil fertility and weather conditions.<br/>NUTRIENTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SOYBEAN<br/>            Over 50 years ago Osborne and Mendel (1980) found that rates grew poorly when feed with raw soybean meal and that dry head did not improve the nutritional value of the meal.<br/>            Rates grew normally, however when the meal was cooked on a steam for 3hrs. In the past 50yrs a vast literature was developed on the nutritive properties of soybean protein, but moist heat is still used to improve the nutritional quality of soybean protein product for foods and feeds.<br/>            The literature on this subject is often confusing and contradictory ; two recent reviews gives concise summaries of pertinent work for the last 30yrs. Alleged antinutritional factors and protein quality therefore are discussed only briefly.<br/>Antinutritional factors  <br/>            Since moist heat readily inactivates the anti-growth factors raw soybean meal, many workers believe that the factors are proteininhibitors and hemagluthins, non protein components such as sapynins have b suggested as anti-nutritional factors but recent work does not support this view.<br/>TRYPSIN INHIBITORS<br/>            More than five trysin inhibitors are reported for soybeans but only two-the kenitz and the Bowman Birk inhibitors have been purified and studied in details Kaw soybean meal contains 1.4% kunity inhibitor and 0.6^ Bowman-Birk  inhibitor.<br/>            Although both inhibitors are active against boline trypsin the kunity inhibitor has any how activity the esterase activity of human trypsin. The activity of human trypsin however is inhibited to a significant extent by kunity inhibition when case is sued as a substrate to measure proteolytic activity. It is not known whether ingestion of the inhibiters affects the presence in humans.<br/>            From the practical standpoint, Trypsin inhibitors do not appear to be a serious problem in feeds and food since they are largely inactivated by moist heat. Condition of heating time, temperature, moisture content and particle size influence the rate and extent of trypsin inhibitors inactivation for example, atmospheric steaming (1000C) inactivates more than 95% of the trypsin inhibitor activity of raw, defatted soybean flakes in 15mins. Protein efficiency shows an accompanying increase in this same time and flakes of 19% moisture gave a higher protein efficiency ratio than flakes of 5% moisture. In contrast, steaming whole soybeans chips, or cotyledons for 20mins only partially inactivated trypsin inhibitors apparently because of the large particle size. Atmospheric steaming inactivates most of the trypsin inhibitor in whole soybeans in 15mins. In initial moisture content is 20%. If the beans are soaked in water overnight 60% moisture 25mins. In boiling water sufficient to inactivate the inhibitors. Small but measurable trypsin inhibitors activity  can often be deflected after heating the known stability of Bowman-kirk inhibitor suggested that the residual inhibitor may be of this types. Measurements of residual chymotrypsin inhibitor activity would clarify this point because the Bowman-kirk inhibitor is a strong inhibitor of chymotrtpsin.<br/>            At recent study reports trypsin inhibitor activity commercial protein isolate but no inhibitor was detected in canned frankfurters containing 1.5% isolate. The heat treatment during canning inactivated the residual inhibitor.<br/>            Many of the conclusion drawn from studies on kunity inhibitor must be viewed with some reservations because of the heterogeneity of certain commercial preparation even when crystallized five times. The possibility that a protein impurities or a tightly bound non-protein impurity is responsible for some of the biological properties of the inhibitor has received slight  consideration until recently.<br/>            Hemagglatinins –Soybean contain at least four proteins capable of causing clumping of red blood cells of rabbits and rates in invitrotests. These proteins are designated haemagluttinins;  these proteins are in many legumes. Defected soy flour contains about 3%  lemaglutinins. The major hemagluttinin in soybeans has been insolated and characterized. It is a glycoprotein containing 4.5% mannose and 1% glucesanine and has a molecular weight of 110,00 and appear to contain two polypeptide chains. The ability of hemaggluttinins to cause clumping of red blood cells in a test tube serves as a useful assay procedure but there is no evidence that agglutination of red cells occurs when hemagluttinins are ingested. Hemagglutinins is readily inactivated by pepsin; thus it probably does not service passage through the stomach. Furthermore, undigested hemagglutinin would have to be absorbed from the intestine to come into contact with red blood cells an occurrence which seems unliky because of the high molecular weight of the hemagglutinin.<br/>            Soybean hemagglutinins are readily inactivated when maximum growth response is obtain. Hemagglutinins this ;present no known problems in foods of preparation includes proper heating of the soy ingredient at some step of processing.<br/>            Soybean saponings – saponins are complex glycosides of triterpenoid alcohols and occur in soybeans to the extent of 0.5% and because of their polarity, the saponins are insoluble in hexane and remain in defatted meal; defatted meal contains 0.6^ saponins. Although antinutritional properties have been ascribed to soybean saponins, recent studies show t hem to be harmless when ingested by chicks rates and nice aft 0.5 to 3% of the diet. At the highest level the saponins content was about three fold higher than in a 50% soybean meal supplemented diet. Neither saponings nor sapogenine were found in blood  of rates, mice or chicks kept in diet containing  20% soybean seed, thus the saponins are not absorbed thy remain intact until they leave the enzymes in the colon. The saponin inhibit various enzymes including cholinesterase and chymotrypsin but inhibition is not specific. Soyprotein and other dietary protein will also bind saponins. Approximately 0.4% saponins were obtained from a laboratory preparation of soyprotein isolate when isolates where ehated in dilate and solutions crystalline bit apparently modified. Saponins were obtained. The effect of interaction of the saponins with soy protein is still unknown, the saponins are an extremely complex mixture and only limited separations have been obtained to date.<br/>            Protein quality of soybean.<br/>            Until the 1960’s information on the nutritive value of soybean protein was largely limited to defatted flakes, meals and flours. Moreover most of the studied were concerned with use of soybean means as an animals feed. Since commercial introduction of concentrates and isolates in 1959 and their increasing use in foods, these fractions have received considerably more attention studies with human, however, are still limited. The quality of soy protein depends on several factors:-<br/>a)            Amino acids composition<br/>b)            Presence of anti-nutritional factors<br/>c)            Digestibility<br/>d)            Overall composition of the diet<br/>e)            Nutrient requirement of the species involves.

The amino acids and small peptides constituents of protein hydrolysates have been shown to be more readily ascribed from the small intestine than their equivelent pure amino acid mixture, more over, protein hydrolysates are considerably less expensive than synthetic amino acid mixtures. Nonetheless, protein hydrolysates suffer from a serious drawback, namely, the occurrence of a bitter taste which develops during the course of the enzymic hydrolysis.<br/>Murray r (1952) demonstrated that a treatment of enzymic casein hydrolysates with activated carbon resulted in a substantial improvement in the taste of preparations. However, authors regarded this method of improving the taste as impractical due to the simultaneous loss of a large proportion of the hyptophan during treatment. A different approach was presented in move recent studies in which a casein hydrolysate relatively free of bitter taste was obtained by the sequential employment of papa in and of pig’s kidney homogenate – the latter serving as a source of exopeptidases. However, extended time periods of hydrolysis were required, which necessitated the use of dolor form to control bacterial growth.<br/>There is a variety of food and biomedical applications for protein which have been solubilized by enzymatic hydrolysis. Their enhanced solubility, heat stability, and resistance to precipitation in acidic environs, where many proteins are insoluble, offer attractive features to biochemists and nutritionists involve the research and development of high protein food formulations.<br/>Applications of these valuable protein supplements may have merit in the diet of persons with digestive disorders, pre and post operative abdominal surgical patient, geriatric and convalescent feeding , and for other who for various reasons do not ingest a well balanced diet. Unfortunately, the use of enzyme – treated hydrolysates in dietary food applications has in many instances, been limited due to the presence of bitter flovour component. The unpalatability of these hydrolysate  arises mainly from the formation of bitter peptide and amino acids liberated during the hydrolytic process. The bitterness appease to be closely related to the content and sequence of hydrophobic amino acids in the peptides.<br/>Further hydrolysis of pepsin digested soy protein using a bacterial proteins or an exopeptidase, reduced bitterness. Also, chemotropic plastering protein hydrolysates. Similarly, clegg and Mc Millan (1974) have reported that a combination enzyme treatment of case in using papain for 18 hr followed by the addition of a homogenate of swine kidney cortex, also produced a hydrolysate with reduced bitterness. <br/>As another approach to resolving the bitter flavor problem, it seemed reasonable to attempt flavor improvement of protein hydrolysates by reducing the hydrophobic peptide and amino acid content of the digests. It was recognize many years earlier that activated carbon would absorb the aromatic  amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenycalaline. At a later date, Murrgy and Baker utilized carbon to treat a commercial enzymic hydrolysate of casein and reported the taste was greatly improved. A bitter tasting polypeptide fraction was elutated from the carbon.<br/>Various phenol-formaldehyde resins with structures similar to carbon are available commercially and are used in a wide variety of ion-exchange and absorbent applications. Therefore the ability of a phenol-fomaldeliyde resin polymer to interact preferentially with the monoplane groups present in hydrophobic peptide was determined from the findings a hydrophobic chromatography process for debittering protein hydrolysates was developed.<br/>It has been well documented that the main problem in the preparation of soluble hydrolysate from protein such as casein is the difficulty in preventing the formation of bitter peptides or in removing them from the hydrolysate. Among several studies on casein hydrolysates the process developed by clegg and Mc Millan (1974) using skim milk as substrate, should be mentioned. By hydrolyzing skim milk protein with papain, a bitter testing hydrolysate is formed which is rendered bland by subsequent hydrolysis with exopeptidase from pig kidney tissue. Unfortunately, the procedure is both lengthy and costly. Anther costly debittering process involves hydrophobic chromatography of enzymatic protein hydrolysate on hexyls sepharose. An extraction method using azeotropic secondary butyl alcohol by which complete removal of bitter compounds is also achieved.<br/>In the course of a study aimed a producing at a reasonable cost, bland, soluble skim milk hydrolysate without a significant loss of nutritional value, a comparison was made of adsorption methods of debittering pronase- and ficinhydroly-zed skim milks. The result of the comparison and the partial identification of the bitter peptides formed in the skim milk hydrolysates is reported. Due to the minimum changes in taste and appearance afforded to soft drinks or fruit juices by addition of this treated skim milk, the resultant beverages are expected to appear and taste like the original beverages with almost full nutritional value of skim milk.<br/>It is widely known that bitterness sometimes is produced in sake and other fermented products, so decreasing their qualities. This bitterness is produced by bitter peptides and their derivatives formed during the ageing process of these fermented products. Enzymatic hydrolysis of protein also produces bitter peptides very often to decrease the value of the products.<br/>Since those bitter peptides are known to be produced by enzymatic hydrolysis, several attempts to reduce the production of bitter peptides during the enzymatic hydrolysis process by changing the enzymes and or conditions of the reactions have been made.<br/>Skim milk, soybean casein, whey protein concentrate (NPC) and casein hydrolysate of course composed of amino acids. Because a debittering method for bitter peptides was being looked for protein and peptides could block the bitterness. Creaming powder, Vegetable oil and margarine are fatly substances, which could block hydrophobic groups of bitter peptides by their character to reduce the bitterness. Some acidic amino acids were added in order to confirm their ability for masking bitterness, Asp, Glu and tau being used for the study. Although taurine (Tau) is not an acidic amin acid, it has a very strongly acidic function. Taurine was expected to reduce the bitterness as well as other acidic amino acids or peptides. <br/><br/><br/>\n\nPRODUCTION AND USES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES AN REMOVAL OF BITTERING PRINCIPLES IN IT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION AND USES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES AN REMOVAL OF BITTERING PRINCIPLES IN IT", "id": 52}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE INFLUENCE OF PROCESSING METHODS ON THE PROTEIN<br/>AND CYANIDE CONTENT OF AFRICAN YAM BEAN (Sphenostylis Stenocarpa)<br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>Raw African Yam bean (Sphenostylis stenocarpa) was subjected to various processing methods Viz: steeping in water for 6 hr and then boiling for 10, 20, 30, minutes respectively (samples B); steeping in water for 12 hours and then boiling for 10, 20, 30, minutes respectively (sample C) and finally sample A was raw yam bean which served as control.  The entire sample was dry – milled into fine flours.

It is one of the neglected indigenous grain legumes in Nigeria. It is produced mostly in the eastern part of the country where it is consumed in different forms such as snacks, delicacy, man meal etc. It can be used for the fortification of other foods (Eke, 1997)<br/>In Nigeria, it has as many names as there are communities cultivating it. Some of the names are Okpdudu, Azam, Uzuaku, Ijiriji, Azara, Ahaja, Nzamiri, Odudu, Girigiri (Hausa), sese (Yoruba) and Nsana (Ibibio) (Ogbo, 2002).<br/>The high protein content of African yam bean makes it an important source of protein in the diets of population groups of many tropical countries (Kon, 1979, Ekpen young and Borchers, 1980). In addition, the high protein bean flour fractions could be substituted for wheat flour to produce acceptable qualities of cookies breads and leavened doughs (Uebersax and Zabik, 1986; Nzereogu, 1993).<br/>It may also be consumed as porridge after cooking. The mature dry seeds can be used to prepare “moi - moi” and “akara” (Ezueh, 1973; Akoma, 1996). The African yam bean apart from being rich in protein also contains carbohydrate, fat and minerals (NAS, 1979).<br/>A major constraint in the utilization of African yam bean is the different dehulling method. Traditionally, the dehulling method involves manual removal of the hulls from the individual soaked seeds. This method is quite laborous (labour intensive), time – consuming and does not favour effective utilization of the bean. It is widely believed that under cooked African yam bean seeds cause diarrhoea and over cooked seeds cause constipation (Asusu and Undie, 1986).<br/>Previous works showed that steeping will among other things improve the dehulling characteristic of the African yam bean while maintaining the nutritional quality viz: invitro protein digestibility and also improving the functional properties when processed into flour (Abbey and Berezi, 1988). It is evident that better processing methods will not only enhance the acceptability and utilization of this legume but will also improve the nutritional status of the consuming populace (Uebersax et al, 1989).<br/>The overall objective of this study is to investigate the various processing methods and their effects on the protein and cyanide content of African yam bean in conclusion, before the commencement of any research or project, there is meant to be aim/aims of such research.<br/>As such, the aims of this study include:-<br/>1.                  To determine the hydrogen cyanide content of the flour.<br/>2.                  To analyse for the crude protein content of the flour.<br/>3.                  To determine some of the functional properties of the flour.<br/>4.                  Determination of the chemical composition of the flour.<br/>5.                  To determine the bulk density of the flour.<br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF PROCESSING METHODS ON THE PROTEIN AND CYANIDE CONTENT OF AFRICAN YAM BEAN <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF PROCESSING METHODS ON THE PROTEIN AND CYANIDE CONTENT OF AFRICAN YAM BEAN ", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE STATUS OF PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION OF CEREALS IN NIGERIA<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       Introduction<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0              Brief Description Of Various Types Of Cereals <br/>2.1       Maize<br/>2.2              Sorghum And Mihet<br/>2.3              Cotton Seed Meal<br/>2.4              Rice <br/>2.5              Wheat<br/>2.6              Nutritive Values Of Various Types Of Cereals<br/>2.7              The Processing Of Various Types Of Cereals And It’s Uses To Mankind<br/>2.8              Microbial Effects On Cereals<br/>2.9              Preservation/Storage<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0       Conclusion<br/>            REFERENCES<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>            Of all the plant on which man has depended for his food, cereal grains are by far the most important.  Since recorded history, cereals grains are the seed by cultivated grasses that include wheat, corn, 0at, barley, rye, rice, sorghum and millet.<br/>            There are a number of reasons why cereals have been important in man’s diet.  They can be grown in areas with diverse climatic and soil conditions.  They give yield peracre (0.4ha) as compared to most other crops and once harvested, their excellent storage stability combined with their high nutritive valuers make them most suitable for storage.<br/>            They are easy to be packaged and transported and can be used to produce a large variety of high desirable foods both for man and animals.<br/>            Cereal grains are the most important source of the world’s total food.  The grains are eaten in many ways, sometimes as a paste or other preparation of the seeds more often milled and further processed into flour, starch, oil, bran, syrup, sugar, etc.  They are also used to feed the animals that provide us with meat, eggs, millet, butter, cheese and a host of other foods.  Cereals grains are preserved in ways which make them to last long for processing.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE STATUS OF PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION OF CEREALS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE STATUS OF PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION OF CEREALS IN NIGERIA", "id": 54}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROCESS FOR REFINING VEGETABLE OIL AND ITS FOOD VALUE<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.1              The Oil Palm <br/>2.2              Extraction and Refining of Vegetable Oil<br/>2.3              Types and Sources of Vegetable Oil<br/>2.4              Physical Properties and Chemical Reactions of Vegetable Oil<br/>2.5              Role of Vegetable Oil in the Diet<br/>2.6              Utilization and Production of Vegetable Oil<br/>2.7              Factors Influence Quality of Oil<br/>2.8              Preservation Method of Vegetable Oil<br/>2.9              Problems Facing Vegetable Oil Industry <br/>2.10          Cholesterol<br/>2.11          Food Sources of Cholesterol <br/>2.12          Effects of Cholesterol, Other Lipids and Lipoproteins to the Heart<br/>2.13          Reduction of Cholesterol in the Body  <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>References<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/>            Palm oil is one the commercial product of palm fruit (Elaesis Guineesis). It is derived from the fleshy messieurs of the fruit of the oil palm which contains 45 – 55% oil. Palm oil belongs to a class of food known as fat and oil, which are generally termed lipid. It is oil from plant origin. <br/>            However, oil palm exists in a world semi and cultivated state in three kinds of the equatorial tropics:<br/>-                      In Africa<br/>-                      South-east Africa<br/>-                      And in America<br/>It is indigenous to West Africa and grows wild in most parts of Southern Nigeria.<br/>            The oil palm gives the highest yield of oil per unit area of any crop, and produces two distinct oil. The outer fibrous layer provide palm oil, the inner hard unit contains palm kernel oil, both which are important in world trade. <br/>Though both palm oil and palm kernel are derived from the pulp during processing. The international trade in palm oil began in the beginning of the nineteenth century, while pal, kernels trade develop after 1850.<br/>            Naturally, the oil palm must be harvested before processing can take place. This is usually occurs when t he fruit bunches changes colour from black to orange and fruiting body becomes detached from the stalk (Piggott, 1990; p. 109).<br/>            Once the produce is harvested, it is taken to the mill for  the palm oil to be extracted. This process is carried out in four stages:<br/>-                      Sterilization<br/>-                      Stripping of fruitless from bunches<br/>-                      Digestion <br/>-                      Oil extraction<br/>Moreover, crude vegetable oil are extracted form the seeds/nuts.<br/>Presently, it is done primarily by solvents extraction whereas in the past, it was done by physical means such as the application of heavy pressure to the seed/nut. <br/>            However, palm oil constitutes the most important source of edible oils and fats. The oil is semi-solid at room temperature due to the presence of natural saturat4ed fats. It severs as rich source of dietary energy yielding approximately a calorie. Palm oil contains fatty acid components which are essential nutrients (FAO, 1966: p, 119 - 121) and their functional and textural characteristics contribute to the favour and palatability of many natural and prepared foods. It is easily digested, absorbed and to utilized in normal metabolic processes. The oil is cholesterol free and is rich in carotenoids. <br/>            Naturally, palm oil contains a high level of tocols (vitamin E) which are poverty natural anti-oxidants. It contains a very 100 concentration of linolenic acid and a moderate proportion of linolenic acid, the most readily oxidized component of oils. Natural palm oil is known for its excellent stability at high temperatures. The low content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which centers resistance to rancidity.<br/>            In addition, vitamins are accessory food factors, which cannot be synthesized in the human body, and have to be supplied in the diet, albeit in small quantities. <br/>The fat – soluble vitamins namely: <br/>-                      Vitamin A<br/>-                      Vitamin D<br/>-                      Vitamin E<br/>-                      Vitamin K<br/>Are contained in fat and oils. Vitamin A carotene from natural palm oil is nature’s most abundant source. In nature, there are approximately six hundred known carotenoids, rangity from yellow orange to red, lives and some of these pipmeirts possess vitamin A activity of varying degrees.<br/>Red palm oil is one of the richest natural plant sources of carotenoids with concentration of 500 – 750 ppm. No other vegetable oil contains carotenoids in significant quantities.<br/>Vitamin E is one of the most important phytonutrients in edible oils/. It consists of eight naturally occurring isomers a family of four tocopherots (alpha, beta, gamma and delta), and four tocotrinots (alpha, beta, ----mma and delta) homologues.<br/>Tocotrinols are naturally present in most plants; however, they are dound most abundantly in palm oil extracted from palm fruits vitamin E anti – oxidant play protective role in cellular aging, atheroseclerosis and cancer. <br/>Vitamin D on the other hand, is a sterol and is essential for borne formation.<br/>            Nevertheless, the vegetable oil obtained from t h e same fruits as palm oil is very different products because of its lauric and content. It has a similar composition and behaviours of those of acid content of this oil make it a desirable ingredient in the manufacture of margarines confectionery and based goods.<br/>This acid also gives the oil some special quantities which makes it desirable in soap manufacturing. It acts as processing acids in the rubber industry due to its softening and plastering effects.<br/>            Oils and fat are liable to spoilage which results in the production of unpleasant odours and flavours. This is used in described as rancidity. Different types of oil and  fats show varying degree of resistance to spoilage, thus most vegetable oils deteriorate only slowly, whereas animal fat deteriorate rapidly and marine oil. This is because animal fat contain a relatively high proportion of combined high unsaturated fatty acids. The two most common forms of rancidity are hydrolytic.<br/>            Generally, palm tree is highly valuable plant in the sense that non of its component is a waste. The palm founds could be used for there feeding of domestic animals as improvised roofs for local houses. The stem could on its own serve as alternative to plant in the conventional roof for modern building. The fruits/kernel provide goods source of vegetable oil.<br/>            All crude oils and fats when fresh produced contain unwanted impurities.<br/>These unwanted impurities consist of:-<br/>-                      Free fatty acids<br/>-                      Moisture <br/>-                      Gums <br/>-                      Trace metals<br/>-                      Odourferious materials<br/>-                      Colouring matter<br/>-                      Resins<br/>-                      And sometime vitamins. These impurities affect flavour, odour, and clarity and are removed during returning. Process is carried out in a number of stages which may be considered in turn:-<br/>-                      Degummiry <br/>-                      De odourizing<br/>-                      Reaction with alkali<br/>-                      Bleaching <br/>After undergoing these process, the oil is pure and ready for use as is usually the case, ready for blending. It is desirable t hat the oil should not come into contact with air one it has been refined as this leads  to deterioration due to oxidation. The implication of these factors listed above and even more would be highly lighted in the course of this work with a view – pointing the best over all processing method.<br/>            Finally, cholesterol a steroid lipid is found in the cell membranes of all body tissues. It is carried around the blood stream of all animals.<br/>Cholesterol are classified into two forms:-<br/>-                      Good cholesterol <br/>-                      Bad cholesterol <br/>Most cholesterol is not dietary in origin, rather it is synthesized internally. They are present in higher concentrations in tissue which either produce more or have more densely packed membranes, examples:-<br/>-                      The liver<br/>-                      Spinal cord<br/>-                      And atheroma <br/>Moreso, they play a central role in many biochemical processes. The body uses it in a number of ways namely:-<br/>-                      In the production of bile <br/>-                      In the production of acids<br/>-                      Helps I n the digestion of fat in the body<br/>-                      It is important to health.<br/>However, too much cholesterol in the body can lead to narrowing and blockage of the arteries especially those that feed the heart and can keep it healthy. <br/><br/>\n\nPROCESS FOR REFINING VEGETABLE OIL AND ITS FOOD VALUE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROCESS FOR REFINING VEGETABLE OIL AND ITS FOOD VALUE", "id": 55}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF FOOD PACKAGING MATERIAL ON THE ENVIRONMENT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE:     INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       Food packaging definition<br/>1.2       History of food packaging<br/>1.3       Reasons or purpose of food packaging<br/>1.4       Types of food packaging<br/>1.5       Functions of food packaging<br/>1.6       Role of packaging<br/>1.7       Characteristics<br/>CHAPTER TWO:    <br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1       Effect of food packaging material on our environment  <br/>2.2       Littering <br/>2.3       Health Effect<br/>2.4       Pollution Effect<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1       Summary and conclusion <br/>3.2       Recommendation<br/>References or Bibliography <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.0              INTRODUCTION<br/>Food packaging is just one among ways of food preservation for when food is been packaged, it is set for shipment and marketing. Food Technologist who must have a good knowledge of technology materials, labour equipment, money research, engineering and management is in any food-processing establishment.<br/>Particularly, food packages purposely protect the products from environment hazards throughout the period of the shelf life. Some industries can even be instituted purposely for food packaging. For these facts, every Food Technologist must acquire the knowledge of packaging principle and practice as to meet up with the specific requirement of food in order way to retain its quality, throughout the processing of storage and distribution and even specified the demands in which the food imposed on the packages.<br/>Though, it the sole responsibility of the specialist who can design and manufacture these packages. And because of that, the packages physically protect and maintain quality of the product, and it attracts the consumers and even be within an average at economic cost.<br/>1.1       PACKAGING DEFINITION<br/>It is an overall stages in production of product planning involving designing and producing the container or wrapper of the product. The following can serve as a definition of packaging. Packaging could also be an elaborated mattress where you sleep on and the sheets and blanket covering it came out from packaging.  Packaging also is likened to a cereal you have for breakfast and the milk and sugar on it, which in packages. Packaging materials are towels, soap toothpaste, colognes and lotion and the clothes you wear a you get ready to tale the days activities, all comes in packages. Food packaging materials could be defined as you go through the day nearly everything that you touch eat use or with which arrived in a package.<br/>Food packaging   materials can be enlisted as common place such as intergal part of our existence which tends to take things for granted, ignoring their presence and contribution of our every daily lives. It is prescribed as military supplies; where more general sense, are purchased for the use of government agency services. It is also an embodiment of a dynamic of a center where people are socially engaged for the day.<br/>Packaging is explained as merely preserved food over a past few years which have become a tool of marketing operations.<br/>1.2       HISTORY OF FOOD PACKAGING<br/>An early man developed his own packaging technology by using leaves for wrapping purposes in Nigeria such as cocoyam, banana, and plantain and “uma” leaves. Again the skin of a goat for the first flexible packaging material in the environmental through transport of water and wine. Early containers were made by placating rushes or reeds and small wooden casks produced by methods similar to those used by coopers today which is evidenced.  <br/>Ancient Egyptians were masters of art of preservation and this is demonstrated in tombs of pharaohs, not only in the preservation of bodies but also on other materials. However, it is just beginning with modern packaging as original from industrial resolution changed the structure of society and concentrated through large members of people in the town, cities so altering their habits and creating a great demand for similar quantities of various products in large replications.<br/>Today packaging must do much more than merely preserve food and over the past few years which have seen packaging more and more become a tool of marketing operation.<br/>It protects the meat product from microbial contamination’s, light, physical damage or chemical changes. Moreover a good job of packaging with the proper type of packing material may also enhance the appearance of the products and make I t more appealing to the consumers.<br/>It again has a multi-purpose functions for food product primary manufacturer protect the food product by keeping it  in good condition and preserve the flavour until it researchers the consumer.<br/>It is essentially suitable forms of packaging products to a finished level. Food material used for packaging must not contaminate the product.

It could be allowed to ferment and subsequently distilled into gin it could also be used for the leavening of dough for bread making ( Somiari and Udoh 1993).<br/>The use of palm wine and as a leavening agent for dough is attributed to the presence of a yeast strain contained in the palm sap. This yeast strain is saccharomyces cerevisiaem or baking yeast is called in the bakery industry.<br/>Palm wine when fresh, tastes like ginger bear and can be used as like yeast ( Irvine 1961). Initially, the sap is sweet, dirty brown in colour. The fermentation process results in the sap becoming milky white in appearance. This is due to the presence of large number of fermenting bacteria and yeast.<br/>Fermentation occurs between 36 – 38 hr period during which PH of sap falls from 7.0 –7.2 to &lt; 4. (Jay 1986).<br/>1.2       COMPOSITION OF PALM WINE <br/>Palm wine has the average alcoholic content of 2.00 percent to 4. 69 percent. The sugary syrup, which is dirty brown in colour contains about 10 – 12 % sugar mainly sucrose.<br/>Studies made by faparusi et al1986 found the following genera of bacteria to be the most predominant in finished produced Lactobacillus, Micrococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Acetobacter. The predominate yeast found are Saccharomyces  and Candida spp with the former being the more common.<br/>1.3       YEAST (saccharomyces cerevisiae)<br/>Yeast is a unicellular micro-organism and fungus type. It makes possible many of the products made by bakers. This is because various types of bread and certain other bakery precuts are leavened (raised) by yeast. Many of them produce ethanol and carbon dioxide as waste products of their metabolism. They are therefore useful in the food industry for fermentation and aeration.<br/>Yeast usually used in the temperate region for baking are carefully selected strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is a simple chlorophyll – free plant which feeds on sugar in the batter or dough to produce carbon dioxide (Kotshever 1980). By enzyme action, it converts fermentable sugars and some of the starch present in the dough into carbon-dioxide gas and alcohol and provides desirable controlled fermentation (Sultan 1982).<br/>The discovery of the use of yeast to leaven bread centuries ago lead to the growth of bakery industry. Bakers used brewers yeast till about 80 –1000 years ago due to its performance in the bakery which was low and variable. The isolation of a special yeast strain which possessed the desired characteristic needed, brought about revolutionary changes in the bakery industry. This strain is known as saccharomyces cerevisiae or otherwise “ bakers” yeast in the form of cakes of compressed fresh yeast cell, with moisture content of about 70%.<br/>NUTRITION AND GENERATION <br/>Since the yeast cell is a living organism, it has numerous nutritional needs and it is only if these are met that it will grow vigorously and produce a large quantity of carbon dioxide. Food and moisture are needed for this growth.<br/>Saccharomyces cerevisiae  differs from other yeast species. It has more aerobic growth habit, maximum yielding capability stability during storage. It is usually derived from special selection of fast growing (short generation time) naturally occurring yeast strains ( Oyawoye and Bassey 1997) .<br/>The plant grow best at the temkperature between 80 – 900 cooler temperatures retards their growth and a temperature as high as 1110 F kills the plant within an hour 1400 F destroy them within 5 minutes.<br/>IMPORTANCE OF BAKERS YEAST<br/>This principle involved in dough leavening is based on the utilization of the carbohydrate by the ‘bakers’ yeas to give out carbon dioxide entrapped in the dough. As the yeast multiply in the dough, fermenting at room temperature. More and more carbon-dioxide is produced and the dough expanse because of the pressure of gas. This yeast activity is destroyed during baking at the temperature of 1400 F.<br/>            Bakers yeast is useful chiefly in three different ways.<br/>1.                  TESTURE FORMATION: They produce carbon dioxides gas, which leavens or raises the dough, giving the bread the desired loose porous texture.<br/>2.                  INCREASE OF DOUGH VOLUME: The use of bakers yest as a leavening agent help to achieve great great increase in volume and make a wide variety of baked products. This means that it is no longer a necessity to rely on egg white foam to encompass enough air  <br/>1                           FLAVOUR PRODUCTION: Bakers yeast is reported to contribute to the flavour of bread and other yeast leavened products. During dough fermentation, many secondary metabolites such as ketones, higher alcohols,  organic acids, aldehydes, and esters are produced by the yeast. Some of these alcohols escape during baking. Others react with one another and with other compounds found in the dough to form a new and more complex flavour compounds. The resultant flavour diffuses into the crumb of baked bread ( Graw – hill 1971).<br/>1.4       BREAD <br/>Bread is food produced by mixing flour with water and yeast and baking in an oven ( Hornby 1995). In some cases, other ingredients such as eggs, butter, milk and sugar are added basically to augment its nutritional value. Like all other foods produced from cereals, bread is eaten primarily as a cheap source of energy. It contains valuable amount of protein, iron and vitamins flour is the basic ingredient in the production of bakery goods. This is because of its gluten. The unique properties of wheat protein, glademin and can prdice bread dough of the strength and elasticity required to produce low density of bread of desired texture and flavour (Ihekoronye and Ngoddy 1985). The elasticity of gluten retains the gas and supports the structure of the loaf.<br/>The dough is made by mixing together the flour, water, yeast, salt and other additions ingredients. Dough raising is the act of producing carbon dioxide in the dough. This is a results of yeast cell saccharomyces cerevisiae incorporated into the dough, and this helps in the puffing up of the dough during the process of bread making.<br/>Bread is baked at the temperature of 2500 - 2600 for a period of 30 –50 minutes. During baking, the mixtures (dough) are expanded by air, steam or carbon dioxide. The proteins present (gluten) coagulates and the starch takes on water and sets (gelatinizes). The coagulated proteins and gelatinized starches give baked product their structure and colour ( Kotschevar and Lunderg 1970).<br/>Bread production is of vital importance as its is a product which is not liable to seasonal fluctuation and can be made from varieties of flour.<br/>In this work, palm wine was selected as a medium for the isolation of saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of bakers yeast. This is due to ability of the yeast cells present in the palm sap to produce alcohol ( ethanol) and carbon dioxide form the fermentable sugar in the palm juice.<br/>Past work showed that other yeast strains are present in which wine apart from saccharomyces cerevisiae which have the desired characteristics of the bakers yeast. These other strains are generally referred to as “ wild yeast” ( Frazier and Hoff 1988).<br/>The presence of this “ Wild yeast “ as well as mold and bacterial flora limits the direct use of palm wine for bread production. Those loaves produced with 90% palm wine dreg developed sour – taste and pronounced palm wine flavour and were unacceptable after 3days thereby limiting leavening , for this reason, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which occur naturally in palm wine and have the desirable characteristics to the bakers yeast is isolated, propagated and used as pure culture for dough fermentation.<br/>Somiari, and Udoh (1993) worked on the isolation of yeast from palm wine using malt extract agar ( MEA DIFCO) for the leavening of the dough.<br/>1.4.1 AIMS AND OBJECCTIVES <br/>1.                  To isolate the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae from palm wine for the production of bakers yeast whose performance can compete favourably with commercial bakers yeast in bread production.<br/>2.                  To embark on bread production with locally sourced yeast rather than commercial bakers’ yeast.<br/>3.                  To determine the optimum proofing temperature for the isolated yeast during bread production <br/> <br/>\n\nISOLATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE FROM ON PALM WINE\r\n(ELAELS GUINNEENSIS) AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE OF PROOFING DURING BREAD \r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE FROM ON PALM WINE\r\n(ELAELS GUINNEENSIS) AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE OF PROOFING DURING BREAD \r\n", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSIGN TECHNIQUIES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOYMILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Soymilk was processed from soymilk (Glycine Max) seed using that different processing techniques: <br/>A         Hot extraction method<br/>B.        Cold extraction method<br/>C.        Soaking before hot extraction method.<br/>            The soymilk samples were subjected to sensory evaluation using 9 point hedonic scale and proximate analysis.<br/>            Result obtained showed that sample A was significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) between sample B had a more acceptable colour (P &lt; 0.05) than samples A and C this was no significant difference between sample A and C in terms of colour.<br/>            The general acceptability of the sample showed that all the samples were acceptable.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1         History of Soybeans <br/>1.2         Uses of Soybeans <br/>1.3         Composition of Soybeans<br/>1.4         Nutritional Quality of Soybeans <br/>1.5         Antinutritional Factors<br/>1.6         Trypsin Inhibitor <br/>1.7         Haemagluttins <br/>1.8         Soybeans Saponings <br/>1.9         Protein Quality of Soubeans<br/>1.10      Aims and Objectives <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature Review <br/>2.1         Milk from Soybeans<br/>2.2         Nutritional Value of Soybeans <br/>2.3          Essential Amino Acid Content of Soybeans  <br/>2.4         Undesirable Components of Soybeans <br/>2.4.1     Trypsin Inhibitor<br/>2.4.2     Clrease <br/>2.4.3     Haemagluttuis<br/>2.4.4     Gioterogens<br/>2.4.5     Phytic acid<br/>2.4.6     Bitter and Beeany Flavour<br/>2.4.7     Flatus<br/>2.4.8     Soymilk Flavour<br/>2.4.9     Soymilk and Lipoxidase Activity<br/>2.6.1     Nutritional Aspect of Soymilk<br/>2.6.2     Proteins<br/>2.6.3     Vitamins and Minerals<br/>2.6.4     Fats <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1         Materials <br/>3.2         Methods I Hot Extraction Method<br/>3.3         Method II Cold Extraction Method<br/>3.4         Method III Soaking Before Hot Extraction Method<br/>3.5         Method of Analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Result and Discussion<br/>4.1         Effect of Soaking Time on the Organoptic Qualities of Soymilk  <br/>4.2         Effect of Soaking Time on the Protein Recovery and Total Solids<br/>4.3         Effect of Blanching Time on the Organoleptic Qualities of Soymilk <br/>4.4         Effect of Blanching Time on Protein Recovery and Total Solids<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Conclusion and Recommendation <br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation <br/>REFERENCES <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>His of Soymilk:  Soybeans belongs to the family leguminous, subfamily  papiliondase and the genus Glycine Max. (Ricker and Morse, 1984), other normendatures which have been used include phaseolus Max, Soja Max Piper and Soja hispide moech.<br/>It is not known when this remarkable legume, soybean was first cultivated in China. However as the first  legume of which a written record was made. This was in the books of the Emperor  Shen hung, dated 1800BC which describes the five principal and sacred crops of China, rice, bean, wheat barely and millet, lafter in his milliohm there were chinses writing, giving expert advice on growing soybean which was cultivated more extensively in North than in Southern China, it reached Hapan and other countries in East Asia at an early date.<br/>Soybean contain about 46%  protein and 18% fat, characteristics which have influenced it’s history: the ancient Chinese evolved  methods of making from it’s preparations with high protein content for example, Curd and Shoyu, Shoyu is a dark brown liquid made by fermentation of a combination of soybeans and cereals (F.A.O. 1970). The Chinese also ate soybeans as a  vegetable after it ahs sprouted.<br/>The soybean was first heard of in Europe in 1712 through the German Botanist Egelbant Kalmpfer who had visited Japan. In the 18th century, it was grown in some European botanical gardens (F.A.O, 1970), it is first appearance in the United States in 1804, when Commander Perry brought home two varieties from Japan (F.A.O, 1970).<br/>What was called the second stage in the history of soybeans did not begin until the first decade of the present century, when it become an important export from East – Asia at first mainly to Europe and alter to the importing countries was as a source of oil for soap making and other purposes and for the manufacture of livestock feed.<br/>Then the third stage began in the early nineteen thirties, it is silent feature has been the large stage cultivation of the soybean in the United States, combined with the application of Modern Technology which enable it to be put to a variety of uses both as food and folder and as raw materials for manufacturing processes, while soybean has to a considerable extent becomes an industrial crop in the United States, it continues to be grown in East Asia as a food crop processed for consumption by time honoured  methods. (FAO, 1970).<br/>The fourth stage began during the first decade of the 20th century A.D. at the period in which this crop was first introduced of soybeans in Nigeria shows that middle belt of the country to be the best producer of soybean production (Ezedinmma, 1964). In Nigeria, nearly all of the soybean production estimated at 30,000 tons is used for human food. A response to increase in demand for soybean for soybean as a source of protein and vegetable oil, national programme in Nigeria have explained their research on the crop. Since 1987 (IITA; Annual Report 1985) currently more feather have been added to the number of products that can be obtained from soybeans in Nigeria, such products like soymilk as it had been recently demonstrated at the food investigation centuries in Enugu.      <br/>Soymilk in the traditional sense is simply an aqueous extract of whole soybean, A detailed description of the technique used for the preparation of the soymilk as well as its composition will be found in chapter 3.<br/>Soymilk according to the nutritionist a possible substitute for cow or human milk particularly in the feeding of infant who are allegic to animal milk or where cows milk may be found to be two expensive or unavailable.  Miller, (1962) soybean or vegetable milk or flu-changin chinse is reported to have been developed and used in china before the Christian era (paker and Morse 1943) by the philosopher who was credited with the first step in the processing of tofu and yuba. Then, the traditional milk is made by soaking the bean in water overnight, wet milling the bean, heating the wet mash to improve flavour and nutritional value and filtration. The milk produce is sold to the public in streets and canteens in china in 1984.<br/>In recent years large scale production ha evolved along with commercial marketing of soymilk in Hongkong, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Sinapere, Malaysiaa and not the United States (Babara, 1984).  <br/>Uses of Soybeans<br/>Soybeans are a native crop of Eastern Asia where they have `served as an important part of the diet for centuries. The Japanese for example obtain 12 – 13% of their dietary protein from soybean product, for many of their traditional soy foods, the oriental people soak soybeans in water and then grind or cook them.<br/>Hot water extraction of ground beans yields soybean milk  which is consumed as such or is treated with calcium salts to precipitate the protein plus oil in the form of bean curd or tofu, fermentation of cooked soybeans yield products including soy sauce, misso, notto and tempheh.<br/>Except for soy sauce, one of the traditional oriental foods is consumed in significant amounts in this country. Soybeans are a relative new corner to the American scene. They have only been gown in quantity since the late 1920’s when soybean processing become an established industry, the two major products were oil and defaulted meals.<br/>In the mid – 1`930’s large  portion of the oil began to be used for foods such as shortening, margarine, cooking oil mayonnaise and salad dressing, because of its high protein content and good nutritional value, when properly processed, the meal was used primarily  for animal feeds.<br/>Soybeans have expanded in the last 30 year from a minor crop to a major cash crops. Indeed in value to the farmer soybeans now rank second to corn and above wheat, potatoes, oats, cotton and a  variety of other crops better known to the consumers, only within the last ten years however, have every many edible products. Containing soybean derivatives been directly associated with their source. In shortening their presence was “hidden” by statements similar to the followings. ‘A blend of hydrogenated vegetable oils or in salad dressing, merely “vegetable oil or a blend of vegetable oil”. Today a long list of foods containing soybean derived product can be prepared by careful reading of the labels in the supermarket, yet most of these are even not specifically identified as soybean. Product from corn, wheat, oats and many other commodities are so labeled for example corn flakes, wheat, garn, oatmeal, but not soybean. There are several reasons for this an enmity, soybean have a short history of sue in the U.S.A. the flavour and texture of soybean products are comparatively strange to people outside the orient.<br/>Although the Chinese and Japanese have covered soybeans into a variety of products most of these foods have little physical or flavour identity with the original bean. Some people agree that green soybean are a delicious dish when properly harvested and cooked but their sale and the sale and the ale of mature beans for baking are extremely small. Soybean products have problems related to their flavour and flavour stability to their ruction in foods and to their physiological effects. Despite these problems soybean oils have become a major material in our food industry. Soybean now supply more than half of the total visible fits and oils  consumed in the U.S.A<br/> Soybean composition (PREXIMATE), commercial soybean constitute and 2% hypocotyls and phumule. Proximate composition for whole beans and fractions are given in Table 1          <br/>TABLE 1: PROXIMATE COMPOSITION OF SOYBEANS AND SEED PARTS<br/>Fraction     Protein (Nx 6.25)    Fat %    Carbohydrate %    Ash %<br/>Whole bean     40    21    34    4.9<br/>Cotyledon     43    23    29    5.0<br/>Hall    8.8    1    86    4.3<br/>Hypocotyls     41    11    43    4.4<br/>             The constituents of major interest oil and protein make-up about 60% of the bean, but about one third consist of carbohydrates including polysaccharides, stachyose (3.8%), raffinese 1.1% phosphatides, sterols, ash and other minor constituents are also depend on variety, soil fertility and weather conditions.<br/>NUTRIENTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SOYBEAN<br/>            Over 50 years ago Osborne and Mendel (1980) found that rates grew poorly when feed with raw soybean meal and that dry head did not improve the nutritional value of the meal.<br/>            Rates grew normally, however when the meal was cooked on a steam for 3hrs. In the past 50yrs a vast literature was developed on the nutritive properties of soybean protein, but moist heat is still used to improve the nutritional quality of soybean protein product for foods and feeds.<br/>            The literature on this subject is often confusing and contradictory ; two recent reviews gives concise summaries of pertinent work for the last 30yrs. Alleged antinutritional factors and protein quality therefore are discussed only briefly.<br/>Antinutritional factors  <br/>            Since moist heat readily inactivates the anti-growth factors raw soybean meal, many workers believe that the factors are proteininhibitors and hemagluthins, non protein components such as sapynins have b suggested as anti-nutritional factors but recent work does not support this view.<br/>TRYPSIN INHIBITORS<br/>            More than five trysin inhibitors are reported for soybeans but only two-the kenitz and the Bowman Birk inhibitors have been purified and studied in details Kaw soybean meal contains 1.4% kunity inhibitor and 0.6^ Bowman-Birk  inhibitor.<br/>            Although both inhibitors are active against boline trypsin the kunity inhibitor has any how activity the esterase activity of human trypsin. The activity of human trypsin however is inhibited to a significant extent by kunity inhibition when case is sued as a substrate to measure proteolytic activity. It is not known whether ingestion of the inhibiters affects the presence in humans.<br/>            From the practical standpoint, Trypsin inhibitors do not appear to be a serious problem in feeds and food since they are largely inactivated by moist heat. Condition of heating time, temperature, moisture content and particle size influence the rate and extent of trypsin inhibitors inactivation for example, atmospheric steaming (1000C) inactivates more than 95% of the trypsin inhibitor activity of raw, defatted soybean flakes in 15mins. Protein efficiency shows an accompanying increase in this same time and flakes of 19% moisture gave a higher protein efficiency ratio than flakes of 5% moisture. In contrast, steaming whole soybeans chips, or cotyledons for 20mins only partially inactivated trypsin inhibitors apparently because of the large particle size. Atmospheric steaming inactivates most of the trypsin inhibitor in whole soybeans in 15mins. In initial moisture content is 20%. If the beans are soaked in water overnight 60% moisture 25mins. In boiling water sufficient to inactivate the inhibitors. Small but measurable trypsin inhibitors activity  can often be deflected after heating the known stability of Bowman-kirk inhibitor suggested that the residual inhibitor may be of this types. Measurements of residual chymotrypsin inhibitor activity would clarify this point because the Bowman-kirk inhibitor is a strong inhibitor of chymotrtpsin.<br/>            At recent study reports trypsin inhibitor activity commercial protein isolate but no inhibitor was detected in canned frankfurters containing 1.5% isolate. The heat treatment during canning inactivated the residual inhibitor.<br/>            Many of the conclusion drawn from studies on kunity inhibitor must be viewed with some reservations because of the heterogeneity of certain commercial preparation even when crystallized five times. The possibility that a protein impurities or a tightly bound non-protein impurity is responsible for some of the biological properties of the inhibitor has received slight  consideration until recently.<br/>            Hemagglatinins –Soybean contain at least four proteins capable of causing clumping of red blood cells of rabbits and rates in invitrotests. These proteins are designated haemagluttinins;  these proteins are in many legumes. Defected soy flour contains about 3%  lemaglutinins. The major hemagluttinin in soybeans has been insolated and characterized. It is a glycoprotein containing 4.5% mannose and 1% glucesanine and has a molecular weight of 110,00 and appear to contain two polypeptide chains. The ability of hemaggluttinins to cause clumping of red blood cells in a test tube serves as a useful assay procedure but there is no evidence that agglutination of red cells occurs when hemagluttinins are ingested. Hemagglutinins is readily inactivated by pepsin; thus it probably does not service passage through the stomach. Furthermore, undigested hemagglutinin would have to be absorbed from the intestine to come into contact with red blood cells an occurrence which seems unliky because of the high molecular weight of the hemagglutinin.<br/>            Soybean hemagglutinins are readily inactivated when maximum growth response is obtain. Hemagglutinins this ;present no known problems in foods of preparation includes proper heating of the soy ingredient at some step of processing.<br/>            Soybean saponings – saponins are complex glycosides of triterpenoid alcohols and occur in soybeans to the extent of 0.5% and because of their polarity, the saponins are insoluble in hexane and remain in defatted meal; defatted meal contains 0.6^ saponins. Although antinutritional properties have been ascribed to soybean saponins, recent studies show t hem to be harmless when ingested by chicks rates and nice aft 0.5 to 3% of the diet. At the highest level the saponins content was about three fold higher than in a 50% soybean meal supplemented diet. Neither saponings nor sapogenine were found in blood  of rates, mice or chicks kept in diet containing  20% soybean seed, thus the saponins are not absorbed thy remain intact until they leave the enzymes in the colon. The saponin inhibit various enzymes including cholinesterase and chymotrypsin but inhibition is not specific. Soyprotein and other dietary protein will also bind saponins. Approximately 0.4% saponins were obtained from a laboratory preparation of soyprotein isolate when isolates where ehated in dilate and solutions crystalline bit apparently modified. Saponins were obtained. The effect of interaction of the saponins with soy protein is still unknown, the saponins are an extremely complex mixture and only limited separations have been obtained to date.<br/>            Protein quality of soybean.<br/>            Until the 1960’s information on the nutritive value of soybean protein was largely limited to defatted flakes, meals and flours. Moreover most of the studied were concerned with use of soybean means as an animals feed. Since commercial introduction of concentrates and isolates in 1959 and their increasing use in foods, these fractions have received considerably more attention studies with human, however, are still limited. The quality of soy protein depends on several factors:-<br/>a)            Amino acids composition<br/>b)            Presence of anti-nutritional factors<br/>c)            Digestibility<br/>d)            Overall composition of the diet<br/>e)            Nutrient requirement of the species involves. Item a, b, and c are of primary importance in considering the various soy protein forms as protein sources.<br/>In the preparation of isolates for example fractionation occurs; this results in a change in amino acid  composition as well as in removal of the antinutritional factors occurring in the whey, items of and e are of greater importance when a specific food is being considered i.e. an infant food dietary item or a soack food nutritional requirements for an infant differ greatly from the needs of an adult who may be trying too loose weight.<br/>Aims and objectives of the project    <br/>The processing of soybeans into soymilk is aimed at gaining consumer acceptance of the legume by removal of the toxicants that contain and also improving organoleptic qualities of soymilk with special consideration to some adverse effect of these operation in soymilk  quality.<br/>This project re views the effects of different methods used in the processing of soybeans into soymilk on the quality of the milk produced during processing and storage. <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSIGN TECHNIQUIES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOYMILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSIGN TECHNIQUIES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOYMILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ADDITIVES AND PRESERVATIVES USED IN FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION, AND THEIR HEALTH IMPLICATION.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0              Introduction<br/>CHAPTER TWO:    LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.0              What are Food Additives and Preservatives<br/>2.1       classifications of food additives and preservatives <br/>2.2              important of food additives and preservatives<br/>2.3              Additives, preservatives and their uses<br/>2.4              Why do we use additives in food and general principles governing their uses<br/>2.5              Role of some common additives in food<br/>2.6              Choice and economic consideration of additives<br/>2.7              Processing and preservation methods<br/>2.8              Nutritive value of processed food and nutritional losses in food processing <br/>2.9              Reason for processing food and effect of processing on the food product<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0              Why do we preserve food and factors affecting the choice of a preservation process<br/>3.1       Ways of preserving food <br/>3.2              Purpose of preservation <br/>3.3              Needs and benefits of food additives and preservatives; used in food processing and preservations.<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Recommendation <br/>Conclusion<br/>References<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/>            Additives is “any substance the intended use of which result or may reasonably be expected to result directly or indirectly in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food”<br/>(United States Government 1981).<br/>            Additives is any substance not commonly regarded or used as a food, which is added to or used in or on food at any stage to affect its keeping qualities, odaur, alkalinity or acidity or to serve any other technological function in relation to food (food labeling Regulations 1984).   <br/>            Additives are a substance or mixture of substances, other than a basic foodstuff, which is present in a food as a result of any aspect of production, processing, storage or packaging (nutrition Board 1959).<br/>            Additives is non-nutritive substances added intentionally to food, generally in small quantities, to improved it’s appearance, flavour, texture or storage properties (A report of a joint FAO and WHO Expect committee 156).<br/>            Additives are any substance used in or around food that may become a component of the food.<br/>Some are introduced specifically for the purpose of improving the nutritive value, taste, texture, or shelf life of the product; these are intentional additives other enters food as residues after some stage of production or manufacture and are known as incidental additives (introductory Nutrition 1989).<br/>            Additives are chemicals that are added to food to improve it in some way.  Additives are used to modify colour, flavour and texture; to improve the keeping qualities of food and to make processing easier.<br/>It is used to control moisture and acidity. They are used to improve nutritional value.  Thousands of different substances are now used as additives, to some people.  The increasing number of additives being used is a cause for concern, if not alarm, and if is important to emphasize that the use f additives is most carefully controlled ( Allan G. Cameron 1975).<br/>            Need for food additives.<br/>Food additives play or important role in today’s complex food supply.<br/>Never before has the range and choice of foods been so wide either in supermarkets, specialist food shops or when eating out.  Whilst a shrinking purporting of the population is engaged in primary food production, consumer are demanding more variety choice and convenience alongside higher.<br/>Standards of safety and wholesomeness at affordable prices.<br/>Meeting these consumer expectations can only be achieved using modern food processing technologies which include the use of a variety of food additives proven effective and safe through long use and rigorous testing (Flowerdew, D. 1999).<br/>            How is the safety of food additive evaluated in Europe; All food additive must have a demonstration useful purpose and undergo a rigorous scientific safety evaluation before they can be approved for use. <br/>Until the creation of the European food safety Authority mo (EFSA) 177, the safety evaluation of additives in Europe was done by the scientific committee on food (scf).<br/>  At present, it is the EFSA panel on food additives, flavouring, processing, Aids and material in contest with food (AFC panel) who is in charge of this task.<br/>Assessments are based in reviews of all available toxicological date in the humans and animals models.  From the available date, the maximum level of additive that has no demonstrable toxic effect is determined.  This is called “ no-observed-adverse-effect level” (NOAEL) and is used to determined the  “Acceptable Daily intake” (ADI) for each food additive.  The ADI provides a large safety margin and is the amount of a food additive that can be consumed daily over a life time without any adverse effect on health (European parliament and council Directive 1988).<br/>Groups of additive according to committee on toxicity:<br/>-        Group A:       Additives that the available evidence suggests are acceptable for use in food.<br/>-            Group B:        Additives that on the available evidence may be regarded meanwhile as provisionally acceptable for use in food, but about which further information is necessary and which must be reviewed within a specified time.<br/>-        Group C: Additives for which the available evidence suggests probable toxicity and which ought not to be allowed in food without evidence establishing their acceptability.<br/>-         Group D: additives for which the available evidence suggests possible toxicity and which ought not to be allowed in food.<br/>-       Group E: Additives for which the available evidence was inadequate to enable an opinion to be expressed as to their suitability for use in food.<br/>-                      Group F: additives for which no information toxicity was available.<br/>Substance that is not on permitted lists must not be used for the preparation, manufacture and distribution of foods for sale to the ultimate consumer.  In the case of colours, emulsifiers, stabilizers, solvents and most miscellaneous additives, there are no limitations on amounts used in foods although there are prohibitions of their use in certain classes of foods (Furia 1972).<br/>Preservation is “any substance which is a capable of inhibiting, retarding or arresting the growth of micro-organisms or any deterioration of food due to micro-organisms or masking the evidence of such, micro-organisms are yeast, meld, Bacteria.<br/>The use of preservatives to perseverance food has been a common practice for many centuries e.g. salt, sugar, vinegar; spices have been used in homes, for as long as man has been in existence (Britain food Regulations 1989).<br/>Preservatives are centuries old, since ancient times, salt has been used to cure meats and fish, sugar has been added to fruits to conserve them, Herbs, spices and vinegar have also served as preservatives.<br/>Today’, the U.S food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates food preservatives, arrested, mistakes have been made, which has resulted in taking some food preservatives off the market.<br/>That is because at the time of approval, prevailing testing methods proved the substance as safe.<br/>As science continued to evolve and testing methods improved, changes were made.  Technology has also assisted in the approval process, as it has become more sophisticated over the years as well.<br/>Preservatives are often present in nature but they are in such small quantities, difficult to obtain.  To obtain commercially useful amounts of the preservatives synthetic copies of the natural products.  Other preservatives are made in the series of chemical reactions.  Typically, preservatives attack the enzymes inside the microbes and some can disrupt the microbe’s cell wall so that substances cannot enter, processes kill or seriously slow the growth of food-spoiling microbes.<br/>Probably, the most important use of preservatives from the food safety point of view is in processed meats such as ham, bacon, salami and sausages.  Bacteria like clostridium botulinum can produce deadly poisons and the use of preservatives in such products is absolutely essential.  For example, most cured and cooked meats contain the preservative.  Potassium nitrate (salt petre).<br/>The ability to preserve food in good condition for long periods is an undoubted bon.  The amount of food wasted is reduced and the incidence of food poisoning is minimized.  A wider range of foods is available including foods “out of season” and foods from overseas that could not be transported and stocked in former times.<br/>The widespread use of preservatives, refrigerators, ‘deep freezer’ equipment and canned and dehydrated food has made it easy for the consumer or caterer to have available a wide range of wholesome food at all times of the year.  As we are suppressing the growth of micro organisms, an effective method of food preservation must retain, as far as possible, the original characteristics of the food and imparity nutritive value as little as possible (Saltmarsh, M. 2000).<br/>We may say that without additives and preservatives, the very wide range of foods we have come to take for granted would not exist and most convenience foods could not be made.<br/>Our food would be less attractive and less palatable and seasonal foods would not be available all the year round as they are now.  Less food would be available in a fresh and prime condition and to put it bluntly – less food would be available.<br/><br/>\n\nADDITIVES AND PRESERVATIVES USED IN FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION, AND THEIR HEALTH IMPLICATION.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ADDITIVES AND PRESERVATIVES USED IN FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION, AND THEIR HEALTH IMPLICATION.", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PRODUCTION OF MIXED FRUIT USING FUSE LOCALLY SOURED CITRUS FRUITS ORANGE <br/>(CITRUS SILENCES) TANGERINE CITRUS RETICULATE) LEMON C GROUPS (CITRUS PARADOX).<br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>            Fix locally sourced citrus fruit (orange citrus sinners) tangerine (citrus reticulate) lemon citrus lemoni) (Lime (citrus aurantifolis) and Grape (citrus paradist) were mixed together to produce mixed fruit drink.

They may also be processed into other fruits  bevcarge marmalades, fruit butters, vinegar, nectars wine pastes price and preserves (Ihekoronye 1999).

The chief nutritional contribution of citrus juices other than the calorific energy supply by their natural sugar content is vitamin C which is the anti scurvy vitamin.

Margarine is made from water in oilemulsion because margarine is oilemulsion. Today it is a manufactured imitation of butter made by mixing a variety of fats that may include whale oil or vegetable oils, hydrogenated to an appropriates degree. Stabilize, an oil soluble dye and a proportion of soured skimmed milk to supply flavour.<br/>Like its model, margarine is about 80% fat, 20% water and solids. It is flavoured, coloured ad fortified with vitamin A and sometimes D to match butters nutritional contribution. Single oil or a blend may be used. During World War 1, coconut oil was favoured, in the thirties, it was cottonseed, and in the fifties, soy. Today, soy and corn oils predominate. The raw oil is pressed from the seeds, purified, hydrogenated, them fortified and coloured, either with a synthetic carotene or with annatto, a pigment extracted from a tropical seed. The water phase is usually reconstituted or skim milk that is cultured with lactic bacteria to produce a stronger flavour although pure diacetyl, the compound most responsible for the flavour of butter, is also used. Emulsifiers such as lecithin help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil, salt and preservatives are also commonly added. The mixture of oil and water is them heated, blended, and cooled. The softer tub margarines are made with less hydrogenated, more liquid oils than other types of margarines.<br/>            In 1860s French Emperor Louis Napoleon III offered a prize to anyone who could make satisfactory substitutes for buffer, suitable for use by the armed forces and the lower classes.<br/>            French chemist Hippolyte Mege-Mouriezi invented a substance he called oleomargarine, which become, in shortened form, the trade name margarine and is now the generic term for a wide range of broadly similar edible oils. It is sometimes shortened to oleoleomargarine which was made by taking clarified beef fat, extracting the liquid portion under pressure, and then allowing it to solidify. When combined with butyrins and water, it made a cheap and more – or – less palatable butter substitute. Sold as margarine or under any of a host of other trade names, butter substitutes soon became big business but too late to help Mege-Mouriez. Although he expanded his initial manufacturing operation from France to the United States in 1873, he had little commercial success. By the end of the decade, however, artificial butters were on sale in both the old World and the new.<br/>            Margarine is naturally white or almost white; by forbidding the addition of artificial colouring agents, legislators found that they could keep margarine off kitchen tables. The bans became common place around the world and would endure for almost 100 years. It did not become legal to sell coloured margarine. In Australia, for example, until the 1960s.<br/>            In the mean time, margarine manufactures had made changes. Modern margarine can be made from any of a wide variety of animal or vegetable fats, and is often mixed with skim milk, salt and emulsifiers. Liquid fats are transformed into suitable substrates by the chemical process of hydrogenation, which renders them  solid at room temperature. Many popular table spreads today are blends of margarine and butter. Something that was long illegal in the United States and Australia and no doubt parts of the world too and are designed to combine and the lower cost and easy – spreading of  artificial butter with the taste of the real thing.<br/>            Three main types of margarine are common:<br/>Hard, generally uncoloured margarine for cooking or baking, which contains a high proportion of animal fat. “Traditional” margarines for such use as spreading on toast, which contain a relatively high percentage of saturated fats and made from either animal or vegetable oils. Margarines high in mono – poly – unsaturated fats, which are made from safflower, sunflower soybean, cottonseed, or olive oil. <br/>Margarine, particularly polyunsaturated margarine has become a major part of the Western dieted states, for example, in 1930 the average person ate over 8kg of butter a year and just over 1 kg of margarine By the and of the 20th century, an average American ate just under 2kg of butter and bearly 4kg of margarine. <br/>Based on the fact  that margarine can be obtained from vegetable fat and animal fat, this study to produce margarine from palm kernel melon $ coconut oils bland id to investigate if the product would be preferred over the sample in the market by the consumers. The odour and taste in the oils would be removed during processing for it not to affect the sample of margarine. <br/>Physical, chemical and sensory evaluation test would be employed to investigate the quality.

UHT Milk) is packed without the danger of contamination making its increasing shelf span without any needs of a “cool chain” for distribution and storage.  This system can make liquid milk available in deficit areas like the North East India States.  While in Retort Packing, a product is filled in a retort package and is subjected to post packing sterilization in a retort or autoclave.  (Doyle and Mona, 1996).  This is mainly the thermal process and helps in achieving sterility and long shelf life stability.  Retort packages can be distributed and stored at room temperature.  Pick fill seal machines using pre-made retort rouches are the biggest beneficiaries of this technology.  Both the above packaging machinery requires careful selection of processing method and material in order to achieve the desired results.  Of later, commonly sought grocery commodities like sugar, rice, salt, spices are increasingly being projected as brands to all track customers.  (Carthy Jerome and Williams 1996).<br/>            Furthermore, among the groups of packaged, consumer items, food ranks was the highest and thus an entire industry can be instituted purposely for food packaging.  As the world is fast advancing technologist must have the knowledge of packaging principles and practices as their meet specific requirements of food in order to retain it’s quality through processing, storage and distribution.  And to specify what demands the food imposes on the package.  Though it’s the sole of responsibilities of the packaging specialist to design and manufacture packages.  (Mehegan and Sean, 1996)<br/>            However, in as much as the package physically of the protects and maintains the quality of the product, appeals and attracts the consumer, it should be within an average economic cost.  (Mehegan and Sean, 1996).<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND IN PACKAGING OF FOOD<br/>            Before World War II packaging was used primarily to surrender and protect products during storage, transportation and distribution.  Some packages where designed with esthetic appeal and even for ease of use by the end of the consumer, but package design was typically left to technicians.  Since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the mid – 18005, they build it and com maximum had prevailed.  After World War II companies become more interested in marketing and promotion as a means of enticing customers to purchase their products.  (Rosette, 1992).  As a result of more manufactures begans to vicro packaging as a way to lure buyers. During mid 1900s, several influence contributed to turn packaging into an integral part of the most companies marketing mix.  Consumers become better educated, wealth and expectations generally increased, consequently consumer began to rely much more heavily on manufactured good and processed foods items.  New technologist related to production, distribution and preservatives lead to a massive proliferation in the number and type of products and brand available in the industrialized.  (Stern, Waltter and Willy, 1981)<br/>            Thus packaging become vital means of differentiating items and informing consumers.  The importance of consumer packaging was elevated in the United States, during the late 197s, and 1980S. Rapid economic expansion and marked growth warned during the period of forcing consumer to focus increasingly on luring consumer to their product brand at the expanse of the competition. Packaging design become a marketing science. And as a new corporate cost consciousness developed in response to the increased competitive companies began to alter packaging techniques as a way to cut production, storage and distribution expenses. (Crift and Scharow, 1972).<br/>            Furthermore, marketers began to view packaging as a tool to exploit existing product lines by adding new items and pump new life into maturing product.<br/>            Today in different parts of the world, due to the fast advancement in science and technology, the role of packaging in wood processing, packaging some foods naturally have efficient primary containers, for example, nut, oranges, eggs etc. Such foods need to be packaged with only secondary outer box, wrap or drum to hold the units together and gives gross protection. Other foods like milk powder, dried eggs and fruits concentrates often will b filled into primary containers such as plastic lines which are then packaged within protective cartors or drums. (Ugwnanyi, 7998).<br/>1.2.            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS OF PACKAGING<br/>Since the role of packaging in food processing in Nigeria is the Joy of a food scientist or food technologist in food packaging and can only be complete after introducing a new package, the food technologist or food scientist must cover the following:<br/>i.                    Material specification.<br/>ii.                  Product compatibility.<br/>iii.                 Distribution cycle.<br/>iv.                Marketing consideration (Ugwuanyi, 1998)<br/>Then after getting all these, it is left for the industries best interest to produce safe food and reach<br/>It to consumers in a manner where its safety is not compromised. To ensure this, the following must be known.<br/>(1)               Cause of food borne diseases, (where the risk in the production chain are the greatest). And the how’s protecting the consumer from them.<br/>(2)               Production and packaging methods to ensure food safety for longer periods of time.<br/>(3)               Distribution and storage of food in the supply chain. (Doyle and Mona, 1996).<br/>            Another problem is that in the world today, we found out some series of investigation that many people especially Business men, had tried to produced their own food and packaged without the notification of food scientist and food technologist, but they handle succeeded because Government have introduced National Agency for foods and drug Administration and control (which is known as NAFDAC) to work against piracy.(stern and Walter, (1981).<br/>1.3.            OBJECTIVE<br/> The main objective of packaging our food is to.<br/>1)      Prevent the shelf life of food.<br/>2)      To prevent it from attack of microorganisms and pest.<br/>3)      We package our food to make it look pleasant to consumers.<br/>1.4.            SCOPE OF WORK<br/>The role of packaging in food processing in Nigeria is the Joy of a technologist in food packaging can be complete after introducing a new package, only the food scientist or food technologist can be able to cover the following four basic areas.<br/>a.       Material specification<br/>b.      Product compatibility<br/>c.       Distribution cycle<br/>d.      Marketing consideration. (ugwuanyi, 1998)<br/>1.5.            DEFINITION OF THE TERM PACKAGING.<br/>Packaging can be defined as the over all stages the quantity of the product, appeals to and attracts the consumer; it should be within an average economic cost. (Ugwuanyi Gorgina). She also defined packaging as the overall stages in a product planning involving designing and producing the container or wrapper for a product. Packaging is said to be container or wrapper that holds a product or a group of product. (Jane, 1998)<br/>            Furthermore, packaging containers can said to be either primary or secondary. Primary containers is one that comes indirect contact with the food such as cans or jars and secondary container is an outer sox, case, or wrapper that may holds cans or jars but does not directly contact the food.<br/>            Types of commercial packaging include shipping cartons, containers for industrial goods and holders for consumer product. Beside protecting the product from damage and protecting can function as a crucial marketing tool. Helping the companies to attract new customers and retain established ones. The second function become more important for companies in the 1990s, as the reach and effectiveness of advertising began to shrink simultaneously, packaging makers have had to weigh the with consumer demands for environmentally friendly packaging and less packaging altogether. (Rosette, 1992).<br/> <br/><br/>\n\nTHE ROLE OF PACKAGING IN FOOD PROCESSING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF PACKAGING IN FOOD PROCESSING", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN INVESTIGATION ON THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS PACKAGING MATERIAL ON THE QUALITY ATTRIBUTES OF SUYA (MEAT)<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       Introduction<br/>1.1              Suya as a traditional meat<br/>1.2              Aims and objectives<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0       Literature Review<br/>2.1              Function Of A Package Meat And Meat Prodcut<br/>2.2              Different Packaging Materials And Their Properties<br/>2.3              Processing Of Suya<br/>2.4              Methods Of Proximate Analysis<br/>2.5              Results Of Proximate Analysis<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0              Recommendation<br/>3.1       Use Of Different Packaging Mateiral In Industry<br/>3.2              Use Of Aluminum Foil As Packaging Material<br/>3.3              Metal Cans As Packaging Materials<br/>Conclusion<br/>References<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.0              INTRODUCTION<br/>Meat is a flesh of animals consumed for foods.  In the topics, the bulk of the meat consumed is derived from cow, sheep, cattle, pigs, camel etc.  The other aspect of a dead animal such as the offal’s (kidney, liver, intestine etc) and the skin are often consumed, but one not termed meat; which ever part of it is meat is usually consumed for its high quality protein content essential for body growth and repairs.<br/>The proportions of meat derived foods that one consumed are related to the general, affluence of the society in which he lives. Meat consumption in the developed countries is more than in less developed countries is more than in less developed countries. Ihekoronye, A. I and Ngoddy, P.O. (1985)<br/>The most common meat product include Beef (cow), pork (pig), mutton (sheep) and they are commonly used in making sausages, burgers, meat rolls suya meat and sometimes, they are eaten like that. The food technologist is not only interested in those products, but also mostly interested in the process leading to the slaughtering of animals final quality of meat or meat product is usually influenced by both.<br/> SLAUGHTER FACTORS AND THE INITIAL HEALTH OF THE ANIMAL <br/>Animal for slaughtering must be healthy and usually not so old. This requirement is necessary if a high quality product is to be obtained.<br/>Suya is popular roasted and smoked sliced beet product, suya is a traditional meat product originating from the Northern part of Nigeria; and it has gained considerable acceptability and popularity in the south too. It is produced by community meant into straws and passing with slight pressure through sticks. The meat is sprinkled with spices, groundnut oil, dry pepper and heat treated by a process involving dry cooking (roasting) by heat from a burning wood or charcoal. Kafidiya, O.O. (1981)<br/>             Suya meat is an ideal source of animal protein and its inclusion in a balanced diets should go a long way towards improving nutrition, but  technological problems need to be overcome before the product can be successfully and safely  processed, packaged and presented to the consumer Igene, J. O. (1982).<br/>            Increased demand for convenience foods has resulted in expansion of the processed meat industry. The consumption of suya has been accelerated, especially in southern Nigeria. The traditional method of producing suya is processed with the view to effecting some modifications where necessary to improve hygiene, palatability, characteristics and shelf stability. Kafidya, O.O (1981).<br/>            The recent up range of food prices in Nigeria has been the result of a number of complex circumstances, both domestic and international. <br/>            A substantial amount of the diet protein in the nation is obtained from crops. The level of animal protein in take is only about 17 percent of this total protein consumed by the average Nigerian, which is far from minimum recommended this situation could be improved by developing the food processing sector, especially meat and meat products.<br/>            The high quality of meat protein is well established and is essential in the maintenance to a healthy population. Development in the quantitative as well as qualitative production of suya could have a remarkable impact on the animal protein nutrition in Nigeria in view of the diverse and cheap sources of raw materials for suya processing. Suya is within the reach of most members of the population due to its unit price and as such contributes to a growing proportions of the much needed animal protein.<br/>            The process of economic development in any society pre-surposes a structural and social transformation of immense proportions such a transformation requires changes in the attitudes of people, changing the techniques of production and changes in preferences. Consumers expect amongst other things that the food available to them be cheap, clean, safe, unadulterated, reasonable priced and handled under sanitary conditions; for this to be possible, systematic machinery needs to be developed so that the  technological demands of the products as well as consumer are satisfied. <br/>            A prime source of long term productivity gains is technological innovation. New methods, new materials and new machines contribute to a faster rate of gain in output per man hour. Rapid organization has continued to raise income in the nation and has led to the changes in the nation an has led to the changes in the nature of demands for food with growing emphasis on convenience food such as ‘suya’. A revolution in the aesthetic qualitative and quantitative production of suya is one way by which Nigerian improves the level of protein nutrition of its people.<br/>            In many of the major urban area of the country, the number of suya meat, the number of suya meat has increased tremendously over the past decade, while consumption has become improved with respect to ethnicity, re4lijorn, socio- economic factor or sex. Unfortunately, however, suya production is still at its technology standard, in which the production me4thords that have been in use for the past generation are yet to be replaced or modernized to cope with increasing demand.<br/>            AS demand for improve suya becomes apparent, there is a need to focus more attentions on the search for ways to reduce the drudger in the suya industry. While government and foundation have expended millions of naira on research over the years to improve productivity of agriculture’s, research expenditure in the area of suya processing, packaging, storage and distribution has been  non-existence, and the reason can be advanced for this phenomenon, it can be argued that the decision to transform any mode of production is basically economic. Such dissension involves:<br/>i)          Availability of a more efficient production method.<br/>ii)         Calculation of the real benefit to be gained by effecting the change.     <br/>            Although millions of people may be engaged in the production of suya, the industry has a slow rate of growth. At the moment, knowledge about the economic of the current procurement and production methods is the suya industries are non-existent. Nor is there any adequate scientific information abuo9t the nutritional and health effects of suya meat. No information exists as the health hazards or otherwise which is increased consumption of the product might stand foe the consumption population.<br/>            In fact, in the recent study by Igene and Mohammed (1981), it was reported that 74 percent of those surveyed expressed great dissatisfaction regarding the unhygienic conditions prevailing in the places where suya is processed and dispensed to consumers and 84 percent of those surveyed strongly believe that suya processed and dispensed in unhygienic surroundings could cause serious health bazaar risks to consumers. This is the big image problem of suya amongst the enlightened Nigerians (who incidentally could spend much money on suya but turn their back on the product for sanitary reasons).<br/> THE MAJOR AREAS IN WHICH RESEARCH IS URGENTLY NEEDED INTO MANY ASPECTS OF SUYA PRODUCTION<br/>            Although, technical progress is the key to increasing food production. Information is necessary on research into many aspects of suya production and packaging. Among the major areas in which researchers is urgently needed are<br/>i)          A survey of the economic of suya production.<br/>ii)         Determination of consumer preferences and attitudes to the product.<br/>iii)        Microbiological attributes or characteristics of the health and nutritional importance.<br/>iv)                Level of employment generation and mobility in the industry.<br/>v)                  Detailed scientific analysis and properties of the product in relation to accepted standards in the food and drug trade.<br/>vi)                Research into product development and packaging of improved suya product as well as more efficient techniques of suya processing, preservation  and storage.<br/>What emerge therefore from a resolution of the items (i - vi) which constituted a technological barrier would obviously lead to progress and technological innovation.<br/>1.1         SUYA AS A TRADITIONAL MEAT<br/>suya is a traditional product and any innovation in technology must take cognizance of the nature of the product as such. A structural transformation of the suya industry is what is needed at the moment because the present procedure may not take advantage of available technology for obvious reason.<br/>            In the structural transformation one can imagine a situation whereby entrepreneurs and government could invest in the suya industry, thereby raising production above then primary level as well as taking production “off the streets” with the solely purpose of commercialization. The industry has many technological needs and it is possible indeed likely that some of these needs could only be meet through investment by entrepreneurs or government indigenous technological innovation.<br/>            Suya, being a traditional meat product would require certain technological innovation which could not be imported and which is not already in use in other industries. This is the crux of the matter. For technological innovation to succeed in the suya business, it must not only be efficient but also must conform to the traditional nature of the product to a large extent. It is therefore important that the critical requirement of the industry be conveyed to the engineering community if their efforts are to result in innovation which can succeed in the market place. <br/>            The food industry cannot survive in isolated place from the engineering society / community. Innovation is needed in the development of indigenous machinery and processors to enhance fabrication processing packaging and storage. The way to improve the suya industry therefore rests squarely on a structural transformation or the mode of procurement, processing, packaging and distribution.<br/>1.2              AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>The aims and objectives of this project to<br/>i)          Producing good quality suya meat.<br/> ii)         Packaging of suya meat in different packaging material e.g. foil paper, cellophane and cans to investigate the effect of the various packaging materials or the quality attribute of the suya meat.<br/>iii)        Carrying out method of processing suya by chemical and microbiological analysis in each case<br/><br/>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION ON THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS PACKAGING MATERIAL ON THE QUALITY ATTRIBUTES OF SUYA (MEAT)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION ON THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS PACKAGING MATERIAL ON THE QUALITY ATTRIBUTES OF SUYA (MEAT)", "id": 63}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON AFZELIA AFRICANA (AKPALATA) AND BRACHYSTEGIA SPP FLOUR AS SOUP THICKNER<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The effect of different processing methods on the functional properties of Akpalata (Afzelia Africana) and Achi (Brachystegia spp) flours were investigated.

Those processing methods are influenced by the functional, rhological and cooking qualities of the soup (Anazonwu, 1976).<br/>            Information are required to guide the food processor to choose the processing method that will give the most acceptable product.<br/>Commercial production of tradition thickening agent will help the food engineer in the design choice of appropriate handling equipment and food processing system to be adopted.<br/>The constraint encountered in the use of many thickening agents in soup-making is generally there composition of some anti-nutritional factors which nay induced flatulence and other digestive disorder arising from their consumption.<br/>1.1       PROBLEM OF THE STUDY<br/>People have been dealing on these edible indigenous woody plants (Akpalata and Achi) without knowing the food values, how to process, grow and preserve them.<br/>Meanwhile, the general causes of all these negligent<br/>1.                  Are due to dealing much on imported thickening agent  and as a result over – look the locally made ones.<br/>2.                  Lack of encouragement and lack of skills on how  to prepare them.<br/>3.                  Non-availability of these traditional thickening agents all the year round.<br/>4.                  People having little or no knowledge of some of soup thickeners.<br/>Therefore, in order to solve the above problems, it will be very important to identify, classify and to find out utilization of these plants or seeds.<br/>Again, to inculcate the knowledge into people in order to eliminate those factor like negative attitude, ignorance or non-availability of these thickeners all the year round.<br/>1.2       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.                  To compare the effect of processing on the thickening qualities of (Brachystegia spp) and Afzelia Africana. <br/>2.                  To determine the method of processing which will product the most acceptable soup for the consumers?<br/>3.                  To determine the proximate composition of Brachystegia spp (Achi) and Afzelia Africana (Akpalata).<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON AFZELIA AFRICANA (AKPALATA) AND BRACHYSTEGIA SPP FLOUR AS SOUP THICKNER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON AFZELIA AFRICANA (AKPALATA) AND BRACHYSTEGIA SPP FLOUR AS SOUP THICKNER", "id": 64}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF CITRIC ACID ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ORANGE JUICE (CITRUS SINENSIS)<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The effect of different consecrations of citric acid on the physicochemical properties of orange juice was studied. Four samples of the orange juice were prepared, three of which were added (O.ICA), O.2 (B) and 0.3% (C) Citic acid respectively to the forth sample (D) No preservative was added. They were stored on the shelf for a period of one week and they were analyzed for pH, Pitaminac, dilatable acidity total solids, brix content, specific gravity, total plate count coliform count, fest &amp; mold count and finally sensory evaluation. The results showed that over the days, the vitamin C content reduced from 62 mg to 30mg with the most retention in sample C. The pH of the samples reduced from 3.5. to 2.8 over the storage period with the most decrease in sample D (NP).<br/>            The total solids varied from 5.7% to 8.8% with the lesst solids in sample B (0.2%). The Torix content decreased over the storage period from 12.59 to 12 08 with the lesst decrease in sample D (N.P.). the titratable acidity ranged from 0.37% to 0.03 % within the storage period. The microbial analysis showed that there were growths in the nutriment agar, two yeast growths in the potatoedextrose agar which occurred in sample D and no growth in the McConkay agar. Sensory evaluation revealed that all the samples have similar colour and taste while samples A and D had the best flavour. This analysis shows that the use of citric acid in undiluted juice is not recommended except it is made into a drink.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE:<br/>1.0              Introduction                                                                                                   <br/>CHAPTER TWO:<br/>2.0              Literature Review                                                                                          <br/>2.1       Classification of Citrus Fruits                                                            <br/>2.2       Origin of Orange                                                                                            <br/>2.3       Dainties                                                                                                          <br/>2.4       Anatomy of Orange                                                                           <br/>2.5       Botany of Orange                                                                                          <br/>2.6       Uses of Orange                                                                                              <br/>2.7       Orange Juice                                                                                      <br/>2.8       Spoilage of Orange Juice                                                                               <br/>CHAPTER THREE:<br/>3.0              Materials and Methods                                                                                  <br/>3.1       Source of Samples                                                                                         <br/>3.2       Orange Juice Preparation                                                                               <br/>3.3       Flow Chart for orange juice preparation                                            <br/>3.4       Quality factors in fruits juice                                                             <br/>3.4.1    Ascorbic Acid determination                                                             <br/>3.4.2 Determination of total solids                                                                <br/>3.4.3 Determination of filterable acidity                                                       <br/>3.4.4 Determination of Specific gravity                                                        <br/>3.4.5 P2H Determination                                                                                            <br/>3.4.6 Determination of brix Content                                                             <br/>3.5       Microbiological Analysis                                                                               <br/>3.5.1 Total plate count                                                                                               <br/>3.5.2 Coliform count                                                                                      <br/>3.5.3 Mold and Yeast count                                                                          <br/>3.6       Sensory Evaluation                                                                            <br/>CHAPTER FOUR:<br/>4.0       Results and Discussion                                                                                  <br/>4.1       Summary of physicochemical analysis and<br/>sensory evaluation test                                                                                   <br/>4.2       Discussions                                                                                                    <br/>4.2       Specific gravity                                                                                              <br/>4.3       Ascorbic Acid                                                                                    <br/> CHAPTER FIVE:<br/>Conclusion and Recommendation                                                                 <br/>References                                                                                                                 <br/>Appendices                                                                                                    <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>            Oranges, demons, grape fruit and limes are the fruits of trees belonging to the citrus geaus. The sweet orange (citrus sinensis) is the most widely grown of the citrus trees and the fruits are either eaten fresh or made into orange juice. The edible portion is refereed to as the endocarp and consists of a series of segments carpels or loculs which contain the thin walled juice vesides surrounding the endocarp is the peel which comprises of 20-50% of the weight of the weight of the fruit and consists of the flavedo and the albeds (ihekoronye and Ngoddy,1985). The flavedo or outer peel is a layer of tissue underlying the epidermis and contains the chloroplast and oilsacs. The albedo or inner peel is a layer of spongy white tissue which is connected to the core and supplies the water and nutrient from the tree which are necessary for the fruit growth and development.<br/>                        The proximate composition of the edible portion of the orange fruit is<br/>            Water  - 86%<br/>Protein – 0.6%<br/>Fat  - 0.1%<br/>Micronutrients per 100g<br/>Calcium – 24mg<br/>Iron – 0.3.mg<br/>Vit. A  - 120mg<br/>Thiamin – 0.06mg<br/>Riboflavin – 0.02mg<br/>Niscia – 0.1.mg<br/>Ascorbic Acid – 36mg (source: Ihekoronge &amp; Ngoddy 1985).<br/>            The colour of fruits when unripe is greatly influenced by the presence of chlorophyll, caroteaoids and anthocycanins. (Enwere 1998). Due to its high moisture content, fruits are susceptible to spoilage and are also highly perishable. Orange fruits are seasonal and hence in order to preserve them, they are processed into various food products such as juices, squashes, satadinaine etc.<br/>            Fruit juice is the liquid pressed by pressure or other mechanical means from the edible portion of the fruit (Simmond 1984). According to Faye (1973) orange juice was defined as the unfermented juice of mature oranges of the citrus sineasis specie. Fruit juices serve as part of meals and they aid in the digestion of human diet. They supply minerals and vitamins in addition to energy when consumed but they deteriorate over a long storage period unless they are preserved by the addition of chemicals and by the application of heat.<br/>            Preservatives are food additives added to foods with the intention of arresting or retarding the deterioration of the food. Preservation involved the protection of food from the deterioration of microorganisms, enzymes and oxidation. This can be achieved by the application of heat and addition of chemical preservatives (Arnold 1982).<br/>            Preservatives include anti-ripening agents, anti-oxidants, antimicrobial agents and sprouting inhibitors. They may be added intentionally to food or may appear in foods as a result of pre – processing treatments, processing and storage (Ihekornye and Ngoddy, 1985).<br/>            The addition of chemical preservatives is governed by government departments which must give approval before it is permitted for use. In General it should not adversely affect the nutritive value of food.<br/>            Preservatives used in food include benzoic acid, ascorbic acid, vinegar, propanoic acid, citric acid etc. Although their limits in terms of individual specified preservatives, they may also be incorporated into the foods as permitted salts like sodium benzoate (Harold etal, 1992). Also the use of citric acid has been recognized by all major national and international food regulatory agencies as a good preservative for food and beverages.<br/>            The use of citric acid in fruit juices like pineapple juice has been found to give a positive result but in this work, it is aimed at investigating the effect of the different concentrations of citric acid on come physicochemical properties of orange juice. <br/> <br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF CITRIC ACID ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ORANGE JUICE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF CITRIC ACID ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ORANGE JUICE", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROMOTE COMPOSITION OF PLEUROTUS TUBERRCOGININ FROM ENUGU AREA.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Proximate analysis of Pleurotus tuberregium was determined to ascertain its nutritional composition. the sample was analysed for its  moisture, crude fibre, ash, fat, protein and carbohydrate content.

The morphor logical differentiation of plenntus tuberregium is limited. It forms hyphen and develop each type depending on the growth condition. The diameter of the hyphen is usually 5NM. The hyphen is either without septate or has a cellular morphology by septate hyphae. The mass of hyphae represent the mycellium (Stolp, 1988).<br/>plenntus tuberregium posses  rigid cell wall. It does not posses chlorophyll and it has a chemoorganotrophic metabolism. It belongs to the group of fungi called basidiomycetes and are the most developed fungi. They produce basidia containing the four basidiospores. The mycellium consist of septate hyphen.<br/>            However, plenntus tuberregium supplies the major food types. Protein, carbohydrates, fat and oil as well as minerals (OSO, 1977). It is known to be tastier than meat, fish or seed plant proteins. People who abstain from meat for religious reasons have greater choice of plant protein and superior alternative taste in plenntus tuberregium. The fruiting body as well as sclerotigl mass is more commercially<br/>Demanded and yet minimally exploited.<br/>            Several indigenous knowledge and uses of plenntus tuberregium point to the tremendous potential of this biological resource.<br/>(a)                As a food stablizer / thickening agent<br/>(b)               As binding agent.<br/>(c)                As a rich source of foric acid for children and pregnant women.<br/>(d)               As a rich source of calcium for the bones of aging men and women as well as treatment for boils constipation and dental caries (Oso, 1977).<br/>A visit tot he market place any where in Igbo land, would show this commodity being processed in the soup condiment section. The sclerotia mass is scrapped and ground with curcurbita (Melon seeds). This causes swelling and bulking of the soup. A local snacks called “Ogbalotic” is prepared from Curcurbita Pepo and plenntus tuberregium it is normally tied in a leaf of cola gigantea and boiled which yields a well known health and energy sustaining snacks. It is cherished till today in the villages. Travelers and farm workers need only this and large volume of water to sustain them for days.<br/>This taxanomic position of plenntus tuberregium has been problematic because it produces eathery fruit bodies and posses of dogmatic hyphen system with interracially skeletal hyphae, many prenous authorities placed it in either panus or lentinus (Corner, 1981, Peyler, 1983).<br/>plenntus tuberregium has been eaten since classical times (Corner, 1981, Nwokolo 1987, and Okhuoya, et al, 1998). The question of sustainability of plenntus tuberregium is guareur teed being a biological resources, the technology has been developed for massive production (Okhuoya et al 1998). Other added advantages include the fact that substrate for cultivation of plenntus tuberregium is waste such as rice straw, wood dust. Sunnlight is not required so that caves and shades could maximally produced plenntus tuberregium industrially.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The present study is to ascertain t he nutritional composition of plenntus tuberregium.<br/><br/>\n\nPROMOTE COMPOSITION OF PLEUROTUS TUBERRCOGININ <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROMOTE COMPOSITION OF PLEUROTUS TUBERRCOGININ ", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FOOD SECURITY AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPLICATION FOR HOME ECONOMICS <br/>EDUCATION IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS OF EDO STATE.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This research work explored the concept of food security and its relationship to national development studies indicate that food security, which is the availability of adequate meals for man’s consumption as he desires, is an essential ingredient for the development of any nation.

It primarily that human body requires for the transmission of food borne disease and toxicants, which invariably threatens public health. <br/>Disease caused by contraindicated food constitutes one of the most wide, spread and worrisome health problems of the contemporary world. It has personal, national and global socio – economic consequence. As the saying goes a healthy nation is a prosperous nation. <br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>Food security in a nation is expected to contribute in our small way to transformation the nations economy and induce rapid development.       <br/>            Baid (1999), commented that lack of food security in any nation will not only slow down the nations development, but will seriously disrupt a carefully, planned national development programmed.<br/>Therefore the statement of the problem is that, could lack of adequate food supply be responsible for the unrest and constant rioting and agitation almost the labour force and youths in Nigeria, which is a factor that hinders national development? Number of families suffering in poverty and starvation due to the fact that there is no enough provision for food availability, accessibility and nutritional discrimination analysis?     <br/>In today’s world where the global economy is dominated by a few large national economics grouping, the smaller nations are finding it difficult to complete, as well as to harness adequate resources for their development this undoubtedly must be the plight of Nigeria. So what could be done to help this situation? Education could be the answer, because knowledge present is ignorance banished.   <br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>Sizer and Whiney (2000) stated that in chronic starvation lie the frustration, tension and envy of masses of people who will ultimately resort to violence. Thy therefore take solace in looting, fighting, drugging, robbery and burning of houses. <br/>            Therefore the purpose of the study is aims at educating the consumer on the importance of a nation being food secured and how to improve household food security.   <br/>To enable the consumers and bodies governing food resolutions engage in regular talks on the importance of food security to individuals, families, the community and the nation as a whole through regular classroom teaching, mass media and community meeting. <br/>To enable the government to put more fund and machinery into agriculture.   <br/>SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY <br/>            This research works is important to individuals of all categories. <br/>To enable the individual to acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes require knowing their right as consumers and descern or judge information and consuming intelligently within their means or available resources. <br/>To provide the necessary information about the food they buy e.g. expiry dates, weight, brand names, cost and where to purchase them.  <br/>It is also importance to the government do that it will enable the government to plan ahead in case there is food scarcity <br/>RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>Have you heard of the word food security? <br/>Is lack of storage facilities a problem to food security? <br/>Do you secure your food for future purpose? <br/>Do consumers have right on proper practice of food? <br/>Does food availability eliminate poverty? <br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>FOOD: This is any substance that people or animals eat or drink for maintains of life and growth.  <br/>SECURITY: Freedom or protection from danger or worthy. <br/>AVAILABILITY: Things that can be used to obtain or use to achieve something. <br/>ACCESSIBILITY: Means things that can be reached, the opportunity or right to use. <br/>PRESERVATION: Means method of preventing food deterioration. <br/>ADDICTIVES: Means any substance including any source of radiation expected to result that substance or its bye products becoming a part of its characteristics. <br/>CLEANLINESS: This means the application of good sanitary practice in the handling of food, which reduce the incidence of spoilage. <br/>NUTRITION: Means the scientific study of food and its utilization in the body. <br/>POVERTY: The state of being poor.  <br/>UTILIZATION: The process of using ones ability to achieve much from little.<br/>  <br/><br/><br/>\n\nFOOD SECURITY AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPLICATION FOR HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FOOD SECURITY AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPLICATION FOR HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS OF EDO STATE", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL AND ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES OF CULINARY HERBS AND LOCAL SPIES<br/>PIPE GUIEENSE (UZIZA) XYLPIA AETHPICA (UDA)<br/>MONODORA MYRISTICA (EHURU) TETRAPELURA TETRAPTERA (OSHOSHO)<br/>Abstract</b><br/>a comparative study was done on the physico-chemical and antioxidant properties of some culinary herbs and local spices.

Extraction of the Oleorasin from the spices and soybean oil were done using soxhlet extraction unit with hexane as solvent. Imi of each of the Oleorasin samples of the spices was pipette into 100ml of soybean oil into four different test tubes labeled A,B, C and D. sample E contains 100ml of soybean oil with 150ppm of Butylated Hydroxyl toluene while the untreated soybean oil (sample F) was used as the control. The test-tube were shaked, plugged with cottonwood and kept at room temperature in a rack. The peroxide value of the sample were monitored for tightly for eight weeks, the thiobarbituric acid 9TBA) value were also determined on the tenth and twelfth weeks respectively. The peroxide value of the sample for the eighth week were recorded as follows: A (10), B (8) C (8), D (11), E (10) and F (22) respectively. From these results, it shows that all the spices were below the range of detectable rancidity. (i.e. between 20 to 40m Eg/kg). the thiobarbituric aid (TBA) value were recorded, for the twelfth week as follows: A  (0.033), B (0.005),  C (0.004), D (0.046), E (0.776) and F (2.503) respectively.

With modernization and the development of patent medicines, the use of natural cures and elixirs decrease in popularity.<br/>Nowadays, disillusionment with synthetic drugs, artificial additives and their possible sides effects has given great rise in popularity to many natural products, be it for culinary, medical or cosmetics purposes. In line with the world wide trend for eco-consciousness, the popularity of natural cosmetic purposes. In line with the world wide trend for eco-consciousness, the popularity of natural cosmetic products, such as those sold in red earth and the body shop, attests to the current trend (Broadhurt CL, 2000).<br/>Spices are defined as those aromatic plants and their parts, fresh or dried, whole or ground, that are primarily used to impart flavour and fragrances to foods and drink (Prosea 1986). The term is used in a wide sense and includes the culinary herbs. Spices are indispensable in the culinary art, used to create dishes that reflect the history, the culture and the geography of a country. Well-known examples are  curry powder, housing live five spices powder) Pizza herbs and fines herbs (Polansky mm, 2000) spices oils and spice oleoresins are also indispensable in the food and beverages manufacturing industry, the perfumery and cosmetic industry and the pharmaceutical industry. Some spices and derivative possess antioxidant and antibiotic properties, which has increased interest in the commercial exploitation of aromatic plants for food preservation and crop protection with the growing demand natural and organic products and the increasing clamour to dispense with synthetic flavours and artificial food colouring, the future for spices seems bright.<br/>According to Pearson 1976 herbs and spices consist of the dried leaves, flowers, buds fruits, seeds, bark or rhizomes of various plants. They are incorporated in foods only in small amounts but they make important contributions towards the odour and flavour due to the presence of the volatile oil 9essentail oil) and fixed oil, local examples include Piper guineense  (Uzuza), Xylopia gethiopica  (uda), Mondora myristica (Ehuru, Tretaphleura tetraptra  (Oshsho) and capsicum frutescens (Ose Nsukka).<br/>An antioxidant is defined as any substance which is capable of delaying, retarding or preventing the development in food of rancidity or other flavour deterioration due to oxidation,. Antioxidant are only one means of fending packing or there are others such as vacuum packaging or packing under an inert gas to exclude oxygen and refrigeration, freezing, both of which greatly reduce the rate of authorization. Furthermore, it is seldom realized how little oxygen is need to initiate and maintain the oxidation process or how difficult and expensive it can be to remove the last traces of air from a product.  For these reasons it is quite common to combine the use of antioxidants with inert gas packing using an antioxidant should be seen as one of several measures available, but used properly, it is generally effective, easily applied and inexpensive.<br/>The prime justification for using an antioxidant is one of need an antioxidant can extend the shelf-life of a food, reducing wastage and complaints, it can reduce nutritional losses (oil soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A, are  prone to oxidation)) and a very important point for the food technologist, it can widen the range of fat which can be used.  Using an antioxidant enables the food manufacturer to smooth out differences in the stability of fats/oils and renders the food product less specific in terms of ingredient requirements. This offers more scope for cost control without jeopardizing the product quality of shelf-life,  without an effective antioxidant, lard for instance, would find far fewer uses.<br/>Antioxidants serve two principle functions.<br/>1.         They break the oxidation chain by containing the free radicals or acting as hydrogen donor.<br/>2.         They direct the breakdown of peroxides into stable substances that do not promote further oxidation (Ihekornye and Ngoddy 1985).<br/>An ideal antioxidant meets the following demands:<br/>1.                  Safe in use.<br/>2.                  Should impart no odour, flavour or colour.<br/>3.                  Effective of low concentration.<br/>4.                  Should be easy to incorporate<br/>5.                  Should survive cooking process.<br/>6.                  Should be available at now cost-in-use.<br/>(Allen and Haninlton, 1989), John and Peterson, (1974), summarized the general used and properties of herbs and spices as the ability to:-<br/>1.                  Give flavour to a flavourable base.<br/>2.                  Impart a different flavour character to the basic product.<br/>3.                  Disguise objectionable intrinsic flavour and boost intrinsic flavour which would otherwise be too weak.<br/>According to Ikekornye and Ngoddy, (1985) the effectiveness and optimal utilization of a spice for its various uses depends on certain factors such as method of growing, harvesting sorting, storage and ultimately processing techniques.<br/>Traditionally, spices are sued to prepared food for nursing mothers, it is believed to be very useful in cleaning the uteral lining after child birth. It is believed to have contract the womb to its normal size after birth. It is used in preparing native concoction for the treatment of convulsion and “jedi-jedi” in infant, a diseases which gives rise to greenish stool, stomach upset and inflamed.  It is generally used in treating some minor ailment such as stomach upset, headaches, malaria, bronchitis and many others (Uba, 1997).<br/>1.1       OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT<br/>Herbs and spices are known to be incorporated in food only in small amounts but they make important contributions towards the odour and flavour due to the presence of the volatile oil (essential oil) and fixed oil and little or on work has been done on most local culinary herbs and spices. The aim of this project is to extract these oleoresin and essential oils in herbs and spices that impart flavours and fragrances present for the manufacture of foods, beverages, perfumery, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, and to determine the antioxidant properties of these local spices and herbs for food products, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL AND ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES OF CULINARY HERBS AND LOCAL SPIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL AND ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES OF CULINARY HERBS AND LOCAL SPIES", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>USE OF COMPOSITE FLOUR BLENDS FOR BISCUIT MAKING (PEANUT/CASSAVA FLOUR)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Digestive and gingerroot biscuits were produced from composite flour blends – cassava flour, peanut butter, wheat flour and ginger flavour in different ratio mix digestive biscuit – (50 : 50; 10 : 30 : 60 and 10 : 90 ), Ginger biscuit (10 : 25 : 60 : 5, 10 : 85 and 50 : 45 : 5) respectively.

Flour confectionery describes a large range of flour based goods other than bread manufactured from batter sponge or dough by mixing, kneading and may be created by fermentation, chemical or other means resulting in puff/flaky short or sweet product. Those that have their moisture content reduced to make them exceptionally brittle or crops are generally regarded as biscuits. (Okaka, 1997)<br/>        The word biscuit come from the Latin word Biscuit meaning twice cooked, baking at high temperature followed by drying at lower temperature (Okaka, 1997). The term biscuit and cookie are synonymous. The American Encyclopedia described biscuit as a form of bread baking soda as a raising agent rather than yeast.<br/>        Biscuit are a common feature of southern us cousine which can be served as a side dish with meal or as a breakfast item. Biscuit is also said to be essentially bakery confectionery dried down to low moisture content name derived from Latin word for twice cooked, made from soft flour, mostly rich in fat and sugar and consequently of high energy content of 420 to 510kcal per 100g they are cherished by people of all ages and used at different meals and occasions as part of breakfast, snacks etc. they are eaten with butter and jam or jelly or as a part of a dish called “Biscuit and gravy”. Biscuits are also eaten covered in pizza sauce and cheese. Many varieties exist, both sweet and savoulry often produced in industrial quantities by large food companies. Sweet biscuit are commonly eaten as snack and may contain chocolate fruit, jam or nuts (peanuts). Savoury biscuits are plainer and commonly eaten with cheese following a meal<br/>        The simplest form of biscuit is a mixture of flour and water but may contain fat sugar and other ingredients mixed together into a dough which is rested for a period, passed between rollers to make a sheet. The sheet is then stamped out baked, cooled and packaged. Biscuits are generally made from wheat flour but according to the topic of this project, “use of composite blends for biscuit making”. Some raw materials other than wheat have to be used in producing the flour for the biscuits. In order to get a superior product especially for crackers, the following factors are of importance – choice of flour for sponge and dough, selection of fermentation environment and the baking conditions. It is therefore necessary to search for raw materials that give flour of light quality.<br/>        Biscuits are classified based on their degree of enrichment and processing or by the method adopted in shaping them. Based on the enrichment criterion are hard dough, soft dough and batter biscuit respectively. (Okaka; 1997). Soft wheat is used in making flour for most biscuit and the softness is de to lower protein (gluten) content when compared with the hard wheat. Based on this fact, raw materials are chosen from other legumes such as Peanut and Roots such as cassava. Since they contain protein though in lesser quantity and quality.<br/>        Peanuts are one of the leading agricultural crops of the world and belong to the family leguminous. It is a source of edible oil and plant protein. The characteristic feature of legume seed protein is that they are markedly deficient in methionine and tryptophan. Infact, methioine is t he first limiting essential amino acid in almost all the legume grains. Peanuts contain about 26% to 35% protein with the peanut meal containing a large amount of nutritionally essential amino – acid. The seeds are nutritional and contain vitamin E, Niacin, folacin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, riboflavin, thiamine, potassium etc (Ogbo; 2002). Peanut also contain a significant load of  resveratrol, a strong antioxidant which inhibit lipid peroxidation of low – density lipoprotein (LOL), prevents the cytotoxicity of oxidized (LDL) and protects cells  against lipid peroxidation. Hydrophilic aid lipophilic properties, it can as well provide more effective protection than other well known antioxidations such as vitamin C and E.<br/>Peanut is used for different purposes, food (raw, roasted or b oiled, cooking oil), animal feed and industrial raw material. There are four varieties of peanut:- Virginia, Peruvian runner, Valencia and Spanish.<br/>Cassava, one of the raw materials is an indigenous and stable food of millions of Nigerian people. The few misconceptions related to cassava especially with regard to its low nutritional value and its toxicity have been effectively challenged by National ad International Research Institutions. National Institutions like University of Agriculture Umedike in Umuahia who have succeeded in producing many Tropical Manioc Selection (TMS) varieties with an added advantage of low cyanide.<br/>Despite the obvious advantages of cassava like being easily propagated by stem cutting. Relatively high yielder and excellent source of calories, cassava remained for some time a neglected crop in agricultural research and development activities to an extent not commensurate with its importance as food. However, some developments within the past 15 years have enhanced interest in the crop and research priority has been given to research on its improvement, increased production and utilization.<br/>First, the International Society for Tropical Root and Tubers Crops was founded in 1967 to encourage research, increased production and utilization and exchange of information on tropical root and tuber crops including cassava yams, sweet potatoes and avoids. Second, among the International Institutions (International Institute for Tropical Agriculture – IITA – in Nigeria, and he International Centre for Tropical Agriculture – CIAT in Colombia) that have programmes giving high priority to research on the improvement, production systems, storage and utilization of cassava and other related training.  Roots and Tubers Expansion Programme (RTEP was also put in place to develop and source for alternative uses of cassava as industrial raw material and create enabling market environment. High Quality unfermented flour”, including fortified cassava flours are now more accessible because of the improved processing and technological methods for processing cassava. These technologies can be used to produce particle / whole substitute for wheat flour from 540 100 percent in bakery and confectionery products such as biscuit, chin-chin etc. and some of these snacks have no noticeable change in texture, flavour, aroma nor colour.<br/>The cassava flour is fortified with peanut butter in this project because of its high protein content, vitamins like vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant. The manufacture of good biscuit therefore depends mostly on the selection of correct flour for each type ad applying processed which are compatible such processes a re mixing, accretion and fermentation, laminating, baking and cooling (Okaka, 1997:- p. 155). <br/> 1.2    AIM / PURPOSE <br/>As everybody including the federal government is putting effort together to induce foreign exchange conservation by means of local material utilization. It has been decided to carryout some work on cassava and peanut blend in order to use them as substitute for imported wheat in making flours for biscuit manufacture. Peanut butter is also added to complement the necessary amino acids.<br/>The result of research carried out and test conducted by Roots and Tubers Expansion Programme show that it is possible to produce acceptable biscuits of comparable standard to that of wheat flour biscuits using composite flours from the above named legume and Roots.<br/>Wheat whose flour is the major material used for biscuit manufactures in most countries of the world traditionally employ wheat for biscuits and similar products. Although wheat flour is generally employed as the basic ingredients in biscuit manufacture. Wheat is uniformly grown all over the world and being a temperature crop, it only grows under certain climatic conditions. Consequently, biscuit manufacture industries in countries where wheat does not grow have to import the grain or the flour.<br/>In countries, Nigeria, to be precise, wheat is cultivated though not in appreciable quantity due to climate conditions, a large sum of foreign exchange is spent on importation especially with the present rate of growth of biscuit and allied industries in Nigeria (Federal Office of Statistics, Lagos Nigeria). There are a lot of industries (confectionery) although the date is not yet readily available, all based on wheat flour. Foreign exchange spend as at 1982 are huge amount of money. Therefore success in this trend of supplementation will save a huge sum of money being spend annually on wheat importation and could now be utilized to improve other sector of the country’s economy.<br/>The aim of this project work therefore is to reduce or stop totally the extensive importation of wheat, thereby broaden the food base of Nigerians. The commercial and industrial implication will bring economic benefits to all biscuit consumers by making the product more readily available. Supplementation of imported wheat flour with cassava flour will save millions of naira in foreign exchange.<br/>It is also estimated that the use of these composite blends (cassava flour and peanut butter) will result in the production of biscuits that are less expensive and highly nutritive than those produced before.<br/>It will also create new employment opportunities as well as economic self-reliance both at the industrial and house – hold level of cassava processors.<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nUSE OF COMPOSITE FLOUR BLENDS FOR BISCUIT MAKING (PEANUT/CASSAVA FLOUR)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " USE OF COMPOSITE FLOUR BLENDS FOR BISCUIT MAKING (PEANUT/CASSAVA FLOUR)", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PRODUCTION AND DETERMINATION OF FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF PLANATAIN FLOUR<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>        Plantains (Musa epp) are important staple foods, which make substantial contribution of the nutrition and economy of millions of people through the developing world and are grown in 720 countries.  The gross value of plantain production in sub-saharan Africa extent that of several other main food crops, such as maize, rice cassava and sweet potato.      They are considered the fouth important global food commodity after rice, milk and wheat in terms of gross value of production and provide more than 25% of the carbohydrates for approximately 70 million people in sub-sharan Africa.      Plantain flour production involves procurement of matured plantain, feeling, chipping, drying, milling and packaging, plantain is an important source of carbohydrate, the starch fat and total sugars in plantain are adequate for the manufacture of plantain biscuit.         Blanding considerably reduce the emulsion capacity and viscosity, while built density, water and oil absorption capacities were increased by blanding.  Plantain could also be used as an emulsifier and thickner in food system. Plantain flour is a cheap source of iron, protein and vitamin A and the product can be marketed.  <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>Plantain is a common name for a herbaceous plants of the genus Dusa, it was classified formally as Musa Acuminata, Musa Balbisoana or Hybrids Musa Acuminataz Balbisoana depending on their genomic constitution.  (balell John in 2000) gare the archaic scientific name Musa paradisiacal which is no longer used,.  Most plantain come from the hybrid AAB and ABB cultirar group all members of the genus.  Musa are indigenous to tropical regions of South east Asia and Oceania including the making Archipelago. (Brian and Allan 1985).  <br/>Plantains are a major staple food in equantoria Africa and andian region.  Their attractiveness as food is that they fruit all year round making them more reliable all season.  This is particularly important for communities living in mountains or forests with Inadequate food storage, preservation and transportation, this tends to be frimer and lower in sugar content than desert, plantains are cooked or otherwise processed and are used either when green or unripe land therefore starchy or overripe and therefore sweet (William 1979) stated that an average plantain has about 220 calories and is a good source of poxassium and dietary fibre.  (Murray Tossler 1987).<br/>Plantains is a perennial plant that consist of a roseete of basal leaves and one or more flowering stalks the basal leaves are up to “10 long and ¾ across”, “but more commonly about half this size the tenth most important staple food that feed the world. (Uwaegbufe 1996) plantains are treated in much as the same way as potatoes and with a similar neutral flavour and texture when this unripe fruit is looked by steaming boiling or trying.  It (plantain) fruits all year round which making the crop a reliable all season  staple, food, particularly in developing countries with inadequate food storage, preservation and transportation technologies, in Africa plantains provide more than 25 percent of the carbohydrate requirement for over 70 million people.  Plantain can be eaten raw as well.  As it ripen it becomes sweeter and changes colour from green to yellow to black, green plantain are firm and starchy and they resemble potatoes in flavour.  UNCST 2007) the yellow plantains are softer and starchy, but sweet.  Extremely ripe plantains have softer deep yellow pulp that is much sweeter than the earlier stages of ripeness. (Archy 1987).<br/>Plantains in the yellow to black stages can be used in sweet dishes steam-looked plantains are considered a nutritious food for infants and the elderly.  A ripe plantain is used as food for infants at wearing.  Ut is mashed with a pinch of salt and is believed to be more easily digestible (FAOSTAT 2011).  Plantains are also dried and grouped into flour it is an important food stuff that constitute, water of about 1062%, proteins 55%, Fat 1.15%.  Carbohydrates 81.6% and Ash 3.01%.  Dried plantain provider is mixed with a little fennel seed powder and boiled either in milk or water to feed small children till they age of 1yr. (Oke 1998) stated that in Southern parts of Indian Roots and tubers, plantains, and bananas is good for human nutrion.<br/>        Plantain has been a good source of food and known to different countries with different names like, in Ivory Coast where plantains are dishes when fried with Onion and tomato sauce and serve to eat.  It is called ALOCO.  It is also used for a dish called Magu in Dominican Republic, where the green plantains are peeled smashed with hot water and boiled then served with sauce.  In West Africa plantains are served for eating with stew or beans or any food when fried it is known as BODO (Dough-Bough) (Forcylth 1988).  Plantains are also known as fufu De plantan a popular dish in Cuba where the plantains are boiled and mixed with chicken stock and sauce and the served.  Plantains can also be fried twice and served as a side appetizer or snack in countries like Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama.  It is known as potacones.  The popular known food Boli is usually made in Nigeria, whereby plaintain is roacted and eaten with red oil sauce.  (Adnan and Muyalia 1984).<br/> AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>(i)                  To produce plantain flour <br/>(ii)                 To determine the functional properties of plantain flour.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nPRODUCTION AND DETERMINATION OF FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF PLANATAIN FLOUR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION AND DETERMINATION OF FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF PLANATAIN FLOUR", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ISOLATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE FROM ON PALM WINE<br/>(ELAELS GUINNEENSIS) AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE OF PROOFING DURING BREAD MAKING<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated from the fermenting sap of flaeis guinneensis.

It could be allowed to ferment and subsequently distilled into gin it could also be used for the leavening of dough for bread making ( Somiari and Udoh 1993).<br/>The use of palm wine and as a leavening agent for dough is attributed to the presence of a yeast strain contained in the palm sap. This yeast strain is saccharomyces cerevisiaem or baking yeast is called in the bakery industry.<br/>Palm wine when fresh, tastes like ginger bear and can be used as like yeast ( Irvine 1961). Initially, the sap is sweet, dirty brown in colour. The fermentation process results in the sap becoming milky white in appearance. This is due to the presence of large number of fermenting bacteria and yeast.<br/>Fermentation occurs between 36 – 38 hr period during which PH of sap falls from 7.0 –7.2 to &lt; 4. (Jay 1986).<br/> 1.2    COMPOSITION OF PALM WINE <br/>Palm wine has the average alcoholic content of 2.00 percent to 4. 69 percent. The sugary syrup, which is dirty brown in colour contains about 10 – 12 % sugar mainly sucrose.<br/>Studies made by faparusi et al1986 found the following genera of bacteria to be the most predominant in finished produced Lactobacillus, Micrococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Acetobacter. The predominate yeast found are Saccharomyces  and Candida spp with the former being the more common.<br/> 1.3    YEAST (saccharomyces cerevisiae)<br/>Yeast is a unicellular micro-organism and fungus type. It makes possible many of the products made by bakers. This is because various types of bread and certain other bakery precuts are leavened (raised) by yeast. Many of them produce ethanol and carbon dioxide as waste products of their metabolism. They are therefore useful in the food industry for fermentation and aeration.<br/>Yeast usually used in the temperate region for baking are carefully selected strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is a simple chlorophyll – free plant which feeds on sugar in the batter or dough to produce carbon dioxide (Kotshever 1980). By enzyme action, it converts fermentable sugars and some of the starch present in the dough into carbon-dioxide gas and alcohol and provides desirable controlled fermentation (Sultan 1982).<br/>The discovery of the use of yeast to leaven bread centuries ago lead to the growth of bakery industry. Bakers used brewers yeast till about 80 –1000 years ago due to its performance in the bakery which was low and variable. The isolation of a special yeast strain which possessed the desired characteristic needed, brought about revolutionary changes in the bakery industry. This strain is known as saccharomyces cerevisiae or otherwise “ bakers” yeast in the form of cakes of compressed fresh yeast cell, with moisture content of about 70%.<br/> NUTRITION AND GENERATION <br/>Since the yeast cell is a living organism, it has numerous nutritional needs and it is only if these are met that it will grow vigorously and produce a large quantity of carbon dioxide. Food and moisture are needed for this growth.<br/>Saccharomyces cerevisiae  differs from other yeast species. It has more aerobic growth habit, maximum yielding capability stability during storage. It is usually derived from special selection of fast growing (short generation time) naturally occurring yeast strains ( Oyawoye and Bassey 1997) .<br/>The plant grow best at the temkperature between 80 – 900 cooler temperatures retards their growth and a temperature as high as 1110 F kills the plant within an hour 1400 F destroy them within 5 minutes.<br/> IMPORTANCE OF BAKERS YEAST<br/>This principle involved in dough leavening is based on the utilization of the carbohydrate by the ‘bakers’ yeas to give out carbon dioxide entrapped in the dough. As the yeast multiply in the dough, fermenting at room temperature. More and more carbon-dioxide is produced and the dough expanse because of the pressure of gas. This yeast activity is destroyed during baking at the temperature of 1400 F.<br/>        Bakers yeast is useful chiefly in three different ways.<br/>1.           TESTURE FORMATION: They produce carbon dioxides gas, which leavens or raises the dough, giving the bread the desired loose porous texture.<br/>2.           INCREASE OF DOUGH VOLUME: The use of bakers yest as a leavening agent help to achieve great great increase in volume and make a wide variety of baked products. This means that it is no longer a necessity to rely on egg white foam to encompass enough air  <br/>1                 FLAVOUR PRODUCTION: Bakers yeast is reported to contribute to the flavour of bread and other yeast leavened products. During dough fermentation, many secondary metabolites such as ketones, higher alcohols,  organic acids, aldehydes, and esters are produced by the yeast. Some of these alcohols escape during baking. Others react with one another and with other compounds found in the dough to form a new and more complex flavour compounds. The resultant flavour diffuses into the crumb of baked bread ( Graw – hill 1971).<br/> 1.4    BREAD <br/>Bread is food produced by mixing flour with water and yeast and baking in an oven ( Hornby 1995). In some cases, other ingredients such as eggs, butter, milk and sugar are added basically to augment its nutritional value. Like all other foods produced from cereals, bread is eaten primarily as a cheap source of energy. It contains valuable amount of protein, iron and vitamins flour is the basic ingredient in the production of bakery goods. This is because of its gluten. The unique properties of wheat protein, glademin and can prdice bread dough of the strength and elasticity required to produce low density of bread of desired texture and flavour (Ihekoronye and Ngoddy 1985). The elasticity of gluten retains the gas and supports the structure of the loaf.<br/>The dough is made by mixing together the flour, water, yeast, salt and other additions ingredients. Dough raising is the act of producing carbon dioxide in the dough. This is a results of yeast cell saccharomyces cerevisiae incorporated into the dough, and this helps in the puffing up of the dough during the process of bread making.<br/>Bread is baked at the temperature of 2500 - 2600 for a period of 30 –50 minutes. During baking, the mixtures (dough) are expanded by air, steam or carbon dioxide. The proteins present (gluten) coagulates and the starch takes on water and sets (gelatinizes). The coagulated proteins and gelatinized starches give baked product their structure and colour ( Kotschevar and Lunderg 1970).<br/>Bread production is of vital importance as its is a product which is not liable to seasonal fluctuation and can be made from varieties of flour.<br/>In this work, palm wine was selected as a medium for the isolation of saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of bakers yeast. This is due to ability of the yeast cells present in the palm sap to produce alcohol ( ethanol) and carbon dioxide form the fermentable sugar in the palm juice.<br/>Past work showed that other yeast strains are present in which wine apart from saccharomyces cerevisiae which have the desired characteristics of the bakers yeast. These other strains are generally referred to as “ wild yeast” ( Frazier and Hoff 1988).<br/>The presence of this “ Wild yeast “ as well as mold and bacterial flora limits the direct use of palm wine for bread production. Those loaves produced with 90% palm wine dreg developed sour – taste and pronounced palm wine flavour and were unacceptable after 3days thereby limiting leavening , for this reason, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which occur naturally in palm wine and have the desirable characteristics to the bakers yeast is isolated, propagated and used as pure culture for dough fermentation.<br/>Somiari, and Udoh (1993) worked on the isolation of yeast from palm wine using malt extract agar ( MEA DIFCO) for the leavening of the dough.<br/> 1.4.1 AIMS AND OBJECCTIVES <br/>1.           To isolate the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae from palm wine for the production of bakers yeast whose performance can compete favourably with commercial bakers yeast in bread production.<br/>2.           To embark on bread production with locally sourced yeast rather than commercial bakers’ yeast.<br/>3.           To determine the optimum proofing temperature for the isolated yeast during bread production <br/> <br/> <br/><br/>\n\nISOLATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE FROM ON PALM WINE (ELAELS GUINNEENSIS) AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE OF PROOFING DURING BREAD MAKING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE FROM ON PALM WINE (ELAELS GUINNEENSIS) AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE OF PROOFING DURING BREAD MAKING", "id": 71}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECT OF STEEPING PERIOD ON YIELD AND ACCEPTABILITY OF STARCH EXTRACTED FROM SORGHUM<br/>(SORGHUM BICOLOR, WHITE VARIETY AND RED VARIETY)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> Starch was extracted from two varieties of sorghum bicolor grains (white and red varieties) steeped for 6, 8 and 12 hours by wet milling method, the starch samples were analysed for yield, functional properties and overall acceptability. The yield of the white variety ranged from 0.45 – 0.70kg and the red variety was 0.40 – 0.50kg.

(Awan and Okaka, 1983). <br/>Starch is the major storage form of carbohydrate in sorghum and millets. It consists of amylopectin, a branched – chain polymer of glucose, and amylose, a straight chain polymer (FAO, 1992).<br/>        The digestibility of the starch, which depends on hydrolysis by pancreatic enzymes, determines the available energy content of cereal grain. Processing of the grain by methods such as steaming, pressure cooking, flaking, puffing or Micronesian of the starch increases the digestibility of sorghum starch.<br/>        This has been attributed to a release of starch granules from the protein matrix rendering t hem more susceptible to enzymatic digestion (FAO, 1992).<br/>        When starch is heated in water (moist heat) it will produce a gel – an important property needed in the thickening of gravies, sauces, in the baking of bread and production of custards (Awan and Okaka, 1983).<br/>        The physico-chemical properties of the starch affect the textural characteristics of the food preparations made from the grain.<br/>        The behaviour of starch in water is temperature and concentration dependent (Malleshi and Desikachar, 1985).<br/>        Starches in general show very little uptake of water at room temperature and their swelling power is so small. At higher temperature, water uptake increases and starch granules collap--- which leads to solubilisaiton of amylose and amylopectin to form a colloidal solution.  This is the gelatinisation stage. Genetic and environmental factors affect the gelatinisation temperature of starch (Freeman and Bocan, 1973).<br/>        Heat treatment of starch in a limited amount of water lead to swelling the granules  with very little loss of soluble material and partial gelatinization of the starch (Watson, 1970).<br/>        On cooking, the gelatinized starch tends to return from the soluble,  dispersed and amorphous state to an insoluble crystalline state.<br/>        This phenomenon is known as retrogradation or set back; it is enhanced with low temperature and high concentration of starch (Rooney, 1991). Amylose, the linear component of the starch, is more susceptible to retrogradatioln than the amylopectin (Freeman and Bocan, 1973).<br/> 1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>          Steeping of sorghum for a longer period consumes time and imparts undesirable flavour to the starch extracted from the sorghum due to the action of some spoilage microorganisms. Hence the need to reduced the steeping time and detect its effect on the yield and their sensory properties.<br/> 1.2    The overall objective of the project work is to develop a process for extracting starch from two different cultivar of sorghum by subjecting to different steeping time.<br/>        The null hypothesis is that cultivar and steeping period will not have effect on the yield and functionality of the extracted starch.<br/>        Specific aims are:<br/>        To determine the effect of steeping period on:<br/>1.     The yield of the starch<br/>2.     The functional properties of the starch<br/>3.     Organoleptic properties of the starch<br/>4.     The glycosidic cyanide level of the starch<br/>5.     The metabolysable energy value of the starch<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nEFFECT OF STEEPING PERIOD ON YIELD AND ACCEPTABILITY OF STARCH EXTRACTED FROM SORGHUM (SORGHUM BICOLOR, WHITE VARIETY AND RED VARIETY)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF STEEPING PERIOD ON YIELD AND ACCEPTABILITY OF STARCH EXTRACTED FROM SORGHUM (SORGHUM BICOLOR, WHITE VARIETY AND RED VARIETY)", "id": 72}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MICROORGANISMS FROM STORED PAP (OGI)<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>The microbial changes which took place during the steeping and storage of pan (ogi) was studied.  The steeped water had an initial PH of 6.8 which latter reduced to 4.9 at the end of steeping.  The bacterial  number for the steeped water ranged from 4.7x104  to 3.2 x 107 cfu/ml while the fungal number ranged from 1.5 x103 to 5.7 x 106 cfu/ml.  In the stored pap, pap I had higher count which range from 7.2x104 to 6.0x107 cfu/g while 6.0x107 to 1.6x1011.

A fermented cereal product is known as paplogi).  Corn is processed into traditional food such as paplogi) Umo and fields 1981).<br/>        Pap is a fermented non-alcoholic starchy food and is a major staple food widely consumed in west Africa.  It is a sour fine past beverage which when cooked produces a thin semi solid porridge. Pap (Ogi) porridge has a smooth texture and a sour taste resembling that of yoghurt,.  In Nigeria, some states such as Anambra, Imo, Enugu and Abia refer to it as Akamu but Ogi is a Yoruba name but most state of Nigeria, it refers to maize pap.  On the other hand, sorghum pap is known as Ogi baba while millet pap is known as Ogi gero in Yoruba (Banigi 1977, Onyekwere and Akinrele 1977).<br/>        Pap logi) can be consumed with variety of other product including with bread, steamed been cake (moi-moi), fried bean cake (Akara), fried yam and plantain etc.  it is used as a main meal for adult and sick patients and it is suitable for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Pap is widely used as the first native food given to babies at wearing to supplement breast milk and is a major breakfast cereal for pre-school children and adults.   It is consumed as a main meal for convalescing patients because it can easily be digested.  As a wearing food, it is utilized mainly by low income earners category, it is estimated that about 25 million or more adults eat it about 4-5 days weakly (Banigo 1972).  Milk and sugar may be added to improved the taske and nutritional quality.  Pap is cooked and turned into a stiff gel called Agidi which is similar to kenkey, a fermented shanian product (Muller 1988, withby 1968).  Some Yoruba indigens beliwved that pap is capable of stimulating the production of breast milk in Nursing mother (Bassir 1962).  However, there  has been no qualitative evidence of support of this belief.<br/>        In spite of it’s important in the Nigeria diet, pap manufacture is essential a home based industry.  There are at present no large scale factory operation for the production of pap.  The manufacture is carried out on a small scale by some house wives as a commercial venture in many parts of the country.  The cleaned grain free of dirt and impurities steeped in eastern ware, plastic or enamel pot for 1-3 days at room temperature, this is followed by wet milling and sieving.  Twenty-four (24) hours of sleeping leads to a greater depletion of the fermentable carbohydrate.  After sieving, the coarse material obtained is wash with water to separate more of the starch.  The filtered slurry is allowed to sediment and undergo further fermentation for 1-2 days at room temperature.  The coarse matter which is separated is used ad animal feed while the sediment (Pap) is boiled to obtain.<br/> 1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>          Microorganisms are involved in the processing of pap especially during fermentation and equally during storage.  Few organisms are found in the pap, if it is properly stored.  Their presence in pap during storage leads to irregular of flavour and loss of nutrients (van veen and steinkrans 1990).  This is the result of their metabolic activity in the stored pap.<br/>        The tradiitonal method of pap production using various grains encourage significant nutrient losses, Losses m,ay occur during steeping, milling and sieving.  Large parts of the protein in the grain is located in the testa and germ that are shifted off during processing.<br/>        Losses of fibre, protein, ash as well as some vitamins have been reported by Banigo and Muller (1972). Losses in nutrients could be minimized by using an improved wet milling method devised by Banigo and Muller (1972).  At the end of this work, the microorganisms found in stored pap was isolated and characterized.<br/> 1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STDU<br/>          The aim of this study is to isolate and characterize micro-organisms from stored pap.<br/>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE<br/>i.             To isolate and characterize bacterial contaminants from stored pap<br/>ii.            To isolate and characterize fungal contaminants from stored pap<br/> 1.4    HYPOTHESIS<br/>          HI:    Bacteria and fungi are involved in the fermentation and storage of maize pap.<br/> 1.5    JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY<br/>          Not very much work has been done in this in recent times, with reference to the microbiology of the process.  Some of the earliest workdone in this include those of Akiurele (1970-1977) and Barigo (1969, 1970, 1972, 1977).<br/> 1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>          Pap stored improperly for a relatively length of time is likely to develop microorganisms.  Therefore, the study is carried-out to identify this organisms and properly advice on the proper way of storing pap.<br/> <br/><br/>\n\nISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MICROORGANISMS FROM STORED PAP (OGI)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MICROORGANISMS FROM STORED PAP (OGI)", "id": 73}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECT OF STORAGE TIME ON THE FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF WHEAT/BAMBKA GROUNDNUT BLEND<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>Study of effect of storage time on the functional properties of wheat (Triticum Aestivum) and Bambrara Groundnut (Voandzeia Subteranea) Flour Blends.<br/>                  The flour blends comprised of wheat (WT) 1005, Banbaranut (BG) 100%, WBZO 70% wheat and 30% Bambaradnut, WB20 80% wheat and 20% Bambara and WBSO, 50% wheat and 50% Bambara.

At the beginning of recorded history, wheat was already an established crop whose origin was unknown (Anon 1953). There is however some evidence that cultivation of wheat started about 6,000 years ago in the 5yria – Palestine area and spread to Egypt, (ran, India, China, Russia, Turkey and Central Europe from where it spread to other countries and continents. Countries that produce wheat today include Russia, Switzer land United State of America, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England, Poland, Netherlands, Norway, Swedan, South Africa, Peru, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Newzealand and Nigeria. 9Shellenberger, 1969, Olugbemi etal 1992).<br/>In addition, wheat flour has uniques properties that differs it from other flours in containing a considerable proportion of gluten which makes wheat flour suitable for bread making and other bake products. This composition of gluten present has a bearing on the “strength” and water holding properties of the flour. The two protein that form the greater part of the guten are gluternin and gliadin while the latter appear to be identical in strong and weak wheat, the former exists in different varieties.<br/> 1.1.2 STRUCTURE OF WHEAT KERNEL<br/>The main feature of the wheat kernel can be best described in terms of the rounded or dorsal side and a vertical or crease side (Shellenberger, 1969). A deep groove a crease extends the entire length of the wheat kernel. At the apex or the small end of the grain there are many short fine hairs called brush hairs. The outer bran or seed coat consist of three layers known as epidermis.<br/>Wheat grain has the following average percentage composition. Endosperm 85% of the whole grain from which the flour is derived bran 12.5%, germ 2.5%.  the composition of wheat flour however varies considerably according to the class of wheat, its country of origin, proportion of the outer part removed by the particular milling process (Ehias, 1972, Nelson 1985). The outer partcontain more protein, fat fibre and ash then the starchy endosperm. The proportion of each of these constituents decreases as the extraction percentage gets less.<br/>                CULTIVATION OF BAMBARA GROUNDNUT<br/>It is mostly monocropping in a selected plot of land with suitable sandy soil 82% of households in North central are 67% in kavango planted Bambara groundnut in 1993. Estimating an average  of 1400m2 per farm cropped with Bambara groundnut, the total production areas sums up to  around 3000ha. Production figure are very variable, depending on the rainy season. Due to wide spacing 10 – 12 plants/m2 and lack of improved varieties yield rarely exceed 500kg/ha. Taking 250kg/ha as an overall average of the total production to 750t/year.<br/>This does not satisfy the market requirements and a considerable amount of Bambara groundnut is informally imported from Angola and sold with local materials on tradition markets. Seed size is an important factor for the marketing of Bambara groundnut.<br/> 1.1.3 USES<br/>1.     The dried mature seed cab be converted into paste, steamed and eaten with vegetable soup or sauce.  <br/>2.     The form in which the Bambara groundnut seed is commonly consumed is moin-moin usually referred to as ‘Okpa’ in the eastern states of Nigeria.<br/>3.     Dried and roasted Bambara groundnut can be used to make soup, flour and porridge.<br/> 1.1.4 USES OF WHEAT AND WHEAT PRODUCTS<br/>1.     Wheat is perhaps the most popular cereal grain for the production of bread, cake and other pastries in baking industries.    <br/>2.     Wheat bran is used mainly for the formulation animal feed.<br/>3.     Farinha, shorts, semolina, semovita, flour from wheat are used for other preparation purpose.<br/>4.     It can also be used as an ingredient in breakfast, cereal, macaroni, adhesives and other products.<br/> 1.2    BAMBARA GROUNDNUT (VOANDZEIA SUBTERAEA)<br/>1.2.1 ORIGIN<br/>Bambara groundnut belongs to the family of flowering plant called leguminosease. It is an important legume consumed in Nigeria especially in Enugu State and some other Northern States. The Bambara groundnut is native to West Africa. Some wild species are found in North Eastern Nigeria and Northern Cameroon.  It has different name’s in different parts of Africa. It is called ‘Okpa by the Igbos. Bambara groundnut is an important article of commerce in Nigeria. It grows extensively in Northern Nigeria but eaten mostly in eastern Nigeria. A large volume of trade is undertaken between the growing and the consuming population.<br/>Bambara groundnut seed vary in shape, size and colour of the seed coat (Ojimelumelukwe (1985) differentiated between four  cultivars with respect to the seed coast, colour and size. Seed may be round cream or russet brown smooth taste. The seeds have white elliptical helium with seed eight ranging between 280 and 320g.  <br/>1.3    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>1.     To investigate on the effect of storage time on the functional properties of Bambara groundnut and wheat blend for cake prior.<br/>2.     To determine effect of storage time on the nutritional quality of the flour blend for cake production.<br/>3.     To determine the significant of supplementation in nutritional content of food products.<br/> <br/><br/>\n\nEFFECT OF STORAGE TIME ON THE FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF WHEAT/BAMBKA GROUNDNUT BLEND<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF STORAGE TIME ON THE FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF WHEAT/BAMBKA GROUNDNUT BLEND", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROMOTE COMPOSITION OF PLEUROTUS TUBERRCOGININ FROM ENUGU AREA.<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>Proximate analysis of Pleurotus tuberregium was determined to ascertain its nutritional composition. the sample was analysed for its  moisture, crude fibre, ash, fat, protein and carbohydrate content. Using the method of AOAC. The results for the analysis showed that the materials has moisture content of 2.5% ash content of 1.50%, fat content of 3.00%, crude fibre content of 3.02% and carbohydrate content of 89.32%. Carbohydrate has the highest composition of the nutrients. This indicates that it could be used as food stablizer, thickening / binding agent in food industries. Based on the findings, Plenrotus tuberregium could compare favourably with other hydrocolloids such as modified starches and celluloses that one normally used as binding agents. It is therefore suggested that the use of Pleurotus tuberregium should be popularized.<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/> CHAPTER ONE <br/>1          Introduction<br/>            Objective of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0              Literature Review<br/>2.1       Taxanomy of Pleu--- tuberregium<br/>2.2              Characteristics of Plennotus tuberregium<br/>2.3              Sources of pleuntus tuberregium<br/>2.4              Cultivation of plenntus tuberrgium on cellulosic sudstrate<br/>2.4.1    cultivation of plenrotus tuberreium on nutritive medium<br/>2.5              Cultivation of other mushroom from Phennotus tuberregium<br/>2.6              Importance of some food Nutrient present in plenrotus tuberregium<br/>2.6.1        Functions of Carbohydrate<br/>2.6.2        Functions of Dietary Fibre<br/>2.6.3        Functions of Protein<br/>2.6.4        Functions of Fat<br/>2.6.5        Functions of Vitamin C<br/>2.6.6        Functions of Chemical Element<br/>2.6.7        Sodium<br/>2.6.8        Magnessium<br/>2.6.9        Copper<br/>2.7              Nutritive Value of Pleurotus tuberregium<br/>2.7.1        Micro Elements Present in Pleurotus tuberregium table 1<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0              Material and Method<br/>3.1              Material / Equipment<br/>Equipments<br/>Chemicals<br/>3.2              Sample.

The morphor logical differentiation of plenntus tuberregium is limited. It forms hyphen and develop each type depending on the growth condition. The diameter of the hyphen is usually 5NM. The hyphen is either without septate or has a cellular morphology by septate hyphae. The mass of hyphae represent the mycellium (Stolp, 1988).<br/>plenntus tuberregium posses  rigid cell wall. It does not posses chlorophyll and it has a chemoorganotrophic metabolism. It belongs to the group of fungi called basidiomycetes and are the most developed fungi. They produce basidia containing the four basidiospores. The mycellium consist of septate hyphen.<br/>            However, plenntus tuberregium supplies the major food types. Protein, carbohydrates, fat and oil as well as minerals (OSO, 1977). It is known to be tastier than meat, fish or seed plant proteins. People who abstain from meat for religious reasons have greater choice of plant protein and superior alternative taste in plenntus tuberregium. The fruiting body as well as sclerotigl mass is more commercially<br/>Demanded and yet minimally exploited.<br/>            Several indigenous knowledge and uses of plenntus tuberregium point to the tremendous potential of this biological resource.<br/>(a)                As a food stablizer / thickening agent<br/>(b)               As binding agent.<br/>(c)                As a rich source of foric acid for children and pregnant women.<br/>(d)               As a rich source of calcium for the bones of aging men and women as well as treatment for boils constipation and dental caries (Oso, 1977).<br/>A visit tot he market place any where in Igbo land, would show this commodity being processed in the soup condiment section. The sclerotia mass is scrapped and ground with curcurbita (Melon seeds). This causes swelling and bulking of the soup. A local snacks called “Ogbalotic” is prepared from Curcurbita Pepo and plenntus tuberregium it is normally tied in a leaf of cola gigantea and boiled which yields a well known health and energy sustaining snacks. It is cherished till today in the villages. Travelers and farm workers need only this and large volume of water to sustain them for days.<br/>This taxanomic position of plenntus tuberregium has been problematic because it produces eathery fruit bodies and posses of dogmatic hyphen system with interracially skeletal hyphae, many prenous authorities placed it in either panus or lentinus (Corner, 1981, Peyler, 1983).<br/>plenntus tuberregium has been eaten since classical times (Corner, 1981, Nwokolo 1987, and Okhuoya, et al, 1998). The question of sustainability of plenntus tuberregium is guareur teed being a biological resources, the technology has been developed for massive production (Okhuoya et al 1998). Other added advantages include the fact that substrate for cultivation of plenntus tuberregium is waste such as rice straw, wood dust. Sunnlight is not required so that caves and shades could maximally produced plenntus tuberregium industrially.<br/> OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The present study is to ascertain t he nutritional composition of plenntus tuberregium.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nPROMOTE COMPOSITION OF PLEUROTUS TUBERRCOGININ<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROMOTE COMPOSITION OF PLEUROTUS TUBERRCOGININ", "id": 75}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF CITRIC ACID ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ORANGE JUICE (CITRUS SINENSIS)<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>          The effect of different consecrations of citric acid on the physicochemical properties of orange juice was studied. Four samples of the orange juice were prepared, three of which were added (O.ICA), O.2 (B) and 0.3% (C) Citic acid respectively to the forth sample (D) No preservative was added. They were stored on the shelf for a period of one week and they were analyzed for pH, Pitaminac, dilatable acidity total solids, brix content, specific gravity, total plate count coliform count, fest &amp; mold count and finally sensory evaluation. The results showed that over the days, the vitamin C content reduced from 62 mg to 30mg with the most retention in sample C. The pH of the samples reduced from 3.5. to 2.8 over the storage period with the most decrease in sample D (NP). <br/>        The total solids varied from 5.7% to 8.8% with the lesst solids in sample B (0.2%). The Torix content decreased over the storage period from 12.59 to 12 08 with the lesst decrease in sample D (N.P.). the titratable acidity ranged from 0.37% to 0.03 % within the storage period. The microbial analysis showed that there were growths in the nutriment agar, two yeast growths in the potatoedextrose agar which occurred in sample D and no growth in the McConkay agar. Sensory evaluation revealed that all the samples have similar colour and taste while samples A and D had the best flavour. This analysis shows that the use of citric acid in undiluted juice is not recommended except it is made into a drink. <br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE:<br/>1.0        Introduction                        <br/>CHAPTER TWO:<br/>2.0        Literature Review                        <br/>2.1    Classification of Citrus Fruits  <br/>2.2    Origin of Orange                         <br/>2.3    Dainties                     <br/>2.4    Anatomy of Orange             <br/>2.5    Botany of Orange                        <br/>2.6    Uses of Orange                   <br/>2.7    Orange Juice                      <br/>2.8    Spoilage of Orange Juice              <br/>CHAPTER THREE:<br/>3.0        Materials and Methods          <br/>3.1    Source of Samples                              <br/>3.2    Orange Juice Preparation                              <br/>3.3    Flow Chart for orange juice preparation<br/>3.4    Quality factors in fruits juice          <br/>3.4.1 Ascorbic Acid determination                  <br/>3.4.2 Determination of total solids                  <br/>3.4.3 Determination of filterable acidity           <br/>3.4.4 Determination of Specific gravity                   <br/>3.4.5 P2H Determination                                       <br/>3.4.6 Determination of brix Content                        <br/>3.5    Microbiological Analysis        <br/>3.5.1 Total plate count         <br/>3.5.2 Coliform count                                            <br/>3.5.3 Mold and Yeast count   <br/>3.6    Sensory Evaluation              <br/>CHAPTER FOUR:<br/>4.0    Results and Discussion  <br/>4.1    Summary of physicochemical analysis and <br/>sensory evaluation test                 <br/>4.2    Discussions         <br/>4.2    Specific gravity   <br/>4.3    Ascorbic Acid              <br/>CHAPTER FIVE:<br/>Conclusion and Recommendation   <br/>References         <br/>Appendices                 <br/>  CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/>        Oranges, demons, grape fruit and limes are the fruits of trees belonging to the citrus geaus. The sweet orange (citrus sinensis) is the most widely grown of the citrus trees and the fruits are either eaten fresh or made into orange juice. The edible portion is refereed to as the endocarp and consists of a series of segments carpels or loculs which contain the thin walled juice vesides surrounding the endocarp is the peel which comprises of 20-50% of the weight of the weight of the fruit and consists of the flavedo and the albeds (ihekoronye and Ngoddy,1985). The flavedo or outer peel is a layer of tissue underlying the epidermis and contains the chloroplast and oilsacs. The albedo or inner peel is a layer of spongy white tissue which is connected to the core and supplies the water and nutrient from the tree which are necessary for the fruit growth and development.<br/>                The proximate composition of the edible portion of the orange fruit is <br/>        Water  - 86%<br/>Protein – 0.6%<br/>Fat  - 0.1%<br/>Micronutrients per 100g<br/>Calcium – 24mg<br/>Iron – 0.3.mg<br/>Vit. A  - 120mg<br/>Thiamin – 0.06mg<br/>Riboflavin – 0.02mg<br/>Niscia – 0.1.mg<br/>Ascorbic Acid – 36mg (source: Ihekoronge &amp; Ngoddy 1985).<br/>        The colour of fruits when unripe is greatly influenced by the presence of chlorophyll, caroteaoids and anthocycanins. (Enwere 1998). Due to its high moisture content, fruits are susceptible to spoilage and are also highly perishable. Orange fruits are seasonal and hence in order to preserve them, they are processed into various food products such as juices, squashes, satadinaine etc.<br/>        Fruit juice is the liquid pressed by pressure or other mechanical means from the edible portion of the fruit (Simmond 1984). According to Faye (1973) orange juice was defined as the unfermented juice of mature oranges of the citrus sineasis specie. Fruit juices serve as part of meals and they aid in the digestion of human diet. They supply minerals and vitamins in addition to energy when consumed but they deteriorate over a long storage period unless they are preserved by the addition of chemicals and by the application of heat.<br/>        Preservatives are food additives added to foods with the intention of arresting or retarding the deterioration of the food. Preservation involved the protection of food from the deterioration of microorganisms, enzymes and oxidation. This can be achieved by the application of heat and addition of chemical preservatives (Arnold 1982).<br/>        Preservatives include anti-ripening agents, anti-oxidants, antimicrobial agents and sprouting inhibitors. They may be added intentionally to food or may appear in foods as a result of pre – processing treatments, processing and storage (Ihekornye and Ngoddy, 1985).<br/>        The addition of chemical preservatives is governed by government departments which must give approval before it is permitted for use. In General it should not adversely affect the nutritive value of food.<br/>        Preservatives used in food include benzoic acid, ascorbic acid, vinegar, propanoic acid, citric acid etc. Although their limits in terms of individual specified preservatives, they may also be incorporated into the foods as permitted salts like sodium benzoate (Harold etal, 1992). Also the use of citric acid has been recognized by all major national and international food regulatory agencies as a good preservative for food and beverages.<br/>        The use of citric acid in fruit juices like pineapple juice has been found to give a positive result but in this work, it is aimed at investigating the effect of the different concentrations of citric acid on come physicochemical properties of orange juice.  <br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF CITRIC ACID ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ORANGE JUICE (CITRUS SINENSIS)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF CITRIC ACID ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ORANGE JUICE (CITRUS SINENSIS)", "id": 76}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON AFZELIA AFRICANA (AKPALATA) AND BRACHYSTEGIA SPP FLOUR AS SOUP THICKNER<br/>  ABSTRACT</b><br/>The effect of different processing methods on the functional properties of Akpalata (Afzelia Africana) and Achi (Brachystegia spp) flours were investigated.

Margarine is made from water in oilemulsion because margarine is oilemulsion. Today it is a manufactured imitation of butter made by mixing a variety of fats that may include whale oil or vegetable oils, hydrogenated to an appropriates degree. Stabilize, an oil soluble dye and a proportion of soured skimmed milk to supply flavour.<br/>Like its model, margarine is about 80% fat, 20% water and solids. It is flavoured, coloured ad fortified with vitamin A and sometimes D to match butters nutritional contribution. Single oil or a blend may be used. During World War 1, coconut oil was favoured, in the thirties, it was cottonseed, and in the fifties, soy. Today, soy and corn oils predominate. The raw oil is pressed from the seeds, purified, hydrogenated, them fortified and coloured, either with a synthetic carotene or with annatto, a pigment extracted from a tropical seed. The water phase is usually reconstituted or skim milk that is cultured with lactic bacteria to produce a stronger flavour although pure diacetyl, the compound most responsible for the flavour of butter, is also used. Emulsifiers such as lecithin help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil, salt and preservatives are also commonly added. The mixture of oil and water is them heated, blended, and cooled. The softer tub margarines are made with less hydrogenated, more liquid oils than other types of margarines.<br/>            In 1860s French Emperor Louis Napoleon III offered a prize to anyone who could make satisfactory substitutes for buffer, suitable for use by the armed forces and the lower classes.<br/>            French chemist Hippolyte Mege-Mouriezi invented a substance he called oleomargarine, which become, in shortened form, the trade name margarine and is now the generic term for a wide range of broadly similar edible oils. It is sometimes shortened to oleoleomargarine which was made by taking clarified beef fat, extracting the liquid portion under pressure, and then allowing it to solidify. When combined with butyrins and water, it made a cheap and more – or – less palatable butter substitute. Sold as margarine or under any of a host of other trade names, butter substitutes soon became big business but too late to help Mege-Mouriez. Although he expanded his initial manufacturing operation from France to the United States in 1873, he had little commercial success. By the end of the decade, however, artificial butters were on sale in both the old World and the new.<br/>            Margarine is naturally white or almost white; by forbidding the addition of artificial colouring agents, legislators found that they could keep margarine off kitchen tables. The bans became common place around the world and would endure for almost 100 years. It did not become legal to sell coloured margarine. In Australia, for example, until the 1960s.<br/>            In the mean time, margarine manufactures had made changes. Modern margarine can be made from any of a wide variety of animal or vegetable fats, and is often mixed with skim milk, salt and emulsifiers. Liquid fats are transformed into suitable substrates by the chemical process of hydrogenation, which renders them  solid at room temperature. Many popular table spreads today are blends of margarine and butter. Something that was long illegal in the United States and Australia and no doubt parts of the world too and are designed to combine and the lower cost and easy – spreading of  artificial butter with the taste of the real thing.<br/>            Three main types of margarine are common:<br/>Hard, generally uncoloured margarine for cooking or baking, which contains a high proportion of animal fat. “Traditional” margarines for such use as spreading on toast, which contain a relatively high percentage of saturated fats and made from either animal or vegetable oils. Margarines high in mono – poly – unsaturated fats, which are made from safflower, sunflower soybean, cottonseed, or olive oil. <br/>Margarine, particularly polyunsaturated margarine has become a major part of the Western dieted states, for example, in 1930 the average person ate over 8kg of butter a year and just over 1 kg of margarine By the and of the 20th century, an average American ate just under 2kg of butter and bearly 4kg of margarine. <br/>Based on the fact  that margarine can be obtained from vegetable fat and animal fat, this study to produce margarine from palm kernel melon $ coconut oils bland id to investigate if the product would be preferred over the sample in the market by the consumers.

Fruits are also plant parts which have aromatic  and fragrant characteristics and are usually sweet or sweetened before eating. They may also be processed into other fruits  bevcarge marmalades, fruit butters, vinegar, nectars wine pastes price and preserves (Ihekoronye 1999). Processing method used for any fruit depends on the fruit type (janick et- al 1981) <br/>There are also different kinds of tropical fruits available for the production of fruit juices and they are pineapple, grape lime lemon shaddock oranges paw- paw  tangerine all these are used for the different purpose depending on the type of drink that is desired, one mature and fully ripe. The chief nutritional contribution of citrus juices other than the calorific energy supply by their natural sugar content is vitamin C which is the anti scurvy vitamin. These facts proves that the possibility that fruit drinks might be substituted  for break fast serving. All the ready to serve canned juice and a few of the other in contrast contained substantial    amount of vitamin C. <br/>Various authorities have estimate that 25- 80 % fresh fruit and vegetable produced are lost at harvest in tropical regions which include a large proportion of developing countries, losses can be of  considerable  economic and social importance. (unpublished hand out 1. <br/>Fruit due to their composition and  physiology are highly perishable and  therefore  needed to undergo  some treatment which will aid  in improving and increasing the sholf life of the fruit. It is also important to process fruit so as to maintain consistency and to ease shipping  and also necessary to process those fruits so  as  to manufacture  for  both home grown and imported product for exports so as  to aid imposing the wealth of the country. <br/>Tropical fruits include pineapples, orange grape, lime guava, shaddock, lemon and we have them grouped into various classification.

(Ricker and Morse, 1984), other normendatures which have been used include phaseolus Max, Soja Max Piper and Soja hispide moech.<br/>It is not known when this remarkable legume, soybean was first cultivated in China. However as the first  legume of which a written record was made. This was in the books of the Emperor  Shen hung, dated 1800BC which describes the five principal and sacred crops of China, rice, bean, wheat barely and millet, lafter in his milliohm there were chinses writing, giving expert advice on growing soybean which was cultivated more extensively in North than in Southern China, it reached Hapan and other countries in East Asia at an early date.<br/>Soybean contain about 46%  protein and 18% fat, characteristics which have influenced it’s history: the ancient Chinese evolved  methods of making from it’s preparations with high protein content for example, Curd and Shoyu, Shoyu is a dark brown liquid made by fermentation of a combination of soybeans and cereals (F.A.O. 1970). The Chinese also ate soybeans as a  vegetable after it ahs sprouted.<br/>The soybean was first heard of in Europe in 1712 through the German Botanist Egelbant Kalmpfer who had visited Japan. In the 18th century, it was grown in some European botanical gardens (F.A.O, 1970), it is first appearance in the United States in 1804, when Commander Perry brought home two varieties from Japan (F.A.O, 1970).<br/>What was called the second stage in the history of soybeans did not begin until the first decade of the present century, when it become an important export from East – Asia at first mainly to Europe and alter to the importing countries was as a source of oil for soap making and other purposes and for the manufacture of livestock feed.<br/>Then the third stage began in the early nineteen thirties, it is silent feature has been the large stage cultivation of the soybean in the United States, combined with the application of Modern Technology which enable it to be put to a variety of uses both as food and folder and as raw materials for manufacturing processes, while soybean has to a considerable extent becomes an industrial crop in the United States, it continues to be grown in East Asia as a food crop processed for consumption by time honoured  methods. (FAO, 1970).<br/>The fourth stage began during the first decade of the 20th century A.D. at the period in which this crop was first introduced of soybeans in Nigeria shows that middle belt of the country to be the best producer of soybean production (Ezedinmma, 1964). In Nigeria, nearly all of the soybean production estimated at 30,000 tons is used for human food. A response to increase in demand for soybean for soybean as a source of protein and vegetable oil, national programme in Nigeria have explained their research on the crop. Since 1987 (IITA; Annual Report 1985) currently more feather have been added to the number of products that can be obtained from soybeans in Nigeria, such products like soymilk as it had been recently demonstrated at the food investigation centuries in Enugu.      <br/>Soymilk in the traditional sense is simply an aqueous extract of whole soybean, A detailed description of the technique used for the preparation of the soymilk as well as its composition will be found in chapter 3.<br/>Soymilk according to the nutritionist a possible substitute for cow or human milk particularly in the feeding of infant who are allegic to animal milk or where cows milk may be found to be two expensive or unavailable.  Miller, (1962) soybean or vegetable milk or flu-changin chinse is reported to have been developed and used in china before the Christian era (paker and Morse 1943) by the philosopher who was credited with the first step in the processing of tofu and yuba. Then, the traditional milk is made by soaking the bean in water overnight, wet milling the bean, heating the wet mash to improve flavour and nutritional value and filtration. The milk produce is sold to the public in streets and canteens in china in 1984.<br/>In recent years large scale production ha evolved along with commercial marketing of soymilk in Hongkong, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Sinapere, Malaysiaa and not the United States (Babara, 1984).  <br/>Uses of Soybeans<br/>Soybeans are a native crop of Eastern Asia where they have `served as an important part of the diet for centuries. The Japanese for example obtain 12 – 13% of their dietary protein from soybean product, for many of their traditional soy foods, the oriental people soak soybeans in water and then grind or cook them.<br/>Hot water extraction of ground beans yields soybean milk  which is consumed as such or is treated with calcium salts to precipitate the protein plus oil in the form of bean curd or tofu, fermentation of cooked soybeans yield products including soy sauce, misso, notto and tempheh.<br/>Except for soy sauce, one of the traditional oriental foods is consumed in significant amounts in this country. Soybeans are a relative new corner to the American scene. They have only been gown in quantity since the late 1920’s when soybean processing become an established industry, the two major products were oil and defaulted meals.<br/>In the mid – 1`930’s large  portion of the oil began to be used for foods such as shortening, margarine, cooking oil mayonnaise and salad dressing, because of its high protein content and good nutritional value, when properly processed, the meal was used primarily  for animal feeds.<br/>Soybeans have expanded in the last 30 year from a minor crop to a major cash crops. Indeed in value to the farmer soybeans now rank second to corn and above wheat, potatoes, oats, cotton and a  variety of other crops better known to the consumers, only within the last ten years however, have every many edible products. Containing soybean derivatives been directly associated with their source. In shortening their presence was “hidden” by statements similar to the followings. ‘A blend of hydrogenated vegetable oils or in salad dressing, merely “vegetable oil or a blend of vegetable oil”. Today a long list of foods containing soybean derived product can be prepared by careful reading of the labels in the supermarket, yet most of these are even not specifically identified as soybean. Product from corn, wheat, oats and many other commodities are so labeled for example corn flakes, wheat, garn, oatmeal, but not soybean. There are several reasons for this an enmity, soybean have a short history of sue in the U.S.A. the flavour and texture of soybean products are comparatively strange to people outside the orient.<br/>Although the Chinese and Japanese have covered soybeans into a variety of products most of these foods have little physical or flavour identity with the original bean. Some people agree that green soybean are a delicious dish when properly harvested and cooked but their sale and the sale and the ale of mature beans for baking are extremely small. Soybean products have problems related to their flavour and flavour stability to their ruction in foods and to their physiological effects. Despite these problems soybean oils have become a major material in our food industry. Soybean now supply more than half of the total visible fits and oils  consumed in the U.S.A<br/> Soybean composition (PREXIMATE), commercial soybean constitute and 2% hypocotyls and phumule. Proximate composition for whole beans and fractions are given in Table 1          <br/>TABLE 1: PROXIMATE COMPOSITION OF SOYBEANS AND SEED PARTS<br/>Fraction     Protein (Nx 6.25)    Fat %    Carbohydrate %    Ash %<br/>Whole bean     40    21    34    4.9<br/>Cotyledon     43    23    29    5.0<br/>Hall    8.8    1    86    4.3<br/>Hypocotyls     41    11    43    4.4<br/>             The constituents of major interest oil and protein make-up about 60% of the bean, but about one third consist of carbohydrates including polysaccharides, stachyose (3.8%), raffinese 1.1% phosphatides, sterols, ash and other minor constituents are also depend on variety, soil fertility and weather conditions.<br/>NUTRIENTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SOYBEAN<br/>            Over 50 years ago Osborne and Mendel (1980) found that rates grew poorly when feed with raw soybean meal and that dry head did not improve the nutritional value of the meal.<br/>            Rates grew normally, however when the meal was cooked on a steam for 3hrs. In the past 50yrs a vast literature was developed on the nutritive properties of soybean protein, but moist heat is still used to improve the nutritional quality of soybean protein product for foods and feeds.<br/>            The literature on this subject is often confusing and contradictory ; two recent reviews gives concise summaries of pertinent work for the last 30yrs. Alleged antinutritional factors and protein quality therefore are discussed only briefly.<br/>Antinutritional factors  <br/>            Since moist heat readily inactivates the anti-growth factors raw soybean meal, many workers believe that the factors are proteininhibitors and hemagluthins, non protein components such as sapynins have b suggested as anti-nutritional factors but recent work does not support this view.<br/>TRYPSIN INHIBITORS<br/>            More than five trysin inhibitors are reported for soybeans but only two-the kenitz and the Bowman Birk inhibitors have been purified and studied in details Kaw soybean meal contains 1.4% kunity inhibitor and 0.6^ Bowman-Birk  inhibitor.<br/>            Although both inhibitors are active against boline trypsin the kunity inhibitor has any how activity the esterase activity of human trypsin. The activity of human trypsin however is inhibited to a significant extent by kunity inhibition when case is sued as a substrate to measure proteolytic activity. It is not known whether ingestion of the inhibiters affects the presence in humans.<br/>            From the practical standpoint, Trypsin inhibitors do not appear to be a serious problem in feeds and food since they are largely inactivated by moist heat. Condition of heating time, temperature, moisture content and particle size influence the rate and extent of trypsin inhibitors inactivation for example, atmospheric steaming (1000C) inactivates more than 95% of the trypsin inhibitor activity of raw, defatted soybean flakes in 15mins. Protein efficiency shows an accompanying increase in this same time and flakes of 19% moisture gave a higher protein efficiency ratio than flakes of 5% moisture. In contrast, steaming whole soybeans chips, or cotyledons for 20mins only partially inactivated trypsin inhibitors apparently because of the large particle size. Atmospheric steaming inactivates most of the trypsin inhibitor in whole soybeans in 15mins. In initial moisture content is 20%. If the beans are soaked in water overnight 60% moisture 25mins. In boiling water sufficient to inactivate the inhibitors. Small but measurable trypsin inhibitors activity  can often be deflected after heating the known stability of Bowman-kirk inhibitor suggested that the residual inhibitor may be of this types. Measurements of residual chymotrypsin inhibitor activity would clarify this point because the Bowman-kirk inhibitor is a strong inhibitor of chymotrtpsin.<br/>            At recent study reports trypsin inhibitor activity commercial protein isolate but no inhibitor was detected in canned frankfurters containing 1.5% isolate. The heat treatment during canning inactivated the residual inhibitor.<br/>            Many of the conclusion drawn from studies on kunity inhibitor must be viewed with some reservations because of the heterogeneity of certain commercial preparation even when crystallized five times. The possibility that a protein impurities or a tightly bound non-protein impurity is responsible for some of the biological properties of the inhibitor has received slight  consideration until recently.<br/>            Hemagglatinins –Soybean contain at least four proteins capable of causing clumping of red blood cells of rabbits and rates in invitrotests. These proteins are designated haemagluttinins;  these proteins are in many legumes. Defected soy flour contains about 3%  lemaglutinins. The major hemagluttinin in soybeans has been insolated and characterized. It is a glycoprotein containing 4.5% mannose and 1% glucesanine and has a molecular weight of 110,00 and appear to contain two polypeptide chains. The ability of hemaggluttinins to cause clumping of red blood cells in a test tube serves as a useful assay procedure but there is no evidence that agglutination of red cells occurs when hemagluttinins are ingested. Hemagglutinins is readily inactivated by pepsin; thus it probably does not service passage through the stomach. Furthermore, undigested hemagglutinin would have to be absorbed from the intestine to come into contact with red blood cells an occurrence which seems unliky because of the high molecular weight of the hemagglutinin.<br/>            Soybean hemagglutinins are readily inactivated when maximum growth response is obtain. Hemagglutinins this ;present no known problems in foods of preparation includes proper heating of the soy ingredient at some step of processing.<br/>            Soybean saponings – saponins are complex glycosides of triterpenoid alcohols and occur in soybeans to the extent of 0.5% and because of their polarity, the saponins are insoluble in hexane and remain in defatted meal; defatted meal contains 0.6^ saponins. Although antinutritional properties have been ascribed to soybean saponins, recent studies show t hem to be harmless when ingested by chicks rates and nice aft 0.5 to 3% of the diet. At the highest level the saponins content was about three fold higher than in a 50% soybean meal supplemented diet. Neither saponings nor sapogenine were found in blood  of rates, mice or chicks kept in diet containing  20% soybean seed, thus the saponins are not absorbed thy remain intact until they leave the enzymes in the colon. The saponin inhibit various enzymes including cholinesterase and chymotrypsin but inhibition is not specific. Soyprotein and other dietary protein will also bind saponins. Approximately 0.4% saponins were obtained from a laboratory preparation of soyprotein isolate when isolates where ehated in dilate and solutions crystalline bit apparently modified. Saponins were obtained. The effect of interaction of the saponins with soy protein is still unknown, the saponins are an extremely complex mixture and only limited separations have been obtained to date.<br/>            Protein quality of soybean.<br/>            Until the 1960’s information on the nutritive value of soybean protein was largely limited to defatted flakes, meals and flours. Moreover most of the studied were concerned with use of soybean means as an animals feed. Since commercial introduction of concentrates and isolates in 1959 and their increasing use in foods, these fractions have received considerably more attention studies with human, however, are still limited. The quality of soy protein depends on several factors:-<br/>a)            Amino acids composition<br/>b)            Presence of anti-nutritional factors<br/>c)            Digestibility<br/>d)            Overall composition of the diet<br/>e)            Nutrient requirement of the species involves. Item a, b, and c are of primary importance in considering the various soy protein forms as protein sources.<br/>In the preparation of isolates for example fractionation occurs; this results in a change in amino acid  composition as well as in removal of the antinutritional factors occurring in the whey, items of and e are of greater importance when a specific food is being considered i.e. an infant food dietary item or a soack food nutritional requirements for an infant differ greatly from the needs of an adult who may be trying too loose weight.<br/>Aims and objectives of the project    <br/>The processing of soybeans into soymilk is aimed at gaining consumer acceptance of the legume by removal of the toxicants that contain and also improving organoleptic qualities of soymilk with special consideration to some adverse effect of these operation in soymilk  quality.<br/>This project re views the effects of different methods used in the processing of soybeans into soymilk on the quality of the milk produced during processing and storage. <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSIGN TECHNIQUIES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOYMILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSIGN TECHNIQUIES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOYMILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE", "id": 80}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PRODUCTION AND USES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES AN REMOVAL OF BITTERING PRINCIPLES IN IT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS.<br/>CHAPTER  ONE</b><br/>DIFINITION<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/> CHAPTER  TWO<br/>2.1       DIFFERENT METHODS OF PRODUCTION OF PROTEN HYDROLYSATE USING ENZYMATIC AND CHEMICAL METHODS<br/>  2.2              USES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES IN FOOD SYSTEM<br/>2.3              ADVANTAGES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES OVER NATIVE PROTEIN<br/>2.4              LIMITATIONS OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES IN FOOD SYSTEM<br/>2.5              METHODS OF DEBITTERING THE HYDROLYSATES<br/> CHAPTER THREE<br/>CONCLLISION<br/>REFERENCES<br/>CHAPTER  ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Definition:       Protein hydrolysate could be defined as the end product of protein hydrolysis using chemical and enzymic methods.<br/>Protein hydrolysate have many uses in specialty foods such as non allergenic infant formular, diets foods and other special nutritional foods.<br/>The drawback of many hydrolysates such as Soya or Casein hydrolysates is the bitter taste that develops when they are hydrolysated into small peptides with protease enzymes.<br/>Protein maldigestion which is often associated with cystic fibrosis and allergy to milk protein may be overcome by replacing intact in the diet with synthetic amino acid mixture, or with enzymic protein hydrolysates. Hydrolysates may be the treatment of choice for two reasons. The amino acids and small peptides constituents of protein hydrolysates have been shown to be more readily ascribed from the small intestine than their equivelent pure amino acid mixture, more over, protein hydrolysates are considerably less expensive than synthetic amino acid mixtures. Nonetheless, protein hydrolysates suffer from a serious drawback, namely, the occurrence of a bitter taste which develops during the course of the enzymic hydrolysis.<br/>Murray r (1952) demonstrated that a treatment of enzymic casein hydrolysates with activated carbon resulted in a substantial improvement in the taste of preparations. However, authors regarded this method of improving the taste as impractical due to the simultaneous loss of a large proportion of the hyptophan during treatment. A different approach was presented in move recent studies in which a casein hydrolysate relatively free of bitter taste was obtained by the sequential employment of papa in and of pig’s kidney homogenate – the latter serving as a source of exopeptidases. However, extended time periods of hydrolysis were required, which necessitated the use of dolor form to control bacterial growth.<br/>There is a variety of food and biomedical applications for protein which have been solubilized by enzymatic hydrolysis. Their enhanced solubility, heat stability, and resistance to precipitation in acidic environs, where many proteins are insoluble, offer attractive features to biochemists and nutritionists involve the research and development of high protein food formulations.<br/>Applications of these valuable protein supplements may have merit in the diet of persons with digestive disorders, pre and post operative abdominal surgical patient, geriatric and convalescent feeding , and for other who for various reasons do not ingest a well balanced diet. Unfortunately, the use of enzyme – treated hydrolysates in dietary food applications has in many instances, been limited due to the presence of bitter flovour component. The unpalatability of these hydrolysate  arises mainly from the formation of bitter peptide and amino acids liberated during the hydrolytic process. The bitterness appease to be closely related to the content and sequence of hydrophobic amino acids in the peptides.<br/>Further hydrolysis of pepsin digested soy protein using a bacterial proteins or an exopeptidase, reduced bitterness. Also, chemotropic plastering protein hydrolysates. Similarly, clegg and Mc Millan (1974) have reported that a combination enzyme treatment of case in using papain for 18 hr followed by the addition of a homogenate of swine kidney cortex, also produced a hydrolysate with reduced bitterness. <br/>As another approach to resolving the bitter flavor problem, it seemed reasonable to attempt flavor improvement of protein hydrolysates by reducing the hydrophobic peptide and amino acid content of the digests. It was recognize many years earlier that activated carbon would absorb the aromatic  amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenycalaline. At a later date, Murrgy and Baker utilized carbon to treat a commercial enzymic hydrolysate of casein and reported the taste was greatly improved. A bitter tasting polypeptide fraction was elutated from the carbon.<br/>Various phenol-formaldehyde resins with structures similar to carbon are available commercially and are used in a wide variety of ion-exchange and absorbent applications. Therefore the ability of a phenol-fomaldeliyde resin polymer to interact preferentially with the monoplane groups present in hydrophobic peptide was determined from the findings a hydrophobic chromatography process for debittering protein hydrolysates was developed.<br/>It has been well documented that the main problem in the preparation of soluble hydrolysate from protein such as casein is the difficulty in preventing the formation of bitter peptides or in removing them from the hydrolysate. Among several studies on casein hydrolysates the process developed by clegg and Mc Millan (1974) using skim milk as substrate, should be mentioned. By hydrolyzing skim milk protein with papain, a bitter testing hydrolysate is formed which is rendered bland by subsequent hydrolysis with exopeptidase from pig kidney tissue. Unfortunately, the procedure is both lengthy and costly. Anther costly debittering process involves hydrophobic chromatography of enzymatic protein hydrolysate on hexyls sepharose. An extraction method using azeotropic secondary butyl alcohol by which complete removal of bitter compounds is also achieved.<br/>In the course of a study aimed a producing at a reasonable cost, bland, soluble skim milk hydrolysate without a significant loss of nutritional value, a comparison was made of adsorption methods of debittering pronase- and ficinhydroly-zed skim milks. The result of the comparison and the partial identification of the bitter peptides formed in the skim milk hydrolysates is reported. Due to the minimum changes in taste and appearance afforded to soft drinks or fruit juices by addition of this treated skim milk, the resultant beverages are expected to appear and taste like the original beverages with almost full nutritional value of skim milk.<br/>It is widely known that bitterness sometimes is produced in sake and other fermented products, so decreasing their qualities. This bitterness is produced by bitter peptides and their derivatives formed during the ageing process of these fermented products. Enzymatic hydrolysis of protein also produces bitter peptides very often to decrease the value of the products.<br/>Since those bitter peptides are known to be produced by enzymatic hydrolysis, several attempts to reduce the production of bitter peptides during the enzymatic hydrolysis process by changing the enzymes and or conditions of the reactions have been made.<br/>Skim milk, soybean casein, whey protein concentrate (NPC) and casein hydrolysate of course composed of amino acids. Because a debittering method for bitter peptides was being looked for protein and peptides could block the bitterness. Creaming powder, Vegetable oil and margarine are fatly substances, which could block hydrophobic groups of bitter peptides by their character to reduce the bitterness. Some acidic amino acids were added in order to confirm their ability for masking bitterness, Asp, Glu and tau being used for the study. Although taurine (Tau) is not an acidic amin acid, it has a very strongly acidic function. Taurine was expected to reduce the bitterness as well as other acidic amino acids or peptides. <br/> <br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nPRODUCTION AND USES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES AN REMOVAL OF BITTERING PRINCIPLES IN IT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION AND USES OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES AN REMOVAL OF BITTERING PRINCIPLES IN IT", "id": 81}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECTS OF SOME SALTS (Nacl and Na2 SO4) ON FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF PUMPKIN SEED <br/>(TELFARIA OCCIDENTALS) FLOOR.<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>            A study was carried out on the physico – chemical properties of fluted pumpkin seeds (Telferia occidentalis) flours.  The 1st two flour samples were obtained by boiling for 1 hr in 0.5% solution for Nacl, and .5% solution of Na2 S04 respectively.<br/>The 2nd two samples were obtained by soaking for 12 hrs in 0.5% soln of Nacl, and 0.5% soln of Na2 So4 respectively.  The control was neither soaked; F4, F6, F5, F7, and F8 respectively.  All the samples were dried milled and sieved to obtain their respectively flours.  The flour samples were defatted using n-hexane.

INTRODUCTION<br/>Pumpkin is a common name of the genus cucurbitae of the Gourd Family.  It includes the pumpkins and squashes.  Although the names are often used interchangeably, pumpkins in the United Kingdom usually refer to cucurbita maximum and it’s varieties, in the U.S. it means curcurbita pepo.  The most popular of this is a vine bearing orange fruits or pumpkin used as a piefilling.<br/>Pumpkin is any several prickly vine with large lobed leaves and yellow flowers, in the genus cucurbita of the order violates.<br/>Pumpkin is commonly applied to the large orange coloured fruit, the curcurbita species is used when ripe as a table vegetable in pies.  The flesh is some what coarse and strongly flavoured, hence generally not served as a baked vegetable.<br/>Fluted pumpkin (Telfaria accidentalis) belongs to the family cucurbitaceae.  It is known as “Ugu” in Igbo, “Umee” in urchobo “Ubon” in Efik and “Iroko” in Yoruba language.  It is widely eaten in the first zone of the southern Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.  Both mature and immature leaves and the young shoots are frequently eaten as a pot herb.<br/>The seeds are cooked whole or ground up and used as soup thickener.  They have agreeable almond like flavour very nutritious and highly rich in oil of potential industrial value.   The seed also contains relatively high amount of minerals and vitamins required in human nutrition.<br/>The amino acid of the protein are deficient in the sulphur containing amino acid.  (Asiegbu 1987).<br/>The wide shortage of animal protein in developing countries had continued to attract research interest in plant protein of high abundance.<br/>However the ultimate success of utilizing plant protein in food formulation depend largely upon it’s functional properties some of these functional some of these functional properties include water and oil absorption capacity, gelation property, Emulsification, protein solubility, bulk density (Fagbemi and Oshodi 1991).<br/>Considerable work had been done on it’s cultivation and diseases (Maduewsi 1977).  Seed biological chemical ecology cultural practices and fatty acid composition of the oil in the seed.  Both the essential and non essential amino acid of fluted pumpkin is higher than that of colocyn this citrullus.<br/>Fagbemi and Oshodi (1991) examined the chemical composition and functional properties of the defatted seed flour, it’s protein isolate nutritionally valuable minerals and compare with other oil seed flour, isolated being based in food formulation.  (Fagbemi and Osgodi 1991).  Previous studies on the functional properties of the fluted pumpkin had been done on the raw seed (dried sample. Fagbemi and Oshodi 1992, search on the forces affecting the thermal beheviour of protein, may provided methods of improving the functional behaviour of oil seed proteins in food system.      Heating to denature some protein had been reported to be justifiable or desirable in thermal destruction of functional agents and deteoretion of enzyme and in enhancing the digestibility of the component proteins in oil seed.<br/>Processing effects on functional properties is desirable for designing appropriate refining, extraction and drying methods for the preparation of the functional properties.  There is need to study salt and processing effect on the functional properties of some vegetable protein to enhance their optimum utilization.<br/>This present work is aimed at the following <br/>1)        To study the effect of processing on the proximate composition of the fluted pumpkin seed flour.<br/>2)        To study the effect of salt on protein solubility of the defatted fluted pumpkin seed flour.<br/>3)        To investigate processing effect the foaming capacity and stability of defatted fluted pumpkin seed flour.<br/>4)        Study the effect of pH and processing on the foaming capacity and stability of defatted seed flour.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nEFFECTS OF SOME SALTS (Nacl and Na2 SO4) ON FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF PUMPKIN SEED (TELFARIA OCCIDENTALS) FLOOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF SOME SALTS (Nacl and Na2 SO4) ON FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF PUMPKIN SEED (TELFARIA OCCIDENTALS) FLOOR", "id": 82}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSIGN TECHNIQUIES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOYMILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Soymilk was processed from soymilk (Glycine Max) seed using that different processing techniques: <br/>A         Hot extraction method<br/>B.        Cold extraction method<br/>C.        Soaking before hot extraction method.<br/>            The soymilk samples were subjected to sensory evaluation using 9 point hedonic scale and proximate analysis.<br/>            Result obtained showed that sample A was significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) between sample B had a more acceptable colour (P &lt; 0.05) than samples A and C this was no significant difference between sample A and C in terms of colour.<br/>            The general acceptability of the sample showed that all the samples were acceptable.<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1         History of Soybeans <br/>1.2         Uses of Soybeans <br/>1.3         Composition of Soybeans<br/>1.4         Nutritional Quality of Soybeans <br/>1.5         Antinutritional Factors<br/>1.6         Trypsin Inhibitor <br/>1.7         Haemagluttins <br/>1.8         Soybeans Saponings <br/>1.9         Protein Quality of Soubeans<br/>1.10      Aims and Objectives <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature Review <br/>2.1         Milk from Soybeans<br/>2.2         Nutritional Value of Soybeans <br/>2.3          Essential Amino Acid Content of Soybeans  <br/>2.4         Undesirable Components of Soybeans <br/>2.4.1     Trypsin Inhibitor<br/>2.4.2     Clrease <br/>2.4.3     Haemagluttuis<br/>2.4.4     Gioterogens<br/>2.4.5     Phytic acid<br/>2.4.6     Bitter and Beeany Flavour<br/>2.4.7     Flatus<br/>2.4.8     Soymilk Flavour<br/>2.4.9     Soymilk and Lipoxidase Activity<br/>2.6.1     Nutritional Aspect of Soymilk<br/>2.6.2     Proteins<br/>2.6.3     Vitamins and Minerals<br/>2.6.4     Fats <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1         Materials <br/>3.2         Methods I Hot Extraction Method<br/>3.3         Method II Cold Extraction Method<br/>3.4         Method III Soaking Before Hot Extraction Method<br/>3.5         Method of Analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Result and Discussion<br/>4.1         Effect of Soaking Time on the Organoptic Qualities of Soymilk  <br/>4.2         Effect of Soaking Time on the Protein Recovery and Total Solids<br/>4.3         Effect of Blanching Time on the Organoleptic Qualities of Soymilk <br/>4.4         Effect of Blanching Time on Protein Recovery and Total Solids<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Conclusion and Recommendation <br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation <br/>REFERENCES <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>His of Soymilk:  Soybeans belongs to the family leguminous, subfamily  papiliondase and the genus Glycine Max. (Ricker and Morse, 1984), other normendatures which have been used include phaseolus Max, Soja Max Piper and Soja hispide moech.<br/>It is not known when this remarkable legume, soybean was first cultivated in China. However as the first  legume of which a written record was made. This was in the books of the Emperor  Shen hung, dated 1800BC which describes the five principal and sacred crops of China, rice, bean, wheat barely and millet, lafter in his milliohm there were chinses writing, giving expert advice on growing soybean which was cultivated more extensively in North than in Southern China, it reached Hapan and other countries in East Asia at an early date.<br/>Soybean contain about 46%  protein and 18% fat, characteristics which have influenced it’s history: the ancient Chinese evolved  methods of making from it’s preparations with high protein content for example, Curd and Shoyu, Shoyu is a dark brown liquid made by fermentation of a combination of soybeans and cereals (F.A.O. 1970). The Chinese also ate soybeans as a  vegetable after it ahs sprouted.<br/>The soybean was first heard of in Europe in 1712 through the German Botanist Egelbant Kalmpfer who had visited Japan. In the 18th century, it was grown in some European botanical gardens (F.A.O, 1970), it is first appearance in the United States in 1804, when Commander Perry brought home two varieties from Japan (F.A.O, 1970).<br/>What was called the second stage in the history of soybeans did not begin until the first decade of the present century, when it become an important export from East – Asia at first mainly to Europe and alter to the importing countries was as a source of oil for soap making and other purposes and for the manufacture of livestock feed.<br/>Then the third stage began in the early nineteen thirties, it is silent feature has been the large stage cultivation of the soybean in the United States, combined with the application of Modern Technology which enable it to be put to a variety of uses both as food and folder and as raw materials for manufacturing processes, while soybean has to a considerable extent becomes an industrial crop in the United States, it continues to be grown in East Asia as a food crop processed for consumption by time honoured  methods. (FAO, 1970).<br/>The fourth stage began during the first decade of the 20th century A.D. at the period in which this crop was first introduced of soybeans in Nigeria shows that middle belt of the country to be the best producer of soybean production (Ezedinmma, 1964). In Nigeria, nearly all of the soybean production estimated at 30,000 tons is used for human food. A response to increase in demand for soybean for soybean as a source of protein and vegetable oil, national programme in Nigeria have explained their research on the crop. Since 1987 (IITA; Annual Report 1985) currently more feather have been added to the number of products that can be obtained from soybeans in Nigeria, such products like soymilk as it had been recently demonstrated at the food investigation centuries in Enugu.      <br/>Soymilk in the traditional sense is simply an aqueous extract of whole soybean, A detailed description of the technique used for the preparation of the soymilk as well as its composition will be found in chapter 3.<br/>Soymilk according to the nutritionist a possible substitute for cow or human milk particularly in the feeding of infant who are allegic to animal milk or where cows milk may be found to be two expensive or unavailable.  Miller, (1962) soybean or vegetable milk or flu-changin chinse is reported to have been developed and used in china before the Christian era (paker and Morse 1943) by the philosopher who was credited with the first step in the processing of tofu and yuba. Then, the traditional milk is made by soaking the bean in water overnight, wet milling the bean, heating the wet mash to improve flavour and nutritional value and filtration. The milk produce is sold to the public in streets and canteens in china in 1984.<br/>In recent years large scale production ha evolved along with commercial marketing of soymilk in Hongkong, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Sinapere, Malaysiaa and not the United States (Babara, 1984).  <br/>Uses of Soybeans<br/>Soybeans are a native crop of Eastern Asia where they have `served as an important part of the diet for centuries. The Japanese for example obtain 12 – 13% of their dietary protein from soybean product, for many of their traditional soy foods, the oriental people soak soybeans in water and then grind or cook them.<br/>Hot water extraction of ground beans yields soybean milk  which is consumed as such or is treated with calcium salts to precipitate the protein plus oil in the form of bean curd or tofu, fermentation of cooked soybeans yield products including soy sauce, misso, notto and tempheh.<br/>Except for soy sauce, one of the traditional oriental foods is consumed in significant amounts in this country. Soybeans are a relative new corner to the American scene. They have only been gown in quantity since the late 1920’s when soybean processing become an established industry, the two major products were oil and defaulted meals.<br/>In the mid – 1`930’s large  portion of the oil began to be used for foods such as shortening, margarine, cooking oil mayonnaise and salad dressing, because of its high protein content and good nutritional value, when properly processed, the meal was used primarily  for animal feeds.<br/>Soybeans have expanded in the last 30 year from a minor crop to a major cash crops. Indeed in value to the farmer soybeans now rank second to corn and above wheat, potatoes, oats, cotton and a  variety of other crops better known to the consumers, only within the last ten years however, have every many edible products. Containing soybean derivatives been directly associated with their source. In shortening their presence was “hidden” by statements similar to the followings. ‘A blend of hydrogenated vegetable oils or in salad dressing, merely “vegetable oil or a blend of vegetable oil”. Today a long list of foods containing soybean derived product can be prepared by careful reading of the labels in the supermarket, yet most of these are even not specifically identified as soybean. Product from corn, wheat, oats and many other commodities are so labeled for example corn flakes, wheat, garn, oatmeal, but not soybean. There are several reasons for this an enmity, soybean have a short history of sue in the U.S.A. the flavour and texture of soybean products are comparatively strange to people outside the orient.<br/>Although the Chinese and Japanese have covered soybeans into a variety of products most of these foods have little physical or flavour identity with the original bean. Some people agree that green soybean are a delicious dish when properly harvested and cooked but their sale and the sale and the ale of mature beans for baking are extremely small. Soybean products have problems related to their flavour and flavour stability to their ruction in foods and to their physiological effects. Despite these problems soybean oils have become a major material in our food industry. Soybean now supply more than half of the total visible fits and oils  consumed in the U.S.A<br/> Soybean composition (PREXIMATE), commercial soybean constitute and 2% hypocotyls and phumule. Proximate composition for whole beans and fractions are given in Table 1          <br/>TABLE 1: PROXIMATE COMPOSITION OF SOYBEANS AND SEED PARTS<br/>Fraction     Protein (Nx 6.25)    Fat %    Carbohydrate %    Ash %<br/>Whole bean     40    21    34    4.9<br/>Cotyledon     43    23    29    5.0<br/>Hall    8.8    1    86    4.3<br/>Hypocotyls     41    11    43    4.4<br/>             The constituents of major interest oil and protein make-up about 60% of the bean, but about one third consist of carbohydrates including polysaccharides, stachyose (3.8%), raffinese 1.1% phosphatides, sterols, ash and other minor constituents are also depend on variety, soil fertility and weather conditions.<br/>NUTRIENTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SOYBEAN<br/>            Over 50 years ago Osborne and Mendel (1980) found that rates grew poorly when feed with raw soybean meal and that dry head did not improve the nutritional value of the meal.<br/>            Rates grew normally, however when the meal was cooked on a steam for 3hrs. In the past 50yrs a vast literature was developed on the nutritive properties of soybean protein, but moist heat is still used to improve the nutritional quality of soybean protein product for foods and feeds.<br/>            The literature on this subject is often confusing and contradictory ; two recent reviews gives concise summaries of pertinent work for the last 30yrs. Alleged antinutritional factors and protein quality therefore are discussed only briefly.<br/>Antinutritional factors  <br/>            Since moist heat readily inactivates the anti-growth factors raw soybean meal, many workers believe that the factors are proteininhibitors and hemagluthins, non protein components such as sapynins have b suggested as anti-nutritional factors but recent work does not support this view.<br/>TRYPSIN INHIBITORS<br/>            More than five trysin inhibitors are reported for soybeans but only two-the kenitz and the Bowman Birk inhibitors have been purified and studied in details Kaw soybean meal contains 1.4% kunity inhibitor and 0.6^ Bowman-Birk  inhibitor.<br/>            Although both inhibitors are active against boline trypsin the kunity inhibitor has any how activity the esterase activity of human trypsin. The activity of human trypsin however is inhibited to a significant extent by kunity inhibition when case is sued as a substrate to measure proteolytic activity. It is not known whether ingestion of the inhibiters affects the presence in humans.<br/>            From the practical standpoint, Trypsin inhibitors do not appear to be a serious problem in feeds and food since they are largely inactivated by moist heat. Condition of heating time, temperature, moisture content and particle size influence the rate and extent of trypsin inhibitors inactivation for example, atmospheric steaming (1000C) inactivates more than 95% of the trypsin inhibitor activity of raw, defatted soybean flakes in 15mins. Protein efficiency shows an accompanying increase in this same time and flakes of 19% moisture gave a higher protein efficiency ratio than flakes of 5% moisture. In contrast, steaming whole soybeans chips, or cotyledons for 20mins only partially inactivated trypsin inhibitors apparently because of the large particle size. Atmospheric steaming inactivates most of the trypsin inhibitor in whole soybeans in 15mins. In initial moisture content is 20%. If the beans are soaked in water overnight 60% moisture 25mins. In boiling water sufficient to inactivate the inhibitors. Small but measurable trypsin inhibitors activity  can often be deflected after heating the known stability of Bowman-kirk inhibitor suggested that the residual inhibitor may be of this types. Measurements of residual chymotrypsin inhibitor activity would clarify this point because the Bowman-kirk inhibitor is a strong inhibitor of chymotrtpsin.<br/>            At recent study reports trypsin inhibitor activity commercial protein isolate but no inhibitor was detected in canned frankfurters containing 1.5% isolate. The heat treatment during canning inactivated the residual inhibitor.<br/>            Many of the conclusion drawn from studies on kunity inhibitor must be viewed with some reservations because of the heterogeneity of certain commercial preparation even when crystallized five times. The possibility that a protein impurities or a tightly bound non-protein impurity is responsible for some of the biological properties of the inhibitor has received slight  consideration until recently.<br/>            Hemagglatinins –Soybean contain at least four proteins capable of causing clumping of red blood cells of rabbits and rates in invitrotests. These proteins are designated haemagluttinins;  these proteins are in many legumes. Defected soy flour contains about 3%  lemaglutinins. The major hemagluttinin in soybeans has been insolated and characterized. It is a glycoprotein containing 4.5% mannose and 1% glucesanine and has a molecular weight of 110,00 and appear to contain two polypeptide chains. The ability of hemaggluttinins to cause clumping of red blood cells in a test tube serves as a useful assay procedure but there is no evidence that agglutination of red cells occurs when hemagluttinins are ingested. Hemagglutinins is readily inactivated by pepsin; thus it probably does not service passage through the stomach. Furthermore, undigested hemagglutinin would have to be absorbed from the intestine to come into contact with red blood cells an occurrence which seems unliky because of the high molecular weight of the hemagglutinin.<br/>            Soybean hemagglutinins are readily inactivated when maximum growth response is obtain. Hemagglutinins this ;present no known problems in foods of preparation includes proper heating of the soy ingredient at some step of processing.<br/>            Soybean saponings – saponins are complex glycosides of triterpenoid alcohols and occur in soybeans to the extent of 0.5% and because of their polarity, the saponins are insoluble in hexane and remain in defatted meal; defatted meal contains 0.6^ saponins. Although antinutritional properties have been ascribed to soybean saponins, recent studies show t hem to be harmless when ingested by chicks rates and nice aft 0.5 to 3% of the diet. At the highest level the saponins content was about three fold higher than in a 50% soybean meal supplemented diet. Neither saponings nor sapogenine were found in blood  of rates, mice or chicks kept in diet containing  20% soybean seed, thus the saponins are not absorbed thy remain intact until they leave the enzymes in the colon. The saponin inhibit various enzymes including cholinesterase and chymotrypsin but inhibition is not specific. Soyprotein and other dietary protein will also bind saponins. Approximately 0.4% saponins were obtained from a laboratory preparation of soyprotein isolate when isolates where ehated in dilate and solutions crystalline bit apparently modified. Saponins were obtained. The effect of interaction of the saponins with soy protein is still unknown, the saponins are an extremely complex mixture and only limited separations have been obtained to date.<br/>            Protein quality of soybean.<br/>            Until the 1960’s information on the nutritive value of soybean protein was largely limited to defatted flakes, meals and flours. Moreover most of the studied were concerned with use of soybean means as an animals feed. Since commercial introduction of concentrates and isolates in 1959 and their increasing use in foods, these fractions have received considerably more attention studies with human, however, are still limited. The quality of soy protein depends on several factors:-<br/>a)            Amino acids composition<br/>b)            Presence of anti-nutritional factors<br/>c)            Digestibility<br/>d)            Overall composition of the diet<br/>e)            Nutrient requirement of the species involves. Item a, b, and c are of primary importance in considering the various soy protein forms as protein sources.<br/>In the preparation of isolates for example fractionation occurs; this results in a change in amino acid  composition as well as in removal of the antinutritional factors occurring in the whey, items of and e are of greater importance when a specific food is being considered i.e. an infant food dietary item or a soack food nutritional requirements for an infant differ greatly from the needs of an adult who may be trying too loose weight.<br/>Aims and objectives of the project    <br/>The processing of soybeans into soymilk is aimed at gaining consumer acceptance of the legume by removal of the toxicants that contain and also improving organoleptic qualities of soymilk with special consideration to some adverse effect of these operation in soymilk  quality.<br/>This project re views the effects of different methods used in the processing of soybeans into soymilk on the quality of the milk produced during processing and storage. <br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSIGN TECHNIQUES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOY MILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSIGN TECHNIQUES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOY MILK PROCESSING AND STORAGE", "id": 83}]
