Many professional secretaries experience conflicts because of work in the office and family activities waiting demands upon their time. Conflicts occur because the person want to devote adequate attention to both for family and office work.</p> <p>            The causes of this stress emanate from poor conduct of the so called “manager’s who do forget that the secretary is the heart beat of an organization”. Before any form or organization attain their aim, their secret must be kept and for this to be done the secretary in particular must be involved.</p> <p>            The roles and functions of the secretary are basic to the organization, these range from covering meetings, taking care of all office routine duties, keeping schedules in both hers and her boss’s desk diaries for complete and effective job performance up to date and supervising sub-ordinates as well as keeping other general information in the office. In the organization, she is also important to the organization because of her ability to remain clam under extra-ordinary condition of work pressures and human demands.</p> <p>            The work of secretaries are stressful in the since that they are the head and eye of the organization. Sometimes secretaries feel like back sliding because of the work fully packed for them and there is no time to tackle all these jobs, and upon that the manager will be shouting on them to hurry up, and as the secretary looks around and finds no help stress arises. In any event, extremely stressful situation, such as lack of sleep or physical torture bring about lack of interest to work and unhappiness while working.</p> <p>            As I mentioned before that the secretary is the heart beat of any organization, so organizations should sit up to make life meaningful for the secretaries working in them to achieve their aims.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM      </p> <p>            Stress comes as a result of over working oneself. Over work may emanate from the manager of an organization or the secretary her self. A situation where the manager fail to recruit more workers in the organization, this will generate very many stressful condition for the secretaries working in them, running healter scleter from pillar to post which may lead to frustrations, tension and anxiety and as a result of this implicate her to various forms of problems.</p> <p>            The secretary herself causes stress in her job, as  a result of her inability to schedule her time according to her engagements ie using her limited time to cover a lot of things.</p> <p>            Hence the sources of stress has been measured, is now left for both managers and secretaries to come together and share their time according to their engagements in other to curb stress on that job.</p> <p>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The major purpose of this study is to find out the causes and effects of stress on secretary’s job in Enugu urban business organization performance specifically, the study seeks to:</p> <p>1.                  Find out causes of stress on the secretary.</p> <p>2.                  Identify effects of stress on secretary’s job performance.</p> <p>3.                  Ascertain problems arising from secretary’s stress on the achievement of organizational goal.</p> <p>4.                  Find out measures to curb stress on the job.</p> <p>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The research will be of importance to the society, it will be useful to professional secretaries. It is hoped that after some findings of this work, the secretary will be in a better position to find out causes stress and avoid them whenever possible and control their effects on her performance. This should lend to a better job performance.</p> <p>            Ignorance of how to treat a secretary in order to get her best performances may be one of the reason why the secretary is subjected to stressful conditions at the place of work.  It is hoped that after going through this work, the boss will be better informed as to handle a secretary to get maximum performance from her.</p> <p>            Sometimes, professional secretary trainers are hopelessly out to conduct with what is required of secretary at the place of work so that training programmes are not up to what they should be. This will help trainers to identity vital training areas on which to lay emphasis and from time to time improve on facilities to meet with modern office procedures.</p> <p>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>            The following research questions were formulated to guide this research study.</p> <p>1.                  What factors causes stress in the secretary’s job environment?</p> <p>2.                  To what extent does stress affect the job performance of the secretary?</p> <p>3.                  How does stress effect the organizational goal?</p> <p>4.                  How do we curb stress on secretary’s job?</p> <p>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>STRESS:         is said to be pressure, condition causing hardship and disquiet; stress is the state the secretary’s disposition when she hard been affected by a stressor.</p> <p>STRESSOR: Is any factor in the environment of work that effects the secretary’s job performance.</p> </div>\n\nA STUDY OF THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF STRESS ON SECRETARY'S JOB PERFORMANCE IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STUDY OF THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF STRESS ON SECRETARY'S JOB PERFORMANCE IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>            This research work was carried out to examine the influence of communication equipment on the efficiency of the secretary with particular reference to Nigerian Breweries Public limited company NBL/Ama Green Field 9th mile corner Enugu.</p> <p>            The theoretical frame work for this study was based on the use of related literature.

Communication particularly in business organizations provides a means by which power is required, exercised, shaped and sustained.</p> <p>            Generally, communication is an act shaped by all living things. It originated from the Latin word “communies” meaning to share. Communication is the act of imparting a share of something.</p> <p>            To emphasized on the importance of communication, Cicero (1970) said thus “If a wise man were granted a life of abundance of materials things, so that he has leisure to contemplate everything worth knowing, yet if he could not communicate with other human if he could not communicate with other human beings he could abandon life”</p> <p>            By John fists (1982) “Communication is talking to one another, it is television, it is spreading information by whatever means. It is our life style, it is literary criticism, the list is endless.</p> <p>            Two schools of though exist on communication. The process school and the sem school. Both schools agreed on the fact that for communication to be effective, there must be a sender, a receiver, a channel and the subject matter which is being communicated on. There could also be noise which is anything that is being added to the communication signals between its transmission and reception that is not intended by sources.</p> <p>            Communication in a business organization encompasses more than mere oral transmission. It involves all the sensory, oral and written activities that form part of our organizational life. The actualization of communication is the equipment. This is because when instruction are communicated through the equipment,. The people working know their responsibilities and the secretary dispensers her duties appropriately. Thus, the organizational goal would be enhanced.</p> <p>1.2       WHO IS A SECRETARY</p> <p>            The word secretary us coined from the Latin word “Secretus” which literally means “a secret”. Perhaps it is the fact that aspect if the work of a secretary involve keeping secrets that the secretaries are often regarded as a keeper of secrets.</p> <p>            The National Secretaries Association (United stated of America) defined a secretary as “an assistant to an executive, possessing mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who displays initiatives, exercises judgment and takes decision within the scope of her authority. There is therefore no doubting that fact that the secretary is the wheel on which the executive activities revolve. The secretary is often refereed to as the executive alter ego.</p> <p>1.3       ROLES OF A SECRETARY</p> <p>            The role of the secretary plays in an office is wide and varied depending on the size and type of organization in which she is working. Technological innovation in the office has increasingly made the work of the secretary more complex and sophisticated though a lot easier.</p> <p>            However, there are some of the routine duties a secretary is expected to perform.</p> <p>ARRANGING FOR MEETING</p> <p>            It is the duty of the secretary to arrange for meetings, take accurate minutes of the meeting and type them out neatly.</p> <p>DECISION MAKING AND PROBLEMS SOLVING</p> <p>            H.A. Dauda (1993) The secretary should assist the executive in his decision making and problem solving role. She does this by filtering calls and callers which enables the manager to concentrate fully. She also furnishes her boss with adequate information from files and elsewhere. The secretary should seek as the ears of her boss when he is away and inform him accordingly when he is back.</p> <p>COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION</p> <p>            The secretary joins the manager in his communication processing and dissemination of information. Modern communication and information technology can enable people communicate locally and internationally at the shortest possible time. Local area networks, teleconferences and caller phones are good facilitators of both near and far distant communications. The secretary in particular plays a great role in dissemination of information. He must give adequate and timely information.</p> <p>INTERPERSONAL SKILLS.</p> <p>            Every organization is made up of different kinds of people/business associates, clients, peers and staffs of the organization. It believes on the secretary to develop a good public relations skill by which she grapes quickly the mood of views of all these people and adjust his own responses accordingly such skills include: being a good listener, making people feel at ease and being able to interpret the body movement and signals people display.</p> <p>ORGANIZING THE WORKLAOD</p> <p>            It is the duty of the secretary to organize the method to run the daily workload of the organization. He doubles as the manager’s receptionist, prioritizes the procedure for handling the office mail, operates the various memory aids for checking work progress or those awaiting responses, looking appointments and blocking undesirable visitors and finally maintaining the manager’s diary.</p> <p>MASTERY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT</p> <p>            Mastery of  the communications equipment and the office equipment for use in doing the job is vital. Also she should be able to know the objectives of the firm whether it is profit-oriented, service oriented, operates an expansionist policy or large-scale economics.</p> <p>1.4       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>            Our nuclear age is witnessing an everyday reduction in the number of staff required to perform units of a particular operation due to the development and injection of various communication equipment.</p> <p>            Based on this development it becomes logical to ask if the communication equipment are bringing about changes in the communication role of the secretary.</p> <p>            The problem now to be death with is “Can communication equipment enhance or undermine the efficiency of the secretary”</p> <p>1.5       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The purpose of the study us to</p> <p>a.       Look into the roles a secretary has to play in the m=world of modern communication</p> <p>b.      Identify some of the oral and written communication equipment</p> <p>c.       Determine the effect of communication equipment on the secretary’s efficiency</p> <p>d.      Identify the merits and demerits of the communication equipment and their influence on the secretary.</p> <p>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            This work aims at establishing the roles of a secretary in the world if modern communication. It equally aims at clearing the mind of those who think that secretaries are never-do-well and to make it clear that there is a difference between copy typists and trained secretaries.</p> <p>            Also of importance in this study is the knowledge of the communication equipment to secretaries. Students studying secretarial and business administration respectively are not left out.</p> <p>            The research will also try to allay the fear in some practicing secretaries and students secretaries that advancement of communication technology will have counter-productive effect on the role of a secretary</p> <p>1.8       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The scope of this study is very wide if it has to be carried out in all organizations. Therefore, this research study will be confined to secretaries of (Nigeria Breweries Public Limited Company/Ama Greenfield, 9th mile corner Enugu) NBL. The company has enough of communication equipment and secretaries that operate them.</p> <p>            Moreover the research is centered on this technological age where the innovations seem to take the position of human communication and that id a secretary in an organization. Thus, this research could be described as a modern and computer age study.</p> <p>1.10     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>            The questions are intended to point more on the topic and accordingly supply answers to them</p> <p>1.      What are the roles that a secretary plays in the world of modern communication</p> <p>2.      What are the communication equipment (oral and written) to be found in a secretary’s office.</p> <p>3.      Are the communication equipment bringing about effect on the efficiency of the secretary.</p> <p>4.      Can a secretary cope with such effect/changes brought about by the communication equipment</p> <p>5.      Are the communication equipment of any advantages or positive influence on the secretary.</p> <p>6.      DO demerits of communication equipment have influence on the secretary.</p> <p>1.11     DEFINITION OF TERMS.</p> <p>EXECUTIVES ALTER EGO: This means an assistant to the executive who possesses a mastery of office skills, demonstrate the ability to assume responsibilities with or without direct supervision.</p> <p>TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: These are the modern sophisticated devices that gave communication very wonderful boost.</p> <p>LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN): Is the linking of devices together for sharing information with the aid of terminals.</p> <p>NEVER-DO-WELL: This means unimportant and worthless. Thus, the secretary is not never-do-well but indispensable in every organization.</p> <p>MEMORY AIDS: These are those things/documents which a secretary uses to record appointments viz: diary. Appointment cards, induced memory aid, telephone pad, private notebook, reminder schedule, calendar, mnemonic devices and pocket computer.</p> <p>NUCLEAR AGE: This is the scientific era when weapons

this phenomenon has get in far reaching effect on almost all spheres of human endeavour.</p> <p>Different people have perceptions of what impact the modern technology via the Internet is playing to address the issues of performance of the secretarial profession in the new millennium.</p> <p>To be precise, many scholars have dealt on this topic but the researchers of the project work have tried to portray actually what the impact of the internet is regarding the performance of secretarial profession.</p> <p>The internet according to Cerf, [1996] president of the internet society ‘is a specific collaboration of independently managed networks that allow users at disparate heterogeneous computer networks to communicate with each other across organizational and geographical boundaries.  Its main function in any social system may be identified as information, education, entertainers, discussion, communication and integration.  Therefore, the Internet as an information superhighway has been aroused to perform all these immeasurable impact for the rest of the world.</p> <p>One cannot talk about information and access without making regular reference to the information technologies and their convergence particularly the INTERNET.</p> <p>Information and communication technology are rapidly changing the way we work and live, most especially regarding the way the office is handled.  We see a world of network.  That is bringing new opportunities and options to people at work, at home and on the move directly stating how our society live, work, learn, play and how our society evolves.</p> <p>In the secretarial profession, information and communication are the very essence of the content and that is what the internet is all about.</p> <p>Information derives its value from the meaning that an entity [a human being] assigns to data.  It therefore becomes a performed in an organization.</p> <p>The question now is, how far can this form of inexhaustible resource carry the users with special internet on the secretarial profession.</p> <p>The machines used in the secretarial profession are involved effectively to perform the work in

information gathering system</p> <p>Stressing more on the meaning of the internet and how it works Rutherford F. July 22 1997, described the internet as ‘a global collection of many different types of computers and computer networks that are linked together.</p> <p>The secretarial profession, people who are conversant with the services that the personal computer renders will no doubt find the internet fascinating job-made-easy and enjoyable.</p> <p>But many people cannot purchase or acquire this precious information superhighway, what risks are involved.  Who are supposed to use this inexhaustible resource?</p> <p>The aim of the study is to know the impact of internet more on information and communication in secretarial profession.</p> <p>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>People say or believe that the internet has no impact on secretarial profession.  That secretaries do not need the internet at all.  They also say that secretaries only need the typewriter to carry out their duties.  They also say that if secretaries include the use of the internet in their profession, that work will be tedious.</p> <p>According to Sir Walter Ford, the duty of the secretary is to take down records, minutes of the meetings and typing of orders by the above authorities and it involves the use of the typewriter.</p> <p>Vin Pluto [1990] says thus, ‘the internet is used by high senior officials and those trained personnel and as such the secretaries do not fit into this cadre’.</p> <p>Peter Roberts in his opinion says, ‘the internet and the secretary are not compatible’.</p> <p>So for this very reasons, we have decided to carry out this research work so as to find out the actual impact the internet has on the secretarial profession.</p> <p>1.3              THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>In view of the above problem, this research work is therefore designed to the following;</p> <p>1.                  To find out the impact of internet on the secretarial profession.</p> <p>2.                  To ascertain, the impact of the internet, on the lives of individual secretaries.</p> <p>3.                  To ascertain, if the use of internet facilities, is a monotonous task to the secretary.</p> <p>4.                  To ascertain if there are problems being caused by the internet in the secretarial profession.</p> <p>5.                  To give remedies and solutions to such problems if any.</p> <p>1.4              SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The geographical area covered by the researchers  in Enugu metropolis selected Government parastatals in Enugu State are used as samples on which judging the impact of the internet to the secretarial profession will be based.</p> <p>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>1.                  What are the effects of Internet on the secretarial profession?</p> <p>2.                  What impact does the internet have on a secretary</p> <p>3.                  Does the frequent task of operating a computer everyday bore a secretary?</p> <p>1.6              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>It is important that secretaries should at times take critical look outside their private areas of concentration and state the latest system of improving their techniques at their field of specialization.</p> <p>The study is not only important to the secretary but will also serve as a green light to the entertainment world, education, communication and media practitioners on how to restructure their programmes to suit their receiving audience.</p> <p>It will moreover help the secretary to be abreast with the events taking place within and outside the country.</p> </div>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET ON SECRETARIAL STUDIES IN SELECTED BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET ON SECRETARIAL STUDIES IN SELECTED BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRCAT</p> <p>            The study is aimed at finding a survey of the factors responsible for students poor performance in shorthand in polytechnics in Enugu.</p> <p>            In search of the required information, the researcher administered questionnaires to 100 respondents that made up the population for this study.</p> <p>            The information gathered were presented in tables and analyzed using simple percentage.</p> <p>            A number of factors were identified to be responsible for mass failure of students in shorthand.

This system of education laid more emphasis on vocational courses. Shorthand is a course in secretarial studies that leads to the acquisition of a particular skill and offer workers adequate self-expression, more opportunities for creative thinking and physical manipulation of modern equipments.</p> <p>            Shorthand is one of the main subject offered by secretarial studies department in various tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Unfortunately, many students of secretarial studies or business education (secretarial option) find the mastery of shorthand an obstacle to the realization of their educational ambition. In schools, the study of shorthand has been a difficult task to both students and lecturers.</p> <p>            The lecturers find it uneasy to impact the knowledge to the students, while on the other hand the students find it difficult to master the art as to produce accurate transcription or get to the standard as many required of them. Some of the problems encountered by the students of shorthand include poor knowledge of English, bad typewriters for transcription, bad cassette recorders, lack of interest, poor ventilation, uncomfortable sitting arrangement and poor accommodation etc. which should facilitate shorthand writing. Lack of adequate teaching equipment and fear on the part of the students has prompted the researcher to carry out thus study with a view of finding solutions to these problems. Students treat shorthand like every other subject, they only study it during examination periods and as such perform badly. The reason for choosing shorthand among other subject for this work is because of its importance to the business world and the society at large without adequate alternative.</p> <p>            In the secretarial profession upon which the researcher, will want to base this research, it has been discovered that many people choose the secretarial profession for one reason or the other.</p> <p>            Normally, people are enthusiastic and motivated to perform better in a course of study when they are aware of the benefit they will get from the study of such courses like shorthand, typewriting, audio typing, transcription, computer operation and word processor manipulation.</p> <p>            Whatever be the motivate of the people for doing the course, they should bear in mind that it is very important that the basic shorthand and typewriting that qualifies anybody to be called a secretary, must not be tossed to the wind.</p> <p>            Much has been said in recent years about the declining standard and disappointing examination results in shorthand while this may be some what exaggerated, lecturers are well aware that the performance of many students fall short of their potentials example the result of Institute of management and Technology, Enugu declined seriously in the year 2001 academic session, due to students inability to synthesize and retain what they had learnt in shorthand subject thus being unable to deliver positive result and students negative attitude to the learning of shorthand or is it inadequate teaching of the course and lack of equipment and materials for study.</p> <p>            Despite the fact that shorthand plays a vital role in today’s business transaction, students in secretarial department have beem finding it difficult to put more interest in the course of shorthand which has lead to poor performance of the students in the course (subject shorthand)</p> <p>            Inability of the students to comprehend and concentrate when shorthand dictation is going on are all reason why difference in progress is to be expected.</p> <p>            Another factor that lead to poor performance in shorthand is the student’s poor background in English language because it implies to the students knowledge in the transaction from shorthand dictation.</p> <p>            Considering the above listed factors, shorthand is made up of the following contents</p> <p>-          Vowels</p> <p>-          Consonants</p> <p>-          Diphthongs</p> <p>-          Trip hones</p> <p>This research work aims at finding out the causes of poor performance of students in shorthand examination.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>            Over the years, the general notion has been that shorthand is a difficult subject. Its difficult nature is better imagined than described.</p> <p>            This general notion is a driving force which has led the researcher into the topic: factors responsible for student’s poor performance in shorthand.</p> <p>            Some of the problems student encounter may include but not limited to.</p> <ol><li>The negative or lack of interest of students towards shorthand subject has effect on the students performance</li> <li>Lack of qualified teachers to teach the course</li> <li>Teacher’s inability to use the appropriate methods in teaching the course</li> <li>The teachers attitude towards the student</li> <li>Inability of the student to identify shorthand outlines among others.</li> </ol><p>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The major purpose of this study is to find out the factors responsible for student’s mass failure in shorthand</p> <p>            Specifically, the study will find out:</p> <ol><li>Why students fail shorthand massively</li> <li>Whether students of today have interest in studying shorthand.</li> <li>If the lecturers are qualified shorthand teachers</li> <li>The suitability of the teaching methods used by the lecturers</li> <li>What is responsible for the students inability to identify their outlines</li> <li>Whether lecturers attitude encourages or discourages the students in studying and learning shorthand.</li> </ol><p>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            It is hoped that the research findings will help to know how the students, lecturers, boss, society and institute will benefit if the problem of students poor performance in shorthand is rectified.</p> <p>            It would be significant to students as they will be able to take down minutes or letters in a very shorthand time in their office instead of using longhand in writing. This can make their work more easy and more accurate.</p> <p>            Lecturers can also benefit because they will have little work to do when marking student scripts after examination believing that their students are good in the course.</p> <p>            Also, the boss will benefits if his/her secretary knows her job in the office and can take down notes within a short time and accurately or transcribe shorthand dictation after a meeting.</p> <p>            Secretaries need shorthand skills so as to be competent in performing his/her duties without constant supervision. A secretary that fails to perform well in his/her duties will not succeed.</p> <p>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>            The following research questions will guide the study</p> <ol><li>What are the causes of students massive failure in shorthand</li> <li>How do students demonstrate interest in studying shorthand</li> <li>What are the qualifications of shorthand teachers</li> <li>What are the teaching methods used on teaching shorthand</li> <li>To what extend do students find it difficult to recognize their shorthand outlines</li> <li>What are the lectures attitude to shorthand students.</li> </ol></div>\n\nA SURVEY OF THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR STUDENT POOR PERFORMANCE IN SHORTHAND WRITING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SURVEY OF THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR STUDENT POOR PERFORMANCE IN SHORTHAND WRITING", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>PROPOSAL</p> <p>            Proposal page simply means the summary of the fist three chapters, introduction, literature review and research methodology.</p> <p>            Project Topic: The effect of secretarial job design in FRCN</p> <p>            Job design concerns the content functions and relationship of job that are direct towards the accomplishment of organizational purpose and satisfaction of the personal needs of the individuals job holder. A secretary need a job design strategy that will help her to enhance her potentials as well as achieving organizational goal. Many organization attain little on no importance to the qualities of a secretary, not to talk of giving them a benefiting job design, because secretary is an indispensable management personnel they deserve a job design  that is motivating and satisfying. The main point is that the effectiveness of a secretary job design should be consider.</p> <p>            The main purpose of this study is to find out the effects of improper job design on the secretary job design, strategies that exist in most organization and negative effects on the psychological and psychological life of a secretary. My attention will be given on the following question, what type of job design strategy does the secretary need? What type does the manager adopt mostly? Whether job design effects the performance of a secretary? The guide line of drawing up a job design? The effects of job design on secretarial profession. This will help the managers to understand how an effective job design will improve secretary performance and other people who will want to go into research will also benefits from this work.</p> <p>            This project will cover all categories of secretaries including those who have attained the secretarial status through promotion and advancement in their working place.</p> <p>            It has been observed that most secretaries cannot be perform better due to the kind job design structure and feeling of secretary that their contribution are not recognized etc.</p> <p>            This research will base on how the secretary job will be designed in their place of work. Job design is one of the components of scientific management said by Taylor. Whish means that job should be simplified, standardized and specialized for the required work. Job design should also determine by the situation that the organization find itself dwelling within at a particular time, if job is well designed it will make employee to identify the organizational goal and inspired by its attractive design to be motivated.</p> <p>            Job design is the system of planning or arranging a job, that is drawn an outline from which job contents are made. It is also an outgrowth of job analysis and concern with the design of jobs in order to improve organizational efficiency. There are many factors affecting job design. One of the most common factors is employee dissatisfaction with job that are repetitive, narrow, meaningless and routine. Another one is human relationship resulting as loss of pride in work insecurity etc. in recent years it has been observed with respect to move usual and seeming risky changes to job content which includes; job enrichment, job enlargement and job rotation.</p> <p>JOB ROTATION: This means increases the variety of activities performed by the individual by allowing him to move from the job to another, perhaps at specified intervals.</p> <p>JOB ENLARGEMENT: This represents definite movement away from simplified job by extending the job content to include a wider range of task, which aims at reduction of boredom and stimulating of interest at work to improve satisfaction of esteem needs.</p> <p>JOB ENRICHMENT: This means extend of job contents to provide for greater satisfaction of individuals need and goals by a combination of enlargement autonomy and responsibility.</p> <p>            A description of the research process followed in the study to obtain background information on the organization involves in the study is provided.</p> <p>            In this research the primary and secondary method of data collection will be used and the questionnaire will drawn to achieve mainly tow objectives.</p> <ol><li> <ol><li>Establishment of current form of job design</li> <li>An examination and analysis of the aspects of how this job design affects the secretary’s performance.</li> </ol></li> </ol><p>The sampling method or technique that will be used in the random sampling technique. The tabulation of data will consist of qualitative and quantitative information. The question make protesting will be comprehensive and suitable and in line with the research objectives.</p> <p>            In order to analyze the data gathered. A table will be used and percentage to classifying the opinions of respondent regarding the question asked.</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>            Job design as suggested by Taylor is one of the most important components of scientific management. In its basic format, it assures that jobs should be simplified standardized and specialized for each components of the required work. In general organizations operations aisled this basic job design format by breaking each job down into very small but workable units standardizing the necessary procedures for performing the units, and teaching and motivating workers to perform their job under conditions of high efficiency.</p> <p>            Therefore, the importance of designing jobs and systems of work in a manner that will satisfy both psychological and sociological needs of a secretary should be stressed. That is the effectiveness of a secretary’s job design, effort should consider both the work accomplishment efforts and the secretarial responses of the job.</p> <p>            Empowers job design has the following effect misunderstanding between secretaries and their bosses, lowering status of the secretary etc.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> CHPATER ONE <p>1.0       INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1              Background of the study</p> <p>1.2              Statement of problems</p> <p>1.3              Purpose of the study</p> <p>1.4              Scope of the study</p> <p>1.5              Significance of the study</p> <p>1.6              Research question.</p> CHAPTER TWO <p>2.0              REVIEW OF LITERATURE</p> <p>2.1       Historical background</p> <p>2.2              Factors affecting individual job design</p> <p>2.3              Job enlargement</p> <p>2.4              Job rotation</p> <p>2.5              Job enrichment</p> <p>2.6              Summary of literature review.</p> CHAPTER THREE <p>3.0              DESIGN/METHODOLOGY FOR THE STUDY</p> <p>3.1       Research design</p> <p>3.2              Area of study</p> <p>3.3              Population of study</p> <p>3.4              Instrument for data collection</p> <p>3.5              Validation of research instrument</p> <p>3.6              Reliability of the instrument</p> <p>3.7              Method of data collection</p> <p>3.8              Administration of research instrument</p> <p>3.9              Method of data analysis.</p> CHAPTER FOUR <p>4.0              PRESENTATION OF RESULTS</p> <p>4.1       Summary of result/findings</p> CHPATER FIVE <p>5.0       DISCUSSION IMPLICATION AND RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>5.1              Discussion of results</p> <p>5.2              Conclusions</p> <p>5.3              Implication of results</p> <p>5.4              Recommendation</p> <p>5.5              Suggestion for further research</p> <p>5.6              Limitation of the study.</p> <p>References</p> <p>Appendices.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            Business organization exist because they have goals to attain. It is through people that organizational goals are achieved. In fact people are the most important assets of any organization. Their performance determined the success or failure of an organization. It is the concern of management that workers carry out their task effectively.</p> <p>            Therefore the human factor must be managed properly for positive impact on productivity by provision of a goal. Job design is the way job are structured, designed or tailored towards achievement of organizational goals. Organizations needs job designed that will enhance their performance and help them achieve their self-esteem.</p> <p>            Job design is important to an organization because the way job are structured designed or coordinated has direct and significant impact on the performance of the organization. Job design concerns the content functions and relationships of jobs that are directed towards the accomplishment of organizational purpose and satisfaction of the personal needs of the individuals job holders.</p> <p>            This also showed that a secretary needs a good job design that will help her to enhance her potentials as well as help in accomplishing organizational goals.</p> <p>            Onasanya (1990) stated that the secretary is an important officer in any establishment. The contributions and effectiveness of a secretary can either enhance or diminish the efficiency of an organization. He also stated that the title secretary may either refer to a chief administrator of an organization or to a person who performs the functions of organizing and recording the proceedings of a meeting.</p> <p>            The duties of a secretary could be likened to that of the executive because the secretary is aware of nearly every action of the executive, many organizations attach little or no importance to the qualities of a secretary not to talk of giving them a benefiting job design.</p> <p>            Stanwell and show (1978) defined secretary as an staff who is concerning with the preparation, preservation and transmission of all types of communication as well as the conventional secretarial duties of confidential nature at various levels. Eni (1989) also defined the secretary as a member of clerical staff whose fundamental function are concerned with the preparation of correspondence or communication in all form with and outside the organization.</p> <p>            From the above definitions, it can be seen that secretary is an indispensable management personnel in an organization and outside environment. Considering the job of a secretary in an organization they deserve a job design that is motivating.</p> <p>            Durcker (1978) asserted that an organization needs the best performance a man is capable of and a man needs more than a job he can perform. He need a job that will provide the greatest scope of his abilities and talent the best opportunity for growth and for superior performance.</p> <p>            The secretary position varies widely depending on the size of the organization the number of workers employed, the nature of the business as well as personal qualities. Today the secretary’s job has also been hanged due to computerization their job became more challenging than ever because of the current technological design. A research on job design will not be complete without making mention of motivation. Motivation is a way of stimulating people into action.</p> <p>            Therefore, the redesigning of a secretary job will not only focus on the key job characteristics, dimensions of contents function and relationships, but also considering the important of individual differences in relation to job design consequences.</p> <p>            Birdchall (1975) stated that an understanding of human motivation is essential to the job designer. The job which he creates may be technical depending upon the cooperation and involvement of the job holder. Therefore, he must be aware of the important role of work in a man’s life in order that he is better able to engineer a fit between human needs and technical requirement of the work. Work is an aspect of life which gives man his status and binds him to the society.</p> <p>            Discontent may result from individual failure to find satisfaction in his job not meeting his psychological and social needs. The feeling that his contribution to the organization is not being adequately compensated rewarded or recognized by the organization.</p> <p>            The high level of job specialization promoted by scientific management approach created a number of problems centering on the individual workers moral and behavior example low satisfaction, high absenteeism and low turnover were partially attributed to the boredom and monotony created by highly specialized routine nature of individual employee’s work.</p> <p>            The introduction of an effective job design in the job of a secretary will show improvement in the secretarial job performance. These changes come through job content function, relationship and feedback of jobs.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</p> <p>            These are the problems which the researcher intended to find out the solution at the end of the study.</p> <p>            Most secretaries cannot perform better due to the kind of job design structure given to them.</p> <p>            Sometimes job design given to them create a feeling to them that their contribution are not adequately compensated, recognized or needed in the organization.</p> <p>            They feel demoralized when they see their job as the one that have no definite sequence or procedure for doing it.</p> <p>            Because they feel demoralized or humiliated by their broiling managers they feel they cannot satisfy their psychological and social needs</p> <p>            These problems and so many others are what the researcher intend to find out the solution to in this study.</p> <p>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p>             The following are the purpose of this study <ol><li>To find out the effects of improper job design on secretarial performance</li> <li>To examine some of the job design strategies that exists in most organization.</li> <li>To investigate if secretary’s work is the work that have no definite job design</li> <li>To examine if the work of a secretary is not recognized on given their due entitlement</li> <li>To find out if secretaries cannot satisfy their psychological social needs.</li> </ol><p>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            This simply means the geographical and subject area of the study. The scope of the study is delimited to the effect of job design on a secretarial performance in FRCN Enugu.</p> <p>1.5       SIGNIFCANCE OF THE STUDY.</p> <p>            This study will help managers to understand fully how an effective job design will enhance performance of their secretaries.</p> <p>            It will also help organizations to identify those factors inherent in the secretarial job design that will affect the performance of the secretary and</p> <p>            Finally it will help the students and lecturers in the future as a reference material in the library.</p> <p>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>            Attention will be given to the following questions.</p> <ol><li>What type of job design structure does the secretaries need</li> <li>What type of job design does managers adopt mostly to the secretaries</li> <li>Does these job designs enhance the performance of the secretary</li> <li>What are the guide line for drawing up a job design</li> <li>What are the effect of job design on secretaries performance.</li> </ol></div>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF JOB DESIGN ON SECRETARIAL PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF JOB DESIGN ON SECRETARIAL PERFORMANCE", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The topic of this research is the contributions of modern office equipment.

Secretaries should be sent for further training.</p> <p>-       Organization should procure power generators to ensure that they are always functional.</p> <p>-       Finally, the researcher suggested that further studies could be undertaken on the place of the secretary in the success of business organization in general.    </p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>Introduction                                                                                       </p> <p>1.1              Background of the study                                                       </p> <p>1.2              Statement of problem                                                </p> <p>1.3              Purpose of study                                                                    </p> <p>1.4              Significance of study                                                 </p> <p>1.5              Delimitation of the study                                                       </p> <p>1.6              Assumption of the study                                                       </p> <p>1.7              Research questions                                                                 </p> <p>1.8              Definition of terms                                                                </p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>Literature review                                                                                            </p> <p>2.1              The contributions of modern office equipment</p> <p>            to the secretary’s job efficiency                                                         </p> <p>2.2              Classification of modern office equipment                           </p> <p>2.3              Duties of a secretary                                                              </p> <p>2.4              Problem secretaries encounter in the   use of modern office equipment</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>Research methodology                                                                                  </p> <p>3.1              Design of the study                                                               </p> <p>3.2              Source of data                                                                        </p> <p>3.3              Area of the study                                                                               </p> <p>3.4              Population of the study                                                                     </p> <p>3.5              Sample and sampling technique                                                         </p> <p>3.6              Instrument used for coveting data                                                     </p> <p>3.7              Method of administration</p> <p>            and collection data                                                                 </p> <p>3.8              Method of data analysis                                                        </p> <p>3.9              Validity of research instrument                                 </p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>Presentation and analysis of data                              </p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>Discussion of findings, summary, recommendations and conclusion</p> <p>5.1       discussions of findings                                              </p> <p>5.2       Summary of findings                                     </p> <p>5.3       Recommendations                                                     </p> <p>5.4       Conclusion                                                                 </p> <p>5.5       Limitation of study                                        </p> <p>5.6       Suggestion for further study                          </p> <p>            Reference                                                                   </p> <p>            Appendix                                                                   </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            According to Neuner et al (1972), modern office equipment is the intermediary between the secretary and her Job. It enables her to accomplish more work in few hours with greater efficiency and better Quality. Also Doswell (1978) mentioned that a secretary is capable of working faster and more efficiently with modern office equipment with a minimum of fatigue.</p> <p>            The use of this modern office equipment by a secretary can result in greater output than that of a secretary using manual or under-developed equipment. Highly skilled personnel is sought for in business organization nowadays and to this effect, Russo et al (1980) advocated that the more productive a secretary is, the more the organization can afford to pay with in reasonable limits and hence create employment opportunities for secretaries.</p> <p>            The invention of office equipment necessitated the growth in large enterprise and also a technological break –through. The office, therefore, receives much on sophisticated office equipment in order to cope with the ever- increasing roles in the organization.</p> <p>            It seems, however, that although the higher levels of management might not make much direct use of technology, the secretary. Will. The future for office automation for this job is in providing the secretary with system that meets the real need identified as being important, rather than the ones of typing and stenography that are thought to be important.</p> <p>As against the traditional office, the modern office has a lot of activities to perform with the aid of modern equipment. These day’s uncountable organizations have installed these equipment and the sectaries are present to manipulate some of them in discharging their duties officially. However, modern office equipments which act as improvement tools in the secretary’s job arose from the numerous mathematical calculations done in offices, and the use of the equipment by a secretary can result to a greater output than that of a secretary using manual equipment.</p> <p>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Automation in office emerged to replace work and enhance office efficiency and productivity</p> <p>Today, Secretaries profession has witnessed a marked change in terms of technological advancement. Modern office equipment has taken the toll of events with the growing rate of scientific and technological innovations.</p> <p>            There are office equipment which are used in organization to improve office work and reduce labour costs. They include electric typewriters, computers, telephone, dictating machines, facsimile transceiver, internet and others are tremendously used in offices today.</p> <p>The problem of this study is that now, it has not been known the extent these modern office equipment help the secretary in performing her job, to effectiveness and efficiency.</p> <p>            From the use of these modern office equipment it has also not been know whether these equipment act as important tools in the much –desired secretary’s job Satisfaction.</p> <p>            This research work therefore attempts to find out the contributions of modern office equipments in the advancement of secretarial profession.</p> <p>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY.   </p> <p>The purpose of the study:</p> <p>i.                    To find out the type of office equipment used in Anammco and Enaenite.</p> <p>ii.                  To find out if any of the equipment is modern</p> <p>iii.                To determine the extent the use of these equipments has assisted the secretary in performing their job.</p> <p>iv.                To find out the problems they encounter in using office equipment.</p> <p>v.                  To determine if Anammco management and Emenite management derive any economic advantage from using these machines.</p> <p>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY.</p> <p>            This research would serve as an indicator to employers so as to know the type of modern office equipment needed by the secretary that will be best for maximum efficiency and productivity of secretarial work and the entire organization. It would also serve as a means to ease workload of secretaries in office and bring about job efficiency to secretaries.</p> <p>            Finally, business organization would appreciate the importance of these equipment and thus procure them.</p> <p>1.6       ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The researcher assumes that if modern office equipment were provided in various offices they would contribute to secretarial effectiveness and efficiency.</p> <p>            It is also assumed that the reverse may be the case where secretaries have the skill and there is lack of modern office equipment.</p> <p>The researcher also assumes that if these equipment are provided and the secretaries do not have the competence to manipulate them, their productivity would also be affected.</p> <p>1.7       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>i.          What type of office equipment does Emenite and Anammco      use in their offices?</p> <p>ii.         How many of these equipment are modern?</p> <p>Iii         To what extent has the use of these equipment helped        the secretaries in their jobs?</p> <p>iv.        What problems do the secretaries encounter in the use         of these office equipment?</p> <p>v.         What economic advantage does the Emenite and Anammco derive from using these office equipment.</p> <p>1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>EFFECTIVENESS: The oxford advanced learners dictionary defines effectiveness as having the desired effect, of producing the intended result.</p> <p>  EFFICIENCY: The oxford advanced learners dictionary also defines efficiency as the ability of the people to the work well and without waste of time or resources example, competent and efficient secretary.</p> <p>   EQUIPMENT: The some oxford advanced learners dictionary described equipment as those things needed for particular purpose, example, equipments, are needed in offices for work.</p> <p>ENHANCEMENT: Oxford advanced learners dictionary also explains enhancement as the way to increase or to improve further quality, value or status of something.</p> </div>\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION<div

<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Students industrial work Experience scheme (SIWES) was introduced in 1973 by the Federal Military Government under the auspices and direct supervision of industrial Training fund (ITF).</p> <p>The scheme is presently 32 years old and it is meant for technocrats.</p> <p>            The scheme aimed at exposing students pursuing professional courses in institutions of Higher learning under real office situation, work ethnics and methods.  Today it has covered many disciples and has become a necessary pre-requiring for the award of Higher National Diploma and Degree Certificates in specific disciplines in Institutions of Higher Learning in the country.</p> <p>            In 1985, the scheme was reverted to industrial Training fund (ITF) for Implementation in collaboration with National Board of Technical Education (NBTE) and National Universities commission.  Guidelines were jointly drawn up by the tripartite agencies and since then ITF has continued to ensure the success of the scheme through painstaking supervision of the activities of students in industrial attachment.</p> <p>            Industrial twining could be considered as the opportunity given to students in Higher Institutions to acquire experience in the area of his or her career interest in industries.  In many undergraduates programmes in Nigerian Universities, polytechnics and colleges of education, the motivation, responsibility and opportunity for insight gained through industrial training can be of inestimable value to students future.</p> <p>            Okoye (1992) holds that industrial training helps to develop students public relations especially those who have never worked before they were admitted into higher institutions.  The benefits that students obtain from one year industrial training such as exposure to the larger world of work, practical experience of their career and financial assailable offer additional advantage for their field.</p> <p>            University students of the relevant courses will have three months industrial attachment at the end of part II and part III of their respective courses.  Post graduate students are not eligible.  Polytechnics and colleges of technology students should have four months industrial attachment after their first session and then go for one year industrial training after second year.  This is duly for ordinary National Diploma students.</p> <p>            The main focus of the scheme could hinge on getting employers of labour involved in training their prospective employees.</p> <p>            Thus the scheme is aimed at promoting desired technological know how for the advancement of the nation.  The ultimate goal of the scheme is to develop a well and articulated labour force needed to build a self-reliant economy.</p> <p>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>The students industrial work experience scheme was established to help students gain practical experience in industry in the course of their studies.  There are problems associated with the scheme.  These include the fact that it has not run on been known type of experience students are exposed to in their industrial training.</p> <p>            It has not been known whether the experiences so exposed to are relevant in their prospective career.</p> <p>             It is not certain whether industrial training experience is responsible for some students dropping out to work instead of returning to school for higher studies.</p> <p>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of the study is to:</p> <p>1.                  find out whether students who participate in SOWES receive any practical job training.</p> <p>2.                  find out whether the experience gained during SIWES is useful in their future career.</p> <p>3.                  Determine whether SIWES help to generate a pool of indigenous trainee manpower for like federal poly Oko.</p> <p>4.                  Investigate whether SIWES is responsible for some students dropping to work rather than going back to school in Oko.</p> <p>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The study will be useful to the students in tertiary institutions who are doing their OND in polytechnics and those in part II and part III in universities.</p> <p>In going through this study, the students in Oko will come to take industrial training serious and thereby achieving the best out of it.</p> <p>The head of the institutions of higher learning will come to realize the usefulness and contributions of SIWES in training students as a means of improving the qualities of skilled manpower in Nigeria.  A standard which the limited resources in the institutions cannot provides.</p> <p>Industries also make good use of students in industrial training for the achievement of the organizational goals all for the development of the country.</p> <p>The study will also make federal polytechnic Oko to totally reject any student who does not undergo industrial training before registering for Higher National diploma.</p> <p>            This study will also serve as a useful information to any person who wants to research on related issues.</p> <p>1.5              ASSUMPTIONS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The following assumptions were made in the study; the assumptions were that:</p> <p>1.                  Students go on industrial training after first two years in school and at the completion, they go back to complete their studies.</p> <p>2.                  Students who gained useful experience in the industrial work experience scheme approach office work with ease on their graduation.</p> <p>3.                  students are thoroughly supervised while on industrial attachment.</p> <p>4.                  some students drop out of school after industrial work experince.</p> <p>5.                  students also return to school after their industrial training.</p> <p>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>In the process of carrying out this research work the following research questions were used to guide the researcher.</p> <p>            The study provide answer to the following questions:</p> <p>1.                  What type of practical training do students get in their SIWES?</p> <p>2.                  How far are the experience gained during such SIWES useful to the student future career.</p> <p>3.                  how does SIWES help to generate a pool of trained manpower for our indigenous organizations?</p> <p>4.                  what are responsible for students dropping out of school after their industrial training?</p> <p>1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>For easy understanding to this study, the researcher has taken time to define certain terms in the study.</p> <p>SIWES:</p> <p>            This means students industrial work experience scheme.</p> <p>ITF:</p> <p>            This means industrial training.  It is a programme that exposes students to office life experience and also qualify them for registration of Higher National Diploma and degree courses in polytechnics and universities respectively.</p> <p>ITF:    This means industrial training fund.  This is an agency established by the federal government to provide industrial work experience for certain categories of students in Nigerian universities, polytechnics and colleges of education.</p> </div>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF INDUSTRIAL

class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The institute of management and technology being the case of study of this write up is a great polytechnic of price among others. When this great institute was established a greater part of the management was left in the hands of Europeans, who really gave optimum management to the school affairs. This they did by equipping the created departments with enough equipment for student effective and efficient performance in the various skill courses they engaged in.</p> <p>            Among the departments that was really equipped then was secretarial studies department. This department was fully equipped with the necessary facilities, like typewriters, which were the major equipment of the department. The adequacy of the typewriter, that is, the ratio was a typewriter per a student irrespective of the number of student, they were able to sit each per typewriter during their skill drill. The most impressing factor among other things was the efficiency of this typewriters despite the frequency of usage.</p> <p>            However, as time went, the number of students offering the courses increased tremendously far above the number of these facilities.</p> <p>            The increased in the number of students without a commensurate increase in the number of equipment will surely have an adverse effect on the students standard of achievement and on the teachers who now have to work with inadequate tools.</p> <p>Educational facilities are those equipments used by both lecturers and students to make learning easy and simple. Overtime these are new inventions modernized. In order to adapt to these changes schools must introduce and teach student how to use them.</p> <p>            With time and technological growth, business organizations are increasing the scope of their business and consequently the duties of secretaries are increasing. Facilities are therefore needed to overcome the difficulties and ensure effective and efficient performance of their study. This is a frame of reference on which facilities are concluded.</p> <p>            The use of educational facilities in every school is today the driving forces for change. Man has been using facilities in one way or the other throughout the history of man’s existence on earth.</p> <p>            Educators at all level from the government to private school, colleges and polytechnics  as well as universities, have recognized the impact of the facilities on business/offices and have had the foresight not only to recommend but in many instances to require that student’s planning to enter the business world at any level, and in any capacity should be exposed to the study and possible manipulation of these facilities as that would enhance their chances in life.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>            The department of secretarial studies of I.M.T., Enugu was established in 1973, and ever to produce competent and high qualified secretaries to handle secretarial function various offices.</p> <p>            This department unlike other department of the school can be said to be a practical department which needs equipment and facilities more than only other department in the school. These aids which make it easier for systematic training, acquiring knowledge and abilities as well as developing character and mental powers are indispensable in secretarial department.</p> <p>            Over this years however there had been an increase in student intake into the department.  Also overtime these facilities have become old, obsolete and out-dated. With the advent of modern technology ands changes in offices equipment and systems, one then wonders whether the department is able to maintain required standards. How prepared is the department to meet current needs of the modern office? Do they have the necessary facilities electronic typewriters, computers, modern communication gadgets, etc, which they should be using in training. These and many more are what this research topic seek address.</p> <p>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY/OBJECTIVE</p> <p>            For every action, these must be reason and in the light of this, the main purpose of our study is to find out and x-ray the causes and effects of educational facilities on the academic performance of secretarial students. Other purpose are:</p> <p>1.         To know whether the department of secretarial studies has adequate educational facilities to train their students.</p> <p>2.         To know what are the causes if the answer to number 1 is in the negative such inadequacies.</p> <p>3.         To know what efforts have been made to provide these facilities to these department.</p> <p>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY/IMPORTANCE</p> <p>            This project is written to serve the beginning and advanced secretarial students. It will provide them with a basic understanding of what they should know, how they can use facilities in their professional endeavour. This study covers these requirements to equip students to know how to communicate their needs and requirements to the data processing personnel in their organizations.</p> <p>            It is also beneficial to lecturers, hence it will lessen their burden in lecturing the students and at the same time improve their knowledge and ability to mental power. Also to the department and management, hence they will be proud. They can be recommend their student secretaries to any company or offices with no doubt of poor performance. Hence the good name come to them.</p> <p>            To the parents and general public, in that their job will be done by experts who are training with modern equipment/facilities and will not feel strange to any modern machine in the organization.</p> <p>            The Nation also will benefit from these for the graduates will be of great use and can redress the economic situation of the country</p> <p>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>1.         What are the modern educational facilities required by the department of secretarial studies.</p> <p>2.         Why is the department lacking these facilities equipment?</p> <p>3.         Is the department really in need of those facilities?</p> <p>4.         Are these facilities available in other departments of the school?</p> <p>5.         Is the school management aware that such things are lacking for the lacking of this department?</p> <p>6.         Who is responsible for the lacking of this department or the school management?</p> <p>7.         How does this set back the academic performances of the students?</p> <p>8.         Is the public also affected by this problem of poor?</p> <p>9.         What efforts has been made to provide this to this department?</p> <p>10.       What are the possible solutions to be taken into consideration to achieve a good result?</p> <p>11.       How would the public and students benefit from this, if a good result is achieved?</p> </div>\n\nEFFECT OF INADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIAL STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF INADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIAL STUDENTS", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <div> <p>INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The whole universe include our country, are so much on the brink of this immense technology. It has gotten a far reaching effect on almost all human endeavour.</p> <p>            Most people understood what impact, the modern technology, (INTERNET) is playing to address the issue of performance on the secretarial profession in this new era.</p> <p>            Truly, most learned and talented scholars have commented so much on this topic. But the researchers of this project work, have tried to portray in a special way, the impact of the internet with regards to the performance of the secretarial profession.</p> <p>            The internet is a specific collaboration of independently managed networks that allow its users at disparate heterogeneous computer net works to communicate with each other across organization and geographical boundaries. Its main function in any social system may be identified as information, education, entertainers, integration, discussion and communication. Therefore, the internet as a super high way in collecting and accessing of information, has been arouse to perform all these immeasurable impact for the rest of the world.</p> <p>            To be precise, one cannot talk about information and access, without making regular reference to the information technologies and its convergence, that is the internet. This information and communication technologies are rapidly changing the ways are work and live, most especially with regards to the way the office is been handled. We see a world of networks that is bringing new opportunities and options to people at work, at home and on the more directly stating how our society live, work, play, learn and how the involves.</p> <p>            In secretarial profession, information and communication are the very essence, and that is what internet is all about. Information values are been derive from an entity whom data is assign to it, therefore, becomes a commodity and indeed the lifeblood of every activity that is performed in an organization.</p> <p>            Stressing more on the meaning of the internet and how it works, the April 10, 2002, issue of “Awake” magazine describe the internet as a global collection of many different types of computers and computer networks that are linked together. The question now is, how far can this form of inexhaustible, resource carry the users with special internet in the secretarial profession.</p> <p>            More over, in this profession, people who are more acquainted and conversant with the services that the personal computer renders, will no doubt, find the internet fascinating jobs made easy and enjoyable. And people who are financial incapacitated and are unable to acquire this precious super high way information gathers what risk are involved, whoa re supposed to use this inexhaustible resource?</p> <p>            The aim of this study is to know more in the impact of internet on information and communication in secretarial profession.</p> <p>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>            Generally, people think that the internet has no impact on secretarial profession, it is also their believe that secretaries have no need for the internet at all, rather, they say that secretaries prefer using typewriter in carrying out their duties their than the internet that secretaries including internet in their profession, makes their works to be hectic. In view of this, so many scholars have the same opinion that internet is of no use to secretarial profession. According to Plato, the internet is used by high senior officials and those trained personnel and as much, secretaries do not fit into that cadre. While Ford Walter, in his own stressed that the primary duties of a secretary is to note down the minutes of meetings, take down records and as well carrying out orders from the authorities and it involves the use of the typewriter”. Also, this was design to know, whether internet facilities is a monotonous task to secretaries and whether it is of any impact to individual secretaries and their lives.</p> <p>            For this and many more reasons, we have decided to look into this and carry out a research work to find out whether it is true that this internet is of no importance to secretarial profession, and as well find out the actual impact the internet has to secretarial profession.</p> <p>THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY         </p> <p>            In view of the above problems earlier stated, this research work is therefore designed as follows:</p> <p>(a)                To look and find out the impact of internet in the secretarial profession.</p> <p>(b)               To ascertain if there are problems being caused by the internet in secretarial profession.</p> <p>(c)                To know actual, impact of the internet in the lives of individual secretaries.</p> <p>(d)               To ascertain if the use of internet facilities is a monotonous task to the secretary.</p> <p>(e)                To provide remedies and solution to such problems.</p> <p>SCOPE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>            The geographical area covered by the researchers is Enugu metropolis. Some selected Banks in Enugu State are used as samples in which judging the impact  of the internet to the secretarial profession, will be based.</p> <p>RESEARCH QUESTIONS </p> <p>(a)                What are the effect of internet on the secretarial profession in Enugu metropolis?</p> <p>(b)               What are the problems encountered by the secretaries in using internet facilities?</p> <p>(c)                Does frequent task of operating a computer everyday become bore to the secretary?</p> <p>(d)               What are the impact of internet to a secretary?</p> <p>(e)                How can all these problems be solved?</p> <p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            It is important that secretaries should at times take critical look outside their private area of concentration and state the interest system of improving the techniques of their field of specialization.</p> <p>            This study is not only imperative to the secretaries, but will also serve as a green light to the entertainment world, education, communication and media practitioners, on how to restructure their programmes to suit their receiving audience.</p> <p>            It will moreover, help the secretary to be abreast with the events taking place within and outside the country.</p> </div>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET ON SECRETARIAL PROFESSION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET ON SECRETARIAL PROFESSION", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <div> <p>A lot of employees think that their secretaries are not producing as much as they should. That they are not working up to maximum capacity where as there is room for improvement in their job performance. In order for any organization to achieve its basic objectives, it must lay strong emphasis on the way it observes the environmental factors that affect their organizations as a whole and that of the secretary in particular.</p> <p>Efficient performance is contingent upon the proper match between he secretary and the job on the other hand and the environmental factors or physical conditions affecting her performance on the other hand. In this research work, attempt were made to identify and analyze the good physical factors influencing secretary’s job performance. The project  is divided into five chapters. Chapter one covered the general introduction, statement of problem, working hypothesis, purpose of the study scope of the study, and determination. Chapter two death with the review of related literature.

It is obvious to everybody, that the work of a secretary is very delicate and confidential, and as such, a healthy environment is necessary enable the secretary operates effectively.   </p> <p>A secretary whose office is equipped with communication gadgets as telephones, fax etc cooling gadgets, as fans, air conditions, fridge etc including execrative upholstery chairs and table is therefore regarded as an extra senior service worker by her unfortunate colleagues who unknowingly or out of ignorance does not know that hey deserve more than mentioned above for maximum productivity but rather retard progress thereby constitution a cry in the wheel of progress of such as establishment.</p> <p>An understanding of effect of office environment in enhancing the secretary’s morals is necessary in every organization, he/she is an indispensable staff and as such, management should place high priority on work motivation. This influences the amount of work, interest and happens  of secretaries.</p> <p>The provision of adequate and proper physical conditions in the office cannot be over emphasized.  Secretaries tend to be happier when hey work in a quiet, cool and inspiring environment, but hey are unhappy and suffers from mental strain when the physical conditions are poor or inadequate.</p> <p>Physical conditions refer to those things in the office that enable workers to work for periods without fatigue and distraction, so that work can be carried out effectively and efficiently.</p> <p>It should be bone in mind that most office work is as the accounts clerks job of putting figures together or the secretary’s job and others.</p> <p>However, the increasing sophistication of modern office machines and self awareness towards the maintenance of a more co-operate image have resulted in management looking more critically at the environment of secretaries work place “in encyclopedia”.</p> <p>The term secretary is derived from a Latin word “secrtarum” which means a confidential office. He is one ot whom secrets are entrusted and he has to maintain secrecy of the work he deals with.</p> <p>According to Act, 1980. sec 2 (45) states that a secretary means “one whose office is to write for another; especially one who is employed to conduct correspondence, to keep records and to transactrarions other business for another person or for a society, corporation or public body.”</p> <p>“Environment” in the management context consists of office building the furniture and layout, the physical conditions under which secretaries operate, lighting, ventilation, decoration, sound, proof, safety measure and so on. The influence of work environment on secretaries has become so recognized that management now calls it science of “ergonomics”.</p> <p>Experience has shown that secretaries cannot be happy if the ventilation is poor. Work is likely to suffer and in accuracy would result if the lighting is poor. The noise from machine and visitors constitute a barrier to a secretary’s efficiency. Example of an ideal office should be measured with that of the secretary to director Nigeria Bottling Company Plc Enugu. All these have strong bearing on the secretary morale and work productivity.</p> <p>The promulgation of the office, shops and railways premises Act of 1963, is a milestone in the advancement of good working condition. Management therefore has duty of providing a comfortable environment which is pleasure and conducive.</p> <p>1.2              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study is  meant to investigate the following.</p> <p>The effect of the depressing and unstimulating nature of the office on the morals and productivity of the secretary.</p> <p>The effect of he physical factors such as office surroundings on the secretary’s morals to work.</p> <p>The importance of providing a good proper working environment for the secretary.</p> <p>The problems caused by lack of these good physical condition on the secretary productivity.</p> <p>Finally, to see to what extent the office environment affect the concentration of the secretary.</p> <p>1.3              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The secretary no doubt occupies a very important position in an organization and her inability to discharge her duties very well have an adverse effect on the image of the organization.</p> <p>Also a secretary’s moral boosted by the type of environment she works in. therefore, for a secretary to be able to perform her duties efficiently and effectively, she should be provided with a pleasant and conducive environment to work in.</p> <p>Presently, there are many problems encountered by secretaries with regards to their environment, and other facts like poor physical conditions in an office, lack of private office.</p> <p>Secretaries in business organization share offices with other staff. Sometimes, where one is lucky to be assigned any, there is always no privacy.</p> <p>In some organization, a secretary may be lucky to have a private office, but that office will be an entrance to his / her boss’s office.</p> <p>The study is to investigate the effect of poor conditions and lack of offices, how it affects the productivity of the secretary and find ways of enhancing her productivity.</p> <p>1.4              SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>A lot of organizations are now aware that secretaries need to be settled comfortably in order to ensure high productivity in the organization.</p> <p>Much has been said and written about he best way to ensure secretary’s high job performance and many people have argued that those secretaries have to be adequately motivated in order to ensure effective job performance on their part.</p> <p>They outlined such motivational incentives as increase in salaries and wages, priorison of certain social amenities such as free medical facilities, ensuring effective job performance among the secretaries and workers in general. All those motivational incentives no debt facilitates high job performance among secretaries, but it depends on the environmental factors affecting the organization.</p> <p>The study therefore, be of immense value to the management of Nigeria Bottling Company and PZ Company Services as well as other organizations and also to the secretaries at large, especially those who do not recognize that he environment under which the organization operate will in any way affect their performance.</p> <p>1.5              SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Some organization do not realize that the environment under which their business operation has anything to do with the secretary’ job performance. Their belief is that only the motivational incentives administered adequately will confluence the secretary’s job performance.</p> <p>This study will benefit management readers or the staff counterparts responsible for improving secretarial service operations by helping them using the items.</p> <p>A management can usually benefit by holding all aspects service system operations up to standard.</p> <p>It will also benefit future secretaries of Nigeria Bottling Company (NBC). It hoped that the management will improve the office conditions of the secretaries, so that the secretary will have cause to smile broadly and improve in their productivity.</p> <p>For other employers of labour, this should help them to know better how their work will fit into a production environment, and the environmental considerations that should be studied when planning for personnel includes the physical element of lighting and the whole subject of design.</p> <p>The result help to establish a realistic / service having a guide to management responsibilities as a background for analysis.</p> <p>This study will benefit both the management and secretaries to improve their productivity</p> <p>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>1)                  Does the depressing and unstimulating nature of the office have negative effect on the morale and productivity of the secretaries?</p> <p>2)                  Does the small floor space and the congested nature of the office affect the secretary’s morale and attitude to work.</p> <p>3)                  What effect do  air conditions and floor covering in most offices of the secretaries moral and work productivity?</p> <p>4)                  What effect do lighting and ventilation have on the morals and productivity of the secretaries.</p> <p>5)                  How does the relationship between the boss, others and the secretary affects the secretary’s environment.</p> <p>1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p><em>SECRETARY:</em> A secretary is the image make of any organization for without a secretary, an organization is incomplete.</p> <p>According to Barrister N. A. Obodo 1998 He defined secretary as an executive assistance who secretary as an executive assistance who possesses the mastery of skills, who demonstrate ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who exercise initiative and judgment, who make decision within the scope of assigned authority.</p> <p>In enclopedea, the term secretary is derived from a Latin word “secreterum” which means a confidential officer. He is one to whom secrets are entrusted and he has to maintain secrecy of the work he deals with.</p> <p><em>OFFICE</em><em>: </em>In every well organized business there is the need for the record of its activities to be kept and protected. It is the office that such activities are carried out and its records kept.</p> <p>The term “office” was defined firstly by Geoffery Whitehead, as a room or building where clerical processes are carried out to start, develop and control the many activities of business. Ronald Warson et al, defined the office as “the place where information is received sorted, acted upon, file and passed on”.</p> <p><em>OFFICE ENVIRONMENT: </em>Environment consists of the office building, its furniture and layout as well as the physical conditions under which workers do the jobs, it is also concerned with the external factors as the business which the office services, the industry or other activities within which business lies, the custom and laws of the community within which business operates. These environment factors are always changing and the office must react to change with them.</p> <p>When we are talking about office environment, we talk bout physical things in an environment. What you can see, something that enable you to work fine. Cleanliness of a place, or duty environment.</p> </div>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF OFFICE ENVIRONMENT ON THE MORAL AND PRODUCTIVITY OF SECRETARIES IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF OFFICE ENVIRONMENT ON THE MORAL AND PRODUCTIVITY OF SECRETARIES IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <div> <p>The research work was based on the problems of ineffective communication in business organization, a case study of Vetco Gray Nigeria Limited, Port-Harcourt.

It is the life wire and the key to success of all business organizations.</p> <p>            Communication involves everybody, it is the pivot upon which the existence of human and business organizations revolves, and based on this, the issue of communication has developed into a major area of study and formidable social force.</p> <p>            Eyre (1983), stated that “communication is not just the giving information, it is the giving of understandable information, it is the giving of understanding the message”.</p> <p>            Bernard (1938), saw communication as “the means by which people are linked together in an organization to achieve a common goal”. When there is a link between people towards achieving a common goal there is communication. In a business organization, if a manager is to relate to his subordinates, he must communicate effectively. If an organization wishers to stay in business and enjoy high patronage; there must be effective communication. Also, if management wants its decisions implemented, it must communication its policies and programmes effectively. The questions one faces are: -</p> <p>(1)          What is effective communication all about</p> <p>(2)          What are the possible means to avoid the problems of ineffective communication? And</p> <p>(3)          What are the strategies to adopt to achieve effective communication.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>            Inefficient communication constitutes a major problem to any organization. It goes a long way in preventing such organization from achieving the set objectives. Irrespective of the different perspective one may look at it, be it from the angle of the employee or the employer, it is always believed that inefficient communication is unfavourable towards the realization of the organizational goals.</p> <p>            Some of the problems associated with ineffective communication in a business organization using my case study as an example are,</p> <p>(1)          lack of proper channels of communication throughout which information is obtained. This explains why there still exists situations were minor problems which could be solved by simple dialogue between the workers and the management most times lead into major problems which cause some set back in the company.</p> <p>(2)          Secondly, the organization is not willing to carry its employees along, through sharing of information on management decisions. This gave way for workers to receive and give information from the grave vine rumours, and rumour being unhealthy development brings about negative opinion and also leads to unfavourable reaction to the organizational problems. The business organizations I am researching on, being a manufacturing and service company, often run out of stock of raw materials, this explains why productions is not carried out as scheduled, no other genuine reason could be given for this lack of raw materials but inefficient communication which breeds negative development in an organization. And as we all know disrupted production does not enhance regular payment of workers salaries and motivation and when workers are hungry, they go unhealthy about the organization who does not truly see communication as vital aspect of communication gap is bound to suffer.</p> <p>1.3       PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>            This research work is embarked upon for the following purposes:</p> <p>(1)          To find out the problems caused by ineffective communication in an organization.</p> <p>(2)          To find out the strategies which could enhance effective communication in organization.</p> <p>1.5       Significance of the Study</p> <p>This research work is aimed at using the most effective means of communication and its impact on all aspects of human and business activities. The result of this research work will also help business organizations know the strategies and how to implement it to enhance effective communication in organization, and also how to reduce the barriers to effective communication.</p> <p>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>            The following questions were produced to guide the researcher towards a meaningful and unbiased result:</p> <p>(1)          What are the problems caused by ineffective communication in organizations?</p> <p>(2)          What are the strategies employed by organizations to enhance communication?</p> </div>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS OF INEFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN AN ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS OF INEFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN AN ORGANIZATION", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <div> <p>            A lot of us after graduating from our schools of higher learning are still ignorant about what it takes to work with people in an organization nor so they posses any knowledge of psychology.</p> <p>            Most of the executives, especially the secretaries we are focusing our attention on, can recite a set of rules when asked how to handle a specific situation, but are at a loss when human relations function are relegated to the background, the effect on an organization will be counter productive especially if the staff do not know and follow the laid down procedures of human relations.</p> <p>            Therefore, this research paper will most importantly on how the secretary assumes her responsibilities in the office environment can apply human relation skills in working with subordinate and her boss, and also to achieve the desired objectives expected of her.</p> <p>            A good number of secretaries were interviewed with their bosses and subordinated and questionnaires were administered to them. This was to find out the impact of human relation functions on job performance of personal secretaries in financial institutions. The research was carried out in Enugu urban in Enugu state. The result was most successful in the sense that most secretaries and bosses interviewed agreed that it was an issue that required a lot of attention, especially in our institutions of higher learning.</p> <p>            Although some people felt that the name secretary is out-dated and is such should be scrapped for something or a name more appropriate and as well should be accompanied with a higher profile job description and specification.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION <p>1.1              Background of the study</p> <p>1.2              Statement of the problem</p> <p>1.3              The purpose of the study</p> <p>1.4              Significance of the study</p> <p>1.5              Scope of the study</p> <p>1.6              Research questions</p> CHAPTER TWO REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE <p>2.1              Definition of human relation</p> <p>2.2              Methodical approach to human relation</p> <p>2.3              Summary</p> CHAPTER THREE <p>3.1              Research methodology</p> <p>3.2              Research design</p> <p>3.3              Are of study</p> <p>3.4              Population of the study</p> <p>3.5              Sample</p> <p>3.6              Sources of data</p> <p>3.7              Development and administration of data</p> <p>3.8              Research instrument</p> <p>3.9              Procedure for the statistical</p> <p>3.10          Analysis of data.</p> CHAPTER FOUR <p>4.1              Analysis, Findings, and Interpretation of data</p> CHAPTER FIVE <p>5.1              Summary of findings</p> <p>5.2              Conclusion</p> <p>5.3              Recommendation</p> <p>References</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>Appendix</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            One of the basic problems in the society si just how workers should be motivated to achieve the goals in our industries. It is not an easy thing to go by since a little percentage of workers derive slight personal satisfaction from the jobs and enjoy little sense of accomplishment or creativity</p> <p>            This is why Carvel F.J in his book “Human Relation in Business” stated that in “Large organization people work together, follows instructions and order they do not understand” just few workers have the opportunity of self-expression or freedom. Then the question remains, how could this employees satisfy their personal need and that of the organization they are working with.</p> <p>            How can the secretary motivate workers at all levels of the organization? This was the saying of those who are old in the profession but to the way they view it, as frustrating and unrewarding. The young workers who faces the prospects of going to work with great fear of uncertainty (lack of understanding as regard to the new job or even inexperienced ones, need to develop their behavior which will help them adopt to the conditions of the job)</p> <p>            The best approach for a secretary to apply is the scientific and methodological system of human relations to achieve the desired goals and objectives of her organization. It is quite obvious that human relations deals with the interaction of a wide range of circumstances and of course social setting but I am going to limit this to the office conditions especially in financial institutions.</p> <p>            Carvel F.J (1977) say “That human relations can be pleasant and rewarding” the relationship between a secretary and co-worker, the boss and others even customers in her working environment should be very cordial in her day to day dealings. This he said will be compared with that of husband and wife, lecturers and students parents and their children.</p> <p>            Human relations is vital because it creates avenue for people to interact with both in offices and other parastatals because it has an influence over the nature and manner with which individual work out solutions to the problems in which they are confronted with.</p> <p>            The secretary with his or her psychological skills is also expected to understand different moods of co-workers, customers, the work conditions and how to arrest difficult situations in the office, how to get the best from his present group and how to take care of unexpected situation successfully.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</p> <p>            For a good number of reasons, secretaries in some of our financial institutions have been finding it very difficult to cope with the performance of their function as it regards to human relations. This has generated a lot of problems for secretaries.</p> <p>            Some of the situations are witnessed when an intolerant boss makes a mistake in the course of his duties with the secretary, but fails to admit such mistakes, rather he costs the blames on the secretary.</p> <p>            Struggling to meet up with the demands of these disgust executives as well as maintaining a good relationship with each other and at the same time keeping up with the demands of the job is stressful to the secretary.</p> <p>            Again lack of fact in performing official duties by the secretary constitute a very big problem, for instance when answering phone calls, secretaries with poor relationship radiate this attitude to phone callers.</p> <p>            This equally applied when handling clients affairs, because some secretaries by their positions in financial institution do not take cognizance of the client due to inefficiency in their job.</p> <p>            In that regards Carvel F.J (1972) say “That a problems arises when the boss finds the secretary sexually attractive. This he says creates room for insolent secretary and an awkward office relationship now prevails.</p> <p>            In this regard the researcher will try to find the solutions to these problems as it affects the secretary.</p> <p>1.3       THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p>             The purpose of this study is to <ol><li>Highlights the fact that every one in the course of work comes in close contact with people.</li> <li>Understand the meaning of work and its impact on people</li> <li>Understand the background and development of human relations.</li> <li>Understand the impact of human relations function on job efficiency</li> <li>Understand the role of secretaries in organization development.</li> </ol><p>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUSY</p> <p>            The study of the impact of human relation functions on job performance of secretaries in financial institutions is such that would have taken the researcher to different parts of the country.</p> <p>            But as a result of financial problems and time factor the researcher decided to ,limit the study to Enugu Urban.</p> <p>1.5       SIGNFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The significance of this study will be of tremendous aid to various institutions of higher learning in Nigeria, to know the importance of human relations in organizations. This will go a long way to propelling the various business organizations in the country to appreciate the need for effective training of secretaries and staff on human relations.</p> </div>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF HUMAN RELATIONS ON THE JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF HUMAN RELATIONS ON THE JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <div> <p>Is the computer really a new frontier opportunity and means to solve our problem is it of any help to management information system. </p> <p>It is the aim of research work to concentrate on computerization of management information system application of computer to customer billing system in NITAL Plc and application of computers to any transaction.

Thus, the abuse adding machines and slide rule are all forms of calculating derives.</p> <p>The definition of computer has become more limited in a contemporary range.</p> <p>A computer is now define as an electronic device that process data and it is capable of receiving input and output and posses such characteristics as high speed, accrual and the ability to store a set of instructions for solving a problems.</p> <p>The computer took over centuries to endure, undergoing four generations, reckoning from time to time, serious efforts began toward simplifying mathematical computation. Quite a few people were involved in the eventual development of the computer and several of the scientists who made those useful contributions did not really aim at developing a computer extremely important to computer development. Four inventions and innovation were particularly useful in development of computers. These are contributions of Joseph Jacquard Charles babbage, Alar Trwnning and John Von Nenman.</p> <p>Between 1802 and 1804, Joseph Jacquard, a French textile manufacturer developed the Jacquard card to hold textile design information in form of brining patterns which revealed some of the advantage of using binary nations in machine design and data storage.</p> <p>This intention and innovation challenged other scientist, which led Charles Babbae to exploit the advantages of Jacquard innovation to invent the Difference engine and Analytical engine. This earned him the name father of modern computers. These engines were essentially for general purpose computation but they suffered a limitation of non-discovered of an electronic switch.</p> <p>In 1937, Alar Trunning showed that a computer can be build with a set of simple instruction which any problem having a logical solution can reduced to a solution based upon a small set of simple instruction. A few years later (1940) John Von Nowana set out a summary of the design requirement for a modern computer as follows.</p> <p>i)                    Binary codes should be used to represented data and instruction in a way that makes no distinction of the two and stall allow them, the storage space in the computer.</p> <p>ii)                  The ability of the computer to process these data and instruction which include the use of programmes and modified programmes accordingly.</p> <p>Based on these contribution and innovations of these scientist and others, the modern computer came to be. It underwent series of improvement which gave rise to fourth computer generation before we have today modern computer.</p> <p>However, the introduction of their general derive and machine and simpler programming langrage greatly increased the computer utility especially in management information system (MIS) which basically doodles on how information is obtained, retried and utilized hence computers are now indispensable tools of business, because electronic data processing or the use of computers I grooving and is capable of meeting the need of it’s and security and extends to other area such as marketing, accounting, inventory management and production process and office automation.</p> <p>Finally, there modern computers are still undergoing impartment which the computer age is experiencing a digital revolution which has now transformed the end of the last one and greatly improving the management information system of today’s.</p> <p>It is said that to manage the organization is to mange its future. How can the future be managed? The answer clearly is that the future can be managed through timely procurement of relevant reliable information system. The whole lot of activities therefore ranging from information procurement through it’s collation, valuation and analysis to feedback makeup what can be seen as a system. This type of system in management is known as management information system (MIS).</p> <p>Management information system is the formal process of data collection organization analyzing, procession, and dispensing of information in internal and external within the organization in an effective and efficient manner. It entails not only any organized and integrated approach at placing relevant and timely information on the denk of the managers for decision making, but also the control and accessibility of such information. At any point in time as may be demanded by  management (Wilkinson 1993).</p> <p>Primary, the management information system (MIS) is set up for the purpose of providing, planning and controlling information to all levels of management to effect appropriate decision making. Thus, it does by gathering data, inputting and processing them into information and further disseminating these ideas of information to management in form of financial as well as non-financial information system and the personnel information system depending on the type of organization.</p> <p>This management information system provides management with varying information depending on the level thereby making for increase in the efficiency of the organization through better management decision, more effective utilization of resources and increase profits better.</p> <p>A management information system perform four basic functions.</p> <p>a)                  Collection of data from a variety of sources: This means obtaining facts such as records of day today transactions either by observation or research from both external and internal source.</p> <p>b)                  Sufficient organization of data” Accessing and storing data in database: A database is an organized collection of data for instruction. An ordinary handwritten address is example of a simple manually datable.</p> <p>c)                  Data procession into information upon which to be used by management. Data is stored analyzed, compared, calculated and generally, worked onto producing messages in the form required by the managers, which form required by the manager, which is then termed information. </p> <p>d)                 Presenting data in a meaningful and useful form. This could be means of various kinds of reports including statistical reports such as sales analysis and control information such as variance reports.</p> <p>However, owning to the fact that organization has grown in size, the information flow has become so voluminous that face to face communication and even writer memoranda can no longer effect adequate communication or effective processing of data. The management information system of these organization have in recent times found it difficult to meet with the increasing demand being made on it for information as a result, the manual means of operation is jam-packed with scores of data to be processed. Hence delay and inaccuracies in data collection and analysis. Also there is problem of misappropriation of important document of files or even cases of Stolen Files.</p> <p>These lapses amongst others parts a question mark on the manually assisted management information system hence solution have been sought in the introduction of mechanization with particular reference to the use of computer.  </p> <p>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS </p> <p>In recent years, technology change have been introduced by many organizations. One of such is the advent of computers and it is being adopted by managers in many organization to help increase efficiency and output, to provide greater consumer and consumer satisfaction and to improve the management information system by manipulation, processing and distribution of data and other problem that in previous IMS were attended with difficultly.</p> <p> Investigation has shown that before the introduction of computers in the management information system (MIS) in the department of NITEL Plc Enugu the manually operated management information system in vogue then indicated lapses, which often beat the imagination on matters, consequently, the processes of decision making was almost reduced to grass root due to the essence of the effective and enduring information effective and enduring information storage and retrieval system. This affected the general productivity of NITEL Plc Enugu.</p> <p>However with the computerization of the management information system (MIS) in Nitel, not only was the problem of competence in decision making eradicated but also information storage and retrieval system become effectively and efficiently fit. But has NITEL Plc been fairly and well improved with the computerization of its management information system.</p> <p>The researcher seeks to know the impact of computerization of the management information in Nitel on profitability level of the organization.</p> <p>1.3              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The objectives of this study are as follows: </p> <p>1)                  To determine whether there is improvement in MIS in Nitel Plc since it has been computerized.</p> <p>2)                  To expose those areas in which management of computerized firm has failed to take advantage.</p> <p>3)                  To uphold or day some presumption that have existed around the computer, that is to know if computer displace people form their job.</p> <p>4)                  To know how the introduction of computer has solved the latent problem of the manual system.</p> <p>5)                  To know the extent of fraudulent practice in Nitel Plc.</p> <p>1.4              SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>This study is confined to the  management information system in NITEL Plc Enugu, with a particular reference to the designated are a of management information system which controls customers billing system. The adoption of the billing system will help in providing the relationship between the billing system and the profitability level.</p> <p>1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The satisfactory operation and control of an organization rests to a great extend on information or data. Data processing for business is not an end itself but it is used by the management to assist in achieving it’s objectives which is providing good and services, making profits, dealing fairly with employees, customers, suppliers and satisfying legal requirement regarding the keeping of records. This could enhanced by the introduction of the computer in management information system.</p> <p>This project will highlight the importance of computer on the management information system and heighten the emphasis by companies the computerized system of operation to the manual. Where as this work appears to be more beneficial to those in the management cadre. It is hoped that person with septennial knowledge of management will find it valuable.  </p> <p>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>1.                  Has the computerization of the MIS in Nitel Plc Enugu actually improved?</p> <p>2.                  Are customers effectively and satisfactorily served better now with the computerization of Nitel?</p> <p>3.                  Has computer in any way displace people form their job?  </p> <p>4.                  Before now, how is their profitability level and at present any improvement.</p> <p>5.                  Has fraud been mitigated in Nitel Plc</p> </div>\n\nTHE RELEVANCE OF COMPUTER IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE RELEVANCE OF COMPUTER IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <div> <p>            This study reveals that the problems of Cyber-cafes in Delta state, Nigeria by means of questionnaires</p> <p>            Data were collected from Cyber-cafes, frequency counts and simple percentages were used to analyze the data generated.</p> <p>            Findings revealed the problems militating against internet services in the cyber-cafes as well as some recommendation that can facilitate the operations of cafes.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION <p>1.1              Background of the study</p> <p>1.2              Statement of the problems</p> <p>1.3              Purpose of the study</p> <p>1.4              Significance of the study</p> <p>1.5              Research questions</p> <p>1.6              Definition of terms.</p> CHAPTER TWO LITERATURE REVIEW <p>2.1              Definition of Cyber-Café</p> <p>2.2              Review of Empirical research</p> <p>2.3              Summary</p> CHAPTER THREE <p>3.1              Design of study</p> <p>3.2              Area of the study</p> <p>3.3              Population of study</p> <p>3.4              Instrument for data collection</p> <p>3.5              Method of data analysis.</p> CHAPTER FOUR PRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS CHAPTER FIVE CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS <p>Reference:</p> <p>Appendix I</p> <p>Appendix II</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            This is an overview of the project topic. It gives the history of the circumstances surrounding the topic</p> <p>            The internet has mad changes in almost all aspect of our lives as it plays important role in most of what we discuss today about access to distribution and retrieval of information. According to Cachage “Internet explorer” (2001) he declared that Internet explorers have high expectation of internet services which  range from a  simple desire to find something interesting (for no particular reason) to searching for useful information on a specific issue as a result of the great diversity and volume of information contained in he internet. Chen et al (1998) stated that internet can enable the user to have access to information on diverse and specific areas that can meet his needs.</p> <p>            According to Paul (2002) he said that the internet which began in the 1960’s as a project of a few researcher has grown to be a commercial success with billions of dollars of annual decades into a mass developed within three decades into a mass medium that influences most or all domains of life from education to recreation, from business to medicine and from academic to politics. He notes further that today’s mega-trend and vision of the global village and globalization are based on and influenced by this technology. The influence of the internet allows all aspect of life. In developing as well as developed countries.</p> <p>            Statistics show that the use of the internet has grown in the most urban area in Africa relatively rapidly in much the same way as the adoption of the mobile phone which followed shortly after. Jensen (1996) observed that over half of African countries have despite their poor telecommunications infrastructure developed some form o low-cost dial up store end e-mail service with a gateway to the internet – 33 of the 54 nations on continent as at 1996, that of these 20 countries have live internet cities.  E listed these as Algeria, Angola, central African Republic, Benin, Cote d’ ivory, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Tanzania, Tunisia, Egypt, Senegal, Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique and of course South Africa, which is among the top 20 countries on the internet when ranked by number of the internet nodes. He noted further that an additional eight countries had well advanced plans for establishing an internet node, namely Burkinafso, Botswana, Gabon, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Guinea, Sierra Leone, as can be seen from the foregoing, Nigeria of which Delta state is part had no live internet public access services in her cities at that time</p> <p>            At present every capital city and major towns in Nigeria have internet public access services. As indicated by 2002 status report on the Africa internet (1) as of mid-2002 the internet of dial-up internet subscribers was close to 1.7m in Africa, 20 percent up from the previous year mainly bolstered by growth in a few of the larger countries such as Egypt, South Africa, Morocco and Nigeria, that charred public access and the use of corporate networks is continuing to grow at greater rates than he number of dial-up users. The report further notes that there are now many thousands of cyber-café in the major cities of Nigeria run by small entrepreneur who are allowed by the regulator of provide VOIP services as part of the cyber-café license, which costs about $500 a year. These cyber-cafes are growing in number at the passing of each day.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</p> <p>            This means the reasons why the researcher have chosen to study a particular research. Cyber-café has variety of problems that affect them. It include</p> <ol><li>High cost of internet connectivity</li> <li>Frequent/occasional loss of contact with internet service provider (ISP)</li> <li>Frequent electricity interruption</li> <li>The poor state of high telecommunication charges in Nigeria.</li> <li>High cost of maintaining equipment.</li> </ol><p>HIGH COST OF INTERNET CONNECTIVITY</p> <p>            Cyber-cafes have thus become very important in Nigeria, as the cost of having internet connectivity is so high that private individuals cannot afford it.</p> <p>            However, some educational institution (especially tertiary institutions) corporate organization and business centers do have computer in the country – though except in a very few organization and some cyber-cafes, most of these computers are not connected to the internet. This is  due to the high cost of connectivity.</p> <p>FREQUENT/OCCASSIONAL LOSS OF CONTACT WITH INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP)</p> <p>            It is common place to experience loss of contact from internet service provider when one is using cyber-café. The loss of contact could last for a few second, minutes, hours or could last for a day to several days and is very discouraging hen it is experienced.</p> <p>FREQUENT ELECTRICITY INTERRUPTION.</p> <p>            There are a number of circumstances which prevent cyber-café from offering more and better services in addition to internet access provision. From time to time electricity supply is interrupted in the country and this affects the provision of internet services by cyber-café</p> <p>POOR STATE OF AND HIGH TELECOMMUNICATION CHARGES IN NIGERIA</p> <p>            Local telephone systems are very important for the widespread use of the internet but the Nigeria telecommunication limited (NITEL) current infrastructure has too low a capacity for the internet.</p> <p>            In Nigeria communication technology development is restrained by NITEL the sole distributors of telecommunication services</p> <p>HIGH COST OF MAINTAINING EQUIPMENT</p> <p>            Computer consultant is very important in cyber-café to help the customer who need assistance and to ensure that café runs smoothly.</p> <p>            However, in Delta state consultant are scare in that it is difficult for the cyber-café to have or invite a good consultant for services when the equipment breakdown. Therefore any consultant in the cyber-café could get to service the equipment usually charge them very high.</p> <p>1.3       PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>            This means what exactly the researcher is ging to do. The researcher’s target which she set out to reach are as follows</p> <ol><li>The main purpose of this study is to identify the problems of cyber-café in Delta state</li> <li>On the other hand, to find out if such problems exist</li> <li>To know the extent of these problems if they exist</li> <li>To suggest solutions where necessary</li> <li>To recommend actions to be taken to avoid problems of cyber-café in Delta state.</li> </ol><p>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p>             This mean the benefits to be derived from the study <p>            This study is significant to that its findings should enable stakeholders to know the current state of cyber-café in the state and then take steps to increase public access to the internet.</p> <p>            It is also significant to relevant authorities to moderate the amount charged for internet connection so as to encourage people to establish internet cafes.</p> <p>            The findings and recommendations would thus enable individuals and corporate bodies to put more efforts to set up more cyber-cafes, especially in the rural areas, to cater for the teaming population of the state.</p> <p>            Its findings should enable students, business men and women, lecturers etc to know the existence, the importance of the internet and access to and use of the internet.</p> <p>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>            These are questions posed by the researcher which will be help her find solution to the problems. It is the objectives of this study to know</p> <ol><li>What are the causes of high cost of internet connectivity</li> <li>Why do cafes have occasional loss of contact with internet service provider</li> <li>How does electricity interruption affect the cafes</li> <li>What are the causes of poor state of and high telecommunication charges in Nigeria.</li> <li>What are the effect of high cost of maintaining equipment</li> </ol><p>1.6       DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>CYBER-CAFÉ: This is a café from which people can access the internet. It is also a chartroom or can be called a business center.</p> <p>INTERNET: It is global network which anybody can hook onto. It is rich online sources of information from  bulletin, boards electronics mail, exchange of audio/video, data to business transaction face to face discussion with any body in the world or distant relations and friends.         </p> <p>INTERNET EXPLORER: This mean any person who uses internet for internet or enjoyment.</p> </div>\n\nA SURVEY OF PROBLEMS OF CYBERCAFE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SURVEY OF PROBLEMS OF CYBERCAFE", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <div> <p>            Te importance of training both old and new employees in an organization particularly in modern business organizations cannot be over emphasized.

This training is usually mapped out mainly for people already in service and it is geared towards improving their abilities in their jobs.</p> <p>LIST OF TABLE</p> <p>Table 1:           Response to question one</p> <p>Table 2:           Response to question two</p> <p>Table 3:           Response to question three</p> <p>Table 4:           Response to question four</p> <p>Table 5:           Response to question five</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1              Background of the study</p> <p>1.2              Statement of problems</p> <p>1.3              Purpose of study</p> <p>1.4              Research questions</p> <p>1.5              Delimitation of the study</p> <p>1.6              Significance of the study</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>2.1              Concept of in-service training</p> <p>2.2              Relevance of training</p> <p>2.3              Strategies for improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries.</p> <p>2.4              The need for in service training</p> <p>2.5              Types of  in service training</p> <p>2.6              Planning of in service programme</p> <p>2.7              The focus of in service training</p> <p>2.8              Importance of in service training.</p> <p>2.9              Summary of related literature</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>3.1              Design of the study</p> <p>3.2              Area for the study</p> <p>3.3              Population for the study</p> <p>3.4              Sample and sampling procedure</p> <p>3.5              Instrument for data collection</p> <p>3.6              Validity of the instrument</p> <p>3.7              Reliability of the instrument</p> <p>3.8              Method of data collection</p> <p>3.9              Method of data analysis.</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>DATA PRESENTATION AND RESULT OF FINDINGS.</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>SUMMARY, DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>5.1              Research findings</p> <p>5.2              Discussion of findings</p> <p>5.3              Summary</p> <p>5.4              Conclusion</p> <p>5.5              Recommendation</p> <p>5.6              Suggestion for further study</p> <p>5.7              Limitations of the study</p> <p>Appendices I</p> <p>References</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            In introduction topic a survey of the strategies for improving the functionalities of ins service training of secretaries in a modern business organization in Enugu state, we must first understand when in-service training is all about.</p> <p>            There are many definition of in service training but I will highlight on just a few in order to see ways of improving its functionalities for a modern secretary.</p> <p>            Otto and Sender (1964) stated that in service training is a continued education of person while they are in service.</p> <p>            Hass (1964) stated that in service training include all activities engaged by professional personnel during service and designed to contribute to professional improvement.</p> <p>            Dillon Peterson (1981) defines in service training and professional growth for individuals within a respectful, supportive, positive organizational climate having as its ultimate aim to better learning. Having seen the definitions of in service training, ,let us consider the strategies f improving its functionalities.</p> <p>            The aim of in service training for the secretaries being to help them overcome many challenges posed to them by the modern technologies such as computers, fax machines, word processors etc. to now improve the functionalities of this training for secretaries it becomes imperative to train them in the use of these equipment to enhance their productivity and efficiency</p> <p>To also improve on the functionalities of in service training for secretaries in a modern business organization, such must be well articulated and well designed toward personal and organizational goals.</p> <p>            According to Wyn Reilay (1979) he said that there are two schools of thought as to the extent the design and running of their services  We are more interested in the second school of thought which agrees that trainees should participate in determining what should constitute an in service training for them. For it helps to develop a sense of responsibilities.</p> <p>            Granti8ng study leave instead of on the job training will improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in no small measures, in that they will have enough time to consulate on the training and also remove stress which will not help in the training.</p> <p>            Attachment of incentives like promotion, monetary reward etc, can as well enhance the functionalities of in service training of secretaries. The type of personnel assigned to conduct the training will equally in no small measure improve the functionalities of this training, seeing that in service training si a two way course that really involves a trainee and a tutor. How the tutor handles the course will go a long way to arouse the interest and dedication of the trainees. Using qualified personnel will in turn bring in new motivation, fresh insights, whose teaching techniques is based on many years if experience will impact and improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in a modern business organization in Enugu sate.</p> <p>            A good communicator is e1qually a great asset to this course of study.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>            The inability of employers to send their staffs for in servuice training posses a lot of problem and pulls down efficiency and productivity.</p> <p>Most modern business organizations in Enugu state lack qualified secretaries. They employ secondary school leavers as secretaries, when they don’t even know who a secretary is not to talk of what her duties are. There in experience and lack of training posses a great problem as to what assets of training to give them.</p> <p>            The establishment of staff development and distant education for staff training is one thing but lack of facilities,, non chalet attitude of employers and lack of funds are militating against the up-liftment of such projects like in service training of secretaries.</p> <p>            Some of these employers lack adequate knowledge as to how in service training can really improve their workers and in turn bring about greater productivity and efficiency</p> <p>            Selfishness and greediness is another problem facing the improvement of the functionalities of in service training og secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state in that over use these secretaries and at the same time pay them very little amount of money as salary, which makes it difficult for such secretaries to go for in service training and when the attempt to attend one is usually not a very qualitative one and the result is usually learning little of nothing at all.</p> <p>            These days, people are mainly interested in the acquiring of certificates and not really on skill acquisition of learning what they are suppose to learn. In this situation, such secretaries will inevitably receives what they have asked for which is inadequate training.</p> <p>            Considering the above background, the study therefore, awareness should be created in the need for improved functionality of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state, to be able to promote efficiency and increase productivity.</p> <p>1.3       PURPOSE OF STHE STUDY</p> <p>            The study is therefore designed to</p> <p>1.      Examine the literature on in service training of secretaries with the intension of improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organization in Enugu state.</p> <p>2.      Determine if secretaries in modern business organization in Enugu state are given adequate training</p> <p>3.      Determine the need for improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state,.</p> <p>4.      Create awareness on the needs of employing qualified secretaries and on he need of sending them for an improved in service training.</p> <p>5.      Offer immediate and long term suggestion for the improvement of the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations.</p> <p>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>            This study will seek to answer the following questions</p> <p>1.      What literature can be examined to improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state</p> <p>2.      How far are secretaries in modern business organization given adequate training</p> <p>3.      To what extent is the need to improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organization in Enugu state.</p> <p>4.      What level of awareness is to be created in the needs of employing qualified hands in modern business organizations and on the need of sending them for an improved in service training programmes.</p> <p>5.      What immediate and long term suggestion should be offered for the improvement of the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state.</p> <p>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            This study is significant for the following reasons</p> <p>1.      It will go a long way in helping to create the necessary awareness required of employers in achieving an improved in service training of their secretaries, for an improved functionalities of these secretaries. Thee by making them more productive and deficient in their jobs to the benefit of the employers and to their joy and satisfaction.</p> <p>2.       It will help build the desire for self development as the secretaries are provided with the opportunity of self evaluation, which will in-turn move them to strive for greater competence in their job to the benefits of the employers.</p> <p>3.      This study will serve as a guide and also as a motivational tool for both the secretaries and the employers of labor in modern business organization in Enugu state.</p> <p>4.      This will help the Nigerian labor congress to put-up a common front and fight against mediocrity in the   employment and training (in service) of the secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state, thereby creating job opportunities for qualified secretaries and creating good ground for qualitative and improved in service training of same.</p> <p>5.      The study is significant in that it will help our policy makers take into account the strategies of improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations ion the state, thereby formulating development plans to favor them.

This in turn will put the secretaries in the lime-light and also make for their better utilization</p> <p>6.      It will take away redundancy and make the secretaries feel fulfilled.</p> </div>\n\nTHE STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF IN-SERVICE  TRAINING OF SECRETARIES IN MODERN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF IN-SERVICE  TRAINING OF SECRETARIES IN MODERN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div>            ABSTRACT <p>The degree to which computer is used in offices has been of serious concern to secretarial profession.

For all types of organizations to  succeed  in  today’s  rapidly  changing environment, they  need  to  be  able  to  be  process  data   and information  effectively.</p> <p>            In conducting them  day  to day  operations  organization  use  information  for  functions  such  as  planning, controlling, directing,  organizing  and  diction  making.   Information therefore  is  unique actionably  a critical  resources  in  the  operations  of  all  organization  the  business men,  secretaries, students and  in  fact  everybody, would now readily see the indelible impact of modern technology on people lives.</p> <p>            In an organization, information moves from person, forms are completed, filed and received and individuals communicate variety of both simple and complex concepts. At the turn of the century most written information were complied by hand in pen and ink copies were made by hand and communicated was by letter, telegraph or in person.  Today most of the tedious functions related to information handling and processing are done through the computer.</p> <p>            For the secretaries, not only have their equipment changed, but also their administrative processes office routine management systems are similarly evolving into new forms.  Computers have replaced manual typewriters and electric typewriter while for machines replaced telex machines.  There are also different type of advanced communication gadget such as cellular phones, pager etc.  With this radical change, the secretaries are expected to change and be able to keep up with all these professional changes around them.  In accordance with the law of motion CHANGE is a constant phenomena.  If we look at the beginning of man to the present day, we would see that there had been tremendous change. If there had not occurred, man would have remained primitive hill today.  Change is a challenge and if we abide by change, it brings out the best in us thereby leading to erroneous progress.</p> <p>            The first office automatic machine were introduced 1930 and used paper rolls later paper tape as a form of memory.  BY the 1960s the international business machine (IBM) had introduced the selective go If ball typewriter which allows the typist to change the print element, the go If – ball to provide a different type font (character design and sign) another break through was the introduction of IBM’s magnetic tape selective typewriter.  This was followed by the introduction of a visual display unit (VDU) this allows the typist to see what I happening to the text as if being tyed amended and stored, but before it I being committed to paper or printed out.  In fact, electronic systems are now possible that they can sense absorbs store, categorize ponder, very high quantity.  Yet with greater accuracy, speed and reliability.  Coventry, (1981) indicated that Recent development of the micro processor, founded on the silicon chips has potentials likely to have a vast social repercussion through out financial industry, for a simple chip take over a high proportion of today’s office job P.21.  When we refer to computer system, we refer to information and communication system which are necessary for the functioning of the office.  We assume that data processing and word-processing play a large role and also that human system under lie these technical systems.  In an ideal situation therefore, the technology and the people function together harmoniously.</p> <p>It is important to recognize that development and implementation of the computer is moving through several overlapping phases, each affecting differently.</p> <p>In general, a distinction can be made between two classes of office workers.  The first are the information worker they are those who are involved in the routine entry, recording, storage and transmission of information, those who fall under this group of worker include – Typist, secretaries, clerks and data entry personal.</p> <p>The second group are the knowledge works-this group aconite of those worker who create, interpret, analyze and utilize this information these knowledge worker can be divided into two (2) groups professional/technical employees and managers.</p> <p>The main impact of the computer is simply to facilitate office operation as they are now being carried out.  For example the word professor replace the secretary’s type writers, the mini-computer replaces the clerk’s filing cabinets etc.  More recently professionals and secretaries have begun using personal computers and sophisticated calculators to speed up their work.  The timing of there development has largely been dictated by the emergence of the technology starting with the widespread introduction of word processor’s in the 1970’s, and it in the late 1970s and its legitimating as a business tool in 1981, with the introduction of the IBM P.C.</p> <p>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Up to the 190’s the use of the computer in this country was limited to very few multinational companies.  The secretary then had to contend with using manual and electric typewriters in performing her word processing function.</p> <p>            Furthermore storage and retrieval of information was by use of files, filing cabinets, index cards etc.  Accessing of other information had to be through telephone directories and other relevant specialized text meant for such purpose.</p> <p>            Many of the secretaries of the 80’s are still in employment. With the advent and widespread use of the computer are then wonders how these secretaries are adjusting to be new devices now prevalent in modern offices are they finding it easy or difficult?  Is the profession generally under threat by the introduction of the computer and the Internet?  What can be done to keep the secretary still relevant in to day’s modern business setting?  These and many more are what this research aims to find solutions for.</p> <p>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to thoroughly investigate on the impact of the introduction of the computer on the secretaries.</p> <p>1.                  How secretaries react or the attitude of secretaries towards the introduction of computers.</p> <p>2.                  To ascertain whether the introduction of computer has in any way improve the secretary’s work.</p> <p>3.                  To ascertain whether the introduction of computer has made it easy or difficult to adjust (especially the secretaries of the bank under investigation).</p> <p>4.                  To determine the problems encountered by secretaries in trying to adapt to changes in the nature of their work.</p> <p>5.                  To find out whether or not secretaries are involved in the planning and introduction of computers.</p> <p>1.4              RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>The research provided answers to the following research questions;</p> <p>1.                  How do secretaries react to the introduction of computer</p> <p>2.                  What problems are encountered by secretaries in trying to adapt to changes in the nature of their work.</p> <p>3.                  Are there orientation programmes in facilitating the adaptation to new changes of work</p> <p>4.                  Are secretaries involved in the planning and introduction of computers.</p> <p>1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The investigation of the impact of the introduction of the computer on secretaries in some selected banks in Enugu Metropolis.  Would give some insight in the performance of secretaries on the advert of computers.</p> <p>            Many of the major problems that organizations have faced in the past have been that they are in awe of technology, they failed to recognize the need to use technology as a competitive weapon against their rivals, they expected technology to be difficult to use and also the unwillingness to address the compelling human issues which has been the major cause of low productivity.  This study will help secretaries to full understand how their career will change as a result of the introduction of computers in their offices.</p> <p>            From this study, banks will now recognize the need to use technology as a competitive weapon.  Winning a competitive edge has become of fundamental importance within national and international Banking, institutions.  The prime emphasis of activity now rests on providing an ever improving levels of services to existing clients and customers and winning new business through the sheer quality of service provided and the ingenuity of marketing activity.  Ultimately, it is only through establishing a competitive advantage over rival institutions that an institution can hope to maximize profitability.</p> <p>            In Banking sector where establishing a competitive advantage has become so important, it is necessary for them to pay particular attention to the role which technology plays in offering them an opportunity to gain this advantage.  The main function of technological deployment is to assist an institution to gain a competitive advantage.</p> <p>            Finally, this research work will be of significance to the society at large because if the computer is well utilized, productivity (efficiency and effectiveness) would be enhanced, there by leading to a higher standard of ling for the society.</p>

study</p> <p>Ethics and social responsibilities of a business and their organization has been extremely important to every society and Nigeria at large. Every society makes sure that those who engage in any form of business should engage in good morals in their daily activities. Ethics and social responsibilities are related concepts that pay special attention on moral conscience of business. The idea of ethical responsibilities has to do with those issues and problems that concerns people in business, and their faithfulness to their organization and to their customers also. Social responsibilities and its problem is the interest and need of every society.</p> <p>There are laid down rules that govern every profession. In enabling us understand what “ethics” actually means, we shall quickly look at the following phenomena that could rapidly be misconceived as ethics. We are referring to such phenomena as law and morality: Laws are laid down rules made by administrations, communities, governments etc. And the motives of these laws are primarily to regulate or check discrepancies or misconduct as may be observed in human character or behavior. Summarily; laws improves human character, which when absent could bring about disorderliness and chaos.</p> <p>Morality on the other hand is related to the opinion principal of good and evil as it affect human conduct. It comes from the mind to differentiate good from evil. We can in other words refer to morals as love and ethical virtues. Finally morals involves individual character considered by the winning standard of moral honesty.</p> <p>Ethics has been defined as the principal of right and wrong conduct by the American heritage dictionary (second college edition). It is also the general study of the entire nature of morals and the specific moral choices made by a person as it affect his relationship with his fellow individuals.</p> <p>Those used in an organization in achieving it’s objectives, makes up the workforce of that organization and also of competence of any organizational objectives.</p> <p>A very high level of performance and efficiency has to be attained by the staff as a workforce: Efficiency is a function of so many different factors like, political, social, societal and economical, just to mention but a few. The staff is an essential factor of production in any given establishment since their proficiency and contributions can either promote or demote the efficiency of an establishment. In the eyes of an ordinary person, a staff could be considered as a group of individual or persons that operate in an establishment in order to achieve a common purpose. They also indulge in accounting, managerial and clerical functions.</p> <p>A good staff is one that uses his intellect and positive opinions to make suitable decision not beyond the scope of approved governance without having to be monitored and also with a reasonable degree of moral standards.</p> <p>Members of every professions are being guided by some codes of conducts; such professions include, Lawyers, Doctors, Customs, etc. There are some ethical conducts that are written down on paper, whereas others are verbal or unwritten. The said rules are made known to the members of a particular profession. To be ethical means, keeping these rules in your relationship with your fellow staff whereas, to be in ethical means not abiding by these rules.</p> <p>Social and ethical obligations are concepts that concentrate o the conscience of business managers as an image-maker of an establishment with the outside world. This is normally achieved by the reasonable use of telephones, faxes, letters, etc. To an extent, this encourages positive public reaction towards the organization depending on the moral character of the staff. It is therefore of interest that since the staff engage in various forms of business administration ranging from agriculture to production and manufacturing, they should be socially and morally obligated to the community where they operate so as to excel in their operations.</p> <p>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>An office personnel should be a mirror through which an organization restructures its duties and functions. This implies that the personnel should portray the good image of the said organization, since high social responsibilities and moral demand are expected from them. The quality of services rendered by the staff can be influenced by the environment where they operate. The environmental situation can be changed if its moral status is low, but on the other hand, the staff should be encouraged to adapt to the environmental standards if its moral status is encouraging.</p> <p>So an organization should have a dynamic social responsibility to enable it influence its environmental positively for viability and stability. The objective of every organization should be to maintain a worthy inter-relationship amongst its staff, the organize person and its environment in order to enhance cordial outcome.  Finally; the organization that it exists.</p> <p>1.2              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This project is geared towards serving some useful  purposes and everything that can be done, will be done to ensure that these objectives are not defected.</p> <p>The advantages of this project that makes it obviously imperative are as follows:</p> <p>To support the promotion of productivity especially where the ethics of business profession is adhered to suit us organizational motive.</p> <p>            To indicate to controlling authorities, essential areas and shortcomings that needs necessary attention.</p> <p>This work will support the education of every top management, of the ethics desired of them.</p> <p>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The objectives of this study is to ascertain the extent of social obligation and ethics of the staff of NICON instance co-operation.

It informs all our actions and inaction in relations to others and it takes place all the time. It can manifest itself in symbolic, verbal and non-verbal forms we can communicate with all apart of our body, our posture, smile and even the dress we put on communicate one thing of the other.</p> <p>            Different scholars have defined the word communication variously. However, there is the central theme that runs through all these definitions. That is the giving of information, ideas, opinions attitudes etc. by one person or group of persons to another person or group of persons</p> <p>            Communication particularly in a business organization provides a means by which people in the organization interact, exchange information, ideas, plan proposal and execute them. It is a medium through which relationships are established and maintained. It is also a means by which commendation is given and condemnation is handed down.</p> <p>            Business and organizational communication helps to orientate workers to their jobs as well as helping the supervisors monitor activates of the workers. Communication is an extremely invaluable asset in human organization. His is because at all levels in the organization among and between executives, managers, staff, supervisors, foremen and employees, the communication process is always in action conveying information, ideas, attitude and feelings among individuals and groups</p> <p>            Communication affects all the management function since none of them can be effectively performed without it. Plans and innovation cannot be executed unless they are communicated to those who will carry them out. The organizational structure is designed to set up channels of communication through which information is passed downwards, upwards, horizontally or laterally.</p> <p>            Interference are barriers to effective communication because of changes in a desired direction.</p> <p>            The effectiveness of communication discourages better performance, high productivity and job satisfaction in an organization. This reduces the essentials for the internal functioning of an organization, which could integrate the managerial; functions.</p> <p>            The problems in an organization as a result of communication problems reduce and obstruct the chance of such an organization achieving their goals.</p> <p>            For the purpose of this study we shall focus all our attention on the major courses of communication problems with a particular emphasis on the Mercedes Benze Anambra Motor Manufacturing Company (MB-ANAMMCO)</p> <p>            MB – ANAMMCO limited was incorporated on January 17, 1977 and the plant was commissioned on July 8, 1980 by the firs executive president of Nigeria, Alhaji Shehu Shagari. It started official production in January 1981 and has to date made enable mark on the nation’s industrial growth, adding over 25,000 vehicles to the nation’s transportation sector, backed up effectively with a network of over 36 after-sales service pints and spare parts supply depots. The company’s central spare parts deport stocks over 35, 000 line items</p> <p>            Mercedes Benz ANAMMCO is a joint ventures between the federal Government of Nigeria and the Daimler Chryster AG. MB ANAMMCO manufacturers Commercial vehicles and leads in the commercial vehicles markets from five tine payload and above in Nigeria. The plant, which occupies a sprawling 300,000 square meter site in Emene, near Enugu, is a shine example of a profitable and viable economic and technological corporation between the government and people of Nigeria and Daimler Chrysler AG and so there exists a combination of white/black system of administration.</p> <p>            As a result of the white/black relationship there are time when one system administration disagree with other both in the formulation and implementation due to communication problems.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</p> <p>            Communication is a very important instrument in every organization.</p> <p>            The problems of effective communication is pre-requisite for improper understanding and interaction of people in an organization. Poor communication system makes for ineffective and inefficient management and this affects the preset goals. Some of these problems include</p> <ol><li>Lack of proper channel of communication in the organization. This can explain why there still exist, situation where minor problems which could be sorted out by discussion and understanding between the workers and the management escalate into major problems which causes some set back in the company.</li> <li>The management is not willing to share information with employees. As a result workers normally get information from the grapevine which usually lead to unfavorable actions in the company</li> <li>MB – ANAMMCO is a multi-national company that carries information from different parts of the federation and outside the country too. The information is so much that the channels cannot handle all the messages that are been sent. Sometimes the telephone lines cannot get through of all the lines are in use at the same time. This information overload occurs when ,ore message are transmitted than the human receiver can handle, this leads to reduced efficiency</li> <li>Since the company does not fully consider communication as a very important aspect of the organization and therefore allows communication gaps to exist between it and the workers the productivity level of the company will suffer.</li> </ol><p>1.3       OBJECTIVES/PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The objective/purpose of the study is to survey the effect of communication barriers to organizational success. The smooth operation of any business undertaking lies largely on its efficiency in the circulation of information with and outside the organization and the presences of barriers in this circulation could be very disastrous therefore the researcher is going to</p> <p>i.                    To determine communication problems create improper coordination of the organizational functions</p> <p>ii.                  To  find out the communication channel that exist in MB-ANAMMCO</p> <p>iii.                To determine it the desired organizational goals achieved through this communication channels</p> <p>iv.                To find out if good business opportunities be lost by an organization through communication ineffectiveness.</p> <p>1.4       SIGNFICANE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            It is through communication that understanding information, motivation cooperation and job satisfaction necessary for groups efforts is being provided. Better communication get better job performance and more work satisfaction. In MB-ANAMMCO the challenges posed ineffective communication in the part of the management and the staff nearly grounded the multi-national promising enterprise that has supplied succor to teeming population made up of Nigerian and expertise so it is believed that the analysis of data, findings and solutions proffered in this write-up will be beneficial to</p> <p>i.                    Mercedes Benz Anambra Motor Manufacturing company (MB – ANAMMCO) who will make use of the communication to solve any problem arising from ineffective communication.</p> <p>ii.                  Managers of other companies in the course of improving their knowledge will find this write-up useful in that they will not want to fall into the same unfortunate situation before implementing the solution proffered in this study.</p> <p>iii.                Although already dealt with by many authors, it is believed that this is yet another contribution to such existing materials. Also students and other researchers who may want to carry out a project of this nature will use this as a reference point</p> <p>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The object of this research work is to fine out the effect of communication barriers on organizational success. Its scope is limited to the Mercedes Benz Anambra Motor manufacturing company (MB-ANAMMCO) which is the organization under study. However, this study will go a little further to discuss communication in some details.</p> <p>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>i.                    Does communication problems create improper coordination of organizations</p> <p>ii.                  What is the communication channel that exist in MB – ANAMMCO</p> <p>iii.                Are desired organizational goals achieved through this communication channels</p> <p>iv.                Can good business opportunities be lost be an organization through communication ineffectiveness.</p> <p>1.8              DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>ACHIVEMENT: The successful finishing or gaining of something especially through skill or hard work.</p> <p>BARRIERS: Objects consciously or unconsciously placed in the way that prevents other objects from going forward or backwards.</p> <p>BYPASSING: When the sender and the receiver of a message allubuted different meaning to the same words or use different word through intending the same meaning</p> <p>COMMUNICATION: The process of sending and receiving messages.

Secretaries and their bosses were selected from different organizations as well as the student secretaries of the Rivers State University of Science and Technology and those of the college of education both in Port-Harcourt metropolis. The instruments used in this study were questionnaire and face to face oral interview. These were administered to the sample population. Questionnaires were administered to 150 student secretaries in which 130 responded. The result of the study observed that practicing secretaries dissatisfaction stems form the non recognition of their career as management team, no job prospects lack of rapid promotion. The career has being considered as inferior to other professions as well as being perceived as predominantly female profession. This is as a result of their non contributory attitude to decision making on the organization. This research work has five chapters. Chapter one contains a general discussion of the meaning of a secretary and the important role they play in an organization and what people feel we are in the society. Chapter two is discussing about the problems facing secretary in their offices. They are used as domestic skivvies and are regarded as shorthand typist. The main problems of the secretaries remains the perceived lack of status, we have always been perceived as just supported unequal treatment to secretaries compared to other professionals. Chapter three deals with the design of the study/research methodology, the methods used in collecting relevant date was administering questionnaires and conducting oral or face to face interviews on relevant persons, that is, secretaries and their senior manager as well as student secretaries.  It was conducted in two higher Institutions, rivers state university of science and technology and rivers state College of education both in Port-Harcourt and in various organization. In data analysis a total of 330 questionnaires were administered to working secretaries, senior managers and student secretaries but out of this number 274 of them responded.     Finally, the summary of findings, conclusion on the research and recommendations made by the researcher are all in chapter five. It was also discovered that non recognition of the secretaries as management team has contributed the secretaries job dissatisfaction. But with the advert of the new breed of secretaries who are given better education and the first exploration of the career by men, the  impression about the career will eventually die a natural death and will be left to history </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1        BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>In this part of the world a careful observer would discover that what we refer to as sociological factors affecting professional secretarial career in Nigeria has always been mistaken. The management of some entrepreneur and  institution management has failed in their duties of providing these basic needs to their secretaries.</p> <p>The world “secretary” has been defined by A.S Hornby, in the Advanced Learners Dictionary, as an employee or an official who deals with correspondences, keeps records, makes arrangements, appointment and other business affairs of the firm, society or club.</p> <p>The Lexicon Webster dictionary, an encyclopedic  edition, defines secretary as one entrusted with secrets, one who caries on another’s correspondences and performs other routine task; an officer of an organization or business who keeps records and assists in major decisions, a government officer whose business is to superintendent and manage the affairs of a particular department.</p> <p>Office is of paramount importance to the organization since it is a decision making centre and it is through the office functions that the organization achieves its goals.</p> <p>The importance of a secretary in any organization is not to be over –emphasized but the profession has been misconstrued due to small ill informed masses. M. blight (1983) in duties of a professional secretary commented on this. He said that, this argument is, in part, attributed to the inability of employers to clearly specify job description for professional secretaries. Again, B.O.Ekong (1984) in his article titled problems in professional secretarial career’ hold that, ‘some employers believe that the secretarial school merely teachers shorthand and typewriting to its  graduates therefore, did not see the reason as to the substance of making them beneficiaries of some service conditions and promotional benefit, with their counterparts in other fields. This could be the reason why a secretary’s opinion is always neglected in decision making. Although he has been employed by the boss for his assistance, but his opinion is not always appreciated.</p> <p>        He attends meeting just as minutes jotter and reporter, his opinion is not being sought for in decision making. L.N.Mbaga (1984) in contemporary views, said that, “a professional secretaries are held as drop outs forced by self –induced disappointments and frustrations to specialize in typewriting and shorthand”.</p> <p>Due to this misconception of the profession, less importance is attached to the secretary position. The secretary in an organization, is seen by other members of the organization, as merely an appendage. In most cases, he is regarded as a shorthand/typist by a majority of people. People well informed who are supposed to acknowledge the importance of secretaries in the society and consequently he feels slighted.</p> <p>Some employers seen not to know the difference between the work of an office messenger and that of a secretary. Some secretaries are expected to do the boss’s wife or other co-workers and consequently this affects her psychologically. This was confirmed by an interview conducted by Nicola Tyre (1984), when a lady secretary said that at one time she had two houses to run as well as her normal job. She went on complaining that she was used as a domestic skinny, doing her boss’s personal errand running such as buying a present for the wife and her weekly shopping.</p> <p>These type of problems facing secretaries in the job tend to affect their productivity and stability, even those with genuine interest for the career one scared away and consequently secretaries change of occupation becomes more, than in other fields like engineering, business administration etc.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>It is an understatement to say that the professional secretarial career is unimportant. It is obvious that it is much important, it is also competitive and marketable and deserves nothing but recognition from every perceiving eye. A training secretary is capable and prominent office hand hence has presence is essential to the office. Infact, he is the boss as a nurse or a paramedical staff into the office. Surgeon and this contributes is no small way to the success of the boss and the entire organization.</p> <p>The secretary profession is indeed on career that attracts a discrimination image from society’s evaluating eyes. Most managers who require to assistance of the secretary in the office fail totally to accord him a befitting recognition, rather they show disregard and disrespect for the career.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, the word secretary is often misunderstood by many people. While some are of the opinion that anybody who can write short-hand and use typewriter as well as known as a secretary, others see it as merely a woman’s career and consequently, a non –prestigious one</p> <p>The trend of though is due to a misconception and the culminating results from this trend of events are for reaching and affects the secretarial career very adversely. The secretary feels slighted, he is demotivated both to join and stay in the profession, he suffers image and personality (ego) problems and these accounts for his detraction and adherence and thus mass exodus to other profession.</p> <p>Based on the foregoing, therefore the study was geared towards identifying the factors responsible for the dissatisfaction of professional secretaries on their job performance and solutions to salvage the profession.</p> <p>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the causes of non-recognition of secretaries and their profession or career along side similar professions in our society. To achieve these objectives and these following research questions will be answered.</p> <p>1.           To know the challenges faces Prof. Secretaries in their job performance.</p> <p>2.           To what extent do these challenges Prof. secretaries stability in the career.</p> <p>3.           To know the measured could be taken to solve this problem.</p> <p>4.           To identify’ s those factors that affect secretaries on the job function.</p> <p>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work attempt were made to identify and analyze those factors that contribute to secretaries unhappiness or dissatisfaction while on the job performance. It is intended to reveal to the prospective secretaries on what they should expect from the profession.</p> <p>        Finally, it is also intended to give clear picture of what the  profession is  all about.</p> <p>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work is designed to study the sociological factors affecting professional secretarial career in Nigeria.</p> <p>        A lot of organizations are now aware that secretaries needs to be provides with high productivity in the organization.</p> <p>        The study was conducted in various organization as well as the two higher institutions, that is Rivers State University of Science and Technology &amp; Rivers State College of Education all in Rivers State.</p> <p>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>1.           What in your opinion lowers the status of the secretarial profession in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.           What sort of problems do you encounter in the office and from your employer?</p> <p>3.           Are you recognized as a member of the management team?</p> <p>4.           What is your view on the way secretaries are generally treated?</p> <p>5.           What type of position are you expecting at the end of your course?</p> <p>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>This term was made to identify or to explain those factors that affect professional secretarial career in Nigeria. These are the sociological factors; non-recognition and low esteem rating of the career, which resulted to the poor treatment of secretaries and also the physical factors which is known as environment as well.</p> <p>Environment: In the management or organization contact, environment consist s of office building, the  furniture layout and the physical conditions  under which an office worker or secretaries operate such as lighting, ventilation, sound and safety measure etc.</p> <p>Lighting</p> <p>Bad lighting accentuates the possibility of low performance or output and inaccurate work result in secretarial job function. Enendu O. (1993) mentioned that bad lighting causes eye strain and fatigue to the secretaries causing low job output. Poor standards of lighting obviously affect the secretaries interest, attitude top work and makes them suffer from degree of eye strain, fatigue, irritability and other physical disorders. The effect of poor lighting should be understood as it adversely affects the productivity of the secretaries job function.</p> <p>Poor ventilation also affects secretaries health thereby causing poor performance on the job function.</p> <p>SOUND/NOISE CONTROL</p> <p>        Noise is known to have detrimental effects on the physical and mental mechanism of individuals. Secretarial work cannot be carried out efficiently if there is a constant interruption. Slamming of doors, sounds of footsteps on floor have remarkable influence on the moral and level of performance of secretarial careers.</p> <p>SAFETY MEASURE</p> <p>S.Mills and O. Standing ford has this to say; the health and safety at work act (19974) requires an employer to provide employee with a written statement of policy of the organization and arrangements pertaining to health and safety at work.</p> <p>        Every office should have a first aid kit the staff should be prepared in case of fire outbreak.</p> <p>OFFICE</p> <p>        In every well organized business there is the need for the record of its activities to be kept and protected. Office is where such activities are carried out and its record kept. The term office was first defined by Geoffery Whitehead, as a room or building where clerical processes are carried out to start, develop and control the many activities of business.</p> <p>        Ronald Warson et al, defined office as the place where information is received, sorted, acted upon, filed and passed on.</p> <p>        Many organization have been said and written about the best way to ensure secretaries high performance on the job function and many people have argued that those secretaries have to be adequately motivated, in order to ensure effective job performance on their part. They outlined such motivational incentives as increasing salaries and wages, provision of certain social amenities such as free medical facilities, ensuring adequate recognition on the secretarial parts. All these motivational incentives would not increase the productivity of the professional secretarial career in Nigeria.</p> <p>FUNCTION OF AN OFFICE</p> <p>        With the growth in information requirements and developments of processing techniques which gives the office an increasing important position in the enterprise, the functions of an office have drastically increased.</p> <p>Receiving information: One of the main function of an office is to receive information. These can be inform of orders, letters, fox, telephone calls, e-mails and reports from the various parts that the business covers etc.</p> <p>Recording information: Information’s are recorded in the office as they come in such information record are; faxed messages phone calls, memoranda as well as other messages contained in there are recorded by the office for current and future  use.</p> <p>Arranging information: information received and recorded are arranged in the office for management use. This brings the need for the information to be arranged to meet the requirement of the organization.</p> <p>Giving information: since the office accumulates information of various kinds and shapes and since it is in the office that information is arranged in the form that organization require to give out this information to people who need them eg the prizes and weights  of some goods, date, time and venue of examination such as WAEC, JCE etc.</p> <p>Safeguarding information and Assets: It is the duties of an office work specially, “secretaries” to ensure the safety of the information so that it can be given out when needed. These information safeguard are; computers, photocopying machines, fax machines etc. these assets must be safeguard against fire outbreaks, thelf and other hazards.</p> </div>\n\nA STUDY OF THE

ON STUDENT DEPARTMENT SECRETARIAL STUDIES", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The study examined the roles and the effectiveness of professional secretaries within government parastatals, using Ministry of Agriculture and Environment as a study. The study adopted survey design using primary source of data with questionnaire as instrument of data collection. A total of 150 questionnaires were administered to level five to seven out of which 142 were duly filled and returned. Chi-square statistical method was used to verify the degree of significance of roles and level of effectiveness of Professional Secretaries. The result of the findings show succinctly those Professional secretaries are not effective in government parastatals. This was affirmed using respondents’ opinion to research question one and the conclusion drawn from hypothesis one in which it was concluded that Professional secretaries are not effective in government parastatals. The study further revealed that ICT have significant impact on the performance of Professional secretaries.  It was also established that ICT skills have improved the effectiveness of Professional secretaries.  This was affirmed using respondents’ the conclusion drawn from hypothesis three in which it was concluded that ICT skills have improved the effectiveness of Professional secretaries.Based on the findings the study recommends that Government parastatals should engage the secretaries in on the job training and off the job training especially in the area of using ICT, which without doubt will enhance their job performance, the Ministries should acquire and adopt ICT infrastructure within the parastatals, and More research needs to be done in the area of ascertaining the relevance of professional secretaries’ usefulness within the ministries.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>     Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The role of a secretary is indispensable in every organization especially in public sector.(Azih,2013)  A secretary according to Mayer cited in Azih (2013) is an executive assistant who possess a mastery of office skills, demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility with or without supervision, exercises initiatives and judgment and makes decision with the scope of assigned authority. The secretary is a public relations expert, a staff assistant, the boss’s office memory. The secretary is responsible for much of the detail work of the office and is expected to carry out the duties with a minimum of supervision and direction. According to Nwosu as cited in Azih (2013) A Secretary is expected to represent the organization and the employer attractively to the public and generate good human relations in working with all employees in the organization. This explains that a qualified secretary should have a wide knowledge of business acumen, be versatile in office practice, communication and knowledge of the operation of all departments within the organization where he works, unlike a half-baked secretary who possesses only knowledge of shorthand, typewriting and basic office practices (Azih,2013). </p> <p>Duniya (2011) observed that due to the introduction of sophisticated technological (electronic) office equipment into today’s office and the role secretaries need to play in ensuring accuracy and efficiency in their jobs, the secretaries need to meet the challenges by acquiring new skills and competencies for efficient operations in the electronic office. There is continuous advancement in technology which has affected the secretarial profession in terms of the quality, speed and accuracy of works performed. This has led to the introduction of various electronic facilities to ensure adequate secretarial practice in organization. It is essential that secretaries are properly trained on the usage of these modern facilities to enhance their level of productivity. The proficiency level of a secretary is highly determined by the availability and usage of modern office technology provided in the office environment as well as the acquired skills and competencies of the secretary (Nwaokwa and Okoli, 2012). This is based on the fact that modern offices are automated. Automation is a collection of methods for controlling machinery and production processes by mechanical method, usually with electronic equipment (Akpomi and Ordu, 2009). Automation entails an integration of work station where the secretary would have access to the electronic equipment needed to create, process, store, retrieve and disseminate information. The advent of automation has ushered in an electronic era whereby human works are done by machines.</p> <p>The introduction of modern Information Communication and Technology equipment has affected the demands of the modern secretary (Nwaokwa and Okoli, 2012). The duties of secretaries have been revolutionized especially in the areas of communication, telecommunication, micrograph and reprography. The technology has replaced mechanical technology; new technologies are replacing the old ones. Typing, keyboarding and voice processing are now used in place of dictation and carbonizations. In the area of reprography stencil duplication has been replaced by computer print outs and Xeroxing systems. In the area of micrograph and telecommunications, horizontal suspension and other systems are now replaced by compact disc run and d-base computer systems. Telephones have gone digital while teleconferencing, internet and networking are currently used. The modern office unlike the traditional office makes use of e-mail, fax and other telecommunication equipment. It is imperative to note that currently there is a high demand for skilled and technological trained workers. Regrettable, most secretarial graduates acquire theoretical knowledge which does not match well with the demands of work place.</p> <p>However, there is acute shortage of trained personnel in the application of software, operating system, network communication and local technicians to service and repair computer facilities. However, the secretaries today are not only required to have theoretical and practical knowledge and skills in ICT computer operations, but to be exposed to the use of some computer packages like excel, data base management, etc. They should be conversant with the issue of interconnectivity, ecommerce, skills in browsing the website, skills in data protection techniques and security and adequate knowledge of how to use search engines to gain access to lots of educational resources. In a study carried out by Ntukidem (2000), he found out that advancement in technology has continued unabated and has enriched and widened the scope and practice of the secretarial profession in terms of work quality, speed, accuracy and variety. He also concluded that today, the secretarial profession is faced with array of telecommunication tools and facilities based on modern technology.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>    Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The roles and effectiveness of professional secretaries is becoming imperative relative to advancements in the area of information of communication and technology. Communication technologies are new innovations in offices that enable the discharge of office functions more rapidly and efficiently (Nwaokwa and Okoli, 2012). The emergence of office technologies in modern day organizations has challenged the occupational skills of the employees including the secretaries. Hence, these communication technologies have recently revolutionized office skills and rendered some skills such as  transcription skills, typing on the manual typewriters obsolete and has also given rise to previously unknown skills such as web design, desktop publishing, networking, internet skills, etc., in modern organizations. This development has obviously challenged the skills and functions of secretaries.</p> <p>These advancements in communication technologies has led to the need for secretaries to reposition themselves in other to continue to be relevant in their performance of office functions as well as cope with the trend of technological changes in today’s modern offices.</p> <p>It is against the backdrop of these ICT-centric roles and functions of secretaries this study will be evaluating the roles and effectiveness of professional secretaries in selected government parastatals.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The broad objective of this study is to critically evaluate the roles and effectiveness of professional secretaries in selected government parastatals, other specific objectives include the following:</p> <p>         1.         Determine the roles professional secretaries in government offices</p> <p>         2.         Identify the skills required that will enhance their performance as professional secretaries.</p> <p>         3.         Examine the role ICT plays in the effectiveness of professional secretaries.</p> <p>         4.         Evaluate the importance of professional secretaries in government parastatals. </p> <p><strong>1.4       Relevant Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The principal question of this research is: what are the roles of professional secretaries and what makes them effective? This research will also try to provide answers to the following sub-questions in the course of this study:</p> <p>      1.            What roles do professional secretaries play in government parastatals?</p> <p>      2.            What skills do professional secretaries need for job performance?</p> <p>      3.            What roles does ICT play enhancing the performance of professional secretaries?</p> <p>      4.            What is the importance of professional secretaries in government establishment?</p> <p><strong>1.5       Relevant Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>In the course of this study two null hypotheses will be fully examined</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis I</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong>      Professional secretaries do not have significant roles in government parastatals</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>: </strong>Professional secretaries are not effective in government parastatals.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis II</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong>  ICT does not have significant impact on the performance of Professional secretaries</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:  </strong>ICT have significant impact on the performance of Professional secretaries</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis III</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong>  ICT skills have not improved the effectiveness of Professional secretaries</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:  </strong>ICT skills have improved the effectiveness of Professional secretaries</p> <p><strong>1.6       Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will be significant in the following areas:</p> <p>i)                   A better understanding on the roles and what makes professional secretaries effective.</p> <p>ii)                Ascertain the skills necessary and required to enhance the performance of professional secretaries.</p> <p><strong>1.7       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will be examining few secretaries in just two selected government establishment, which ministry of environment and ministry of agriculture.

The main purpose of this research was to find out the OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY profession, the teaching and learning of internet skills, the teaching and learning of Management information skills, the teaching and learning of data processing skills. Four research questions were formulated and questionnaires were used to obtain data from the population of 60. From the data analysis the following findings were made: that modern Technology plays important role in the OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY profession in polytechnics, that the the challenges of OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY profession in the modern technological era include acquisition of new ideas, helps in training of students in distance areas, provide teachers with current teaching aids among others. That modern Technology helps in the teaching and learning creation of document, storage of document, retrieval of document, disposal of document and protection of document, all these are the challenges of modern Technology in Information Management system. That the challenges of modern Technology in the teaching and learning of data processing skills includes; the teaching and learning of calculation skills, sorting of data, classification of data, recording of data and the teaching and learning of storing of data.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            The modern technology and Economic development in recent years have affected to a large extent the functions and performance of the OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY profession. Consequently, there arise the need for development of improved devices for the purpose of increasing productivity levels, to make work less tedious. The history of the secretarial revolution of the 14th to 16th centuries. Record keeping and inventions of Manu scripting were first developed. When it becomes imperative that these two innovations could not provide a complete answer to smooth take off of business and full office operations, further inventions were made giving birth to the art of typing with machines.</p> <p>            The invention of the typewriter and its uses in the office were almost revolutionarizin  their useful to business application. Work could be done more quickly, more legibly, more accurately and more economically. But the expansion of business activities demand for more and better skill and experienced personnel. The invention of the typewriter was followed by adding and calculating machines, cash register and book-keeping machines.</p> <p>            The office today has changed largely due to technical advances, new business procedures and concepts and international movement.</p> <p>            The use of new machines like computers, fax, machines, electric typewriters, word processing etc has generated new skills and new job opportunities.</p> <p>            These have posed a lot of challenges to the OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession.</p> <p>            Some OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession cannot operate these electronic gadgets and other modern equipment. In a research carried out by Okoye (1992:48), it was discovered that “graduate OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession were rated so low in their abilities to operate such equipments. Their knowledge and shorthand was appreciated but surprisingly, theseOFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession could only exhibit a faint knowledge of the mechanism of the copiers and duplicating machines.</p> <p>            Added to this, most OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Professionhave problems in their work places because of lack skill needed to operate these machines. Lockhart (1991) as cited by Osagie (1992:110) stated that the whole role of typist changed by the impact of new technology. This could mean that the secretarial studies in which we are much involved may need a re0examination with more emphasis on the administrative role of office personnel and fresh look at the whole activities of office management.</p> <p>            Whistler (1970:38) opined that in a recent study of life 15 insurance companies were conducted to determine employment changes at various job levels as a result of automation. These companies believed that without the use of computer that they would need 60% more personnel. In effect, while there may not be (and probably is not) a reduced number of office employees, more work is now being done with electronic machines, than ever before.</p> <p>            For some industries, the installation of computer has hardly affected the total unemployment picture, on the contrarty, new skills have been required. In many companies the rate if turnover among office employees continues to hogh with the result that proposed, reductions in manpower requirements are compensated by moral attrition (Neuner et al, 1972:36 –37)</p> <p>            Further, in an economic and statistical analysis conducted by fortune magazine as cited by Neuner et al (1972:36-37), it was emphatically concluded that automation has made substantially less headway in the United Sates of America economy than the literature on the subject would suggest. Not denying that fact that technology does change and does displace a substantial number of workers, it was noted that ten years after computers have come into common use no fully automated process exists for any major project in any industry in the united states.</p> <p>            With the introduction of automation, an organization stands to gain among others, increased production, efficiency of work and low labor turnover and improved secretarial performance.</p> <p>            This study is therefore geared towards finding out the challenges of automation on the effectiveness of OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession in financial houses in Enugu North Local Government Area</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>            It is not clear what effect modern Technology has on OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession. While the impression is that the introduction of automation in teaching and learning appear to be a blessing to its users, OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession who had not up-dated their skills fear that it would replace them. Is that a genuine fear? if an automated office would effectively replace the secretary,  how soon would that happen? Much is observed today about the changing office scene. Although many views are expressed concerning this subject, it is widely acknowledged that the future office operations and procedures are quite different from the ones the OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Professionare accustomed to. For instance, Olusegun (1991:5) opined that, in a meeting, fear were expressed that another 10 years there might be nothing left for the workers to do since automation and technology might have become so improved that machines begin to operate themselves. While Stouter (1983:28) stressed that sophisticated equipment will never be able to replace the creative, articulate thinking of human being. What equipment can do is to assume the responsibilities for the more repetition o, routine part of office jobs.</p> <p>            Are toady’s secretary’s training programmes designed to accommodate the ever changing job demands to enable her cope effectively with them. These views are more guesses which have not been subjected to scientific study. Hence, this work, “An Investigation into Challenges on modern Automation on the Effectiveness of OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession in Enugu North Local Government Area” is an attempt to find out the challenges of modern Technology on OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession.</p> <p><strong>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            The purposes of this study are</p> <ol><li>To ascertain whether modern Technology pose challenges to secretarial performance and productivity.</li> <li>To determine whether OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession who have no previous experience and skill in the manipulation of modern Technology encountered problems</li> <li>To find out whether OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession who are provided opportunities for training and retraining programes so as to meet challenges in modern Technology.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            This study will provide a research based information on the current notion-wide argument on the challenges of modern Technology to secretarial performance and productivity.</p> <p>            It will also be useful as it would show the adequacies or inadequacies to present day OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Professionviz-a-viz the manipulation of modern Technology.</p> <p>            Again, the study would be useful to organization and OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession as it will reveal the training and retraining programmes that are available to meeting these challenges and hence facilitate the realization of set organizational goals.</p> <p><strong>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>            1n a bid to achieve the objective mention above, the researcher sought answers to the following questions.</p> <p>i.              Do modern Technology pose challenges to secretarial performance and productivity</p> <p>ii.            Do OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession who had no previous experience skill in the manipulation of modern Technology have challenges</p> <p>iii.           Are OFFICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY Profession exposed to training and retraining in order to meet the challenges of modern Technology.</p> <p><strong>1.6       DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>DATA PROCESSING: The handling of data entirely by machine from the collection of the data to the production of the output data (Edum et al, 1996:145)</p> <p>FACSIMILES: An act of duplicating anything written, drawn or typed and transmitted between two distant points (Appleby, 1969:357)</p> <p>COMPUTER: An office machine with which office data is electronically processed at appreciable speed.

Fifty (50) female secretaries were selected for the study. The non-parametric tool of chi-square was employed for the purpose of data analysis; three research hypotheses were tested in all.</em></p> <p><em>Data analyzed revealed that female secretaries face different challenges in their work environment.  These challenges range from sexual assault to dynamism in work environment.  The researcher however recommended that organizations should procure as many modern technological gadgets as are available in the market to enable female secretaries increase their productivity.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong>            <strong>          INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In any establishment, the secretary is seen as a key factor to other personnel in an organization.  It is quite impossible to by-pass the secretary to other executives; hence the role of the secretary cannot be over-emphasized.  A secretary has been given so many titles as pillar, mirror and skeletal structure of an establishment.</p> <p>The word secretary has been in existence for a very long time precisely as soon as business organization came into being. The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary defined a secretary as an employee in an office, who deals with correspondence, keeps records, make arrangements and appointment for a particular member of staff.</p> <p>A secretary is the principal administrative support position in an office and increases the effectiveness of program staff by coordinating the paper flow of the office and carrying out the day-to-day administrative support activities required to accomplish the work of the organization.  The tasks which the secretaries perform fall into four broad categories; communication, coordination, organizations and records maintenance.  Within these categories, Secretaries perform a variety of tasks which enable managers and staffs to accomplish the mission of the agency.</p> <p>It is pertinent to say that, despite the facts that secretary has many roles to play in the management of any organization, so also there are many challenges and problems facing the secretary which may affect the proper running of an organization, especially the female secretaries.</p> <p>These problems may range from interpretation of words, tact’s in handling of office routines, inability to tackle complex situation, gender, and lack of general secretary skills to enhance efficiency.</p> <p>Therefore, a female secretary needs to have good basic educational background and experience.  In addition, a female secretary should have good secretarial skills in shorthand, typewriting, she must be computer literate and sound knowledge of English Language and practical experience of office works since a female secretary is expected to ease the burden of her boss whose work and responsibilities make heavy demand upon her.</p> <p><strong>1.1</strong>            <strong>   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The following areas are to be identified such as lack of recognition for a female secretary, sexual assault from the boss, difficult boss, gender and working hours have become a very serious problem in an organization.  Drastic measure needs to be taken to prevent these problems among the female secretaries in an organization.</p> <p>Considering the problems and challenges faced by the female secretaries from their boss, it arouses the interest of the researcher to appraise the challenges faced among female secretaries in an organization.</p>

The Internet is a worldwide system of connected networks. Each network consists of millions of computers, servers, routers, and printers. You can think of the Internet like the telephone network or the interstate highway system. You may have even heard people refer to the Internet as the Information Super Highway.<br/>\r\nThe Internet, sometimes simply called “the Net,” is a worldwide system of computer networks, a network of networks in which users at any computer can operate, if they have permission, get information from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers). Internet is described as a computer based global information systems. It is composed of many interconnected computer networks. The networks that make up the Internet may be owned and maintained by different companies but messages and data move across all of them without regard to ownership because they all use the same protocol or language to communicate. Each network may link tens, hundreds, or even thousands of computers enabling them, to share information and processing power which has made it possible for people all over the world to communicate with each other effectively and inexpensively.<br/>\r\nThe internet, unlike radio and television, system allows, individuals who have internet access to communicate directly with anyone on the internet, post information for general consumption, retrieve information, use distant application and services, buy and sell product etc.<br/>\r\nFor most internet user, electronic mail (E-mail) practically replaced the postal services for short written transaction. People communicate over the internet in a number of ways which include: internet Ray chat (IRC), internet telephony, instant messaging, video chat or social media.<br/>\r\nThe most widely used part of the internet is the World Wide Web (often abbreviated “WWW” or called “the web”). Nnamdi (2015) opined that the internet is an organization of networks that communicate with another to exchange information. Bintu and Fatima (2017) described internet as a major breakthrough in technology and the most flexible medium currently available in the word.<br/>\r\nThe Internet posses the world most broadcasting capability, a means of sharing information, between individuals and their computers, without regard for geographical location. The versatile nature of the internet has helped spread information beyond human imagination ranging from house-hold activities, education, political through telephone wires and satellite links. Internet users can share information in a variety of ways. The size, scope and design of the internet allow users to: connect easily through ordinary personal computer and local phone numbers. Exchange electronic mail (e-mail) with friends and colleagues with accounts on the internet. Post information for others to access and update frequently the beginning of the internet astonishing expansion. Some of the ways that users are taking advantage of internet are: Sharing research and business data among colleagues and like minded individuals, communicating with others and transmitting files via e-mails, requesting and providing gathering and providing feedback and suggestions from customers and business partners.<br/>\r\nThe internet potentials are limited only by users’ vision and creativity. As the internets grow, new and innovative users will surely follow. Secretaries is expected to acquire basic skills on the use of internet, in order to communicate directly with anyone else on the net, post information for general consumption, retrieve information use distant application and services or even buy and sell products.<br/>\r\nThat is to say that the Secretaries in modern offices can use the internet in offering office electronic office to some extent.</p><p>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>\r\nGenerally internet and micro-electronic are gradually over taking office tasks or activities, Secretaries are prone to so many challenges. Although this innovation is to enhance speed and accuracy in office tasks, but most of the graduates of office technology and management find it difficult to embrace this new technology because they lack the necessary skills needed for operation of the electronic machines. It is these problems that this research seek to address.<br/>\r\nConsequently, Secretaries may not acquire the skills of how to tackle internet tasks before their works are being performed. Hence they do not meet up with internet tasks in modern offices.</p><p>PURPOSE THE STUDY<br/>\r\nThe major purpose of this study is to find out the internet tasks performed by Secretaries in modern offices. The study sought to identify the following.<br/>\r\n1.    The internet communication tasks performed by Secretaries in modern offices.<br/>\r\n2.    The internet administrative tasks performed by Secretaries in modern offices.<br/>\r\n3.    The E-commerce tasks performed by Secretaries in modern offices.<br/>\r\n4.    The webpage tasks performed by Secretaries in modern offices.</p><p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>\r\nIn the nearest future, knowing how to use the internet will be as important as knowing how to read and write. This research work will be of great interest to both practicing and potential Secretaries and this will help them to be productive, knowledgeable and skilled in the operation of internet which will, in turn, enable them function properly in internet connection offices.<br/>\r\nOther employees will equally benefit from this study as it will enable them get vital information easily and faster. It will also help them in transacting business with other organizations thereby increasing their productivity.<br/>\r\nThis research will also serve as literature in future for students who will embark on related topic.</p><p>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>\r\nWhat are the internet communication tasks performed by Secretaries in modern offices?<br/>\r\nWhat are the internet administrative tasks performed by Secretaries in modern offices?<br/>\r\nWhat are the e-commerce tasks performed by Secretaries in modern offices?<br/>\r\nWhat are the webpage tasks performed by Secretaries in modern offices?</p><p>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>\r\nThe scope is limited to the internet tasks performed by Secretaries in modern offices. Such as communication tasks, administrative tasks, e-commerce tasks and webpage.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n \n\nINTERNET TASKS PERFORMED BY SECRETARIES IN MODERN OFFICES IN IDAH LOCAL GOVRENMENT KOGI STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INTERNET TASKS PERFORMED BY SECRETARIES IN MODERN OFFICES IN IDAH LOCAL GOVRENMENT KOGI STATE", "id": 26}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECT OF POOR INFRASTRUCTURAL FACILITIES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SECRETARIAL STUDIES IN POLYTECHNICS IN OWERRI URBAN.</b><br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Secretarial studies is a vocational programme that is offered in Polytechnics, Colleges of Education and Universities primarily to educate and train students to become secretarial teachers and administrators with the appropriate skills and competencies to take up a career in teaching, office occupation and business.  According to Amoor and Udoh  (2008), secretarial education is an area of instruction that has been in existence for several decades, and it plays very significant role in national economic development.  It is, according to Usman (2008) a vital tool in the hand of government to combat unemployment crisis, and also according to Ilo (2002) is a tool to alleviate poverty.  Secretarial Education is also very useful to private organizations and individuals in terms of employability, job creation and self-reliance.<br/>For an effective learning in the tertiary institution, the required infrastructural facilities should be in place. Thus, for effective secretarial studies in our higher institution, there should be adequate supply of the needed equipment and facilities needed for most of their practical studies. The role and function of a secretary involve a lot and as a result of this, the students who are undergoing secretarial studies should be exposed to the necessary facilities that will enable them in developing and equipping themselves.<br/>The role of infrastructural facilities in the upliftment of secretarial studies is quite crucial and necessary, owing to the fact that we are faced with the invention of telecommunication and the technological status-quo of our contemporary society is fast developing. To this effect, the secretary is faced with the challenges of being acquainted with these new technologies that are revolving around the globe.<br/>Owing to this fact, it is quite dilapidating that most tertiary institution (especially polytechnics) that are offering secretarial studies lacks the facilities and the necessary infrastructure that will enhance the level of secretarial studies to be in line with the contemporary era.<br/>It is clear that in most offices today, the secretaries now receives mail through the internet no longer through letters, most of the office files are documented with computers, telecommunication becomes the medium of communication, and a lot of inventory that the computerized world has introduced to the society, thus, these and more are the complications and challenges facing the secretary in an office in this contemporary era.<br/>In order to help the future secretaries, the government and the management should see that the necessary infrastructural facilities that will help the students in achieving great things are provided.<br/>It is the problems of poor infrastructural facilities in the department of secretarial studies in polytechnics in Owerri Urban that this research work is out to investigate and to pinpoint way in which the situation of poor infrastructural facilities can be minimized in polytechnics.<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Secretarial studies Department were established in polytechnics in Owerri Urban with the main aim of training students in the secretarial profession. The department since its inception, has been trying its best in proceeding students of the Secretarial progression.<br/>It is quite a dilapidating issue to note that the present demons or problems in the institutions which emanated as a result of poor infrastructural facilities in the department has twisted the dream of producing well sound and professional secretaries in the society. It must however, be said that one of the greatest predicaments of these institution today is the neglect of the secretarial studies Department whose poor quality very much tend to the craze for good quality make department. Therefore, well established and qualified department is equally contributing to a healthy economy.<br/>In view of the present demands in the institution, it must however, be said that one of the greatest predicaments of polytechnic institutions in Owerri Urban today is the neglect of the secretarial studies department whose poor quality very much tend to the craze for good quality male department. Therefore, well established and equipped department is equally contributing to a healthy economy.<br/> 1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The inability of most graduates who have passed through the rigorous secretarial training to measure up to expectation has been a dilapidating issue in the society. Owing to this fact, this research work is faced with the problem of identifying those problems which militates against effective secretarial studies in polytechnics in Owerri Urban in relation to the lack of the necessary infrastructural facilities needed in the department, and for equipment of the secretarial students. To identify ways in which these problems that emanated as a result of poor infrastructural facilities in the department of secretarial studies can be resolved is the a problematic issue facing this research work.<br/>1.3    AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>As a research work, it is aimed at resolving the controversial issue which militates against effective secretarial studies in polytechnic in Owerri Urban, thus the following objectives will be realized in the course of this study<br/>    To capture in details the concept of secretarial studies and secretary in line with their functions and responsibilities.<br/>    To identify the necessary infrastructural facilities that will be necessary in revamping the effectiveness of secretarial studies in polytechnics Owerri Urban<br/>    To pinpoint the effect of poor infrastructural facilities on the productivity of secretarial studies in Polytechnics in Owerri Urban<br/>    To give possible solutions that will help to provide the necessary infrastructural facilities needed in the department of secretarial studies.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Owing to the fact that the role of secretaries in most organization are so important, this research will be of great significance in the sense that it tries to identify the problems that hinder the growth of secretarial studies in Polytechnics Owerri Urban, and by so doing, the productivity of secretarial job will be elevated. Thus if the findings of this work will be applied vividly, there will great improvement not only with polytechnics Owerri Urban but to the whole tertiary institution at large. This research work will be of great help to future researcher on the topic.<br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work does treat in total the importance of infrastructural facilities or the problems and prospects of secretarial studies but limits itself to the effect of poor infrastructural facilities in the department of secretarial studies in polytechnics in Owerri urban. For the sake of clarity, coherency, precision and specification, this research work will be carried within the polytechnics in Owerri Urban though the findings can vividly and validly be applied to all the tertiary institutions at large.<br/>1.6    LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>During the course of this research, a lot of obstacles was encountered. Thus, the uncooperation of most people working in the library and other offices where the researcher needed to get materials posed great problem to the researcher. Some of the staff does not feel safe letting us have access to some materials while others will charge you more than double cost of Photostat before one can get what he want.<br/>Financial constraint is another limitation to this works which is as a result of high cost of transportation fare to the area of study to gather data, combined with the cost of material to carry this work to conclusive standard was equally important<br/>1.7    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>In the bid to offer solution to the problems facing this research work, the following research question will be given answers, thus:<br/>    To what extent do secretarial studies necessary in secretarial job?<br/>    Do you agree that poor infrastructural facilities can hinder effective secretarial studies?<br/>    Is the problem of poor infrastructural facilities in polytechnic Owerri Urban as a result of the negligence on the part of the government or mismanagement on the part of the school administration?<br/>    Is there any effort from the government to remedy the problem of infrastructural facilities in the department of secretarial studies?<br/>    If yes, what have they done so far?<br/>    Is there any relationship between poor infrastructural facilities and the performance of secretarial studies in polytechnic Owerri Urban.<br/>    What are the major infrastructural facilities are lacking in the polytechnic Owerri Urban.<br/>1.8    STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS<br/>During the course of this research, the following research hypothesis will be tested.<br/>Ho:   There is no significant relationship between inadequate provision of infrastructural facilities and the productivity of secretarial studies<br/>H1:   There is significant relationship between inadequate provision of infrastructural facilities and the productivity of secretarial studies.<br/>1.9    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Effect: A change or changed state as a direct result of action by somebody or something else<br/>Poor: This term poor be regarded as inadequate, lower than expected. In view of the context of the study it can be seen as insufficient to serve the desired need.<br/>Infrastructural facilities: this can be regarded as the large scale of public systems, servers and facilities of a country or region that are necessary for economic activity or academic growth including power and water supply, public transportation, telecommunications, roads and schools.<br/>Department: In view of the context of the study, this refers to the sectors of polytechnics that deals with the education of secretarial students.<br/>Secretarial study: this involves the academic activities rendered in academic institution for the training and educating of future secretaries<br/>Secretary: an employee who does clerical or administrative work in an office for a person or organization. Somebody elected or permitted to keep the records of the meetings of an organization such as a club, society or community and to write or answer letters on it behalf.<br/>Polytechnics: According to the Encarta Dictionary, it is a college offering vocational courses: a college offering a range of course, some of them vocational or technical, at or below the bachelor degree level.<br/><br/>\n\nEFFECT OF POOR INFRASTRUCTURAL FACILITIES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SECRETARIAL STUDIES IN POLYTECHNICS IN OWERRI URBAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF POOR INFRASTRUCTURAL FACILITIES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SECRETARIAL STUDIES IN POLYTECHNICS IN OWERRI URBAN", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CAUSES OF CONFLICT BETWEEN SECRETARIES<br/>AND BOSSES IN ANAMBRA STATE OWNED ESTABLISHMENT (AHOCOL  COMPANY AWKA)</b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>The major purpose of this research is to find out the causes of conflict between Secretaries and Bosses in Anambra State owned Establishments.

The Webster Dictionary of English (2005) however, defined a Secretary as one trusted with secret of or confidence of a superior, adviser, confident or one employed to handle correspondence   and manage routine and detailed work for a superior. This depicts that a secretary is a skilled personnel who possess both executive and personal attributes in managing the affairs of any organization effectively and efficiently in order to achieve organizational objective. From this description, Onasanya (1990) defines a Secretary as someone who possess adequate knowledge of administration or organization and the ability to achieve results through hard work and management of resources or people on behalf of his/her boss. Its classification depends basically on experience and their functions are diverse and this depends largely on the field of specification. The cadre of secretaries tends to determine and at the same time modify the function of such secretary.<br/>    According to Rule and Byars (1983), performance is the degree of accomplishment of the tasks that makes up on individual job, but the performance of these function can be greatly inhibited by certain functions.<br/>    According to Alancik and Fetter (1977) a job is satisfying when there is a match between the characteristic of the job and the needs of the individuals. The determinants include self-evolution, expectation, social norms, social comparisons, commitment etc, for instance, if on e expects a job to be paying well,  and it is not, them he/she will be dissatisfied. Also if one is not evaluated up to the standard, she will also not be happy (dissatisfied).<br/>    The Secretary’s satisfaction leads to organization commitment, while dissatisfaction result in behaviors is know to the organization. (Turnover, absentee’s, low morale, etc).<br/>    Those who are dissatisfied with their work never reach psychological maturity. They feel frustrated. Employees who like their jobs and other job related factors will be loyal and devoted employees. However, employees who strongly dislike and dissatisfied with their job or any other job related factors will often exhibits these feelings by taking absent or by taking more convert actions to disrupt the organization.<br/>    A Conflict is a serious disagreement or argument. Conflict has become a feature of labor management relationship in Nigeria while Secretaries and   Bosses in the industries should work harmoniously together for the betterment to the fulfilled in practice. Secretaries and bosses tend to have opposite views. This is because of the divergence between the expectation of management and labor in an Establishment.<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>    The Secretary is flexible, technically good in their jobs and they are determined. Public concern regarding the conflicts of bosses and secretaries in Nigeria has been on the increase in recent times. It is observed that many qualified secretaries desecrate their jobs and take to other professions entirely different from Secretarial profession. Many Secretaries that choose to remain in the profession do not seek ways of improving their management in an organization.<br/>    Generally, the concern is more on the conflicts between Bosses and Secretaries; no mention is ever made of the factors responsible of these conflicts. Certain questions need to be asked in an attempt to recognize those factors that causes the conflicts in state owned establishment.<br/>Purpose of the Study<br/>    The major purpose of this study is:<br/>    To basically investigate some of the causes of conflicts between Bosses and Secretaries in State owned Establishment.<br/>    To examine the damages which conflicts between bosses and secretaries caused to different industries<br/>    To find out the consequences of such conflicts<br/>    To suggest remedy and strategies for solving conflicts between Bosses and secretaries in state owned establishment.<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>    The study is significant for the following reasons:<br/>The result of the study will enable the Management to formulate a policy toward conflicts resolution in establishment industries.<br/>    It will help to highlight some of the factors which cause conflict between bosses and secretaries in a state establishment (AHOCOL) so that management will appreciate the seriousness of the problem.<br/>    The study will also enable the management to formulate policies towards conflicts resolution in industries. It will serve as a guide (especially in establishment industry) to enable them prepare their minds on how to take the conflicts likely to come.<br/>    The information contain in the study will be of assistance to students who might be interested in further research into other areas of secretaries and bosses conflicts not covered by not present study.   <br/>Research questions<br/>1.    What are the factors that cause the conflicts between bosses and secretaries?<br/>2.    What are the damages caused by such conflicts?<br/>3.    What are the method used in resolving this conflict between bosses and secretaries?<br/>Delimitations of the Study<br/>    This study was delimitated to the causes of problem between Secretaries and Bosses in industries owned by the Government and to enable management to formulate a policy towards conflicts resolution in industries.<br/>Definition of terms<br/>-    Secretary – Is an employee in an office, who deals with correspondence, keeps records and makes management and appointments for a particular member of the staff.<br/>-    Boss – A boss is a person who is the head of a company, not merely in change of subordinate workers but in charge of all lower level manager and supervisors, sometimes called middle management.<br/>-    Establishment – As a place where a business is carried on.<br/>-    Industry - An industry is a group of companies that manufacture products and services which are closely related to each other.<br/>-    Organization - Is a social unit of people that is structed and managed to meet a need or to pursue collective goals.<br/>-    Conflicts – refers to  some form of friction, disagreement or discord arising within a group  when the beliefs or actions of one or more members of the group are either resisted by or unacceptable to one or more members of another group.<br/>-    Skill – This refers to all activities that require the control of physical movements to be made.<br/>-    Performance – Secretaries ability to carryout the duties and responsibilities demanded to his/her position.<br/>-    Source: Oxford Advanced Learners (6th edition)<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nCAUSES OF CONFLICT BETWEEN SECRETARIES AND BOSSES IN ANAMBRA STATE OWNED ESTABLISHMENT (AHOCOL   COMPANY AWKA)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CAUSES OF CONFLICT BETWEEN SECRETARIES AND BOSSES IN ANAMBRA STATE OWNED ESTABLISHMENT (AHOCOL   COMPANY AWKA)", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE INFLUENCE OF COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SECRETARY. <br/>A CASE STUDY OF NBL/AMA GREENFILED 9TH MILE CORNER ENUGU<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This research work was carried out to examine the influence of communication equipment on the efficiency of the secretary with particular reference to Nigerian Breweries Public limited company NBL/Ama Green Field 9th mile corner Enugu.<br/>            The theoretical frame work for this study was based on the use of related literature.

Communication particularly in business organizations provides a means by which power is required, exercised, shaped and sustained.<br/>            Generally, communication is an act shaped by all living things. It originated from the Latin word “communies” meaning to share. Communication is the act of imparting a share of something.<br/>            To emphasized on the importance of communication, Cicero (1970) said thus “If a wise man were granted a life of abundance of materials things, so that he has leisure to contemplate everything worth knowing, yet if he could not communicate with other human if he could not communicate with other human beings he could abandon life”<br/>            By John fists (1982) “Communication is talking to one another, it is television, it is spreading information by whatever means. It is our life style, it is literary criticism, the list is endless.<br/>            Two schools of though exist on communication. The process school and the sem school. Both schools agreed on the fact that for communication to be effective, there must be a sender, a receiver, a channel and the subject matter which is being communicated on. There could also be noise which is anything that is being added to the communication signals between its transmission and reception that is not intended by sources.<br/>            Communication in a business organization encompasses more than mere oral transmission. It involves all the sensory, oral and written activities that form part of our organizational life. The actualization of communication is the equipment. This is because when instruction are communicated through the equipment,. The people working know their responsibilities and the secretary dispensers her duties appropriately. Thus, the organizational goal would be enhanced.<br/>1.2       WHO IS A SECRETARY<br/>            The word secretary us coined from the Latin word “Secretus” which literally means “a secret”. Perhaps it is the fact that aspect if the work of a secretary involve keeping secrets that the secretaries are often regarded as a keeper of secrets.<br/>            The National Secretaries Association (United stated of America) defined a secretary as “an assistant to an executive, possessing mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who displays initiatives, exercises judgment and takes decision within the scope of her authority. There is therefore no doubting that fact that the secretary is the wheel on which the executive activities revolve. The secretary is often refereed to as the executive alter ego.<br/>1.3       ROLES OF A SECRETARY<br/>            The role of the secretary plays in an office is wide and varied depending on the size and type of organization in which she is working. Technological innovation in the office has increasingly made the work of the secretary more complex and sophisticated though a lot easier.<br/>            However, there are some of the routine duties a secretary is expected to perform.<br/>ARRANGING FOR MEETING<br/>            It is the duty of the secretary to arrange for meetings, take accurate minutes of the meeting and type them out neatly.<br/>DECISION MAKING AND PROBLEMS SOLVING<br/>            H.A. Dauda (1993) The secretary should assist the executive in his decision making and problem solving role. She does this by filtering calls and callers which enables the manager to concentrate fully. She also furnishes her boss with adequate information from files and elsewhere. The secretary should seek as the ears of her boss when he is away and inform him accordingly when he is back.<br/>COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION<br/>            The secretary joins the manager in his communication processing and dissemination of information. Modern communication and information technology can enable people communicate locally and internationally at the shortest possible time. Local area networks, teleconferences and caller phones are good facilitators of both near and far distant communications. The secretary in particular plays a great role in dissemination of information. He must give adequate and timely information. <br/>INTERPERSONAL SKILLS.<br/>            Every organization is made up of different kinds of people/business associates, clients, peers and staffs of the organization. It believes on the secretary to develop a good public relations skill by which she grapes quickly the mood of views of all these people and adjust his own responses accordingly such skills include: being a good listener, making people feel at ease and being able to interpret the body movement and signals people display.<br/>ORGANIZING THE WORKLAOD<br/>            It is the duty of the secretary to organize the method to run the daily workload of the organization. He doubles as the manager’s receptionist, prioritizes the procedure for handling the office mail, operates the various memory aids for checking work progress or those awaiting responses, looking appointments and blocking undesirable visitors and finally maintaining the manager’s diary. <br/>MASTERY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT<br/>            Mastery of  the communications equipment and the office equipment for use in doing the job is vital. Also she should be able to know the objectives of the firm whether it is profit-oriented, service oriented, operates an expansionist policy or large-scale economics. <br/>1.4       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            Our nuclear age is witnessing an everyday reduction in the number of staff required to perform units of a particular operation due to the development and injection of various communication equipment.<br/>            Based on this development it becomes logical to ask if the communication equipment are bringing about changes in the communication role of the secretary.<br/>            The problem now to be death with is “Can communication equipment enhance or undermine the efficiency of the secretary”<br/>1.5       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of the study us to<br/>a.       Look into the roles a secretary has to play in the m=world of modern communication<br/>b.      Identify some of the oral and written communication equipment<br/>c.       Determine the effect of communication equipment on the secretary’s efficiency<br/>d.      Identify the merits and demerits of the communication equipment and their influence on the secretary.<br/>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This work aims at establishing the roles of a secretary in the world if modern communication. It equally aims at clearing the mind of those who think that secretaries are never-do-well and to make it clear that there is a difference between copy typists and trained secretaries.<br/>            Also of importance in this study is the knowledge of the communication equipment to secretaries. Students studying secretarial and business administration respectively are not left out.<br/>            The research will also try to allay the fear in some practicing secretaries and students secretaries that advancement of communication technology will have counter-productive effect on the role of a secretary<br/>1.8       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The scope of this study is very wide if it has to be carried out in all organizations. Therefore, this research study will be confined to secretaries of (Nigeria Breweries Public Limited Company/Ama Greenfield, 9th mile corner Enugu) NBL. The company has enough of communication equipment and secretaries that operate them.<br/>            Moreover the research is centered on this technological age where the innovations seem to take the position of human communication and that id a secretary in an organization. Thus, this research could be described as a modern and computer age study.<br/>1.10     RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            The questions are intended to point more on the topic and accordingly supply answers to them<br/>1.      What are the roles that a secretary plays in the world of modern communication<br/>2.      What are the communication equipment (oral and written) to be found in a secretary’s office.<br/>3.      Are the communication equipment bringing about effect on the efficiency of the secretary.<br/>4.      Can a secretary cope with such effect/changes brought about by the communication equipment<br/>5.      Are the communication equipment of any advantages or positive influence on the secretary.<br/>6.      DO demerits of communication equipment have influence on the secretary.<br/>1.11     DEFINITION OF TERMS.<br/>EXECUTIVES ALTER EGO: This means an assistant to the executive who possesses a mastery of office skills, demonstrate the ability to assume responsibilities with or without direct supervision.<br/>TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: These are the modern sophisticated devices that gave communication very wonderful boost.<br/>LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN): Is the linking of devices together for sharing information with the aid of terminals.<br/>NEVER-DO-WELL: This means unimportant and worthless. Thus, the secretary is not never-do-well but indispensable in every organization.<br/>MEMORY AIDS: These are those things/documents which a secretary uses to record appointments viz: diary. Appointment cards, induced memory aid, telephone pad, private notebook, reminder schedule, calendar, mnemonic devices and pocket computer.<br/>NUCLEAR AGE: This is the scientific era when weapons and innovation are in vogue <br/><br/>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SECRETARY.

These files will be kept in the file cabinet as the storage facility and this process will be in progress for years. Although these facts are kept at a stage some of these documents may get too old and tore, it can get lost or the cabinet may not contain it any longer thereby leading to its relocation. Also another worker in the organization may take away an important document without the secretary’s knowledge<br/>            Further, stones and sticks were initially used as counting tools or machine before the industrial revolution. Charles Babbage who invented the first calculating machine fore see the ineffectiveness of using the Abacus method of calculation. Computer came into existence with the help of the Harvard University coupled with the idea of Babbage with the experience gained from the use of punched cared machine. The first electric computer was build in 1944 and it was called the Electronic Numerical Integrator and calculator (ENIC)<br/>            Over the years, (during the 19th and 20th century) business officers have been under going the process of computerization in terms of installing computers and other modern equipment in pace of old And absolute ones. This computerization process started in Europe after the industrial revolution and has since gone round the world including Nigeria and Enugu.<br/>            Moreover, the duties of modern secretaries in offices and the use of computer revolves round the secret for the achievement of organizational goals because a modern office that does not have this computer may not achieve their goals effectively. A modern secretary is a person who possesses a mastery of office skills who demonstrate the ability to assume responsibilities without supervision, who exercises initiatives and judgment and who make decisions within the scope of assigned authority with the knowledge of computers.<br/>            Today most offices have been computerized and it is the secretaries that manipulates these equipments in the course of discharging their duties effectively. The question now is “To what extent does the use of computer affect the job performance of modern secretaries in terms of efficiency, quality of work done reduces mistakes in circulation and gives offices efficient cost effect analysis that would be nearly impossible with manual operations. The effects of the computer literate on the modern secretaries than becomes an issue of discussion.<br/>            Computerized technology is more powerful, more versatile and more flexible than the mechanical technology that the world has now outgrown. In the rapidly changing world where information technology and the electronic office is fast becoming a reality, secretaries cannot be pleased and rely on their basic office skills or secretarial training. Although skills and discipline will be necessary, the ability to be conversant with word processors, computer, desktop publishing equipment and computer application and future innovations will be an essential requirement. Introduction of computer technology improves the secretarial skills and experience. Office work is the area of business which has been most influenced by computer and micro processor. Secretarial work requires the use of word processor, printer and monitors to control their operations and it also help artists, scientist, engineers, accountants, etc. computers are vital to the secretaries in their management systems and storage of information.<br/>            In spite of this computer age, some secretaries are still carrying out their duties manually without the aid of computers because they are completely ignorant of the usefulness of the computer. This research therefore is carried out in order to carefully identify how computer literacy can help modern secretaries and how it will effect their duties.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Since the introduction of computer into the business world, secretaries now find it difficult to cope with the latest development in micro age. Because there are many problems associated with the use of computer. According to Terry (1970:155) stated that the problems associated with the use of computer is heavily with the cost of maintenance. The cost of repairing and maintaining computer are so high that most of them are dumped in the office making secretaries who are acquainted with them handicapped to tackle their job. Recurrent expenses in the form of cost of stationery, ink, training of staff and special pay for such staff are problems encounters in procuring computer Onasanya (1990:248). He further said that computer reduces inefficiency on the part of the secretary, problems such as delay in production due to break down of the machines arises.<br/>Also modern secretaries without computer literate find it difficult to cope or perform their duties  well in a modern office. Many modern office now no longer employ any secretary without computer literate.<br/>Again, the old system of filing or storage has been phased out since the introduction of computers in to the business world. Some modern secretaries cling to the use of manual machine due to their ignorant of the usefulness of computer because of their lack of knowledge of it. Hence her interest for this study to identify the effects of computer literacy on modern secretaries.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The aims of this study is to identify the effects of computer literacy on modern secretaries using NEPA Enugu as the focal point. <br/>Specially, the study will try to<br/>Identify the effects of computer literacy on the job performance of modern secretaries.<br/>Find out whether modern secretaries who are not computer literate can be employed in a modern office<br/>Identify whether the knowledge of computer facilitates the work of modern secretaries.<br/>Find out the importance of computer to modern secretaries.<br/>Find out whether the computer has come to replace the work of secretaries.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            To achieve the above objectives, five research questions were formulated and the research will provide answers to the following research questions.<br/>What are the effects o computers literacy on the job performance o modern secretaries<br/>Can modern secretaries who are not computer literate be employed in a modern office<br/>Does the knowledge of computer facilitates the work of secretaries.<br/>What are the importance o computer to modern secretaries<br/>Has the introduction of computer come to replace the work of secretaries.<br/>1.5       HYPOTHESIS<br/>            The following null hypothesis will be tested.<br/>Ho:      There is no significance difference between the mean responses of female and male secretaries of NEPA Enugu on the effect of computer literacy on the job performance of modern secretaries (P&lt;.05)<br/>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This research is focused on an identification of the effects of computers literacy on modern secretaries in NEPA Enugu. Also to the use of observation which were employed to assess both view of the senor secretaries and  junior secretaries and the top managers that work directly with the secretaries.<br/>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study is going to identify the effects of computer on the job performance of modern secretaries in modern office, to recommend solutions for the up-liftment of everybody in business and for the growth of Nigerian economy in particular.<br/>SECRETARIES<br/>            This study is significant in that it will help modern secretaries to know whether computer literate is important in performing their jobs. This is to minimize and where possible to eliminate computer ignorance on the side of secretaries, workers and nature itself.<br/>            It will also help to clear the argument on whether the introduction of computer will make modern secretaries jobless or not. Many secretaries now bear it at the back of their mind that the only reason of introducing computer into our business is to chase them away from their normal position in the office<br/>EMPLOYERS<br/>            On the side of employers, the notable significance is to inform the employers on the category of secretaries to organizations will equally enjoy this research since it will help them to know, choose or employ qualified secretaries in their organizations.<br/>            The secretaries are said to be the life wire of any organization or business. When the secretaries and their employers are happy, the business itself will be invariably happy. The position of secretaries in office affair is a function of the world position in office line. Therefore, the world as a whole is a beneficiary from the study<br/>            Finally, this study is immensely significant, primarily with the respect to the fact that it constitutes a major requirement to the conferment of the Higher National Diploma in secretarial studies on the writer. The study will be beneficial to those who need the information for literature enrichment of the subject such as director, managers, secretaries and those interested in secretarial information. <br/>\n\nTHE ROLES OF DATA PRESERVATION IN ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF SECRETRIAL FUNCTION IN SELECTED BANKS IN  ENUGU METROPOLIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLES OF DATA PRESERVATION IN ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF SECRETRIAL FUNCTION IN SELECTED BANKS IN  ENUGU METROPOLIS", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE RELEVANCE OF INDUSTRIAL WORK EXPERINCE TO SECRETARIAL STUDENTS <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SECRTARIAL STUDIES IMT ENUGU<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The student’s industrial work experience scheme (SIWES) Relevance to the Department of Secretarial Studies was researched upon.

These they are likely to meet after graduation.<br/>            The scheme affords students the opportunity of seeing familiarized and exposed to the needed experience in handling of machinery and equipment which are usually not available in the educational institutions.<br/>            Furthermore, the scheme exposes the students to work methods and prepare them in safeguarding the work area and other workers in the industry.<br/>            SIWES was introduced by the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) in Nigeria in (1973) about 31 years ago. It was then limited to students of technology. Today it has covered many disciplines and has  become a necessary recognition for the award of national diploma (ND) and Higher National Diploma (HND) in polytechnics in the country.<br/>            A center focus of the scheme is to enlist and strengthen  employers involvement in the educational process of preparing students for the worlds of work. The scheme is therefore aimed at promoting the much-desired technological know-how ultimate goal of the scheme force needed to build a self-reliance economy.<br/>            The following are SIWES relevance to secretarial studies.<br/>            It provides opportunity for the researcher and co-students to gain experiences as a supplement to their students by this, the researcher’s writing in this project will be supervised by the supervisor who helps to direct on how to carry out any given task.<br/>            It affords students the opportunity of being familiarized and exposed to the needed experience in secretarial studies.<br/>            It exposes the researcher/students to real life situation thus supplementing the theoretical lessons in the classroom.<br/>            It helps students to be acquainted to what nature of job they are likely to meet at the labor market.<br/>            It broader the knowledge and understanding of the students in terms of each person to know more<br/>            It is to prepare the researcher the participating students for better future use of their hand s and brain.<br/>            It helps students to gather more information for difficult issues.<br/>            It is one of the most task to take before graduating as a national diploma holder before enrolling for higher national diploma<br/>            As a problems facing the department and a solution to it is to relate it to the people in charge for better result in due time for the life wire of secretarial; studies.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>            It has been observed that some students have some misconception about the work experience programme of the I.T.F. some students for example, equate the programmer with holidays job. Hence the commitment is lacking and so the skills and experience to be gained cannot be acquired from the scheme.<br/>            Again there is relevance among large number of employers to accept and provide facilities necessary for meaningful industrial experience to students. The fears of many employers are that students are inexperienced to handle certain delicate machines and tools without damaging them. A situation in which students are not allowed to use certain equipment does not provide the desired experience needed to prepare them for the world of work.<br/>            Also some students are not supervised during the attachments or training period at all. This is attributable to lack of adequate transportation facilities and or lack of seriousness on the part of their supervisors.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>            The need of this study which was carried out and conducted in the department of secretarial studies. Institute of management and technology in 2004/2005 is to determine that it is of relevance to students to participate fully during their industrial work experience scheme. The researcher also wants to have an empirical base not to support all the sources about the poor impression students have on the industrial work experience scheme. Students must learn to think about themselves not as just a student, but as a product of oneself and doing the things which will make people to want deal with them. Do students of secretarial studies really know their works, and are they wooing secretarial studies as mere woo girks they fancy or love<br/>            If my findings are not valid, I would say there are no bases for the SIWES, but that it arise because students ought to do well in their discipline.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            From the need for study it was assumed that the scheme is completely different from ordinary long vocation employment of the undergraduate. It is a continuation of the students studies.<br/>            SIWES as a t the time of its inception was limited to students of Engineering and Technology only. But today it covers many disciplines because of its relevance to technological and economic development. The scheme has succeeded in establishing a closer collaboration between institutions and industries which is essential for preparing young people skillfully for the world of work.<br/>            It helps to prepare students to fit in, readily to employment industries and commerce. Students no becomes exposed to real life situation, thus supplementing the theoretical lessons in the classroom. The research will also try to make the industrial training fund realize the existence of the department of secretarial studies and to include them in the eligible course for which SIWES and industrial training fund were compulsorily and centrally funded. This is because secretary-ship is one of the professional courses which its advantages cannot be over emphasized.<br/>            The study will also serve as useful information to any person who wants to research on related issues.<br/>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study covers students industrial work experience scheme relevance to the secretarial studies department.<br/>            The institution of management and technology (IMT) Enugu was studied and no attempt was made to study any other department in any other institution involved in the scheme.<br/>1.7       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>Do students that participate in SIWES programmer receive enough practical from the programme <br/>Do students participating in SIWES gain insight into the industrial operations.<br/>In SIWES helping in generating a pool of indigenous trained manpower needed in the country<br/>Does SIWES help to expose students to methods of handling equipments and machinery<br/>Do the students gain supervised experience in industries through SIWES<br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE RELEVANCE OF INDUSTRIAL WORK EXPERINCE TO SECRETARIAL STUDENTS (A CASE STUDY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SECRTARIAL STUDIES IMT ENUGU<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE RELEVANCE OF INDUSTRIAL WORK EXPERINCE TO SECRETARIAL STUDENTS (A CASE STUDY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SECRTARIAL STUDIES IMT ENUGU", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTER LITERACY ON MODERN SECRETARIES IN NEPA ENUGU<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This project attempted to identify the effects of computer literacy on the job performance of modern secretaries and to find out if secretaries without computer knowledge can be conveniently employed in a modern office.<br/>            The researcher used all the secretaries in NEPA Enugu Zonal office which is 75 secretaries as the population of the study.

The researcher noticed that students are not taught word processing as a serious course and this has contributed to their failure in performing their job.<br/>            It was as a result of these findings, the researcher suggested that every secretary should try hard to become computer literate by going for the training so as to secure gainful employment in a modern office.<br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/>Table 4.1         Responses of the respondents on the effects of computer literacy on the job performance of modern secretaries<br/>Table 4.2         Responses of the respondents on whether the use of computer affected the efficiency of secretaries<br/>Table 4.3         Responses of the respondents on the effects of computer application of the productivity of secretaries.<br/>Table 4.4         Responses of the respondents on whether the advent of computer affected the demand for secretaries.<br/>Table 4.5         Responses of the respondents on whether modern secretaries who are not computer literate be employed in a modern office<br/>Table 4.6         Responses of the respondents on whether secretaries without computer literacy skill maintain their position in the modern office.<br/>Table 4.7         Responses of the respondents on whether their office still accept secretaries without computer knowledge<br/>Table 4.8         Responses of the respondents on whether the continues growth of computer in modern business world would make secretaries without computer literacy be conveniently employed.<br/>Table 4.9         Responses of the respondents on whether the knowledge of computer facilitate the work of secretaries.<br/>Table 4.10       Responses of the respondents on how computer facilitate the work of a secretary<br/>Table 4.11       Responses of the respondents on how you ease the output of work you produce with computer<br/>Table 4.12       Responses of the respondents on whether computer has displayed secretaries in modern office<br/>Table 4.13       Responses of the respondents on the importance of computer to modern secretaries<br/>Table 4.14       Responses of the respondents on how they accept the importance of computer to secretary.<br/>Table 4.15       Responses of the respondent on how had the use of computer made your role as a secretary<br/>Table 4.16       Responses of the respondents on whether computer has reduced the boredom of a secretary by making their routine task easy.<br/>Table 4.17       Responses of the respondents on whether the introduction of computer has come to replace the work of secretaries.<br/>Table 4.18       Responses of the respondents on how were the job opportunities of the secretaries.<br/>Table 4.19       Responses of the respondents on has the introduction of computer in your office<br/>Table 4.20       Responses of the respondents on if yes, what are the challenges <br/>TABLE OF CONTENET<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              Background of the study<br/>1.2              Statement of the problem<br/>1.3              Purpose of the study<br/>1.4              Research question<br/>1.5              Hypothesis<br/>1.6              Scope of the study<br/>1.7              Significance of the study<br/>CHAPTER TOW<br/>REVIEW OF LITERATURE<br/>2.1              The meaning and development of computer<br/>2.2              Importance o computer and computer literacy <br/>2.3              The effects of computer literacy on modern secretaries<br/>2.4              The problems of secretaries encounter in the use of computer<br/>2.5              Summary of the literature reviewed.<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1              Research design<br/>3.2              Area of the study<br/>3.3              Population of the study<br/>3.4              Sample and sampling procedure<br/>3.5              Instrument for data collection<br/>3.6              Validation of the research instrument.<br/>3.7              Reliability of the research instrument<br/>3.8              Methods of data collection<br/>3.9              Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>DATA PRESENTATION AND RESULTS<br/> CHAPTER FIVE<br/>DISCUSSION OF RESULTS, IMPLICATION AND RECOMMENDATION.<br/>5.1              Discussion of results<br/>5.2              Conclusion<br/>5.3              Implication of the research results<br/>5.4              Recommendations<br/>5.5              Suggestions for further research<br/>5.6              Limitation of the study<br/>References<br/>Appendixes <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            In the past, centuries, secretaries keep important documents or mails in their files or drawers. These files will be kept in the file cabinet as the storage facility and this process will be in progress for years. Although these facts are kept at a stage some of these documents may get too old and tore, it can get lost or the cabinet may not contain it any longer thereby leading to its relocation. Also another worker in the organization may take away an important document without the secretary’s knowledge<br/>            Further, stones and sticks were initially used as counting tools or machine before the industrial revolution. Charles Babbage who invented the first calculating machine fore see the ineffectiveness of using the Abacus method of calculation. Computer came into existence with the help of the Harvard University coupled with the idea of Babbage with the experience gained from the use of punched cared machine. The first electric computer was build in 1944 and it was called the Electronic Numerical Integrator and calculator (ENIC)<br/>            Over the years, (during the 19th and 20th century) business officers have been under going the process of computerization in terms of installing computers and other modern equipment in pace of old And absolute ones. This computerization process started in Europe after the industrial revolution and has since gone round the world including Nigeria and Enugu.<br/>            Moreover, the duties of modern secretaries in offices and the use of computer revolves round the secret for the achievement of organizational goals because a modern office that does not have this computer may not achieve their goals effectively. A modern secretary is a person who possesses a mastery of office skills who demonstrate the ability to assume responsibilities without supervision, who exercises initiatives and judgment and who make decisions within the scope of assigned authority with the knowledge of computers.<br/>            Today most offices have been computerized and it is the secretaries that manipulates these equipments in the course of discharging their duties effectively. The question now is “To what extent does the use of computer affect the job performance of modern secretaries in terms of efficiency, quality of work done reduces mistakes in circulation and gives offices efficient cost effect analysis that would be nearly impossible with manual operations. The effects of the computer literate on the modern secretaries than becomes an issue of discussion.<br/>            Computerized technology is more powerful, more versatile and more flexible than the mechanical technology that the world has now outgrown. In the rapidly changing world where information technology and the electronic office is fast becoming a reality, secretaries cannot be pleased and rely on their basic office skills or secretarial training. Although skills and discipline will be necessary, the ability to be conversant with word processors, computer, desktop publishing equipment and computer application and future innovations will be an essential requirement. Introduction of computer technology improves the secretarial skills and experience. Office work is the area of business which has been most influenced by computer and micro processor. Secretarial work requires the use of word processor, printer and monitors to control their operations and it also help artists, scientist, engineers, accountants, etc. computers are vital to the secretaries in their management systems and storage of information.<br/>            In spite of this computer age, some secretaries are still carrying out their duties manually without the aid of computers because they are completely ignorant of the usefulness of the computer. This research therefore is carried out in order to carefully identify how computer literacy can help modern secretaries and how it will effect their duties.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Since the introduction of computer into the business world, secretaries now find it difficult to cope with the latest development in micro age. Because there are many problems associated with the use of computer. According to Terry (1970:155) stated that the problems associated with the use of computer is heavily with the cost of maintenance. The cost of repairing and maintaining computer are so high that most of them are dumped in the office making secretaries who are acquainted with them handicapped to tackle their job. Recurrent expenses in the form of cost of stationery, ink, training of staff and special pay for such staff are problems encounters in procuring computer Onasanya (1990:248). He further said that computer reduces inefficiency on the part of the secretary, problems such as delay in production due to break down of the machines arises.<br/>Also modern secretaries without computer literate find it difficult to cope or perform their duties  well in a modern office. Many modern office now no longer employ any secretary without computer literate.<br/>Again, the old system of filing or storage has been phased out since the introduction of computers in to the business world. Some modern secretaries cling to the use of manual machine due to their ignorant of the usefulness of computer because of their lack of knowledge of it. Hence her interest for this study to identify the effects of computer literacy on modern secretaries.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The aims of this study is to identify the effects of computer literacy on modern secretaries using NEPA Enugu as the focal point. <br/>Specially, the study will try to<br/>Identify the effects of computer literacy on the job performance of modern secretaries.<br/>Find out whether modern secretaries who are not computer literate can be employed in a modern office<br/>Identify whether the knowledge of computer facilitates the work of modern secretaries.<br/>Find out the importance of computer to modern secretaries.<br/>Find out whether the computer has come to replace the work of secretaries.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            To achieve the above objectives, five research questions were formulated and the research will provide answers to the following research questions.<br/>What are the effects o computers literacy on the job performance o modern secretaries<br/>Can modern secretaries who are not computer literate be employed in a modern office<br/>Does the knowledge of computer facilitates the work of secretaries.<br/>What are the importance o computer to modern secretaries<br/>Has the introduction of computer come to replace the work of secretaries.<br/>1.5       HYPOTHESIS<br/>            The following null hypothesis will be tested.<br/>Ho:      There is no significance difference between the mean responses of female and male secretaries of NEPA Enugu on the effect of computer literacy on the job performance of modern secretaries (P&lt;.05)<br/>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This research is focused on an identification of the effects of computers literacy on modern secretaries in NEPA Enugu. Also to the use of observation which were employed to assess both view of the senor secretaries and  junior secretaries and the top managers that work directly with the secretaries.<br/>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study is going to identify the effects of computer on the job performance of modern secretaries in modern office, to recommend solutions for the up-liftment of everybody in business and for the growth of Nigerian economy in particular.<br/>SECRETARIES<br/>            This study is significant in that it will help modern secretaries to know whether computer literate is important in performing their jobs. This is to minimize and where possible to eliminate computer ignorance on the side of secretaries, workers and nature itself.<br/>            It will also help to clear the argument on whether the introduction of computer will make modern secretaries jobless or not. Many secretaries now bear it at the back of their mind that the only reason of introducing computer into our business is to chase them away from their normal position in the office<br/>EMPLOYERS<br/>            On the side of employers, the notable significance is to inform the employers on the category of secretaries to organizations will equally enjoy this research since it will help them to know, choose or employ qualified secretaries in their organizations.<br/>            The secretaries are said to be the life wire of any organization or business. When the secretaries and their employers are happy, the business itself will be invariably happy. The position of secretaries in office affair is a function of the world position in office line. Therefore, the world as a whole is a beneficiary from the study<br/>            Finally, this study is immensely significant, primarily with the respect to the fact that it constitutes a major requirement to the conferment of the Higher National Diploma in secretarial studies on the writer. The study will be beneficial to those who need the information for literature enrichment of the subject such as director, managers, secretaries and those interested in secretarial information. <br/>\n\nAN IDENTIFICATION OF THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTER LITERACY ON MODERN SECRETARIES IN NEPA ENUGU<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTER LITERACY ON MODERN SECRETARIES IN NEPA ENUGU", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE INFLUENCE OF COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SECRETARY. <br/>A CASE STUDY OF NBL/AMA GREENFILED 9TH MILE CORNER ENUGU<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This research work was carried out to examine the influence of communication equipment on the efficiency of the secretary with particular reference to Nigerian Breweries Public limited company NBL/Ama Green Field 9th mile corner Enugu.<br/>            The theoretical frame work for this study was based on the use of related literature.

Communication particularly in business organizations provides a means by which power is required, exercised, shaped and sustained.<br/>            Generally, communication is an act shaped by all living things. It originated from the Latin word “communies” meaning to share. Communication is the act of imparting a share of something.<br/>            To emphasized on the importance of communication, Cicero (1970) said thus “If a wise man were granted a life of abundance of materials things, so that he has leisure to contemplate everything worth knowing, yet if he could not communicate with other human if he could not communicate with other human beings he could abandon life”<br/>            By John fists (1982) “Communication is talking to one another, it is television, it is spreading information by whatever means. It is our life style, it is literary criticism, the list is endless.<br/>            Two schools of though exist on communication. The process school and the sem school. Both schools agreed on the fact that for communication to be effective, there must be a sender, a receiver, a channel and the subject matter which is being communicated on. There could also be noise which is anything that is being added to the communication signals between its transmission and reception that is not intended by sources.<br/>            Communication in a business organization encompasses more than mere oral transmission. It involves all the sensory, oral and written activities that form part of our organizational life. The actualization of communication is the equipment. This is because when instruction are communicated through the equipment,. The people working know their responsibilities and the secretary dispensers her duties appropriately. Thus, the organizational goal would be enhanced.<br/>1.2       WHO IS A SECRETARY<br/>            The word secretary us coined from the Latin word “Secretus” which literally means “a secret”. Perhaps it is the fact that aspect if the work of a secretary involve keeping secrets that the secretaries are often regarded as a keeper of secrets.<br/>            The National Secretaries Association (United stated of America) defined a secretary as “an assistant to an executive, possessing mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who displays initiatives, exercises judgment and takes decision within the scope of her authority. There is therefore no doubting that fact that the secretary is the wheel on which the executive activities revolve. The secretary is often refereed to as the executive alter ego.<br/>1.3       ROLES OF A SECRETARY<br/>            The role of the secretary plays in an office is wide and varied depending on the size and type of organization in which she is working. Technological innovation in the office has increasingly made the work of the secretary more complex and sophisticated though a lot easier.<br/>            However, there are some of the routine duties a secretary is expected to perform.<br/>ARRANGING FOR MEETING<br/>            It is the duty of the secretary to arrange for meetings, take accurate minutes of the meeting and type them out neatly.<br/>DECISION MAKING AND PROBLEMS SOLVING<br/>            H.A. Dauda (1993) The secretary should assist the executive in his decision making and problem solving role. She does this by filtering calls and callers which enables the manager to concentrate fully. She also furnishes her boss with adequate information from files and elsewhere. The secretary should seek as the ears of her boss when he is away and inform him accordingly when he is back.<br/>COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION<br/>            The secretary joins the manager in his communication processing and dissemination of information. Modern communication and information technology can enable people communicate locally and internationally at the shortest possible time. Local area networks, teleconferences and caller phones are good facilitators of both near and far distant communications. The secretary in particular plays a great role in dissemination of information. He must give adequate and timely information. <br/>INTERPERSONAL SKILLS.<br/>            Every organization is made up of different kinds of people/business associates, clients, peers and staffs of the organization. It believes on the secretary to develop a good public relations skill by which she grapes quickly the mood of views of all these people and adjust his own responses accordingly such skills include: being a good listener, making people feel at ease and being able to interpret the body movement and signals people display.<br/>ORGANIZING THE WORKLAOD<br/>            It is the duty of the secretary to organize the method to run the daily workload of the organization. He doubles as the manager’s receptionist, prioritizes the procedure for handling the office mail, operates the various memory aids for checking work progress or those awaiting responses, looking appointments and blocking undesirable visitors and finally maintaining the manager’s diary. <br/>MASTERY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT<br/>            Mastery of  the communications equipment and the office equipment for use in doing the job is vital. Also she should be able to know the objectives of the firm whether it is profit-oriented, service oriented, operates an expansionist policy or large-scale economics. <br/>1.4       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            Our nuclear age is witnessing an everyday reduction in the number of staff required to perform units of a particular operation due to the development and injection of various communication equipment.<br/>            Based on this development it becomes logical to ask if the communication equipment are bringing about changes in the communication role of the secretary.<br/>            The problem now to be death with is “Can communication equipment enhance or undermine the efficiency of the secretary”<br/>1.5       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of the study us to<br/>a.       Look into the roles a secretary has to play in the m=world of modern communication<br/>b.      Identify some of the oral and written communication equipment<br/>c.       Determine the effect of communication equipment on the secretary’s efficiency<br/>d.      Identify the merits and demerits of the communication equipment and their influence on the secretary.<br/>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This work aims at establishing the roles of a secretary in the world if modern communication. It equally aims at clearing the mind of those who think that secretaries are never-do-well and to make it clear that there is a difference between copy typists and trained secretaries.<br/>            Also of importance in this study is the knowledge of the communication equipment to secretaries. Students studying secretarial and business administration respectively are not left out.<br/>            The research will also try to allay the fear in some practicing secretaries and students secretaries that advancement of communication technology will have counter-productive effect on the role of a secretary<br/>1.8       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The scope of this study is very wide if it has to be carried out in all organizations. Therefore, this research study will be confined to secretaries of (Nigeria Breweries Public Limited Company/Ama Greenfield, 9th mile corner Enugu) NBL. The company has enough of communication equipment and secretaries that operate them.<br/>            Moreover the research is centered on this technological age where the innovations seem to take the position of human communication and that id a secretary in an organization. Thus, this research could be described as a modern and computer age study.<br/>1.10     RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            The questions are intended to point more on the topic and accordingly supply answers to them<br/>1.      What are the roles that a secretary plays in the world of modern communication<br/>2.      What are the communication equipment (oral and written) to be found in a secretary’s office.<br/>3.      Are the communication equipment bringing about effect on the efficiency of the secretary.<br/>4.      Can a secretary cope with such effect/changes brought about by the communication equipment<br/>5.      Are the communication equipment of any advantages or positive influence on the secretary.<br/>6.      DO demerits of communication equipment have influence on the secretary.<br/>1.11     DEFINITION OF TERMS.<br/>EXECUTIVES ALTER EGO: This means an assistant to the executive who possesses a mastery of office skills, demonstrate the ability to assume responsibilities with or without direct supervision.<br/>TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: These are the modern sophisticated devices that gave communication very wonderful boost.<br/>LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN): Is the linking of devices together for sharing information with the aid of terminals.<br/>NEVER-DO-WELL: This means unimportant and worthless. Thus, the secretary is not never-do-well but indispensable in every organization.<br/>MEMORY AIDS: These are those things/documents which a secretary uses to record appointments viz: diary. Appointment cards, induced memory aid, telephone pad, private notebook, reminder schedule, calendar, mnemonic devices and pocket computer.<br/>NUCLEAR AGE: This is the scientific era when weapons and innovation are in vogue <br/><br/>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SECRETARY.

These they are likely to meet after graduation.<br/>            The scheme affords students the opportunity of seeing familiarized and exposed to the needed experience in handling of machinery and equipment which are usually not available in the educational institutions.<br/>            Furthermore, the scheme exposes the students to work methods and prepare them in safeguarding the work area and other workers in the industry.<br/>            SIWES was introduced by the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) in Nigeria in (1973) about 31 years ago. It was then limited to students of technology. Today it has covered many disciplines and has  become a necessary recognition for the award of national diploma (ND) and Higher National Diploma (HND) in polytechnics in the country.<br/>            A center focus of the scheme is to enlist and strengthen  employers involvement in the educational process of preparing students for the worlds of work. The scheme is therefore aimed at promoting the much-desired technological know-how ultimate goal of the scheme force needed to build a self-reliance economy.<br/>            The following are SIWES relevance to secretarial studies.<br/>            It provides opportunity for the researcher and co-students to gain experiences as a supplement to their students by this, the researcher’s writing in this project will be supervised by the supervisor who helps to direct on how to carry out any given task.<br/>            It affords students the opportunity of being familiarized and exposed to the needed experience in secretarial studies.<br/>            It exposes the researcher/students to real life situation thus supplementing the theoretical lessons in the classroom.<br/>            It helps students to be acquainted to what nature of job they are likely to meet at the labor market.<br/>            It broader the knowledge and understanding of the students in terms of each person to know more<br/>            It is to prepare the researcher the participating students for better future use of their hand s and brain.<br/>            It helps students to gather more information for difficult issues.<br/>            It is one of the most task to take before graduating as a national diploma holder before enrolling for higher national diploma<br/>            As a problems facing the department and a solution to it is to relate it to the people in charge for better result in due time for the life wire of secretarial; studies.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>            It has been observed that some students have some misconception about the work experience programme of the I.T.F. some students for example, equate the programmer with holidays job. Hence the commitment is lacking and so the skills and experience to be gained cannot be acquired from the scheme.<br/>            Again there is relevance among large number of employers to accept and provide facilities necessary for meaningful industrial experience to students. The fears of many employers are that students are inexperienced to handle certain delicate machines and tools without damaging them. A situation in which students are not allowed to use certain equipment does not provide the desired experience needed to prepare them for the world of work.<br/>            Also some students are not supervised during the attachments or training period at all. This is attributable to lack of adequate transportation facilities and or lack of seriousness on the part of their supervisors.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>            The need of this study which was carried out and conducted in the department of secretarial studies. Institute of management and technology in 2004/2005 is to determine that it is of relevance to students to participate fully during their industrial work experience scheme. The researcher also wants to have an empirical base not to support all the sources about the poor impression students have on the industrial work experience scheme. Students must learn to think about themselves not as just a student, but as a product of oneself and doing the things which will make people to want deal with them. Do students of secretarial studies really know their works, and are they wooing secretarial studies as mere woo girks they fancy or love<br/>            If my findings are not valid, I would say there are no bases for the SIWES, but that it arise because students ought to do well in their discipline.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            From the need for study it was assumed that the scheme is completely different from ordinary long vocation employment of the undergraduate. It is a continuation of the students studies.<br/>            SIWES as a t the time of its inception was limited to students of Engineering and Technology only. But today it covers many disciplines because of its relevance to technological and economic development. The scheme has succeeded in establishing a closer collaboration between institutions and industries which is essential for preparing young people skillfully for the world of work.<br/>            It helps to prepare students to fit in, readily to employment industries and commerce.

The research will also try to make the industrial training fund realize the existence of the department of secretarial studies and to include them in the eligible course for which SIWES and industrial training fund were compulsorily and centrally funded.

ONE<br/>1.0              INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The country if not the whole universe is on the brink of immense technology, and this phenomenon has get in far reaching effect on almost all spheres of human endeavour.<br/>Different people have perceptions of what impact the modern technology via the Internet is playing to address the issues of performance of the secretarial profession in the new millennium.<br/>To be precise, many scholars have dealt on this topic but the researchers of the project work have tried to portray actually what the impact of the internet is regarding the performance of secretarial profession.<br/>The internet according to Cerf, [1996] president of the internet society ‘is a specific collaboration of independently managed networks that allow users at disparate heterogeneous computer networks to communicate with each other across organizational and geographical boundaries.  Its main function in any social system may be identified as information, education, entertainers, discussion, communication and integration.  Therefore, the Internet as an information superhighway has been aroused to perform all these immeasurable impact for the rest of the world.<br/>One cannot talk about information and access without making regular reference to the information technologies and their convergence particularly the INTERNET.<br/>Information and communication technology are rapidly changing the way we work and live, most especially regarding the way the office is handled.  We see a world of network.  That is bringing new opportunities and options to people at work, at home and on the move directly stating how our society live, work, learn, play and how our society evolves.<br/>In the secretarial profession, information and communication are the very essence of the content and that is what the internet is all about.<br/>Information derives its value from the meaning that an entity [a human being] assigns to data.  It therefore becomes a performed in an organization.<br/>The question now is, how far can this form of inexhaustible resource carry the users with special internet on the secretarial profession. <br/>The machines used in the secretarial profession are involved effectively to perform the work in business media, the mass media, the information gathering media, and the likes, have seen the different faces of typewriters, mail exchange, computers, cellular, fax, telephone and other technological information gathering system<br/>Stressing more on the meaning of the internet and how it works Rutherford F. July 22 1997, described the internet as ‘a global collection of many different types of computers and computer networks that are linked together.<br/>The secretarial profession, people who are conversant with the services that the personal computer renders will no doubt find the internet fascinating job-made-easy and enjoyable.<br/>But many people cannot purchase or acquire this precious information superhighway, what risks are involved.  Who are supposed to use this inexhaustible resource?<br/>The aim of the study is to know the impact of internet more on information and communication in secretarial profession.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>People say or believe that the internet has no impact on secretarial profession.  That secretaries do not need the internet at all.  They also say that secretaries only need the typewriter to carry out their duties.  They also say that if secretaries include the use of the internet in their profession, that work will be tedious.<br/>According to Sir Walter Ford, the duty of the secretary is to take down records, minutes of the meetings and typing of orders by the above authorities and it involves the use of the typewriter.<br/>Vin Pluto [1990] says thus, ‘the internet is used by high senior officials and those trained personnel and as such the secretaries do not fit into this cadre’.<br/>Peter Roberts in his opinion says, ‘the internet and the secretary are not compatible’.<br/>So for this very reasons, we have decided to carry out this research work so as to find out the actual impact the internet has on the secretarial profession.<br/>1.3              THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>In view of the above problem, this research work is therefore designed to the following;<br/>1.                  To find out the impact of internet on the secretarial profession.<br/>2.                  To ascertain, the impact of the internet, on the lives of individual secretaries.<br/>3.                  To ascertain, if the use of internet facilities, is a monotonous task to the secretary.<br/>4.                  To ascertain if there are problems being caused by the internet in the secretarial profession.<br/>5.                  To give remedies and solutions to such problems if any.<br/>1.4              SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The geographical area covered by the researchers  in Enugu metropolis selected Government parastatals in Enugu State are used as samples on which judging the impact of the internet to the secretarial profession will be based.<br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.                  What are the effects of Internet on the secretarial profession?<br/>2.                  What impact does the internet have on a secretary<br/>3.                  Does the frequent task of operating a computer everyday bore a secretary?<br/>1.6              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>It is important that secretaries should at times take critical look outside their private areas of concentration and state the latest system of improving their techniques at their field of specialization.<br/>The study is not only important to the secretary but will also serve as a green light to the entertainment world, education, communication and media practitioners on how to restructure their programmes to suit their receiving audience.<br/>It will moreover help the secretary to be abreast with the events taking place within and outside the country.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET ON SECRETARIAL STUDIES IN SELECTED BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS IN ENUGU METROPOLIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET ON SECRETARIAL STUDIES IN SELECTED BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS IN ENUGU METROPOLIS", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLES OF DATA PRESERVATION IN ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF SECRETRIAL FUNCTION IN SELECTED BANKS IN  ENUGU METROPOLIS<br/>ABSTRCAT</b><br/>            This research work was undertaken to find out the roles of data preservation in enhancing the efficiency of secretarial function in selected banks in Enugu Metropolis. <br/>            In doing this, the researcher evaluated the various methods of data preservation their advantages and disadvantages and the functions of a secretary in an organization. The researcher collected data from primary and secondary source. Through the primary source of data questionnaire was used to elicit appropriate information from the respondents (secretaries) in selected banks in Enugu metropolis. Secondary source of data collection in the form of textbooks, lecture notes, handbooks and journals were used to explain the topic.<br/>            The data was analyzed using simple percentages and tables and statements. Findings from the study revealed that majority of the respondents use computerized method of data preservation while minority uses electromechanical  and manual method. It was equally revealed that users of manual method face varying problems such as time wastage and  monotony while computer users face problems such as retraining and complexity. In view of this, it was concluded that computerized method is the most effective method of data preservation. And the method was recommend to be used in banks so as to enhance the efficiency of secretarial function.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHPATER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              Background of the study<br/>1.2              Statement of the problems<br/>1.3              Purpose of the study<br/>1.4              Scope of the study<br/>1.5              Research questions<br/>1.6              Significance of the study.<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1              Definition and meaning of data<br/>2.2              Definition and meaning of data processing<br/>2.3              Definition and meaning of data preservation<br/>2.4              Data preservation method<br/>2.4.1        Manual method<br/>2.4.2        Electromechanical method<br/>2.4.3        Computerized method<br/>2.4.4        Who is secretary<br/>2.4.5        Various secretarial functions in an organization.<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1              Research design<br/>3.2              Area of study<br/>3.3              Population of the study<br/>3.4              Sampling and sampling procedure<br/>3.5              Instrument for data collection<br/>3.6              Validation of research instrument<br/>3.7              Reliability of research instrument<br/>3.8              Method of administration of research instrument<br/>3.9              Method of data analysis.<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>DATA PRESENTATION AND RESULTS<br/>4.1              Summary result/findings.<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>DISCUSSION, IMPLICATION, RECOMMENDATION.<br/>5.1              Discussion of results<br/>5.2              Conclusions<br/>5.3              Implications of results<br/>5.4              Recommendations<br/>5.5              Suggestions for further research<br/>5.6              Limitations of the study.<br/>References<br/>Appendices   <br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/>Table I             Response on question no.

In the earlier times, men were capable of storing information in their brains and passing them on form one person to another by mouths. But the more authentic one were data inscribed on stone tablets, on paper scrolls and eve on walls so that generation later can still make reference to them if properly preserved. However, there were limitations on how for one could rely on these methods of preserving data. As time progressed, man continued in searching for as satisfactory data processing/preservation machine. It was due to the numerous problems encountered by man when dealing with large numbers that gave birth to the invention of various mechanisms for preserving data.<br/>            Although man used pebbles, grains of corn, figures and toes as well as other smaller objects. The problems on how to handle pebble conveniently was solved in the Tigress-Euphrates valley about  (5000 years ago by designing a clay board with grooves into which the pebble could be placed. The device enable the grooves to be moved from outside on the instruction to the other to facilitates counting. The technique which was the forerunner of the abacus was adopted and modified by the Chinese and Japanese <br/>            The Abacus comprises of several rows of beads which slide in sticks or wires mounted in a rectangular frame. The frame of the abacus is divided by a cross number so that each row of the bead has a sector with four or five beads and another sector with one bead (two on some abacuses.)<br/>            The abacus, however could not solve man’s arithmetic problems efficiently and effectively so, man’s search for a better and improved method continued.<br/>            By the seventeenth century Jon Nappier a Scottish theologian and mathematician developed a calculating aid know as Nappiers bone. It consisted of a set of roles each of which had a multiplication table marked on it. He later developed logarithms – a tabular system of numbers which simplified arithmetic operations with logarithms, multiplications, divisions, additions, etc were modified and simplified. <br/>            In 1642, Blaise Pascal developed a digital counter with teeth numbering 0 – 9. he invented this  device to assist in adding long columns of figures in his fathers tax office in frame. The machine consisted of a row of wheels with teeth. The first wheel denoted units, the second tens etc. when the first wheel was turned six spaces six was shown in windows at the top of the machine. If the wheel was turned tow more spaces the result was eight, the addition of another seven caused that indicator to proceed through 0 to 6. in this instance, a lever on the units dial must have moved the tens dial one tenth (1/10) of a revolution so that the machine has carried one indicating a total of 16 Pascals machine was only capable of performing addition and subtraction but based on his effort other mechanical machines were developed.<br/>            In 1671, a German Philosopher and mathematician, Gothfried leibniz conceived a calculating machine but the machine was completed in 1674 this was known as Libniz machine and was useful in arithmetic procedures.<br/>            The search for satisfactory data processing and preserving machine continued until in 1909 when Charles Kettering developed for the national cash register company the first accounting machine called the teller. The teller machine was used for certifying passbooks using a tabulating carriage, the machine could sort data into a number of columns in addition to performing the functions of recording, calculating and summarizing.<br/>            All these machines discussed above although efficient had limitations. They were manual rather than  automatic. They laid the foundation on which the modern electronic computers were built.<br/>            In 1802 a French man named Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a weaving loom called Jacquard’s automatic loom. This textile loom was responsible for making famous the wearing trade. The punch card with punch holes supplied instructions which controlled trade selection and directed pattern designs <br/>            In 1917 Charles Babbage an English mathematician designed the first machine that used the punch card in solving mathematical problems. This innovation can equally be used as a memory or storage unit that can store data in the form of holes punched in cards.<br/>            However, the effectiveness of this machine was limited by slowness and mechanical difficulties. These restrictions were overcome by the next development in data a preservation history – the invention of electronic computer.<br/>            In 1954, the first type of computer called UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) was directed to a business enterprise. They were designed to handle vast quantities of data typical of business speed, output and preservation. Over the years, files and cabinets have been used to preserve data too.<br/>            The development of banking services in Nigeria  also passed several stages. In these stages of development manual method of data preservation was used. In manual data preservation human efforts is combined with simple office tools to perform the operation.<br/>            However, today the major banks in operations in Enugu are the First Bank of Nigeria plc, Union Bank for Africa Plc, the Africa continental Bank plc, the international Bank for Wes Africa (IBWA) Plc presently in these banks, data is being preserved in the Hard Disc or Floppy Disc which is used by the computers as well as manually.<br/>            It is on record that there are many methods of preserving data in banks. This study is directed towards identifying the various methods of preserving data, the roles and efficiency of these methods.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>            Public opinion in most offices is that some secretaries especially new ones are lax in their duties, since they are unable to produce stored data promptly when needed. This might be as a result of the method of data preservation being adopted. It is equally common to see a secretary looking for preserved data, which may have been removed by an unauthorized person. Because of the role played by secretaries in retrieving preserved data, many officers complain that secretaries are mere source of information others complain that most secretaries are relaxed and lazy because of the ease with which they produce preserved data with modern devices or equipment.<br/>            It is equally feared that because of the case with which secretaries retrieve preserved data with modern equipment, this might kill the initiative of the secretaries and make their job less challenging. What then is the true position? Can good data preservation system have any effect on the job performance of the secretary? The need to provide answer to the above question necessitated this study, that is to find out the roles of data preservation in enhancing the efficiency of secretarial functions in banks.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of this research work is to:<br/>Identify the various methods for preserving data in banks in Enugu metropolis <br/>The constraints faced by secretaries in using these methods<br/>The roles of these methods in enhancing the efficiency of secretarial functions.<br/>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study is focused on the roles of data preservation in enhancing the efficiency of secretarial function in selected banks in Enugu ,metropolis. The selected Banks are Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Africa Continental Bank Plc, First Bank of Nigeria plc, and United bank for Africa. The study involves all cadre of secretaries in the selected banks.<br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            Answers will be provided to the following questions.<br/>What are the methods used to preserve data in banks toady.<br/>What are the roles of these methods and how do these methods enhance secretarial functions<br/>What are the problems emanating from these methods?<br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The importance of this study is that it will help the secretaries to be aware of the best method of preserving data, the banks as well as other organizations will benefits from the research because secretaries need guidelines on how to preserve data efficiency and effectively, this will in turn improve or contribute to the achievement of their goals and objectives. The students will also help them ground themselves with the required competency for the operation of those machines use for preserving data as they move into the labor market.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE ROLES OF DATA PRESERVATION IN ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF SECRETRIAL FUNCTION IN SELECTED BANKS IN  ENUGU METROPOLIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLES OF DATA PRESERVATION IN ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF SECRETRIAL FUNCTION IN SELECTED BANKS IN  ENUGU METROPOLIS", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EMPLOYER’S PERCEPTION OF THE HND SECRETARIAL GRADUATES IN SELECTED COMPANIES IN ENUGU URBAN<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            Employers perception of the HND Secretarial graduates in the selected companies as titled this research work has through the introduction expressed the statement of problems eg, why are HND Secretarial graduates left to be roaming about the street.  Why are HND holders always been left employed? Why are they always placed at the subordinate position etc and purposely find out how employers of labour perceive the HND secretarial graduates : to find out the effects of these treatment by employers of labour on HND Secretarial Graduates and other employers unfriendly attributes towards these graduates.<br/>            Using the questionnaire methodology of data collection at a total of 110 questionnires administered and collected and using analystical tools such as tables and percentages.  The findings indicate that HND secretarial graduates are perceived in different ways by employers like, saying that they are intrained graduates, executive assistant shorthand typists etc.  also employers were of the opinion that HND Secretarial graduates should possess personal qualities.  Employers use interview and selection tests as the tools for selection of secre and also have unfriendly attitudes towards their secretaries like nicknaming and abusing them.  Based on the above, the study recommends that employers should stop abusing their secretaries in order to raise their morale in their work places, emphasis should not be placed on the possession of shorthand and typewriting fot eh selection of secretaries, etc.<br/>            In conclusion, the attitude of employers of labour towards the HND Secretarial graduates goes to show that employers neglect the profession not knowing what it takes to train a HND Secretarial graduate, hence the issue of roaming about the street unemployed can be anested if the recommendations are implemented.<br/>TABLE OF

sixteen<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>            Before the study of psychology perception has been in existence.  We study perception to be able to explain our observation of the world around us.  We cannot understand the human perception of the world unless we also understand something about the world as a set of physical structure.  No amount of physical energies nor physiological structure can teach us perception.  The study of perception is primarily psychological.  The main aim of psychology was to explain all the possible thought of ideas we have by their origin in the past and present sensory experience.<br/>            Perception begins with recognition and this process of recognition is a large part of perception.  Technically, a percept is a set of sensations plus the images that the sensory inputs evokes.<br/>            It is very important in the study of organizational behavour, the managers perception of his workers, determines the type of motivation and method of communication that will exist in the organization.<br/>            Primarily, perception is a visual process which indeed we say that we “see” something, what we actually mean is that we perceive or understand it.  As a result of this, employers’ perception of the HND secretarial graduates is indeed the way they see or understand them.<br/>            Selection of HND secretarial graduate is vested in the hand of employers / executives in most organizations.  The HND secretarial graduates are always subjected to testing, interviewing and other forms of evaluation for purposes of employment or promotion.  Sometimes, those who evaluate them have never been secretaries and do not have adequate knowledge of the dept and breadth of secretarial training.  These employers use wrong tools in measuring the effectiveness and capabilities of then secretaries and do not know the valid test which will act as an accurate predictor of an effective performance.<br/>            Most employers look at HND secretarial graduates as skilled shorthand typist and therefore, design the criteria for their evaluation from that point of view.  For example research studies show that in majority of cases of recruitment, speeds in shorthand and typewriting are the only criteria.  To them a HND Secretarial graduate does not perform any other function other than taking down dictations in shorthand and transcribing them on the typewriter.  The employers are consistent in the use of these criteria even when it is obvious that the secretary in guestion is not going to be involved in shorthand or much typing.  Even when the needs for typing and writing shorthand are important, these two skills are not enough to determine the employability of a HND Secretarial graduate.  A Higher National Diploma secretarial graduate does a lot of other office functions than taking dictations and transcribing on the typewriter.<br/>            The HND secretarial graduates help the employers by performing her duties most efficiently carry out some of his duties such as planning, execution treating office matters, receiving every manner of visitors etc.  they are able to work independent of their boss so as to build their mage.  They carry out functions which are not derided to her either by reference or inference but which are needed to be done.<br/>            The HDN Secretarial graduates are people that type office<br/> Correspondence, file confidential and general documents attends to meetings, take down minutes and type them out, make appointments for their bosses and remind them of the appointments.  Consequently, they are the executives who manage the most important information.  They are the expansion of the employers time because their roles get them to do more than they accomplish in a day.<br/>            HND secretarial graduates in the companies made works easy, they are very important such that, it employers are to continue to succeed, they must see the HND secretarial graduates as they see those in other professions, so that HND secretarial graduates will stop roming about the street.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Employers are the people that give work or use the services of other people.  The way the reward, understand and treat HND secretarial graduates is not given joy to them.  The government functionaries, businessmen, employers and the general public are all very critical of HND Secretarial graduates.  (personal interview).  The bad attitude ranges from wrong evaluation of performance by employers, not short listing the HND holders for job and subordinating HND Holders to unfriendly attitude of employers in selection for employment.  Is it that the HND Secretarial graduates are not holding the same certificate with others like accountancy, marketing etc.  why are they left to be roming about the street? Even in the recent recruitment done by the state civil service commission, the HND Holders were not short listed let alone calling them for interview.  Why are they always been left unemployed?<br/>Naturally, the spirit of the polytechnic undergraduates are hurt and it downed on them that their struggles and suffering would be in vain.  Most employers do not put their HND Secretarial graduates in a prime position as they are supposed to be.  Why are they always placed at the subordinate position? How do these employers of labour see graduates of secretarial studies? Hence, the need for this study, to find out how employers of labour perceive this category of graduates.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>The purpose of the study<br/>1.                  To find out how employers of labour perceive the HND secretarial graduates.<br/>2.                  to find out the effects of these treatment by employers of labour on HND secretarial graduates<br/>3.                  to identify other employers unfriendly attitude towards graduates of secretarial studies.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The significance of this study is to serve as a counseling guide and to correct the wrong impression and misconception employers have about the HND Secretarial graduates.<br/>            It is also to encourage those in the profession that not matter what people say about the profession, they should not feel discouraged.<br/>            This study will also serve as a literature review to other researchers that may wish to write on this topic or something related to it.<br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.                  How do employers of labour perceive that HND secretarial

STUDY<br/>            Hornby 1984, stated that the word “secretary” is derived from a latin word “secretaries” meaning something known only to one or few and kept secret or hidden from the views of things.<br/>            Amaefula 1986 stated that a secretary is the office worker who combine the major skills of shorthand and typewriting with other competence of filling, reprography and telephone technique in the performance of her duties.<br/>            Hanna, pophan and tilton 1974 a secretary is an executive assistant who possesses a mastery of office skills without direct supervision, exercise initiative and judgement and makes decision within the scope of assigned authority.  He also stated that considering the position of the secretary in business organizations every effort should be made to tackle the problems facing her to ensure increased productivity.<br/>            A secretary may be regarded as an employee in an office who deals with correspondence, keeps records, makes arrangement and appointment for a particular member of staff or the boss.  Seguel to the definition above one can see that the profession is a noble one and that the secretary plays a toemendous role in an organization.  The issue of in efficient performance of secretaries has in recent years been a matter o fgreat concern to modern business organizations.<br/>            Riggs 1981 stated, it productivity is the quality that indicates how well labour, capital, material and energy are utilized it is the output resulting from a given resources – input at a given time. It is the concept that guides the management of a production system and then measure its success.  Mcbeth 91974) added that it is the measure of production efficiency, a ratio between input and output, input is frequently limited to input of labour.<br/>            Low productivity when applied to secretarial in selected modern business organizations measure in the degree of quantitative and qualitative inadequacies in the output of workers.  It can be been as inadequate production.  According to Riggs (1981), low productivity is the way by which productivity can fall short of the high standards that are less than perfect in the working situation are not identified, the result is low productivity.<br/>            In view of the above facts, one may quinines ask, why is the secretary characterized by low productivity? Agbese (1987) pointed out that the low productivity rate compled with sub-standard quality of secretaries job is a constant source of anxiety to government and their bodies which utilize them.  He emphasized more that need therefore, for high productivity level in any organizational set up whether private or public cannot be over emphasized since high productive potential in both the organizational man power utilization and output levels help to cpe with exigieuces according to him, the center of any organization is the office which is managed by the secretary who plans, budget, organizes, controls, supervises bodinates to achieve efficiency.<br/>            A well motivated, trained and remunerated secretary is capable of achieving her productivity through experince acquired on the knowledge of technological advancement (Edum &amp; Ajetunbok 86).<br/>            This research is therefore intended to find out the problems responsible for low productivity of secretaries in selected modern business organizations, and suggest ways of improving secretaries productivity.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Secretaries in modern business organizations especially the qualified ones do their jobs with the aim of producing a good work with adequate speed and accuracy. But some secretaries failed to avail themselves of the opportunities given to them.  This has created a gap between most executives and their secretaries.  <br/>Most of the secretaries complain that frige benefits, inadequate modern machines, environmental factor, lack of training and Door relationship with others affect the productivity of secretary.  <br/>The inability of employers in modern business organizations to remunerate and motivate their secretaries accurately in line with exportations of the present changing work environments in another pain or problem.  This has led to low morale, poor standard of living, lateness and absenteeism on the part of the secretary.    <br/>1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>            the following are the objective of this study:<br/>1.                  To determine the problems affecting secretaries productivity in some secreted business organizations.<br/>2.                  To examine the types of equipment use by secretaries<br/>3.                  to identity whether or not secretaries have the required skills<br/>4.                  to determine the specific duties of secretaries<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY<br/>            The study will benefit the secretaries in modern business organization in Enugu metropolis, managers, lecturers and students as it will take care of the factors problems that lead to low productivity.<br/>It will also widen and increase the knowledge of the researcher and act as a source of reference material to those intending members of secretarial studies.<br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>This study will answered the following research questions:<br/>1.                  What are the problems affecting secretaries productivity in moder business organization?<br/>2.                  Do the secretaries have the required skills to perform their functions?<br/>3.                  What are the functions of secretary in business

INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>In order to carry out a meaningful research into the job prospects of secretaries, it may be necessary to attempt a definition of a secretary and the functions he/she is expected to perform.  A secretary is someone who assists a top executive in the office by performing his/her secretarial duties, skillfully and who possesses the ability to relieve the executive of certain administrative tasks.<br/>Also, Marshal (1973:2) defined secretary as an Assistant to the executive secretary as an assistant to the executive possessing mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision who displays initiative, exercises judgment and makes decision within the scope of her authority.<br/>In the business organization, the secretary is a great asset to her boss, she is his personal organizer.  She uses different typewriters, computers which are her tools in the office.  She takes shorthand dictations and transcribes them to produce mailable letters.  The secretary is generally the life-wire of any organization.<br/>The secretary also performs the duties of using different filing systems to file documents,, arrangement and preparation of Board/Management meetings and prepare notices and Agenda of meetings.  She also takes speeches in shorthand at conference, seminars and low courts. She also books appointments for the boss and takes care of his itinerary.  The duties of the secretary is so enormous and vast that listing them will be inexhaustible.<br/>These are various categories of secretaries in Business organization before the civil service reform of 1988 namely:<br/>1.                  Confidential Secretary IV<br/>2.                  Confidential Secretary III<br/>3.                  Confidential Secretary II<br/>4.                  Confidential Secretary I<br/>5.                  Personal Secretary<br/>(Principal Secretary Assistant Grades)<br/>6.                  Personal Secretary Grade<br/>(Principal Secretary 2)<br/>7.                  Senior Personal Secretary<br/>(Principal Secretary Assistant I)<br/>8.                  Principal Personal Secretary<br/>(Chief Secretary)<br/>9.                  Bilingual Secretary<br/>10.              Verbation/Official Reports<br/>However, the guidelines on the civil service reform of 1988 changed the titles as follows:<br/>Old Titles                                                                    New Titles<br/>1.  Principal Personal Secretary                                   Chief Secretarial Assistant<br/>2.  Senior Personal Secretary                          Principal Secretariat Assistant I<br/>3.  Personal Secretary I                                               Principal Secretarial Assistant I<br/>4.  Personal Secretary II                                              Principal Secretarial Assistant III<br/>5.  Confidential Secretary I                            Principal Secretarial Assistant IV<br/>6.  Confidential Secretary II                           Senior Secretarial Assistant<br/>7.  Confidential Secretary III                         Secretarial Assistant I<br/>8.  Confidential Secretary IV                         Secretarial Assistant II<br/> Though secretaries job titles have been harmononized, they do not reach the same position in rank with their bosses because they are subordinates to their bosses.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM:<br/>The secretary is faced with numerous problems, one of which is uncertainty of advancement in her job in terms of promotion, job training and lack of welfarism.<br/>Some business organizations exploit the secretaries by not making the jobs they schedule.<br/>In addition, she is not given the necessary incentives thus frustrated in her job.<br/>Moreover, secretaries in some business organizations are made to stagnate or “mark time” in a grade level due to lack of promotion given to them.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is expected to bring out the job prospects of secretaries in area like job remuneration, promotion, welfare and more job training in today’s business organizations.<br/>When these prospects are known they will motivate new entrants into the secretarial profession.<br/>Recommendations will be made to business organizations on how to motivate secretaries.  This will also make secretaries not to change their profession or be forced out of their jobs.<br/>Moreover, this study can also serve as a future reference in the library.  It can serve as future reference to both the student and the lecturer.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:<br/>1.                  To identify employment opportunities available to secretaries in those selected business organizations in Enugu metropolis.<br/>2.                  To identify the job prospects open to secretaries in terms of promotion, welfare, job training etc.<br/> <br/>3.                  To identify these facts responsible, where necessary militating against their job prospects.<br/>4.                  To offer suggestions for the improvement of secretarial profession.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS:<br/>1.                  Do secretaries receive their promotion when other workers are being promoted in your organization?<br/>2.                  What is the highest position a secretary can attain in your organization?<br/>3.                  What are the secretaries other employment opportunities apart from office work?<br/> <br/>\n\nA STUDY OF JOB PROSPECTS OF SECRETARIES IN SOME SELECTED BUSINESS ORGANISATION IN ENUGU STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\"

modern times.  It has roots in history and dates back to the times of the ancient civilization.  Pedicles, a reasoned leader in ancient Greece introduced a scheme for the compensation of officials, thus facilitating the continued participation in public administration  by citizens who had to work daily for their living.  The official appointed to administer the system was called chung-chung-that is impartial Judge – a for-runner of our present day Civil Service Commission.<br/>            The Nigerian Civil Service dates back to 1861 with the annexation of Lagos as a British possession and the establihment of a crown colony type of government.  Therefore, the Nigerian Civil Service is the product of evolution.  It is an inheritance from our colonial masters.  In the past, it is known for its anonymity, impartiality security of tenure and non intervention in partisan policy.  The basic aim of establishing the Civil Service was manteance of law and order and the management of an extractive economy to produce raw materials to support British Industries.  The colonial Civil Service controlled decision making process of the government during the period until 1954 when the policy of the Civil Service were limited to advising on policy matters and implementation of government decisions.<br/>According to Udenta (1999) The public Service Commission of the Eastern Region was set up in accordance with section 170 of the Nigerian constitution order in Council 1954 and held its first meeting on 29th November, 1954.  section 175 of the order as applied to a region by section 180 provides that the government may refer to this commission for their advice on any matter relating to the appointment of any person to an office in the public service or the dismissal or discipline control of officers in public service of the region.  The public service Commission Regulations, 1955 published as Easter Region Law Nigeria (ERLN)No.166 of 1955 came into operation on 21st July 1955.  with time it became necessary for the commission to further be divided and as such, on 25th February 1970, the East-Central State Public Service Commission was established in accordance with Nigerian Constitution.<br/>The Anambra State of Nigeria Law No. 4, 1980 dated 15th February, 1980 and lited as the Stated Civil Service Commission.  By this enactment, the Public Service Commission was changed to Civil Service Commission.  This was published in the supplement to Anambra State of Nigeria Gazette No. 11, volume 5, dated 24th April, 1980.  at its establishment the secretarial of the commission comprised the following units.  Personal Administration, Recruitment and Statistics.  In August 27, 1991, Enugu State was created.  As a result of this, the former Anambra State Civil Service Commission was changed to Enugu State Civil Service Commission.  Today, the commission has six units departments converged into three namely: personnel / Administration Unit, Recruitment / Statistics / Accounts and Promotion units respectively.  <br/>            According to OAU Obafemi Awolowo University Caleadar (1982/83).  The conceptual framework within which the University System has evolved in the last millennium can be summarized as follows:-<br/>            Community of scholars, seat of learning, center of liberal education, mother of the professions, agent of national or regional development, vehicle for the propagation of teaching advancement of knowledge through research and provisions of service to society?<br/>            Pursuing these missions in varying degrees of mix, Nigerian Universities have differed in no respect from other Universities the world over.  The wording of enactments of the various Nigerian Institutions of higher learning reflect, often in a copious and liberal manner, this tripartite objective of teaching, research and service.  They serve as a constant reminder that universities have an important role to play in helping the citizenry to deepen and strengthen its understanding of ideas of truth and objectivity, integrity and the obligation of service, placed upon it by its possession of learning and through their living together, in a community with than their home environments men and women are able to grasp the values and standard needed to sustain the ethos of present day society”.<br/>            In line with the above statements, part 1 of the OD.Sno.3 of 1982, section 3 outlined that the objective of the University shall be<br/>a.  to provide facilities for learning and to give instruction and training in such branches of knowledge as the university may desire to foster and in doing so as to enable students obtain the advantage of liberal education;<br/>b.   to promote by research and other means the advancement of knowledge and its practical application to social, cultural economic, scientific and technological problems.<br/>c.   To encourage the advancement of learning and to hold out to all persons without distraction of race, creed, sex or political conviction the opportunity of acquiring a higher and liberal education.<br/>d.  To act as a vehicle of national development through applied research, technical assistance direct consultation, informational services and internship programmes.<br/>e. To provide innorative educational programmes of high standards regardless of the nature of the degree being produced as long as this has importance and relevance for state and national development;<br/>f. To meet the specific manpower needs of the nation;<br/>For the carrying out of its objectives as specified in section 3 of the law, the University shall have power among other things.<br/>to institute and award fellowships scholarships, bosaries, medals, prizes and other titles, distractions awards and forms of assistance;<br/>to hold examinations and grants degrees, diplomas, certificate and other distinctions to persons who have pursued courses of study approved by the University and have satisfied such other requirements as the University may lay down.<br/>To grant honorary degrees, fellowship, or academic titles.<br/>It is obvious that the traditional role of the universities in Nigeria is manpower development relevant research, consultancy and extension services.<br/>            However, in the content of a developing society with limited resources, it is necessary to take these concepts and objectives further and focus, at least on a clearly defined objective.  At this point in time, the need for establishing polytechnics began to be entertained in the minds of well-known Nigerians.<br/>            Aminu (1989) stressed the philosophy of polytechnics when he states that:<br/>            “it has for long been widely felt that the technological needs of Nigeria are not being appropriately met by the kind of engineers so far turned out only at the highest academic levels by our universities.  This type of technological manpower has needed extensive retraining and breaking-in to factory-life; it has also been top-heavy in the sense not necessarily of producing too many graduate engineers but of producing too few technicians and even fewer technologist without whom, even more than without the graduates, no self-sustaining industrial revolution is possible.<br/>Even more true is this of the management field the relevance of which in the engineering of human groups the country has yet to become fully aware.  In the private sector the upsurge of entreprenurialism in business a and agriculture of the post-civil war period is a trend that deserves the stongest encouragement as a mechamism for diverting some of our best techno-managerial manpower from the unhealthy hegemony of oil industry into a cadre of job-creating self-employed professionals who need only modest capital findings to start to tackle effectively the scandalous unemployment problems at the sub-professional levels.<br/>            Against this background, against the need to fashion a bread of technologists and engineers who can walk straight from the campus into the factory and feel at home, and against the background also of the lack of a requisite minimum technological milieu for the general public of the country that the polytechnics were established.<br/>            What the nations expect from polytechnic is supplied research that is directed towards improving our technological base in order to faster industries, agricultural and economic development.  It is expected that research activities in the polytechnics will not only enhance scholarships but will also create opportunities for the institutions to be involved in reverse engineering, creativity and technology adaptation.  While for the purpose of scholarship, basic research is useful, polytechnics must attempt not to proliferate the efforts of the conventional universities but stress practical application of utilitarian aspects of their research; the objectives of the polytechnics therefore are:<br/>1.                  the devising of progrmmes and the training of the right types and cadres of manpower for the industrialization of a West African community this implies meeting needs over a spectrum of disciplines and manpower levels as may from time to time be shows to exist; and<br/>2.                  improving by vigorous extra-mural work the techno-centric orientation of our public who otherwise cannot but be a deadweight on efforts to industrialize.<br/>In catering for these needs we must however be studiously wary of at least one error of the past: the technician and technologist must be encouraged to realize from the outset of their training that they are in no way second-rate to their colleagues in the universities or anywhere else.  There is a difference in aptitudes, training and orientation but the aim of a manpower factory is to exploit this diversity in riches most profitably.  That is all.  Remunerations thereafter are commensurate to training, responsibility and output; the technologist is not lower paid or inferior to the graduate per se.  (Institute of management and technology Calendar Vol.1. No.1, 1973 –1973).<br/>Section 2 (1) of Decree No. 33 states as follows:<br/>The fuctions of each polytechnic shall be:-<br/>a.                   to provide full-time or part-time courses of instructions and training.<br/>i.                    In technology, applied science, eommerce and management; and<br/>ii.                  In such ofter fields of applied learning relevant to the needs of the development of Nigeria in the areas of industrial and agricultural production and distribution and for research in the development and adaptation of as the council may from time to time determine.<br/>b.                  To arrange conferences, seminars, and study groups relative to the field of learning specified in paragraph @ above;<br/>c.                   To perform such other functions as in the opinion of the council may serve to promote the objectives of the polytechnic.<br/>The salary grade level disparity or discrepancy exist between the B.Sc or B A and HND holders at the beginning of employment and at the end in the salary structure of the Civil Service; thereby making HND certificate seem inferior to B.SC certificate, though both may have been obtained in the same field of knowledge and no differences exist in terms of the duration of study as well as the environment where the knowledge is acquired.<br/>      This study therefore will find out whether this is a fact or fiction with the view of suggesting appropriate policy measures that will solve the problem.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Without fear of contradictions, polytechnic graduates feel marginalized in the scheme of things.  For instance, a HND graduate is regarded or classified as a subordinate to his collogue a university graduate with either B. Sc or B A qualification in the office.  In a situation where two or more persons are required to be employed in an office, the person with either B. Sc or B A qualification irrespective of the discipline would first be considered for employment before the person with HND certificate.  In the promotion exercise, the polytechnic graduate would be considered last after his university collogues have been considered.<br/>To this end, the researcher therefore aim towards finding out the following research problems.<br/>i.                    Is HND / B. Sc Certificates discriminated or is there any preference for B.Sc to HND?<br/>ii.                  Are there differences in salary grade levels of both certificates on assumption of duty?<br/>iii.                Does any difference exist in the course contents of the courses offered in both institutions?<br/>iv.                Can a B.

This system of education laid more emphasis on vocational courses. Shorthand is a course in secretarial studies that leads to the acquisition of a particular skill and offer workers adequate self-expression, more opportunities for creative thinking and physical manipulation of modern equipments.<br/>            Shorthand is one of the main subject offered by secretarial studies department in various tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Unfortunately, many students of secretarial studies or business education (secretarial option) find the mastery of shorthand an obstacle to the realization of their educational ambition. In schools, the study of shorthand has been a difficult task to both students and lecturers.<br/>            The lecturers find it uneasy to impact the knowledge to the students, while on the other hand the students find it difficult to master the art as to produce accurate transcription or get to the standard as many required of them. Some of the problems encountered by the students of shorthand include poor knowledge of English, bad typewriters for transcription, bad cassette recorders, lack of interest, poor ventilation, uncomfortable sitting arrangement and poor accommodation etc. which should facilitate shorthand writing. Lack of adequate teaching equipment and fear on the part of the students has prompted the researcher to carry out thus study with a view of finding solutions to these problems. Students treat shorthand like every other subject, they only study it during examination periods and as such perform badly. The reason for choosing shorthand among other subject for this work is because of its importance to the business world and the society at large without adequate alternative.<br/>            In the secretarial profession upon which the researcher, will want to base this research, it has been discovered that many people choose the secretarial profession for one reason or the other.<br/>            Normally, people are enthusiastic and motivated to perform better in a course of study when they are aware of the benefit they will get from the study of such courses like shorthand, typewriting, audio typing, transcription, computer operation and word processor manipulation.<br/>            Whatever be the motivate of the people for doing the course, they should bear in mind that it is very important that the basic shorthand and typewriting that qualifies anybody to be called a secretary, must not be tossed to the wind.<br/>            Much has been said in recent years about the declining standard and disappointing examination results in shorthand while this may be some what exaggerated, lecturers are well aware that the performance of many students fall short of their potentials example the result of Institute of management and Technology, Enugu declined seriously in the year 2001 academic session, due to students inability to synthesize and retain what they had learnt in shorthand subject thus being unable to deliver positive result and students negative attitude to the learning of shorthand or is it inadequate teaching of the course and lack of equipment and materials for study.<br/>            Despite the fact that shorthand plays a vital role in today’s business transaction, students in secretarial department have beem finding it difficult to put more interest in the course of shorthand which has lead to poor performance of the students in the course (subject shorthand)<br/>            Inability of the students to comprehend and concentrate when shorthand dictation is going on are all reason why difference in progress is to be expected.<br/>            Another factor that lead to poor performance in shorthand is the student’s poor background in English language because it implies to the students knowledge in the transaction from shorthand dictation.<br/>            Considering the above listed factors, shorthand is made up of the following contents<br/>-          Vowels<br/>-          Consonants<br/>-          Diphthongs<br/>-          Trip hones <br/>This research work aims at finding out the causes of poor performance of students in shorthand examination.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            Over the years, the general notion has been that shorthand is a difficult subject. Its difficult nature is better imagined than described.<br/>            This general notion is a driving force which has led the researcher into the topic: factors responsible for student’s poor performance in shorthand.<br/>            Some of the problems student encounter may include but not limited to.<br/>The negative or lack of interest of students towards shorthand subject has effect on the students performance <br/>Lack of qualified teachers to teach the course<br/>Teacher’s inability to use the appropriate methods in teaching the course<br/>The teachers attitude towards the student<br/>Inability of the student to identify shorthand outlines among others.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The major purpose of this study is to find out the factors responsible for student’s mass failure in shorthand<br/>            Specifically, the study will find out:<br/>Why students fail shorthand massively <br/>Whether students of today have interest in studying shorthand.<br/>If the lecturers are qualified shorthand teachers<br/>The suitability of the teaching methods used by the lecturers<br/>What is responsible for the students inability to identify their outlines<br/>Whether lecturers attitude encourages or discourages the students in studying and learning shorthand.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            It is hoped that the research findings will help to know how the students, lecturers, boss, society and institute will benefit if the problem of students poor performance in shorthand is rectified.<br/>            It would be significant to students as they will be able to take down minutes or letters in a very shorthand time in their office instead of using longhand in writing. This can make their work more easy and more accurate.<br/>            Lecturers can also benefit because they will have little work to do when marking student scripts after examination believing that their students are good in the course. <br/>            Also, the boss will benefits if his/her secretary knows her job in the office and can take down notes within a short time and accurately or transcribe shorthand dictation after a meeting.<br/>            Secretaries need shorthand skills so as to be competent in performing his/her duties without constant supervision. A secretary that fails to perform well in his/her duties will not succeed. <br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>            The following research questions will guide the study<br/>What are the causes of students massive failure in shorthand<br/>How do students demonstrate interest in studying shorthand<br/>What are the qualifications of shorthand teachers<br/>What are the teaching methods used on teaching shorthand<br/>To what extend do students find it difficult to recognize their shorthand outlines<br/>What are the lectures attitude to shorthand students.<br/><br/>\n\nA SURVEY OF THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR STUDENT POOR PERFORMANCE IN SHORTHAND IN POLYTECHNICS IN ENUGU STATE.

A secretary need a job design strategy that will help her to enhance her potentials as well as achieving organizational goal. Many organization attain little on no importance to the qualities of a secretary, not to talk of giving them a benefiting job design, because secretary is an indispensable management personnel they deserve a job design  that is motivating and satisfying. The main point is that the effectiveness of a secretary job design should be consider.<br/>            The main purpose of this study is to find out the effects of improper job design on the secretary job design, strategies that exist in most organization and negative effects on the psychological and psychological life of a secretary. My attention will be given on the following question, what type of job design strategy does the secretary need? What type does the manager adopt mostly? Whether job design effects the performance of a secretary? The guide line of drawing up a job design? The effects of job design on secretarial profession. This will help the managers to understand how an effective job design will improve secretary performance and other people who will want to go into research will also benefits from this work.<br/>            This project will cover all categories of secretaries including those who have attained the secretarial status through promotion and advancement in their working place.<br/>            It has been observed that most secretaries cannot be perform better due to the kind job design structure and feeling of secretary that their contribution are not recognized etc.<br/>            This research will base on how the secretary job will be designed in their place of work. Job design is one of the components of scientific management said by Taylor. Whish means that job should be simplified, standardized and specialized for the required work. Job design should also determine by the situation that the organization find itself dwelling within at a particular time, if job is well designed it will make employee to identify the organizational goal and inspired by its attractive design to be motivated.<br/>            Job design is the system of planning or arranging a job, that is drawn an outline from which job contents are made. It is also an outgrowth of job analysis and concern with the design of jobs in order to improve organizational efficiency. There are many factors affecting job design. One of the most common factors is employee dissatisfaction with job that are repetitive, narrow, meaningless and routine. Another one is human relationship resulting as loss of pride in work insecurity etc. in recent years it has been observed with respect to move usual and seeming risky changes to job content which includes; job enrichment, job enlargement and job rotation.<br/>JOB ROTATION: This means increases the variety of activities performed by the individual by allowing him to move from the job to another, perhaps at specified intervals.<br/>JOB ENLARGEMENT: This represents definite movement away from simplified job by extending the job content to include a wider range of task, which aims at reduction of boredom and stimulating of interest at work to improve satisfaction of esteem needs.<br/>JOB ENRICHMENT: This means extend of job contents to provide for greater satisfaction of individuals need and goals by a combination of enlargement autonomy and responsibility. <br/>            A description of the research process followed in the study to obtain background information on the organization involves in the study is provided. <br/>            In this research the primary and secondary method of data collection will be used and the questionnaire will drawn to achieve mainly tow objectives.<br/>Establishment of current form of job design <br/>An examination and analysis of the aspects of how this job design affects the secretary’s performance.<br/>The sampling method or technique that will be used in the random sampling technique. The tabulation of data will consist of qualitative and quantitative information. The question make protesting will be comprehensive and suitable and in line with the research objectives.<br/>            In order to analyze the data gathered. A table will be used and percentage to classifying the opinions of respondent regarding the question asked.<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>            Job design as suggested by Taylor is one of the most important components of scientific management. In its basic format, it assures that jobs should be simplified standardized and specialized for each components of the required work. In general organizations operations aisled this basic job design format by breaking each job down into very small but workable units standardizing the necessary procedures for performing the units, and teaching and motivating workers to perform their job under conditions of high efficiency. <br/>            Therefore, the importance of designing jobs and systems of work in a manner that will satisfy both psychological and sociological needs of a secretary should be stressed. That is the effectiveness of a secretary’s job design, effort should consider both the work accomplishment efforts and the secretarial responses of the job.<br/>            Empowers job design has the following effect misunderstanding between secretaries and their bosses, lowering status of the secretary etc.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHPATER ONE<br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              Background of the study<br/>1.2              Statement of problems<br/>1.3              Purpose of the study<br/>1.4              Scope of the study<br/>1.5              Significance of the study<br/>1.6              Research question.<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0              REVIEW OF LITERATURE<br/>2.1       Historical background<br/>2.2              Factors affecting individual job design<br/>2.3              Job enlargement<br/>2.4              Job rotation<br/>2.5              Job enrichment<br/>2.6              Summary of literature review.<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0              DESIGN/METHODOLOGY FOR THE STUDY<br/>3.1       Research design<br/>3.2              Area of study<br/>3.3              Population of study<br/>3.4              Instrument for data collection<br/>3.5              Validation of research instrument<br/>3.6              Reliability of the instrument<br/>3.7              Method of data collection<br/>3.8              Administration of research instrument<br/>3.9              Method of data analysis.<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0              PRESENTATION OF RESULTS<br/>4.1       Summary of result/findings<br/>CHPATER FIVE<br/>5.0       DISCUSSION IMPLICATION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.1              Discussion of results<br/>5.2              Conclusions<br/>5.3              Implication of results<br/>5.4              Recommendation<br/>5.5              Suggestion for further research<br/>5.6              Limitation of the study.<br/>References<br/>Appendices. <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            Business organization exist because they have goals to attain. It is through people that organizational goals are achieved. In fact people are the most important assets of any organization. Their performance determined the success or failure of an organization. It is the concern of management that workers carry out their task effectively.<br/>            Therefore the human factor must be managed properly for positive impact on productivity by provision of a goal. Job design is the way job are structured, designed or tailored towards achievement of organizational goals. Organizations needs job designed that will enhance their performance and help them achieve their self-esteem. <br/>            Job design is important to an organization because the way job are structured designed or coordinated has direct and significant impact on the performance of the organization. Job design concerns the content functions and relationships of jobs that are directed towards the accomplishment of organizational purpose and satisfaction of the personal needs of the individuals job holders.<br/>            This also showed that a secretary needs a good job design that will help her to enhance her potentials as well as help in accomplishing organizational goals.<br/>            Onasanya (1990) stated that the secretary is an important officer in any establishment. The contributions and effectiveness of a secretary can either enhance or diminish the efficiency of an organization. He also stated that the title secretary may either refer to a chief administrator of an organization or to a person who performs the functions of organizing and recording the proceedings of a meeting.<br/>            The duties of a secretary could be likened to that of the executive because the secretary is aware of nearly every action of the executive, many organizations attach little or no importance to the qualities of a secretary not to talk of giving them a benefiting job design.<br/>            Stanwell and show (1978) defined secretary as an staff who is concerning with the preparation, preservation and transmission of all types of communication as well as the conventional secretarial duties of confidential nature at various levels. Eni (1989) also defined the secretary as a member of clerical staff whose fundamental function are concerned with the preparation of correspondence or communication in all form with and outside the organization.<br/>            From the above definitions, it can be seen that secretary is an indispensable management personnel in an organization and outside environment. Considering the job of a secretary in an organization they deserve a job design that is motivating.<br/>            Durcker (1978) asserted that an organization needs the best performance a man is capable of and a man needs more than a job he can perform. He need a job that will provide the greatest scope of his abilities and talent the best opportunity for growth and for superior performance. <br/>            The secretary position varies widely depending on the size of the organization the number of workers employed, the nature of the business as well as personal qualities. Today the secretary’s job has also been hanged due to computerization their job became more challenging than ever because of the current technological design. A research on job design will not be complete without making mention of motivation. Motivation is a way of stimulating people into action.<br/>            Therefore, the redesigning of a secretary job will not only focus on the key job characteristics, dimensions of contents function and relationships, but also considering the important of individual differences in relation to job design consequences. <br/>            Birdchall (1975) stated that an understanding of human motivation is essential to the job designer. The job which he creates may be technical depending upon the cooperation and involvement of the job holder. Therefore, he must be aware of the important role of work in a man’s life in order that he is better able to engineer a fit between human needs and technical requirement of the work. Work is an aspect of life which gives man his status and binds him to the society.<br/>            Discontent may result from individual failure to find satisfaction in his job not meeting his psychological and social needs. The feeling that his contribution to the organization is not being adequately compensated rewarded or recognized by the organization.<br/>            The high level of job specialization promoted by scientific management approach created a number of problems centering on the individual workers moral and behavior example low satisfaction, high absenteeism and low turnover were partially attributed to the boredom and monotony created by highly specialized routine nature of individual employee’s work.<br/>            The introduction of an effective job design in the job of a secretary will show improvement in the secretarial job performance. These changes come through job content function, relationship and feedback of jobs.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>            These are the problems which the researcher intended to find out the solution at the end of the study.<br/>            Most secretaries cannot perform better due to the kind of job design structure given to them.<br/>            Sometimes job design given to them create a feeling to them that their contribution are not adequately compensated, recognized or needed in the organization.<br/>            They feel demoralized when they see their job as the one that have no definite sequence or procedure for doing it.<br/>            Because they feel demoralized or humiliated by their broiling managers they feel they cannot satisfy their psychological and social needs<br/>            These problems and so many others are what the researcher intend to find out the solution to in this study.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The following are the purpose of this study<br/>To find out the effects of improper job design on secretarial performance<br/>To examine some of the job design strategies that exists in most organization.<br/>To investigate if secretary’s work is the work that have no definite job design<br/>To examine if the work of a secretary is not recognized on given their due entitlement<br/>To find out if secretaries cannot satisfy their psychological social needs.<br/>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This simply means the geographical and subject area of the study. The scope of the study is delimited to the effect of job design on a secretarial performance in FRCN Enugu.<br/>1.5       SIGNIFCANCE OF THE STUDY.<br/>            This study will help managers to understand fully how an effective job design will enhance performance of their secretaries.<br/>            It will also help organizations to identify those factors inherent in the secretarial job design that will affect the performance of the secretary and<br/>            Finally it will help the students and lecturers in the future as a reference material in the library.<br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>            Attention will be given to the following questions.<br/>What type of job design structure does the secretaries need<br/>What type of job design does managers adopt mostly to the secretaries <br/>Does these job designs enhance the performance of the secretary<br/>What are the guide line for drawing up a job design<br/>What are the effect of job design on secretaries performance. <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF JOB DESIGN ON SECRETARIAL PERFOPRMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF JOB DESIGN ON SECRETARIAL PERFOPRMANCE", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>IDENTIFYING THE CONSEQUENCES OF INEFFICIENT FILING SYSTEM IN AN ORGANISATION  <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED ORGAINSATION IN ENUGU.)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The aim of this project is to find out the consequences to inefficient filing system in private business organizations.  A case study of selected organization in Enugu.<br/>            The research work looked into the problem statement, which in essence was the previous and present problems of filing system and how the study is being carried out.  The objective of the study was to identify the consequences of inefficient filing system of these selected organizations.<br/>            The population of the study constituted the senior staff of the organizations involved.  The method of data collection was through the use of questionnaires.  A total number of 100 questionnaires were printed, distributed, collected and analyzed using sample percentages the analysis reveal that, untrained personnel:  The employee handling the filing system are not well trained and so cannot handle the filing system well.<br/>            Conclusion were drawn which had it that, it is necessary for the PRAODA to improve their filing system, so that it can achieve a better result in the this millennium.<br/>            Recommendations given were proper funding, creation of motives and incentives, Training in the use of current electronic devices, proper education and training to raise professionals in the field.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/> Chapter one<br/>1.1              Introduction<br/>1.2              Background<br/>1.3              Statement of the study<br/>1.4              Purpose/objective of the study<br/>1.5              Delimitation of the study<br/>1.6              Significance of the study<br/>1.7              Research Questions<br/>Chapter two<br/>Literature review<br/>Chapter three<br/>3.0              Research methodology<br/>3.1       Design of the study<br/>3.2              Area for the study<br/>3.3              Population of the study<br/>3.4              Sample / sampling method<br/>3.5              Method/instrument of data collection<br/>3.6              Validity of instrument<br/>3.7              Method of data Analysis<br/>Chapter four<br/>4.0              Presentation and Analysis of data<br/>Chapter five<br/>5.0              Discussion, conclusion and recommendation<br/>5.1       Discussion of findings<br/>5.2              Conclusion<br/>5.3              Recommendation<br/>5.4              Limitation of the study<br/>5.5              References<br/>5.6              Appendix<br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/>Table   4:        Response to question <br/>Table   5:         Response to question <br/>Table   6:         Response question     <br/>Table   7:         Response question     <br/>Table   8:         Response question     <br/>Table   9:         Response question     <br/>Table   10:       Response question     <br/>Table   11:       Response question     <br/>Table   12:       Response question     <br/>Table   13:       Response question     <br/>Table   14:       Response question     <br/>Table   15:       Response question     <br/>Table   16:       Response question     <br/>Table   17:       Response question     <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:<br/>Many decades back, very little attention was given to information <br/>organization. Management had been mostly concerned with the proper application of management principles on resources to keep the organization going.  But recently, there has been an overwhelming realization of the importance of information as the life-wire of any organization.  Before any business is set up, there must be relevant information relating to that line of business and data has to be collected and evaluated to make sure that the business will be a viable one.  So also strategies relating to that business line should be planned ahead of the commencement of the business if the business is expected to succeed.  Hence for better planning and good decision making management must have at their disposal, ready and accurate information.  This great importance now placed on information has been necessitated by the ever-increasing scope of communication and the expanding size and complexity of today’s business environment.  Much emphasis is now placed on information to all walks of life and in particular to business environment or resources as regards filing in an organization.  Efficient filing system in an organization helps the management of such organization in taking or making timely and accurate decisions.  Information, as defined by Ottih (1989) is data that has been processed in any way that is beneficial to the recipient.  Which means that data in its raw form has to be processed and shaped into useful information for managerial use.  The act of data processing therefore is the collecting, classifying summarizing, reponting and sorting of information (Lyon and Ivancevich, 1976). The pieces of written fact relating to the running of the organization are what constituted its records.  According to Johnson and Kallous (1974) filing system is an act that emerged with data processing and is primarily concerned with systematic handing and proper filing system of an organization from its creation to its final disposal.<br/>            Records keeping dates back to the early man when the act of writing began.  Not having any need for much record to be kept, the early man kept records of very memorable events in caves, stone, wax parchments earthenware vessels.  Some of these were also buried in the earth and dug up after several years.  In cities of early civilization like Ancient Egypt and in the Roman days there came a realization of the convenience of arranging and keeping together in one place, all papers received from individuals of organizations people kept records of all purchases and sales of land and referred to them from time to time (Payne 1970).<br/>            The act of filing was seen in the Roman Empire when records were stung on threads.  This was how the modern term “File” was derived from a latin word for thread , which is orderly arrangement of records that gave rise to the basic methods of filing (alghabetic, subject, chronological and geographical) that are found in existence today. With this also came the procedures of filing, which includes inspecting, coding, cross-referencing, sorting, and sorting. This enable the proper storage of records in a manner that allows for easy and speedy retrieval when needed.<br/>              Very few business ownership existed within this period and tread secrets within their heads and few legal documents. The emergency of various business ownerships and the increasing size and scope of operations have made people to be very much aware of happenings. Johson and kallaus (1974) had it that decades back when the early man really had no need for much records still. But recently, many organizations have grown in size and complexity to the extent that they are industrially revolutionized.  In order to catch up with the ever-growing scientific business environment, organizations have towed a new path towards the development of machines and instruments to replace or enhence human manual dextenity.<br/>            So the modern office is undergoing some technological changes to meet the increased need for information storage.  Over the years, a gradual technological development have been recorded in the area of filing system with a variety of office equipment introduced.  With the application of this advancement to office, filing system answers to inquires can easily and quickly be given by more keying in some codes or commands to tract the required storage location to retrieve information stored there.<br/>            Human judgment is still required to direct the entire operation and put them into proper use.  In agreement, Denyer (1986) has to say that it is not the equipment in use that determines a good result in filing system, rather the personnel who apply the system should be able to use them in a beneficial way to achieve maximum efficiency.  Hence, for the achievement of higher productivity in office operations at a lower cost, there is the need the presence of adequate and capable records, personnel to ensure that they are not properly used.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>In most organization, the issue of good and efficient filing system has <br/>posed a lot of problems and challenges to them conferences, seminars, and workshops may have been organized in the past and recent times to enhance an efficient and accurate filing system, but more or less, it has not achieved completely the aims and objectives. No wonder whitehead (1975) stated that “the essence to having files in the office is to keep related documents together so that information contained in them can be produced with minimum delay”.<br/>            Consequently, now as then, the problems of finance, delay in filing, untrained personnel in the registry, lacks of motivations, no established  procedure, and especially poor  knowledge in the use of modern electronic equipment and many more have not eradicated the ugly and tasking problems in filing system hence this project<br/>1.3              Objectives of the study<br/>Based on the above problems this work is therefore desiged to do the following:<br/>(a)                Identify the current system of filing in selected organization.<br/>(b)               Identify the problems of these methods<br/>(c)                Identify the consequences of inefficient filing.<br/>(d)               Identify the advantages of a good filing system.<br/>1.4              Scope of the study<br/>The study was carried out in using the filing department of the following<br/>1.                  Projects Development institute (PRODA).<br/>2.                  Federal Training Centre (F.T.C.)<br/>3.                  Industrial Training Fund (I.T.F.).<br/>4.                  Aniuzo International Ltd.<br/>5.                  Standard organization.<br/>Senior officers of this organizations were used for the study.  <br/>1.5              Research Questions:<br/>(a)                What are the methods used in the current filing system in selected organization?<br/>(b)               What are the problems militating against those methods in the current filing system in selected organization?<br/>(c)                What are the consequences of inefficient filing system?<br/>(d)               How can effective and efficient filing system help management in day-to-day administrative process?<br/>1.6              Significant of the Study<br/>This study will be of tremendous importance to different business <br/>organizations in Nigeria specially these organizations used for the study, to impart desired skills on their staff as regards to filing system.<br/>            It will also be beneficial to the Federal government of Nation Nigeria to make healthy policies for the importation of modern equipment in filing system or for record keeping.<br/>            Similarly, the study will be very handy to different financial institutions to  appreciate the maximal use of modern equipment for increased up-dating of filing system.<br/>            Finally, the study will be useful to anyone in the field of business management to the importance of filing system.<br/><br/>\n\nIDENTIFYING THE CONSEQUENCES OF INEFFICIENT FILING SYSTEM IN AN ORGANISATION  \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED ORGAINSATION IN ENUGU.)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IDENTIFYING THE CONSEQUENCES OF INEFFICIENT FILING SYSTEM IN AN ORGANISATION  \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED ORGAINSATION IN ENUGU.)\r\n", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>JOB DISSATISFACTION AND ITS IMPLICATION TO CAREER SECRETARIES IN FEDERAL ESTABLISHMENTS <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF NEPA, ENUGU DISTRICT)<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The secretarial profession has come a long way; ranging from a stage of insignificance to a stage where and when it has become indispensable in the administration of modern office.  The wadle of this noble profession saw the secretary as a mere “keeper of secrets”.  This description of the secretary depicts more of his function than his person.<br/> The next stage saw the secretary as “A person employed by another person, society or corporation for the purpose of conducting correspondence, keeping records and transacting other businesses”.  He acts as an aid and the closest assistant to the Principal/Boss.  He is the vehicle through which his boss’s or organisation’s actions are conveyed to the public in readable and discernable form.<br/> The secretary had at sometime been regarded as a disposable employee who should be hired and fired at random.  This view manifested in the case of Barnett.   Hoarse and company vs. South London Tranways when the leaned judge, Lord Estier (1887), noted, that “A secretary is a mere servant, his position is that he is to do what he is told and no person can assume that he has any authority to represent anything at all … “.  This position of the secretary remained unchanged as a George Witechurch ltd Vs. Cararagh (1902) and in Reuben vs Great Fougale Consolidated (1906) where Lord Macnaghten upheld the decision of Lord Esher.<br/> The position of the secretary, however, has improved tremendously from what in the past.  The enhanced roles and status of the secretary was give credence in Pamoran Development Ltd vs. Fidelis Funishing Fabrecs Ltd where Lord Denning (1971) ruled that:- “… but times have changed.  A secretary is a much more important person nowadays than she was in 1887.  She is administrative officer of the company.  As regards is matters concerning administration, in my judgement, the secretary has ostensible  authority to sign contracts on behalf of the company.  Furthermore, of a company is hiring cars to meet its foreign customers at the airport, nothing to my mind is more natural than that the company would live those came though its secretary.<br/> The important role of the secretary has been appreciated by even in Nigeria.  Ovie Whisky (1978) said, “the constitutional Drafting Committee owes its greatest debt to members of the secretarial staff without whose hand work, patience and fore beagueen, its work would have made all the move difficult.  The committee wishes to express its profound gratitude to its able secretary and his energetic assistants, … not only for the efficient manner in which they looked after the welfare of the members but also for providing exceptional secretarial services …, in particular for preparation of excellent records of discussions and conclusion”.<br/> The secretary has arrived in the modern industrialized society of today, and so, dissatisfies’ or hygiene factors of Heizberg’s two factor theory have set in some of these ‘dissatisfies’ including company policy, and administration, quality of supervision, relation with supervisor/boss, relation with peers, salary, job security, personal life, working conditions and environment, status etc.<br/> The impact of technical break through have further compounded the problems of the career secretaries in mechanism – the computer, because a sweet – bitter pill for the career security is government establishments.  The computerization of the operations of most government establishments saw the exit of most career secretarial workload in the office at the very time when technology had not provided much for the performance of secretarial functions.  Currently, the job done by may secretarial in the past, are conformably and more efficiently performed by a computers.<br/> The career secretary’s relationship is a sophisticated office environment has shifted to “man – machine” relationship.  You find the secretary all though the day’s work interacting and carasing with machines of all sorts.  A situation where the secretary takes sloth and dictation from the boss in fast phasing out due to technology.  Where dictations are given at all, dictating machines are used – still leaving the secretary to interact with machines.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>In spite of the modernization of the office environment, the career secretary is still dissatisfied with his job.  The causes of this job dissatisfaction are many and varied.  They also have far – reaching implications on the performance of their secretaries.<br/> Some of these problems exist within the office environment.  Others have their roots outside the office environment.   Emphasis will however, be placed on these problems, which exists with in the office environment and probably, a little of the ones which exist outside the office. <br/> These problems affect the performance of the secretary and decreases her output.  Sometimes, they lead to conflict between the boss and the secretary, above all, highly qualified secretaries hadly retire on the job and this affects the secretarial profession greatly within government establishment as one cannot rule out the fact that the secretarial profession is in high demand and very relevant to our social and economic development.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of the study are as follows:-<br/>1.           To identify factors leading is job

INTRODUCTION<br/>As human beings grow, more numerous they have been subdivided to increase productive efficiency.  This process known as the division of labour has led to increasing specialization of the functions of an individual workers.<br/>Organizations, be it public or private, large or small, are set up to achieve specific organizational goals and objectives. These goals and objectives include profit maximization of socio-economic well-being of members etc.<br/>In recent years, the Nigerian government is showing increasing concern over the performance of her fully owned enterprises.  This current privatization and commercialization of governments owned cooperation is example of this concern for performance.<br/>Secretaries as organizations members and agent through whom organizations achieve their objectives are very complex in nature.  Basely and Robinson (1964) states that the work of the secretary varies according to the kind of products or service being rendered by the firm in which he is employed.  The size of the organisation, the position of the secretary’s employer in the organization, and his employer’s manner or method of wok.<br/>One of the problems of secretaries is the hierarchical structure o the profession.  A secretary is ranked according to her level of education or grade.  In the working system in the Nigerian economy, there are many problems and difficulties encountered by all classes of workers and which in olden days were called stenographers, typist etc. are now designated secretarial, Assistants  I, II,  III and IV.<br/>Problems ranging from the environment, public relations, accommodations, transport, the boss, salary and state governments are at presents raced with the problem of running result through efficient combination of resources at their disposal. These resources are man, machines, materials and money of these, man is regarded as the most important because he controls all other resources.  The failure of the enterprises can therefore be traced to a failure in the managements of the humans resources in the enterprises.<br/>Therefore, the problem of this study is to identify the working conditions of  the office environment of a professional secretary and to evaluate how  these affects  her productivity.<br/>Robins (1978) opines  that he management of human resources simply means “how to achieve bigger and better results through the efforts of people working in the organization”.  This  is basically concerned with the integration of personal aspiration of the employees or groups of employees within that organization.<br/>Robins (1978) further asset that people participated in an organized enterprise and indeed in all kinds of groups in order to achieve some gods that they will necessarily work and contribute all they can to be sure that these goals are accomplished.  It has been observed that one needs the rights skills to accomplish and it follows therefore that employers will value any behaviour that is the actions people put into their jobs and the consequences of those actions.<br/>What propels those action?  What factors influence and affect a secretary’s work performance?  How should a secretary’s work performance be improved?  The answers to these questions are the focal points of this very study.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>One of the problems of secretaries is the hierarchical structure of the profession.  A secretary is ranked according to her level of education or grade.  In the working system in the Nigerian economy, there are many problems and difficulties encountered by all classes of work and secretaries are no exception.  There secretaries which in olden days were called stenographers, typists etc.  Are  new designed secretarial Assistants I  II, III and IV.<br/>Problems ranging from the environment, public relations, accommodations, transport, the boss, salary and state governments are at present faced with the problem of running result-oriented corporation, Enterprises can achieve results through efficient combination of resources at their disposal.  These resources are man, machines, materials and money.<br/>Of these, man is regarded as the most important because he controls all the other resources.  The failure of the enterprises can therefore be traced to a failure in the management of the human resources in the enterprises.<br/>Therefore, the problem of this study is to identify the working conditions of the office environment of a professional secretary and to evaluate now these affects her productivity.<br/>Robins (1978) opines that the management of human resource simply means “how to achieve bigger and better results through the efforts of people working  in the organization”  This is basically concerned with the integration of personal aspirations of the employees or groups of employees within that organization. <br/>Robin (1978) further asserts that people participated in an organized  enterprise and indeed in all kinds of groups in order to achieve some goals that hey will necessary works and contribute all they can to be sure that these goals are accomplished, it has been observed that one needs the right skills to accomplish and it follows therefore that employers will value any behaviours that increase efficiency, performance involves inputs and output, that is the action people put into their jobs and the consequences of those actions.<br/>What propels those actions? Why do secretaries behave the way they do in work?  What factors influence and affects a secretary’s work performance? How should a secretary’s work performance be improved?  The answers to these questions are the focal points of this very study.   <br/>1.3  THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDYS<br/>            The main purpose of perceived leadership is to enhance effectiveness of work performance.<br/>            The overall purpose of this research work include the following. <br/>1.                  To evaluate the perceived leadership function and to ascertain how it can enhance efficiency.<br/>2.                  To appraise the role of leadership in an organization and evaluate its effectiveness in realization of management objectives.<br/>3.                  To ascertain the procedure of leadership in an organization and evaluate its realization of management objectives.<br/>4.                  To find out the problems that that hinder perceives leadership in an organization and seek possible ways of solving such problems<br/>1.4       Research Question<br/>1.                  To what extent does perceived leadership function and to ascertain how it can enhance efficiency.<br/>2.                  To what extent does it appraise the role of leadership in an organization and also the process <br/>3.                  To what extent does the procedure of leadership in an organization and evaluate its effectiveness in realization of management objectives.<br/>4.                  To what extent does problems hinder perceived leadership in an organization and seek possible ways of solving such problems.<br/>1.5. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of the result of any study can be seen in its contribution to the improved performance, Innovation, solution, and new ideas, professional secretaries need some degree of satisfaction to be on the job, so that they can give their maximum best.<br/>Hence, the findings will enable the Management of ANAMMCO, Emene, Enugu to establish a system of motivation, training and retraining professional secretaries, since it follows that employers will value any behaviour that increase efficiency, especially Nigerian mentality that government work means no body’s work and so no body should be concerned about it.<br/>The findings will also offer Organizations helpful suggestions towards the handling of problems therefore, making Organizations know that if secretaries are well motivated, it will make for efficiency in the job performance which leads to the attainment Organizational goals. <br/>1.6.            THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is limited to ANAMCO Limited Emene, Enugu.<br/>1.7              Definitions of the Terms:<br/>Professional secretary are those who have successfully completed a course with shorthand and Typewriter, with speeds of 120/130 per minutes in secretarial studies.  They are senior secretarial Assistant (HND).<br/>In addition, professional secretary act as liaison between his Boss and the rest of the company.  Some times as a bugger you may ask to perform task, beside the professional role.  For example arranging conference calls and scheduling meetings, they may hands more complex responsibilities such as conducting research, preparing statistical reports, training employees, and supervising other clerical staff.<br/>   <br/>\n\nIMPACT OF WORKING CONDITIONS ON PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL SECRETARIES \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF ANAMCO EMENE, ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF WORKING CONDITIONS ON PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL SECRETARIES \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF ANAMCO EMENE, ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A SURVEY OF THE ROLES OF RETAIL BUSINESS HOUSES IN PROVIDING <br/>EMPLOYMENT FOR SECRETARIES IN SELECTED BUSINESS HOUSES IN ENUGU URBAN<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            Historically, people drifted into secretarial work after studying basic shorthand and typing, often beginning in the typing pool and processing from junior to senior secretary, then to personal assistant.

Secretaries were seen as lazy-bones, second-rates , spinsters, dragons or blander bimbos. Fortunately today the profession has gained a healthier reputation. Secretaries are respected for their skills and their professionalism. It is no longer such a female-dominated environment, with a growing proportion of male secretaries being accepted in the business environment.<br/>            Historically, people drifted into secretarial work after studying basic tyoing and typing, often beginning in the typing pool and progressing from junior to senior secretaries.

Moreover, secretaries are to be respected for their skills and professionalism, seeking a fulfilling and rewarding career in administration, communication or public relation by seeking self-employment in retail business houses.<br/>            Also, the study will be useful for further research work by secretarial students.<br/>1.7       ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY<br/>            The following

MOTIVATION ON JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE LTD, ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The field of motivation is a very wide one.  However, the researchers set out to see how motivation works in a management set using EMENITE LTD as a case study.  The concentration is also on the secretary in order to reduce generalization and focus on a specific management personnel.  A general introduction of chapter is presented to relate management to motivation as well as the secretary to management.<br/>A literature review is also given to see the direction others related literatures similar to the researchers’ title have followed.  In doing so, attempts have been made to improve on notice lapses.  This is joined in a chapter with theoretical framework of motivation.  Therein the researchers dealt extensively into renowned theories including Abraham Maslow’s Hygiene Factors, McGregor’s theories X and Y, Frederick Herzberg’s theory, Victor Vroom’s expectancy theory.<br/>The researchers equally defines the objectives of the study which include identifying motivation factors that affects secretary on job performance and identifying environments which make the secretary either efficient or inefficient.  As a prelude to the case study data analysis, a number of questions were asked each revolving round the stated objective.<br/>The researchers devotes a lengthy space to data analysis presented tabularly in chapter four after which recommendations are put forward in chapter five.  The objectives as the introduction says is to identify motivational factors which enhances the secretary’s performance.  No doubt the objective is achieved to a large extent going by the researchers’ recommendations and conclusions.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER

Some say it is made up of “the owners or Directors of an organization” or a system by which diverse resources are utilized in such a way that pre planned economic performances are achieved”. The Gloss any of Marketing Terms” , gives additional meaning to this definition as “comprising the interlocking activities of planning, organising, staffing, directing, controlling and co-ordinating using all liaison and communication resources available to the end”.<br/>            These definitions by different scholars are very important to this study as we can easily see the position and importance of the secretary as well as the need for her efficiency and how she can be motivated towards contributing to profits of the organization.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:<br/>            Emenite Limited, a member of the Belgian Etex Group started operation in 1963 under the name ‘Turners Asbertos Cement Company Nigeria Limited’. The company was incorporated in 1961 with registration number Rc 2712 and the shareholding were as follows:<br/>            Turners and Newall Limited               - 80%<br/>            Government of Eastern Nigeria          - 20%<br/>Due to indigenization decree of 1973, the shareholding of the company changed as follows:<br/>            Turners and Newall Limited               - 60%<br/>            Government of Eastern Nigeria          - 40%<br/>With the name of the company changing to Turners Building Products (Emene)<br/>            Owing to dwindling fortunes of the company, in March 24, 1988, Turners and New all Limited divested its interest in the company and transferred 51% of its Shareholding to Entrepreneur Societe Anonyme of Belgium (Now Etex Group S.A) and the balance of 49% went to the then Anambra and Imo States, now Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia and Eboyi State. As a result of the new shareholding arrangement, the company changed its name to Emenite Limited as is presently known.<br/>            Emenite Limited Specializes in the production of Roofing Products an leiting products. Under the Roofing Products, they have: Bigsix corrugated Sheets (Grey, Red, and Gren colour) 1086mm x 2400mm, Prestige Concrete tile, ultimate corrugated sheets to mention but a few.<br/>            Also under the leiting products, they have Emenite flat sheet, Duraceit decorative Ceiling, Emlux decorative Ceiling and so on. The above products of Emenite are made from fibre and cement and very qualitative in building. No wounder Emenite has a slogun which says “Wherever people builds, there comes Emenite”.<br/>            Emenite Limited, just like every organization has a very grod aim. Hence their aim is to be the leader in the manufacture and sale of high quality building products with zero waste management, culture and to sustain the business in a profitable manner with the knowledge that Emenite will stand by its customers while continually improving the creativity, motivation and safety of all their employees.<br/>            Judging from their aims one will see that they are not far from it since it has achieved almost all as this is made manifest in the benefits its customers derives which includes:<br/>            Universal application<br/>            Non combustible<br/>            Strong and hang lasting<br/>            Rof and Rust free.<br/>            Unique.<br/>Wide range of accessories<br/>            Cost effectiveness<br/>            Completely weather proof and<br/>            Available in different Colours.<br/>            It is interesting and worth mentioning that Emenite has in addition to their numerous products launched (Duratile) into the market on 25th day of November 2001 in Enugu State in the first instance, and other areas later.<br/>            Before now, Emenite produces flower pot, pipes used for water and other things. But thanks to Emenite for improving on their products. Their products range are sold through  a wide range of distributor network located in such a place that will be close to project sites. They also offer free pre and after sales technical advice to ensure, that their customers enjoy problem free roof.<br/>            Consequently, Emenite Limited was Certified to 150 9001-2000 in 1998, 2002, and are the first to obtain such international Standard East of the Niger. This entaits that their products could be sold in any market both locally and internationally.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            As the title suggests, the main problem of this project is to study the Effect of Motivation on job performance of a secretary. In other words, the research is aimed at knowing those factors that will normally increase the job performance and efficiently in an organization. For instance, the study/research wants to know if “Motivation” ends only when a secretary’s salary is increased regularly or when she is promoted or given commendations by her supervisors. On the other hand, would she be inefficient if she is not given medical facilities or if she is not aware of the company’s corporate goals. The research intends to unravel these and many other questions through the case study. This therefore obvious that lack of motivation affects the morale and spirit to;’ work. Inadequate motivation produce, anegaline work attitude.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The performance of secretaries in Emenite Limited has been regarded as both inefficient and ineffective. As already stated, the secretary occupies an important position in the organization. Hence it will not be surprising to say that behind every successful boss, there is an efficient secretary. Such importance requires that she must put in her best, display her talent and integrity and demonstrate a high level of proffesionalism. What factors make her to achieve her best, how can she achieve high efficiency? Hence it is the aim of this study to find answer to these questions with the following objectives<br/>i.                    To identify the factors which the secretary will regard as motivational.<br/>ii.                  To examine the relationship between motivation and secretary’s performance in an organization.<br/>iii.                To identify an environment which will make the secretary either efficient or inefficient.<br/>iv.                To have an indepth knowledge on the effects the motivation of secretaries has on their job performance.<br/>v.                  To meet practicing secretaries to get on the spot assessment of how best secretaries can attain the pinnucle of their profession.<br/>vi.                To drive at reasonable conclusion and make recommendations that will enable the secretary to achieve high efficiency as a professional.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>On completion of this work, administrators will be supplied with important information relating to motivation and its effects on secretary’s performance.<br/>Also, it will reveal how adequately secretaries are motivated in Emenite Limited Enugu.<br/>Again in the field of academics, it will constitute an enormous contribution in the field of business Administration.<br/>This petce of work will in addition be an invaluable material for future researchers who would like to do more research work on motivation as a tool for improving secretaries performance.<br/>It is just the above mentioned, it will enhance general understanding about organisational efficiency and will be our humble wish to contribute to the national strive towards finding a feasible and lasting solutions to the problem of inefficiency in our organization.<br/>Lastly, it is our firm belief that this study will be of immense benefit and of great use of the generality of the public.<br/> <br/>\n\nTHE SURVEY OF THE EFFECT OF MOTIVATION ON JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE LTD, ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE SURVEY OF THE EFFECT OF MOTIVATION ON JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE LTD, ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF ANAMMCO &amp; EMENITE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The topic of this research is the contributions of modern office equipment.

It enables her to accomplish more work in few hours with greater efficiency and better Quality. Also Doswell (1978) mentioned that a secretary is capable of working faster and more efficiently with modern office equipment with a minimum of fatigue.<br/>            The use of this modern office equipment by a secretary can result in greater output than that of a secretary using manual or under-developed equipment. Highly skilled personnel is sought for in business organization nowadays and to this effect, Russo et al (1980) advocated that the more productive a secretary is, the more the organization can afford to pay with in reasonable limits and hence create employment opportunities for secretaries.<br/>            The invention of office equipment necessitated the growth in large enterprise and also a technological break –through. The office, therefore, receives much on sophisticated office equipment in order to cope with the ever- increasing roles in the organization.<br/>            It seems, however, that although the higher levels of management might not make much direct use of technology, the secretary. Will. The future for office automation for this job is in providing the secretary with system that meets the real need identified as being important, rather than the ones of typing and stenography that are thought to be important.<br/>As against the traditional office, the modern office has a lot of activities to perform with the aid of modern equipment. These day’s uncountable organizations have installed these equipment and the sectaries are present to manipulate some of them in discharging their duties officially. However, modern office equipments which act as improvement tools in the secretary’s job arose from the numerous mathematical calculations done in offices, and the use of the equipment by a secretary can result to a greater output than that of a secretary using manual equipment.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Automation in office emerged to replace work and enhance office efficiency and productivity<br/>Today, Secretaries profession has witnessed a marked change in terms of technological advancement. Modern office equipment has taken the toll of events with the growing rate of scientific and technological innovations.<br/>            There are office equipment which are used in organization to improve office work and reduce labour costs. They include electric typewriters, computers, telephone, dictating machines, facsimile transceiver, internet and others are tremendously used in offices today.<br/>The problem of this study is that now, it has not been known the extent these modern office equipment help the secretary in performing her job, to effectiveness and efficiency.<br/>            From the use of these modern office equipment it has also not been know whether these equipment act as important tools in the much –desired secretary’s job Satisfaction.<br/>            This research work therefore attempts to find out the contributions of modern office equipments in the advancement of secretarial profession.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY.   <br/>The purpose of the study:<br/>i.                    To find out the type of office equipment used in Anammco and Enaenite.<br/>ii.                  To find out if any of the equipment is modern<br/>iii.                To determine the extent the use of these equipments has assisted the secretary in performing their job.<br/>iv.                To find out the problems they encounter in using office equipment.<br/>v.                  To determine if Anammco management and Emenite management derive any economic advantage from using these machines.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY.<br/>            This research would serve as an indicator to employers so as to know the type of modern office equipment needed by the secretary that will be best for maximum efficiency and productivity of secretarial work and the entire organization. It would also serve as a means to ease workload of secretaries in office and bring about job efficiency to secretaries.<br/>            Finally, business organization would appreciate the importance of these equipment and thus procure them.<br/>1.6       ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY<br/>            The researcher assumes that if modern office equipment were provided in various offices they would contribute to secretarial effectiveness and efficiency.<br/>            It is also assumed that the reverse may be the case where secretaries have the skill and there is lack of modern office equipment.<br/>The researcher also assumes that if these equipment are provided and the secretaries do not have the competence to manipulate them, their productivity would also be affected.<br/>1.7       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>i.          What type of office equipment does Emenite and Anammco      use in their offices?<br/>ii.         How many of these equipment are modern?<br/>Iii         To what extent has the use of these equipment helped        the secretaries in their jobs?<br/>iv.        What problems do the secretaries encounter in the use         of these office equipment?<br/>v.         What economic advantage does the Emenite and Anammco derive from using these office equipment.<br/>1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>EFFECTIVENESS: The oxford advanced learners dictionary defines effectiveness as having the desired effect, of producing the intended result.<br/>  EFFICIENCY: The oxford advanced learners dictionary also defines efficiency as the ability of the people to the work well and without waste of time or resources example, competent and efficient secretary.<br/>   EQUIPMENT: The some oxford advanced learners dictionary described equipment as those things needed for particular purpose, example, equipments, are needed in offices for work.<br/>ENHANCEMENT: Oxford advanced learners dictionary also explains enhancement as the way to increase or to improve further quality, value or status of something.<br/>    <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION (A CASE STUDY OF ANAMMCO &amp; EMENITE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION (A CASE STUDY OF ANAMMCO & EMENITE", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF JOB DISSATISFACTION OF SECRETARIES<br/>A CASE STUDY OF THE NIGERIAN TELECOMMUNICATION, (NITEL) PLC IN ENUGU.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research is intended to survey the implications of job dissatisfaction of secretaries in Nitel Enugu with the view of determining whether secretaries are not dissatisfied with their jobs, and what makes for job dissatisfaction/satisfaction in the organization. The number of secretaries  in Nitel Enugu were chosen as a population of study among other government organization that have secretaries who face similar problems selection of the respondents were based on simple random sampling.<br/>The result of this study showed that secretaries are dissatisfied with their job. The cause of this job dissatisfaction starts from the low salary they receive which to them is not commensurate with the nature of their job, less time for themselves, constant change of boss, un-cooperative attitude of colleague, people perception of secretaries and lack of achievement.<br/>Finally, in view of the above, it is recommended that bosses should be allowed to work in an office with a secretary for at last 4-5 years duration before they are changed or transferred. This will enable the secretaries to be acquainted or familiar with the boss and it will enhance productivity and out put level. Secondly, the salary level of secretaries must be in accordance with what others are paid. It must be enough to motivate them towards working harder for attainment of the organization goal.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION                                                    <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY                        <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM                        <br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY                                    <br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY             <br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS                                      <br/>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY                                         <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0       LITERATURE REVIEW                                         <br/>2.1       CONCEPT AND DEFINITION OF A SECRETARY       <br/>2.2       FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH JOB DISSSATISFACTION<br/>OF SECRETARY                                                                 <br/>2.3       CONSEQUENCES OF JOB DISSATISFACTION           <br/>2.4       JOB DISSATISFACTION AND FACTORS THAT CAN GIVE RISE<br/>            TO JOB DISSATISFACTION OF THE SECRETARY     <br/>2.5       SYMTOMS AND EXTENT OF JOB DISSATISFACTION<br/>2.6       VARIOUS MOTIVATION THEORIES THAT ARE RELATED<br/>TO JOB DISSATISFACTION                                             <br/>2.7       THE NEED HIERACHY THEORY                                   <br/>2.8       SECRETARY AND JOB DISSATISFACTION    <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0       RESEARCH METHODOLOGY                             <br/>3.1       RESEARCH DESIGN                                                         <br/>3.2       AREA OF STUDY                                                               <br/>3.3       POPULATION OF STUDY                                                 <br/>3.4       SAMPLE AND SAMPLING TECHNIQUES                    <br/>3.5       INSTRUMENT FOR DATA COLLECTION         <br/>3.6       VALIDITY OF THE INSTRUMENT                                 <br/>3.7       RELIABILITY OF THE INSTRUMENT               <br/>3.8       METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS                          <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0       DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS<br/>4.1       RESEARCH QUESTIONS                                      <br/>4.2       RESEARCH QUESTION NO 2                              <br/>4.3       RESEARCH QUESTION NO 3                              <br/>4.4       SUMMARY OF FINDINGS                                               <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0       DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION                                 <br/>5.1       DISCUSSION OF RESULTS                                              <br/>5.2       CONCLUSION                                                                    <br/>5.3       RECOMMENDATION                                                                    <br/>5.4       LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY                           <br/>            REFERENCES                                                         <br/>            APPENDIX                                                               <br/>            QUESTIONNAIRES                                                <br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/>As a secretary are you dissatisfied with your job ………….

The organization was not mainly for profit making but like any other government establishment to provide its services to the public at a minimal cost.<br/>        The problem however, remains that the efficiency and functioning of NITEL has continued to fall below expectations of the consumers despite several reorganizations that has taken place in the parastatal. NITEL though is not the only public parastatal in which there are lapses but her case has become so common place or rather important considering its role as communication conveyor for any modern business organization (private/public).<br/>        Public and private sectors of the economic are modifying their communicate system to ensure efficient and effective information gathering, processing and disseminating by the telecommunication system. Hence the role of telecommunication in the socio economic development of the developing nation like Nigeria cannot be over emphasized. It is in realization of this fact that the Nigeria Telecommunication limited was set up by the federal government to offer telephones, telex, telegrams and satellite services.<br/>        The federal government had spent hugs sums of money in this parastatal to see that the public gets the satisfaction they need but yet telephone subscribers still feel they are getting the best from this parastatal.<br/>NITEL on its own complains frequently of vandalisation of its equipment and neglect on the part of its workers, which leads to disruption of its operations.<br/>        Some of these workers are secretaries who are way or the other are dissatisfied with their jobs and seek a way of satisfying themselves on their job. These secretaries are being paid like other workers but what is the cause of their dissatisfaction with their jobs hence the low efficiency and effectiveness in the performance of their job, could it be the salary paid to them? But even most highly paid establishment are unhappy and dissatisfied with their jobs whereas other receiving half their salary work with great vitality, enthusiasm and enjoy their job.<br/>        Clearly salary alone is not the answer for everyone and perhaps not even the majority. There are other aspect of the job and the work environment that provide much greater satisfaction than the size of the paycheck.<br/>        Jobs dissatisfaction in the context of this research refers to a state of discontent and a sense of not achieving what are wants to achieve the displeasure that one can derive from performing his daily chores or duties. It is quite the opposite of satisfaction. It could be viewed as resulting from lack of motivation, stemming in the challenge of the job, through such factors as achievement, responsibility, growth, inadequate equipment in carrying out her job like computers etc. In NITEL, if concern for workers psychological state as well as the job are allowed to take prominence, it well help create as state of satisfaction in the secretaries particularly in examining job dissatisfaction, two distinct set of factors have considered. These two set are called the ‘satisfiers’ and “dissatisfiers”.<br/>        The satisfiers lead to satisfaction with the job and apparent improvement in performance. The satisfiers include achievement, recognition, responsibility, growth of foster these satisfiers include; delegation of responsibility, freedom to exercise discretion, promotion, full use of skill, appraisal, job enlargement etc.<br/>        The dissatisfiers on the other hand which are peripheral to the job itself are factors on which management have traditionally relied on in an attempt to motivate their employees which include, working conditions, policy and administration, relationship with superiors and peers (workmates).<br/>        It is a well known fact that people go through life performing the job which they derive no pleasure or satisfaction. This study will try to examine some of these attributes that give dissatisfaction to secretaries in government in Enugu using NITEL as a case study.<br/>        However, NITEL office is not the only government establishment in Enugu that has secretaries with similar condition of service.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>        Secretaries are faced with the problems of not being satisfied with their job. This job dissatisfaction comes up in the course of their official duties and in job environment. Recently many people have questioned about the causes of this problem with little or no answers to such questions for this reason the researcher have decided to look into the problems to know what could be the likely cause of this dissatisfaction. Secretaries are educated, fully trained and recognized but are not allowed to exercise initiative in the organization. Also the consistent harassment by their boss have posed a problem for the secretaries which has let to their being dissatisfied with their jobs. Most time they are being treated with disdain.<br/>        Also people perception of secretaries has also caused a sort of problem for these secretaries. Most people look at secretaries as mere typist in the organization. Also secretaries are being restricted from exercising their full freedom like other workers in the organization because of their position in the establishment, and the fear of revealing matters of confidentiality to outsiders. They are not also allowed to enjoy “level” benefits like other workers.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>        This reach work is specifically designed to:<br/>1.           Identify the causes of this job dissatisfaction among secretaries in the parastatals. <br/>2.           Determine the causes of this job dissatisfaction, which affect the secretary in their offices.<br/>3.           To find out whether their jobs as secretaries offer a greater sense of responsibility, achievement, recognition and growth potentials<br/>4.           To find out whether the conditions of services offered to them are satisfactory to them and examine their prospects.  <br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        It is hoped that this study will reveal the prevalent causes of dissatisfaction that secretaries are experiencing which will go a long way in finding ways of improving the performance of the secretary thus leading to increased productivity. The study in the researchers view, will throw more light on the root causes of job dissatisfaction and the prospects of the secretaries and the consider what the employers should do to eliminate most of the causes of job dissatisfaction order to motivate the secretary towards achieving the organization goal. Secretaries will also be made to ensure that solutions are found to the root causes of job dissatisfaction.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>        In view of the problem stated above, the following research questions are set to guide the researcher reach valid conclusions in this research.<br/>1.           What are the job dissatisfaction that secretaries experience?<br/>2.           At what extent has job dissatisfaction of secretaries contributed to the organizational goal?<br/>3.           What factor gives rise to job dissatisfaction or secretaries in NITEL?<br/>4.           What are the problems encountered by secretaries if they are not satisfied with their job?<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The scope of the research work is centre on the “causes and effects of job dissatisfaction on secretaries in government establishments, using (Nigeria Tele Communication Plc) NITEL as a case study. <br/>  <br/>\n\nCAUSES AND EFFECTS OF JOB DISSATISFACTION OF SECRETARIES\r\nA CASE STUDY OF THE NIGERIAN TELECOMMUNICATION, (NITEL) PLC IN ENUGU.\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF JOB DISSATISFACTION OF SECRETARIES\r\nA CASE STUDY OF THE NIGERIAN TELECOMMUNICATION, (NITEL) PLC IN ENUGU.\r\n", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROBLEMS OF TIME MANAGEMENT TO THE PERFORMANCE SECRETARIES<br/>A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OWNED ESTABLISHMENTS IN ENUGU METROPOLIS<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Time management is the allocation of proper and adequate time to a particular task and having them done within the frame.

According to Mc Fadden and Dart (1992). Some of the human activities to which time is very important are in the business profession.<br/>            The underlying theme of time management is the notion of efficiency that time can be allocated in a way that optimize the return of goal achievement.<br/>            Secretaries work with constant and rapid flow of information in organization. To contribute in the processing of information, secretaries must be able not only to organize their effectiveness and efficiency to work in a way to increase their contributions to the organizations but manage others.<br/>            Effectiveness according to Jennings (1981) is producing a defined or a desired result. While efficiency is the act of producing the desired result within a minimum of efforts expense and time wastage.<br/>            According to Njoku (1996) time management  involves developing, acquiring knowledge, skills and equipment to extend performance beyond present capabilities, controlling attitude and emotions that have a tendency to steal time and developing effective reminders, method for following through on each task at the appropriate time. The secretary should be interested in deivising ways of ensuring option and effective utilization of available time so as to obtain maximum productivity and enhance job effectiveness.<br/>            Furthermore, in Gilles (1990), time management is an essential principle in an approach to reducing stress. Effective time management means analysis in what needs to be done, setting priorities, determining the best and most effective ways to do the job, and eliminate things that waste time.<br/>            Still according to Gilles (1990), time is irreversible and irreplaceable, so the effective use of her time to achieve efficiency. From the foregoing, it can be seen that secretaries occupy key positions in organizations either in the private or public industries. Terry (1996) said that it is what the secretary does, she manage, plan, organize, accurate control, not only her own activities but also the activities of her subordinates, according to the same author, time management helps to ensure that no part of the secretarial duties will be neglected. Furthermore,   the jobs of secretaries are made easier and more satisfying by time management. He said that an awareness of the value of time is the basis of more effective utilization. Perhaps to increase time awareness, the hourly value of a secretary’s time would be calculated with this as a base, the optimum allocation and usage  of the secretary’s time would be on those activities that promises the greatest returns of the organization.<br/>            A focus on secretarial job efficiency shows that the success of the organization depends on how secretary manages her time in handling responsibilities coming to her in the organization, therefore a secretary who managed her time effectively in discharging her duties will attend a greater height of efficiency in any business organizations.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            The allocation of time is very important to human beings and to achieve any goal of all to make our work efficient and effective, we have to make proper adequate and appropriate use of time.<br/>            According to Obodo and Ogbu (1999), time management is the allocation of proper and adequate time to a particular task and having them done within the frame. Time as we know is very necessary in our business in particular and life in general.<br/>            Obodo and Ogbu, said that time is not only a unique resources but also a limiting factor which we cannot hire, buy o obtain as an inelastic resources, which cannot be stretched or extended, no matter how high the demand. This gives to the fact that time is a passive thing within the limit organization must make proper use of time in their working place. Workers should make use of appropriate time required to carry out orders, instructions and duties etc.<br/>            On the whole, the researcher ha seen how non challent attitude of workers and managers in other places of work has helped in no small measure in bringing about staff turn over, low profit margin etc. more often than not, some organizations have gone insolvent owing to unproportional use of time in achieving the organizations goals and objectives. The research hence forth is in dare need to find out how proper time management facilitates the work of secretary or how the reversal constraints the performance of a secretary.<br/>            In the course of this research work, the research will find out the problems and prospects of time management and proper solution where necessary.<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVE OR PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of this study is to investigate the problems of time management to the performance of secretaries. This research intend to find out<br/>(1)               The various time management techniques adopted by the performance of secretaries.<br/>(2)               The various methods the secretaries use to solve the problems of time wastage and achieve efficiency in jobs.<br/>(3)               To highlight the benefits an organization derive from effective time management and performance of the secretary.<br/>1.4       THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study investigates the problems of time management to the performance of secretaries. It reveals if it affects or enhances secretarial job productivity and efficiency in federal government owned establishments in Enugu metropolis.<br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>            In carrying out the research work, the following questions have been selected design as general guide in the research work.<br/>1.                  What are the various time management skill adopted by working secretaries.<br/>2.                  what methods do the secretaries use to solve the problems of time wastage and advance efficiency in jobs?<br/>3.                  what are the benefits an organization enjoy due to time management skills by working secretaries.<br/>4.                  what are the problems of time management in an organization.<br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            Significance of the study in context of this research refers to the importance or usefulness of the research, since the ultimate aim of every research is to provide knowledge and information that will bring about a better understanding of the topic under review.<br/>            At the beginning of this research, it was stated that the allocation of time is very important to human brings and to achieve any goal at all or to make our work efficient and effective we have to make proper adequate and appropriate use of time. Time is very necessary in our business in particular and life in general.<br/>            However, secretarial job efficiency shows that the success of organization depends on how secretary manages her time in handling responsibilities coming to her in the organization, therefore a secretary  who managed her time effectively in discharging her duties will attend a greater height of efficiency in any business organizations.<br/> <br/>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROBLEMS OF TIME MANAGEMENT TO THE PERFORMANCE SECRETARIES\r\nA CASE STUDY OF SELECTED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OWNED ESTABLISHMENTS IN ENUGU METROPOLIS\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROBLEMS OF TIME MANAGEMENT TO THE PERFORMANCE SECRETARIES\r\nA CASE STUDY OF SELECTED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OWNED ESTABLISHMENTS IN ENUGU METROPOLIS\r\n", "id": 50}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A STUDY OF EFFECTS OF FRUSTRATION ON NIGERIAN SECRETARIES<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF COAL CORPORATION, ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research project tends to scrutinize the effect of frustration on Nigerian Secretaries.

You will probably see also many people that seem quite bad. The reason is nothing but job dissatisfaction.<br/>It will not be an exaggeration to state that the origin of frustration to mankind dates as far back as the Biblical injection of Cain and Abel, since then, cases of frustration have been heard a midst school, families individuals and more especially in the working environment where I am restricting my research to.<br/>Job frustration is like a song on the lips of some Nigerian.  For Instance, if you are a worker and you have been working for the past five good months without receiving any salary or payment you will be frustrated.  The history of coal exploitation in Nigeria dates back to 1916 when mining started at the foot of the Udi Hill along Enugu escarpment Coal production from inception maintained an upward trend and reached its peak between 1955 and 1959 when at most one million metric tones of coal was produced annually.<br/>The coal industry gave rise to the first set of industries in Nigeria and provided all the energy requirements for these industries up to the late 1960’s.  These include the Nigerian railways, the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (now National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) and the Nigerian Cement Company (Nigerian). Nkalagu.<br/>The leading of coal in the Nigeria’s energy mix started to decline with the discovery of oil in commercial quality in Nigeria in the late 1950’s and was hastered by the Nigerian’s civil war which tool place between 1967 and 1970 during which period all the coal mines in the country were abandoned.<br/>There rapid development of the oil industry in Nigeria and undue Government’s attention’s on the oil sector gradually resulted in a near total reliance on oil for the country’s revenue and   energy needs since the late 1960’s and a neglect of the solid fuel coal which is an alternative energy resource.<br/>Even NEPA has consistently maintained a policy of not using coal, depending wholly on gas and fuel oil or dieses for electricity generation.  The Ijora Coal fired power station was switched from coal to fuel oil and later gas in the 1970’s while Oji River power coal fired station was shut-down permanently in 1990.  This is unlike what obtains in other countries that have most of the energy resources such a crude oil, gas, coal and uranium.  In these countries, at least 50% of their electricity is generated form coal.  It is hoped that the country will correct this imbalance in its energy mix through the on-going privatization process in the upstream energy sector.<br/>Nigerian coal corporation Enugu is a federal organization that is well known over the year as a coal manufacturing organization.  It provided employment for many Nigerians.  Despite all these, the workers also experienced frustration.  Therefore this research will focus on the effect of frustration on secretaries working in the organization.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Human beings have some ambitions to fulfill in life but where those ambitions are not fulfilled due to some circumstances it become frustration.<br/>Nigeria Coal Corporation Enugu has been facing a lot of problems, such as non-payment of salary to workers which secretaries are.  As a result of this some members of the state and outsiders engage themselves on illegal business in the organization like selling the properties of the organization.<br/>This has also lead some workers especially the secretaries to relocate jobs in another organization.<br/>To their Boss and other people around them.  And even the once that has no alternative to their problems die in object poverty or hunger.<br/>Finally, all these negative effects lead to the decline of productivity <br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study is to:<br/>1.           Identify the real causes of frustration and its effects on secretaries<br/>2.           Ascertain whether the frustration of caused by secretaries of their work environment, or<br/>3.           Highlight the problems of frustration and suggest ways to enhance job satisfaction of secretaries in Nigeria.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>(1)        What can we do to stop the causes of frustration?<br/>(2)        Which way or method is useful to quench frustration in Nigeria Coal Corporation?<br/>(3)        The workers that have been affected by this frustration, what strategies are to be to used to bring them back to life in the organization?<br/>1.5               SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is delimited to a study of effects of frustration on Secretaries in Nigeria Corporation, Enugu.<br/>1.6               SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The essence of this research is just to explore and identify the causes of frustration and how for it affects the secretary in an organization.<br/>It is therefore intended to be a useful companion to the managers whose primary junction among others is to provide the most conducive working atmosphere for their secretaries. To potential secretaries in this research work is hoped to be valuable source of reference.<br/> <br/>\n\nA STUDY OF EFFECTS OF FRUSTRATION \r\nON NIGERIAN SECRETARIES\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF COAL

was introduced in 1973 by the Federal Military Government under the auspices and direct supervision of industrial Training fund (ITF).<br/>The scheme is presently 32 years old and it is meant for technocrats.<br/>            The scheme aimed at exposing students pursuing professional courses in institutions of Higher learning under real office situation, work ethnics and methods.  Today it has covered many disciples and has become a necessary pre-requiring for the award of Higher National Diploma and Degree Certificates in specific disciplines in Institutions of Higher Learning in the country.<br/>            In 1985, the scheme was reverted to industrial Training fund (ITF) for Implementation in collaboration with National Board of Technical Education (NBTE) and National Universities commission.  Guidelines were jointly drawn up by the tripartite agencies and since then ITF has continued to ensure the success of the scheme through painstaking supervision of the activities of students in industrial attachment.<br/>            Industrial twining could be considered as the opportunity given to students in Higher Institutions to acquire experience in the area of his or her career interest in industries.  In many undergraduates programmes in Nigerian Universities, polytechnics and colleges of education, the motivation, responsibility and opportunity for insight gained through industrial training can be of inestimable value to students future.<br/>            Okoye (1992) holds that industrial training helps to develop students public relations especially those who have never worked before they were admitted into higher institutions.  The benefits that students obtain from one year industrial training such as exposure to the larger world of work, practical experience of their career and financial assailable offer additional advantage for their field.<br/>            University students of the relevant courses will have three months industrial attachment at the end of part II and part III of their respective courses.  Post graduate students are not eligible.  Polytechnics and colleges of technology students should have four months industrial attachment after their first session and then go for one year industrial training after second year.  This is duly for ordinary National Diploma students.<br/>            The main focus of the scheme could hinge on getting employers of labour involved in training their prospective employees.<br/>            Thus the scheme is aimed at promoting desired technological know how for the advancement of the nation.  The ultimate goal of the scheme is to develop a well and articulated labour force needed to build a self-reliant economy.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>The students industrial work experience scheme was established to help students gain practical experience in industry in the course of their studies.  There are problems associated with the scheme.  These include the fact that it has not run on been known type of experience students are exposed to in their industrial training.<br/>            It has not been known whether the experiences so exposed to are relevant in their prospective career.<br/>             It is not certain whether industrial training experience is responsible for some students dropping out to work instead of returning to school for higher studies.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of the study is to:<br/>1.                  find out whether students who participate in SOWES receive any practical job training.<br/>2.                  find out whether the experience gained during SIWES is useful in their future career.<br/>3.                  Determine whether SIWES help to generate a pool of indigenous trainee manpower for like federal poly Oko.<br/>4.                  Investigate whether SIWES is responsible for some students dropping to work rather than going back to school in Oko.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study will be useful to the students in tertiary institutions who are doing their OND in polytechnics and those in part II and part III in universities.<br/>In going through this study, the students in Oko will come to take industrial training serious and thereby achieving the best out of it.<br/>The head of the institutions of higher learning will come to realize the usefulness and contributions of SIWES in training students as a means of improving the qualities of skilled manpower in Nigeria.  A standard which the limited resources in the institutions cannot provides.<br/>Industries also make good use of students in industrial training for the achievement of the organizational goals all for the development of the country.<br/>The study will also make federal polytechnic Oko to totally reject any student who does not undergo industrial training before registering for Higher National diploma.<br/>            This study will also serve as a useful information to any person who wants to research on related issues.<br/>1.5              ASSUMPTIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>The following assumptions were made in the study; the assumptions were that:<br/>1.                  Students go on industrial training after first two years in school and at the completion, they go back to complete their studies.<br/>2.                  Students who gained useful experience in the industrial work experience scheme approach office work with ease on their graduation.<br/>3.                  students are thoroughly supervised while on industrial attachment.<br/>4.                  some students drop out of school after industrial work experince.<br/>5.                  students also return to school after their industrial training.<br/>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>In the process of carrying out this research work the following research questions were used to guide the researcher.<br/>            The study provide answer to the following questions:<br/>1.                  What type of practical training do students get in their SIWES?<br/>2.                  How far are the experience gained during such SIWES useful to the student future career.<br/>3.                  how does SIWES help to generate a pool of trained manpower for our indigenous organizations?<br/>4.                  what are responsible for students dropping out of school after their industrial training?<br/>1.7              DEFINITION OF

To carry out this study effectively. Five research questions were formulated. Due to the descriptive survey nature of this work both primary and secondary sources of data collection used. Data were got from the eighteen (18) senior and forty-two (42) junior secretaries that were selected from seven departments of the ministry used for the data collected the students cluster mean statistical tools were employed.  The major findings of the study were. Those secretaries performed such roles as information processing, storage and dissemination as well as assisting their bosses in administrative and personnel matters. That there are various effort played by government in uplifting the states of secretaries in the employ.  That there are various factors militating against the effective functions in the ministry. Those secretaries are not paid enough remuneration for their roles in the organization that there are views on whether the modern facilities needed by the secretaries in the organization adequate. The researcher therefore recommended that: A board should be set up to look into the immediate problem of secretaries with a view towards resolving modern equipment or machines should be provided for these secretaries most of whom should be retained as well as allowed to attend seminar and conferences to update their knowledge.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS <br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Introduction                                                                <br/>1.1       Background to the Study                              <br/>1.2       Statement of problems                         <br/>1.3       Objective of the Study                         <br/>1.4       Scope of the Study                                      <br/>1.5       Research Questions / Hypothesis            <br/>1.6       Significance of the Study                              <br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>2.1    Review of Literature                             <br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>3.0    Research Methodology                                 <br/>3.1       Research Design                                  <br/>3.2       Area of Study                                             <br/>3.3       Population of the Study                                <br/>3.4       Sample and Sampling Procedure            <br/>3.5       Instrument for Data Collection               <br/>3.6       Validity of the Instrument                     <br/>3.7       Reliability of the Instrument                  <br/>3.8       Method of Administering of Instrument   <br/>3.9       Data Analysis Technique                               <br/>3.10    Discussion Rule                                  <br/>CHAPTER FOUR    <br/>4.1       Data Presentation and Results                       <br/>4.2       Summary of Findings                           <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>5.1       Discussion Implementation and Recommendation <br/>Conclusion <br/>5.2       Conclusion                                          <br/>5.3       Implication of the Results                      <br/>5.4       Recommendation                                        <br/>5.5       Suggestions for Further Study                       <br/>5.6       Limitation of the Study                         <br/>References<br/>Appendices<br/>LIST OF TABLE <br/>Table <br/>4.1    Respondents view on the role of secretaries in an organization <br/>4.2       Opinion of respondents on the role played by the governments in up lighting the state of secretaries in the employ<br/>4.3       Views of the respondents on the factors militating against the effective performance of the secretarial functions in the ministry.<br/>4.4       Opinion of the respondents on if secretaries are remunerated enough for their roles in their organization.<br/>4.5       Respondents view on whether the modern facilities needed by the secretaries in the organization adequate.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0                   INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Generally, the office no doubt makes an important contribution to economic and social life of any nation or society.  Hence any complex industrial society would rapidly come to a stand still if the office is not there. This efficient organization must provide its management with efficient and sufficient information, planning control and financial services.  <br/>It is limit to expenditure on administrative services. If every one were engaged in office work there would be imbalances between productive activities and administration. The correct balance must be struck between the resources devoted to directly to productive activities so as to sustain rapid economic development of that nation.<br/>Little Mill Standing ford and Appleby (1986) remarked that administration is that part of the management process concerned with the institution and carrying out of procedures by which the programme is held down and communicated the progress of activities is regulated and checked against target and plans.<br/>Essentially the purpose of the office is to provide services of communication and records. This can be amplified under five headings as follows receiving information recording information giving information arranging information and safeguarding of asset.<br/>Office can make only these vital contributions if there is both efficient office services by general management and department manager. (that is the production manager, the marketing manager the secretary and others).<br/>Today the office is becoming such a complex place and more demanding that the executive finds it difficult to cope with the task. In other words she needs someone that would help her accomplish her tasks hence the need for a secretary. On the whole a secretary today is part and parcel of the executive and so is very indispensable. She is the person who assists the executive by displaying an export skill (imitative tact judgment and others) in performing her office function without close supervision by the executive. Thus she should posses the ability to relieve the executive of designated administrative detail when the need arises.<br/>The role of a secretary in office administration and management to a large extent depends on the type of office she work in the post occupied by the boss and her qualification (s). The secretary deals with the boss staff visitors and all paper works.<br/>This study is therefore an attempt to identify and analyze the role of a secretary in office administration management using ministry of finance, Enugu state as the reference point.          <br/>1.2STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Secretaries play multiple roles in any organization. They are the life wire of establishment or business outfit. By virtue of their position and the performance of their job, there exists some imminent problem. Such problems are likely to influence the role of secretaries.<br/>1.     Lack of respect and recognition to secretaries from employers of labour who look down on secretarial administration and regarded those who practice it as never-do-wells <br/>2.     Inadequate modern equipment used by secretaries hinders their efficiency and effectiveness of their jobs.<br/>3.     Secretaries are not apportioned to use or manipulate the required equipment necessary for their profession thereby making them not fit for their profession <br/>4.  Secretaries are always regarded as a professional servant to the executive<br/>5.  Some bosses use their secretaries as scope goat and dehumanize them <br/>before their visitors because such bosses  see the secretaries as supporting staff who he believed cannot stand on their own <br/>1.3  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The main purpose of this study is to identify the role of a secretary in office administration and management specifically the study intends to:<br/>1.  Find out the role of secretaries in office administration and management <br/>2.  Ascertain the   played by government in uplifting the state of secretaries in their employ<br/>3.  Determine the factors militating enough for their roles in their organization <br/>5.  Find out if modern facilities needed by secretaries in organization adequate.    <br/>1.4  SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study delved into the role of secretaries in office administration and management. It focus mainly on the ministry of finance Enugu.  <br/>1.5RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.  What are the roles of secretaries in office administration and management?<br/>2.To what extent have government at various tiers succeeded in uplifting the states of secretaries in their employ?<br/>3.  What are the factors militating against the effective performance of the secretaries function in any organization <br/>4.  To what extent have secretaries been remunerated for their role in their various organization?<br/>5.  To what extent are the facilities needed by the secretaries in the organization adequate?<br/> 1.6  SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY<br/>It is only when the result of any research is effectively used that the time and resources invested on it can be justified. Thus the result of this study would be of great importance for effective discharge of secretarial functions in all the office of ministry of finance. At least all the secretaries would be recognized hence their roles.<br/>Office administration and management is a crucial issue as no organization can function without a properly managed office. The result would extent to the public services and business houses all over the country, as the role of a secretary would be adequately known and discharge.<br/>This study would equally be of immense benefit to those students who whish to take secretarial administration as a profession.<br/>It is hoped that the result of this research would educate the general public as to who a secretary is and the importance attached to the profession. Equally it would educate the secretary in understanding more about herself her role prospects constraints and chosen profession.<br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE ROLE OF A SECRETARY IN OFFICE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF MINISTRY OF FINANCE ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF A SECRETARY IN OFFICE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF MINISTRY OF FINANCE ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECT OF INADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIAL STUDENTS OF IMT ENUGU <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            The institute of management and technology being the case of study of this write up is a great polytechnic of price among others. When this great institute was established a greater part of the management was left in the hands of Europeans, who really gave optimum management to the school affairs. This they did by equipping the created departments with enough equipment for student effective and efficient performance in the various skill courses they engaged in.<br/>            Among the departments that was really equipped then was secretarial studies department. This department was fully equipped with the necessary facilities, like typewriters, which were the major equipment of the department. The adequacy of the typewriter, that is, the ratio was a typewriter per a student irrespective of the number of student, they were able to sit each per typewriter during their skill drill. The most impressing factor among other things was the efficiency of this typewriters despite the frequency of usage.<br/>            However, as time went, the number of students offering the courses increased tremendously far above the number of these facilities.<br/>            The increased in the number of students without a commensurate increase in the number of equipment will surely have an adverse effect on the students standard of achievement and on the teachers who now have to work with inadequate tools.<br/>Educational facilities are those equipments used by both lecturers and students to make learning easy and simple. Overtime these are new inventions modernized. In order to adapt to these changes schools must introduce and teach student how to use them.<br/>            With time and technological growth, business organizations are increasing the scope of their business and consequently the duties of secretaries are increasing. Facilities are therefore needed to overcome the difficulties and ensure effective and efficient performance of their study. This is a frame of reference on which facilities are concluded.<br/>            The use of educational facilities in every school is today the driving forces for change. Man has been using facilities in one way or the other throughout the history of man’s existence on earth.<br/>            Educators at all level from the government to private school, colleges and polytechnics  as well as universities, have recognized the impact of the facilities on business/offices and have had the foresight not only to recommend but in many instances to require that student’s planning to enter the business world at any level, and in any capacity should be exposed to the study and possible manipulation of these facilities as that would enhance their chances in life.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>            The department of secretarial studies of I.M.T., Enugu was established in 1973, and ever to produce competent and high qualified secretaries to handle secretarial function various offices.<br/>            This department unlike other department of the school can be said to be a practical department which needs equipment and facilities more than only other department in the school. These aids which make it easier for systematic training, acquiring knowledge and abilities as well as developing character and mental powers are indispensable in secretarial department.<br/>            Over this years however there had been an increase in student intake into the department.  Also overtime these facilities have become old, obsolete and out-dated. With the advent of modern technology ands changes in offices equipment and systems, one then wonders whether the department is able to maintain required standards. How prepared is the department to meet current needs of the modern office? Do they have the necessary facilities electronic typewriters, computers, modern communication gadgets, etc, which they should be using in training. These and many more are what this research topic seek address.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY/OBJECTIVE <br/>            For every action, these must be reason and in the light of this, the main purpose of our study is to find out and x-ray the causes and effects of educational facilities on the academic performance of secretarial students. Other purpose are:<br/>1.         To know whether the department of secretarial studies has adequate educational facilities to train their students.<br/>2.         To know what are the causes if the answer to number 1 is in the negative such inadequacies.<br/>3.         To know what efforts have been made to provide these facilities to these department.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY/IMPORTANCE <br/>            This project is written to serve the beginning and advanced secretarial students. It will provide them with a basic understanding of what they should know, how they can use facilities in their professional endeavour. This study covers these requirements to equip students to know how to communicate their needs and requirements to the data processing personnel in their organizations.<br/>            It is also beneficial to lecturers, hence it will lessen their burden in lecturing the students and at the same time improve their knowledge and ability to mental power. Also to the department and management, hence they will be proud. They can be recommend their student secretaries to any company or offices with no doubt of poor performance. Hence the good name come to them.<br/>            To the parents and general public, in that their job will be done by experts who are training with modern equipment/facilities and will not feel strange to any modern machine in the organization.<br/>            The Nation also will benefit from these for the graduates will be of great use and can redress the economic situation of the country<br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.         What are the modern educational facilities required by the department of secretarial studies.<br/>2.         Why is the department lacking these facilities equipment?<br/>3.         Is the department really in need of those facilities?<br/>4.         Are these facilities available in other departments of the school?<br/>5.         Is the school management aware that such things are lacking for the lacking of this department?<br/>6.         Who is responsible for the lacking of this department or the school management?<br/>7.         How does this set back the academic performances of the students?<br/>8.         Is the public also affected by this problem of poor?<br/>9.         What efforts has been made to provide this to this department?<br/>10.       What are the possible solutions to be taken into consideration to achieve a good result?<br/>11.       How would the public and students benefit from this, if a good result is achieved?<br/>          <br/>\n\nEFFECT OF INADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIAL STUDENTS OF IMT ENUGU <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF INADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIAL STUDENTS OF IMT ENUGU ", "id": 54}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN THIS MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL ERA<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED ESTABLISHMENTS IN ENUGU STATE)<br/>ABSTRACT   </b>                                <br/>High productivity is the pursuit if every public corporation. To allow for this, it is therefore necessary that the organization should tackle all the problems that could hinder the objective, purpose, growth and target for which the organization was established. This project therefore, is undertaken to give actual background on the problems that affect secretaries on their jobs, their prospects, the need to tackle these problems and the effect of these problems on secretarial productivity. According to the study, these problems could lead to under utilization of secretaries, dissatisfaction with their jobs and lower productivity. Using observation, interview and questionnaire methods, it was found out that the secretaries were also affected with poor promotional morale, lack of adequate motivation, lack of modern equipment and poor conditions of employment compared with their counterparts.  Also discussed were the prospects of secretaries in public corporations. The major findings was that there is poor promotional prospect in the secretarial profession. However, the appraisal of secretarial profession should be advocated because it will avail the organization the opportunity of proper utilization of the secretaries. The secretaries will be willing to put in their best on the job thereby enhancing productivity.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction                                                <br/>1.1        Background of the Study                              <br/>1.2        Statement of the Study                                <br/>1.3        Purpose of the Study                           <br/>1.4        Significance of the Study                              <br/>1.5        Research Questions                                     <br/>Reference                                                          <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Review of Literature                                     <br/>2.1        Introduction                                                <br/>2.2        The Problems of Nigeria Secretaries       <br/>2.3        Prospects of Nigerian Secretaries           <br/>2.4        The Current Problems and Prospects <br/>of Secretaries in Public Corporations<br/>2.5        Summary of Related Literature      <br/>Reference                                                          <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1        Introduction                                        <br/>3.2        Research Design                          <br/>3.3        Population of the Study                        <br/>3.4        Sample and Sampling Technique    <br/>3.5        Sources of Data                          <br/>3.6        Questionnaire Design and allocation<br/>3.7        Method of Data Collection             <br/>3.8        Method of Data Analysis                       <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0    Presentation and Analysis of Data  <br/>4.1        Introduction                                        <br/>4.2        Data Analysis                                              <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0        Summary of Findings, Recommendations<br/> and Conclusions                                 <br/>5.1        Discussion of Findings                           <br/>5.2        Summary of findings                            <br/>5.3        Conclusions                                        <br/>5.4        Recommendations                                       <br/>5.5        Limitations of the Study                                <br/>5.6        Suggestions for Further Studies                     <br/>References                                                 <br/>Appendix                                                            <br/>                                         CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>        Secretaries as seen in the secretarial world and business organizations today, are faced with many problems and also have some prospects.<br/>        A secretary according to Hornby (2001), “is an employee in an office who deals with correspondence, keeps records, makes arrangements and appointments for a particular member of the staff”<br/>        The American Secretarial Association defined a secretary in the most acceptable way as – “an assistant to an executive, possessing a mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who displays initiative, exercises judgment and makes decisions within the scope of assigned authority.”<br/>        A secretary    can also be defined as a person who maintains a high standard of confidentiality and a repository of information. Infact, there are numerous definitions of the word secretary as far as there are many authors. With the above definition in mind, one can easily see that the need for a secretary in any corporation cannot be overemphasized.<br/>        A secretary is a major communicating link between the executive ad his associates, the office staff and the public. As a result of this important linking position, a secretary can play a vital role in helping to create and maintain a smooth running business office. Thus a secretary seen as the bedrock and image-image of any business organization.<br/>        For a secretary to perform her functions efficiently and effectively, she must have undergone some educational training and obtained the basic office knowledge and skills to be efficient and effective on the job. A secretary is quite different from a clerk, a typist and other office workers.<br/>        However, for one to qualify as a secretary, she must have taken courses in shorthand, typewriting, office practice, secretarial duties and must be fairly computer literate for easy adaptation in modern offices.  <br/>        Shorthand and typewriting are the key working tools of a secretary and it is expected that any person who aspires to take up any secretarial post must have passed typewriting ad shorthand within the following speed range – 25-100 words per minute, 80-120 words per minute in typewriting and shorthand respectively.<br/>        It is not uncommon to see people who have only passed typewriting at any of the recognized speeds without shorthand or those that have typewriting and shorthand skills are referred to as secretaries. These categories of secretaries are not qualified secretaries.<br/>        Some of the certificates recognized  in our business organizations and of course our corporation for secretaries are – Royal Society of Arts Certificate, Pitman Certificate, Federal Technical College certificates, national Diploma certificate all in Secretarial field obtained in the Polytechnics, and Colleges of Technology. Bordus Diploma of Mc Cann Erickson Advertising once said, “professional training on a good secretarial course is the basic requirement for the would-be top secretary”. It will help her perform her duties efficiently and effectively.<br/>        A close look at some selected public corporations like the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Nigerian Telecommunications (NITEL) and National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) revealed a lot of problems and prospects of the secretarial profession. For instance, in Nigeria Telecommunications (NITEL), Enugu, the corporation stride towards meeting subscribers’ expectations has always bee made impossible by some of those problems inherent in the organization.<br/>        In an attempt to remedy the problems in the organization, the Federal Government as well as the management of the corporation has introduced a lot of innovations for the effective functioning of the corporation. The former Post and Telecommunication (P &amp; T) and the Nigerian External Telecommunication (NET) were incorporated into one department on January 1, 1985 and by June 1985, the department was split into NITEL and NIPOST  (Nigerian Postal Services).<br/>        The Nigerian Railway Corporation is one of the many corporations owned fully and controlled by the Government of Nigeria. Hence, it is a public corporation, which is meant to provide adequate transportation through the rail system for the growing population of the country, to assist the commercial growth by carrying goods from the interiors to the urban cities. The Nigerian Railway Corporation can be traced back to the early colonial masters who ruled the country. The corporation was set up for profit purposes or social benefits of the population. A study into the Nigerian Railway Corporation shows a lot of irregularities. The organization has put in more efforts to improve its services both to workers and customers.<br/>        The other training corporation stressed on the impact of modern technology on their secretaries. The services of the secretarial profession are utilized by various organizations. Those in the secretarial profession work directly with the management of these organizations as support staff and they help in realizing effectively the missions and objectives of the organizations. Most of these objectives are geared towards resource management, which shows in the production, distribution and utilization of goods and services.<br/>        Today therefore, technology has become the centre point of the secretary’s performance. The role of secretaries in the highly automated   industries tends to become that of monitoring, maintaining and adjusting the equipment involved in the production process. Generally, in this era, those in the secretarial profession do not actually work on the product directly, rather, they maintain and monitor the equipment and records of operations. Those in the secretarial profession have tender opportunities to interact socially since the number of people with whom interaction may occur has been reduced and replaced by machine. The availability and the use of those modern technologies have led to increase in the job interest of secretaries. There is efficiency in production also; there is maximization of profits in organizations.<br/>        This immediate point is the prospect of the secretarial profession. In view of all these facts, the problems and prospects of the secretarial profession in these selected establishments are critically investigated in this study.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>        The invention of computers (word processors) into the business and academic sectors which secretarial profession is not an exception, has exposed the secretary to acquisition of modern skills necessary to improve on the secretarial challenges.<br/>        Storage facilities have been reduced to a small compact called disk. How reliable this medium of storage is, is still a mirage to the secretary. A file can remain as long as a secretary or an organization wants it to last.<br/>        The use of intercommunications, audio-recording equipment and the likes has alienated the secretary from her boss that the interpersonal relationship which she used to enjoyed, is virtually not there. In this isolated situation, how can the secretary morally cope with the present day challenges?<br/>Many other professions where major improvements were made in their scheme affects their “nomenclature” or the nature of their professions but that of the secretary, till date, has not experienced any change to reflect her present status with that of the computer. Old “nomenclature” and the nature of their profession still remain and in use.<br/>It is the purpose of this work, by the time it is completed, to make absolute recommendations and bring to light the challenges and prospects of the secretary in the present day dispensation.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The purpose of this study is to find out the problems facing the secretarial profession and their prospects in relation to their job on selected establishments in Enugu State and make recommendations.<br/>The study specifically, aimed at:<br/>1.     Identifying the problems and prospects of the secretarial profession in the following establishments;<br/>a.     Nigerian Telecommunications (NITEL)<br/>b.     Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC)<br/>c.      Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN)<br/>2.     Determining the cause of those problems, which affect the secretarial profession in these establishments?<br/>3.     Highlight the prospects of secretarial profession in a growing economy.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        It is hoped that this study will reveal the problems that the secretarial profession battles with and it will go a way in finding ways of improving the performance of the profession which will lead to increased productivity and enhanced prospects. The study will give more light on the major causes of these problems and then highlight what the employer should do to eliminate most of them in order to motivate the secretary towards achieving the corporation’s goals. <br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.     How could inadequate training and under utilization of secretarial staff pose problems to any establishment?<br/>2.     How could lack of modern equipment and unfriendly attitude of the boss cause problems to a secretary?<br/>3.     Do you think that the use of modern equipment and proper motivation can improve the productivity and prospects of the secretary?<br/>4.     Do you think that inability of the government and private employer’s of labour to reviewed the secretarial status affects the secretarial output?<br/>    <br/>\n\nTHE CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN\r\nTHIS MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL ERA\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED \r\nESTABLISHMENTS IN ENUGU STATE)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN\r\nTHIS MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL ERA\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED \r\nESTABLISHMENTS IN ENUGU STATE)\r\n", "id": 55}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A STUDY OF THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF STRESS ON SECRETARY’S JOB PERFORMANCE IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS IN ENUGU URBAN<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE PLC ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The purpose of this work was to find out the effects of stress on the secretary’s job performance.<br/>            A questionnaire was drawn up with which data were collected.

The three most significant stressors identified were lack of adequate equipment and sufficient working materials and equipment, strenuous human relations in the work place and the lack of necessary qualifications.<br/>            Recommendations were however made that adequate training of the secretary physically and mentally should be proved among others.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction                                                                           <br/>1.1              Background of the study                                                       <br/>1.2              Statement of the Problem                                                                  <br/>1.3              Purpose of the Study                                                             <br/>1.4              Significance of the Study                                                                  <br/>1.5              Scope/Limitations of Study                                                   <br/>1.6              Research Questions                                                                <br/>1.7              Definition of Terms                                                               <br/>CHAPTER TWO     <br/>Review of Literature                                                              <br/>2.1              The Concept of Stress                                                <br/>2.2              Types of Stress                                                                       <br/>2.3              Causes of Stress                                                                     <br/>2.4              Effects of Stress in Achievement of Organizational Goal    <br/>2.5              Measure to Curb Stress on the Job                                        <br/>2.6              Summary of Review of Literature                                         <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Research methodology and design                                        <br/>3.1              Area of the Study                                                                  <br/>3.2              Population of the Study                                                         <br/>3.3              Sample                                                                                   <br/>3.4              Sources of Data Collection                                        <br/>3.5              Research Instrument                                                  <br/>3.6              Validity of the Instrument Used                                           <br/>3.7              Administration and Collection of Questionnaires     <br/>3.8              Method of Data Analysis                                                      <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1              Analysis and Interpretation of Data                          <br/>4.2              Findings                                                                                 <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.1              Introduction                                                                                       <br/>5.2              Summary of Findings                                                            <br/>5.3              Conclusion                                                                                         <br/>5.4              Recommendation                                                                               <br/>Reference                                                                                           <br/>Appendix                                                                                           <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            A stress encountered by secretaries in the field of their job in business organizations is a lot to write home about.  Stress can be defined as the non specific reaction of the body to the demand made on it by external or internal stimulus events called stressors stress as emotional process has psychological and physiological implications said Han Seyle (1964).<br/>            According to Teachers Rigorously checked stress” is said to be pressure, condition, causing hardship and disquiet etc. Some business organizations in Enugu urban has made life mis-enable for some secretaries working in them, due to their inability to provide one thing or the other for them. Many professional secretaries experience conflicts because of work in the office and family activities waiting demands upon their time. Conflicts occur because the person want to devote adequate attention to both for family and office work.<br/>            The causes of this stress emanate from poor conduct of the so called “manager’s who do forget that the secretary is the heart beat of an organization”. Before any form or organization attain their aim, their secret must be kept and for this to be done the secretary in particular must be involved.<br/>            The roles and functions of the secretary are basic to the organization, these range from covering meetings, taking care of all office routine duties, keeping schedules in both hers and her boss’s desk diaries for complete and effective job performance up to date and supervising sub-ordinates as well as keeping other general information in the office. In the organization, she is also important to the organization because of her ability to remain clam under extra-ordinary condition of work pressures and human demands.<br/>            The work of secretaries are stressful in the since that they are the head and eye of the organization. Sometimes secretaries feel like back sliding because of the work fully packed for them and there is no time to tackle all these jobs, and upon that the manager will be shouting on them to hurry up, and as the secretary looks around and finds no help stress arises. In any event, extremely stressful situation, such as lack of sleep or physical torture bring about lack of interest to work and unhappiness while working.<br/>            As I mentioned before that the secretary is the heart beat of any organization, so organizations should sit up to make life meaningful for the secretaries working in them to achieve their aims.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM      <br/>            Stress comes as a result of over working oneself. Over work may emanate from the manager of an organization or the secretary her self. A situation where the manager fail to recruit more workers in the organization, this will generate very many stressful condition for the secretaries working in them, running healter scleter from pillar to post which may lead to frustrations, tension and anxiety and as a result of this implicate her to various forms of problems.<br/>            The secretary herself causes stress in her job, as  a result of her inability to schedule her time according to her engagements ie using her limited time to cover a lot of things.<br/>            Hence the sources of stress has been measured, is now left for both managers and secretaries to come together and share their time according to their engagements in other to curb stress on that job.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The major purpose of this study is to find out the causes and effects of stress on secretary’s job in Enugu urban business organization performance specifically, the study seeks to:<br/>1.                  Find out causes of stress on the secretary.<br/>2.                  Identify effects of stress on secretary’s job performance.<br/>3.                  Ascertain problems arising from secretary’s stress on the achievement of organizational goal.<br/>4.                  Find out measures to curb stress on the job.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The research will be of importance to the society, it will be useful to professional secretaries. It is hoped that after some findings of this work, the secretary will be in a better position to find out causes stress and avoid them whenever possible and control their effects on her performance. This should lend to a better job performance.<br/>            Ignorance of how to treat a secretary in order to get her best performances may be one of the reason why the secretary is subjected to stressful conditions at the place of work.  It is hoped that after going through this work, the boss will be better informed as to handle a secretary to get maximum performance from her.<br/>            Sometimes, professional secretary trainers are hopelessly out to conduct with what is required of secretary at the place of work so that training programmes are not up to what they should be. This will help trainers to identity vital training areas on which to lay emphasis and from time to time improve on facilities to meet with modern office procedures.<br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>            The following research questions were formulated to guide this research study.<br/>1.                  What factors causes stress in the secretary’s job environment?<br/>2.                  To what extent does stress affect the job performance of the secretary?<br/>3.                  How does stress effect the organizational goal?<br/>4.                  How do we curb stress on secretary’s job?<br/>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>STRESS:         is said to be pressure, condition causing hardship and disquiet; stress is the state the secretary’s disposition when she hard been affected by a stressor.<br/>STRESSOR: Is any factor in the environment of work that effects the secretary’s job performance.<br/>

poor office environment on the secretary’s job performance.<br/>            Institute of Management and Technology was used as a case study.  The data for this study was collected through the use of questionnaire and observation methods.  The administered questionnaire were analyzed in tabular forms using simple percentages.  The outcome of the study proved that the depressing and stimulating

adequate comfort and balance to discharge their duties effectively and efficiently.  Other problems included poor remunerations, lack of necessary equipment and noise proof devices in most of the offices.  Based on these findings the researcher recommended that:<br/>i.          Offices should be stimulating and comfortably furnished so as to encouraged productivity and boast the moral of the secretary.<br/>ii.         There should be enough floor space and if possible separate rooms to avoid over crowding and cluster of materials which make an office to look shabby and

OF THE STUDY<br/>            The work of a secretary is very delicate and confidential and as such a healthy office environment is necessary to enable her discharge her duties efficiently.  An understanding of the office environment in the enhancement of a secretary’s morale vis-à-vis her job performance is necessary in every organization.<br/>            Generally, office environment has serious impact on the job performance of workers.  The office and its appearance, condition of work, materials available and their location, safety measures medical care, relationship among the members of staff and the boss remunerations and other social welfare recognized to the main elements of work or office environment which directly related to workers moral and willingness to discharge their duties effectively.<br/>            The secretary is an indispensable staff and as such management has to place high priority on how best to motivate her.  The nature of work environment invariable has direct effect on the morale and state of health of a secretary, hence her general performance in the discharge of her duties.<br/>            The office environment thus influences the volume and quality of work, interest and happiness of a secretary.<br/>            Office environment in the context of management has been defined the include, office building and layout, furniture and equipment the physical conditions  under which the secretary operates – lighting, heating, ventilation, decoration, sound proof measure, safety measures and such social conditions as relationship with members of staff and boss remuneration and welfare package etc.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            Generally, it is believed that when an environment is not conducive, a worker cannot discharge his/her responsibilities as efficiently and effectively as expected.  In effect the fundamental duties of a secretary are highly prejudiced and jeopardize by an averse and unstimulating environment.<br/>            Today, there are many problems encountered b secretaries resulting from poor work environment which greatly affect their job performances.   Amongst these is lack of private office.  Secretaries most times share offices with other staff, some of which lack basic amenities befitting her status. <br/>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study is meant to investigate the following:<br/>-           The effects of a depressing and unstimulating nature of the office environment on the secretary’s job performance.<br/>-           The effect of small floor space and congested office surroundings on the secretary’s job performance vis-à-vis her attitudes to work.<br/>-           The effect of absence of some basic amenities such as air conditioners, fan, executives seats and tables on the moral of a secretary and her general attitude to work.<br/>-           Other problems in the office environment militating against effective job performance of secretaries.<br/>-           Recommend how best to improve the office environment for the smooth operation of secretaries if it has any serious effects on their job performance.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The study will in particular benefit the present and picture career secretaries whose welfare is being agitated.  It is hoped that management will consider some of the recommendations proffered in this treatise and improve the office conditions of secretaries so that they will have cause to smile.<br/>            Management on its own will benefit form the study since it will enable them to understand the job performance of their secretaries and try to boost their moral by improving the condition of the work environment.<br/>            Finally, this research will help to reduce the dearth of literature in this field of study.<br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>i.          Does the depressing and unstimulating nature of most office environment have negative effects on the job performance of secretary.<br/>ii.         Does the small floor space and the congested nature of an office affect the secretary’s attitude to work?<br/>iii.        Does lack of air-conditioners and floor covering in secretaries offices have effects on their job performance(s).<br/>iv.        Are there adequate and regular remuneration to the secretaries?<br/>v.         To what extent does the secretary relate with other staff in the office.<br/>            Attempts shall be made to find solutions to these research questions in this research.<br/>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>            This refers to the physical and social working conditions under which secretaries work, comprising office buildings, ventilation, lighting, heating, decorations, furnishing, relationship of staff in the office, remunerations, etc.<br/>JOB PERFORMANCE<br/>            This is the productivity or output achieved by the secretary.  It is also the quality or quantity of work which should be attained by the secretary on a certain job.  The job performance is found in appraisal and training, to assess a secretary either in her work or after training.<br/>SECRETARY<br/>            This can be defined as somebody who has a unique ability to keep secret information also has a special quality to communicate with different classes of people and the communication channel between her organization and the public as a whole.<br/>            Also, she has an understanding of the significance of typing documents, taking shorthand, correspondence, reports and instructions which pass through their head, relieving the executive of work, which otherwise she would have to do it with their initiative.<br/>   <br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF POOR OFFICE ENVIRONMENT ON THE SECRETARY'S JOB PERFORMANCE.\r\nA CASE STUDY OF THE I.M.T ENUGU\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn

work environment are only confide to scribing shorthand and hitting the typewriter. It was equally perceived that secretary’s role in the office is related to women’s role in the family. Hence the application of these two related adages ”the women place is in the kitchen”<br/>            Coincidentally, development and technological in Nigeria in particular and the world as a whole has come into play by reforming these wrong perceptions. Just as women are fighting for women liberation, secretaries have gotten numerous qualitative recognition attributable to the significant roles they play in organizations in which they find themselves.<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>            The word “secretary” is derived from the Latin word “secretaries” which means something that is known to one person or few persons but hidden from the views of others. In other words, it means secret. A secretarial staff is an officer with professional qualifications of a secretary and is equipped with the knowledge of general secretarial practice embodied mainly on shorthand and typewriting.<br/>            But in recent time, secretaries are looked down upon on the employment list. They are regarded as ‘YES SIR” clique and no wonder their highest level in any ministerial establishment does not extend beyond grade level 13. This bad attitude towards secretarial staff has succeeded in debarring some new entrants into the profession and as such half baked ones arose to take the position, hence they know how to hit the typewriter. This bad impression about the roles of a secretary was clearly manifested in the case of Barnett Hoaves and company vs South London Tramway when Lord Esher (1887) noted that “a secretary is a mere servant, his position was to do what he was asked to do and no person can assume that he has any authority to represent anything at all.<br/>            The researcher in the course of this study will trace the role of a secretary in an organization as it pertains to public relations. It will compare the role of today’s secretary with that of the yester years because according to Lord Denning (1971) in the case between Panoroma Development Ltd Vs Fidelis Furnishing Fabrics, he ruled “… but times have changed. A secretary is a much more important person nowadays than she was in 1887. She is an administrative officer of the company. As regards matters concerning administrative in my judgement, the secretary has ostensibly authority to sign contracts on behalf of the company.  Furthermore, if a company is hiring cars to meet its foreign customers at the airport, nothing to my mind is more important than that the company would hire these cars through its secretary”.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            Over the years, the significant roles of secretaries have relegated to the background. That is to say, secretaries are known to be working behind the scene. They are wrongly perceived to be those group in an employment list who are keenly interested in taking orders from the boss and complying to such instructions sheepishly without applying their own natural sense, training or professional initiatives.<br/>            Moreso, most employers have the impression that everyone who is a secretary has the same kind of job description. In fact, they fail to understand that secretarial work covers a whole collection of tasks often involving quite contrasting skills. The fact that most secretaries start off with training based on common techniques, such as shorthand, typing and office procedures, frequently distinguished the completely different directions in which secretarial work develop.<br/>            The term “SECRETARY” has come to be used far too loosely. Many junior typists, who are more or less like “mango –tree” typists like to think themselves secretaries. It also flatters young managers, who are seeking to build up their importance to refer to the typist who prepares their letters and reports, as their secretary, all in an effort to boost their ego. No wonder Eleanor et al (1980) p.d in his book tried to distinguish these defects in people’s perception of the role of secretaries with what it is supposed to be. He maintained that “The true secretary, however, should have not only have highly competent manual skills but an understanding of organizational and administration capacity for obtaining result through people on behalf of her manager or managers.<br/>            However, those wrong perceptions or belittling of secretary’s role in organizations have caused an immeasurable harm to secretarial profession by dissuading some young men and women who might have had some interest in taking secretaryship as a profession.<br/>            Furthermore, many have complained of undynamic nature of secretarial job. By this, the researcher means that routine job of a secretary has made people to believe that she usually sit tight in the office no movement at all. She comes first to the office and will be the last to leave.

It can be defined as process of stimulating people to action in order to achieve the desired goal. It is a synthesis of how employees think and feels about their job, their working condition, their supervisor, their organization and their fellow workers. <br/>            A closer look at the Guaranty Trust Bank Ogui road Enugu reveals  a lot of punctualities and good working attitude among the employees. The work attitude of employees of Guaranty Trust bank is so much desirable. The organization strives towards meeting customers expectations. The study is based on the hierarchy of need theory developed by Abraham Maslow starting in ascending order of importance. The basic need are the physiological need, security or safety needs, affliction or acceptance, esteem or self actualization. Motivation generally is the overall provision of those individual needs that spared them to enter into an organization. Such need as the need for higher pay, a prestigious title in an office and host of other things that give people a reason to perform<br/>            Robert C. Apple, by his book “ Modern business administration “ defines Motivation as the way urges, aspiration drive and need of human beings are directed and explain their behaviour. According to him, motivation may simply be described as keenness for a particular pattern in behaviour <br/>            Harchet (1989) said that motivation is understanding the needs or urges which prompt people to do things and provide a way of helping them satisfy these through the organization while at the same time harnessing contribution to satisfy the organizational needs. The foundational principle of the need theory are that until the basic  need are satisfy in the degree necessary to maintain life other needs would not motivate people <br/>            Motivation vary with individual, some people would be reasonably satisfied with a level of motivation while another person will be inadequate. <br/>            Motivation of employees in essence increase their morals, thereby leading to the company’s high productivity. <br/>1.2              STATEEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Presently, our country Nigeria is going through economic crisis, companies and factories are being closed down, others are just able to keep their hands above waters. Inspite of these economic tumult, it is astonishing to see a company in our environment waving from strength to strength, increasing its productivity capacity and ability from year to year. Such a company is the Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB). It is a well known fact that the productivity or service of any company or group is tied to the amount of motivation which the workers receive. <br/>It is very perplexing that Guaranty Trust Bank is waxing from strength to strength  in the same environment where other companies are nearing extinction  as a result of economic crisis. This is the crux of the matter which this study is to crack <br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>-                      The purpose of this study is to investigate the techniques used by Guaranty Trust Bank  Ogui Road Enugu in motivating their workers. <br/>-                      To find out how effective the techniques are <br/>-                      To examine the motivating methods <br/>-                      To find the extent motivation has contributed to the organizational peace. <br/>-                      To find out how lack of proper motivation can hinder an organization in carrying out his objective <br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The findings of this study would be useful to the employers in other business sector, as a guide to the formulation of policies relating to workers welfare. It would help them formulate strategies that improve the welfare of their workers there making them more productive <br/>The study when completed would also be of importance to allied writers and researchers so that they will realize the importance of motivation in an organization and how it helps to improve the productivity of workers <br/>Finally, it will be of assistance to the government in formulating and periodically reviewing other various policies and plans especially as it affects workers in Nigeria. <br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>The following are the question which this research work seeks to find answers to.<br/>-                      Does fringe benefits acts a motivator to workers? <br/>-                      Which is better motivator, material incentive or non-material incentive? <br/>-                      Are motivated workers better workers than non motivated workers <br/>-                      Can introducing better incentive package increase productivity in an industry <br/>-                      Is the use of motivation a better way to increase productivity that other system like stricter supervision of workers <br/>      <br/>\n\nMOTIVATION AS AN INSTRUNMENT FOR ACHIEVEMENT OF HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF GIRRANTY TRUST BANK, ENUGU, ENUGU STATE) \r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MOTIVATION AS AN INSTRUNMENT FOR ACHIEVEMENT OF HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF GIRRANTY TRUST BANK, ENUGU, ENUGU STATE) \r\n", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE IMPACT OF THE “INTERNET ON SECRETARIAL PROFESSION <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            The whole universe include our country, are so much on the brink of this immense technology. It has gotten a far reaching effect on almost all human endeavour.<br/>            Most people understood what impact, the modern technology, (INTERNET) is playing to address the issue of performance on the secretarial profession in this new era.<br/>            Truly, most learned and talented scholars have commented so much on this topic. But the researchers of this project work, have tried to portray in a special way, the impact of the internet with regards to the performance of the secretarial profession.<br/>            The internet is a specific collaboration of independently managed networks that allow its users at disparate heterogeneous computer net works to communicate with each other across organization and geographical boundaries. Its main function in any social system may be identified as information, education, entertainers, integration, discussion and communication. Therefore, the internet as a super high way in collecting and accessing of information, has been arouse to perform all these immeasurable impact for the rest of the world.<br/>            To be precise, one cannot talk about information and access, without making regular reference to the information technologies and its convergence, that is the internet. This information and communication technologies are rapidly changing the ways are work and live, most especially with regards to the way the office is been handled. We see a world of networks that is bringing new opportunities and options to people at work, at home and on the more directly stating how our society live, work, play, learn and how the involves.<br/>            In secretarial profession, information and communication are the very essence, and that is what internet is all about. Information values are been derive from an entity whom data is assign to it, therefore, becomes a commodity and indeed the lifeblood of every activity that is performed in an organization.<br/>            Stressing more on the meaning of the internet and how it works, the April 10, 2002, issue of “Awake” magazine describe the internet as a global collection of many different types of computers and computer networks that are linked together. The question now is, how far can this form of inexhaustible, resource carry the users with special internet in the secretarial profession.<br/>            More over, in this profession, people who are more acquainted and conversant with the services that the personal computer renders, will no doubt, find the internet fascinating jobs made easy and enjoyable. And people who are financial incapacitated and are unable to acquire this precious super high way information gathers what risk are involved, whoa re supposed to use this inexhaustible resource?<br/>            The aim of this study is to know more in the impact of internet on information and communication in secretarial profession.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>            Generally, people think that the internet has no impact on secretarial profession, it is also their believe that secretaries have no need for the internet at all, rather, they say that secretaries prefer using typewriter in carrying out their duties their than the internet that secretaries including internet in their profession, makes their works to be hectic. In view of this, so many scholars have the same opinion that internet is of no use to secretarial profession. According to Plato, the internet is used by high senior officials and those trained personnel and as much, secretaries do not fit into that cadre. While Ford Walter, in his own stressed that the primary duties of a secretary is to note down the minutes of meetings, take down records and as well carrying out orders from the authorities and it involves the use of the typewriter”. Also, this was design to know, whether internet facilities is a monotonous task to secretaries and whether it is of any impact to individual secretaries and their lives.<br/>            For this and many more reasons, we have decided to look into this and carry out a research work to find out whether it is true that this internet is of no importance to secretarial profession, and as well find out the actual impact the internet has to secretarial profession.<br/>THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY          <br/>            In view of the above problems earlier stated, this research work is therefore designed as follows:<br/>(a)                To look and find out the impact of internet in the secretarial profession.<br/>(b)               To ascertain if there are problems being caused by the internet in secretarial profession.<br/>(c)                To know actual, impact of the internet in the lives of individual secretaries.<br/>(d)               To ascertain if the use of internet facilities is a monotonous task to the secretary.<br/>(e)                To provide remedies and solution to such problems.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY  <br/>            The geographical area covered by the researchers is Enugu metropolis.

In spite of the high demand for secretaries in the labour market, it could be observed that secretaries do not get adequate remuneration and other incentives such as training and promotion like their counterparts in other profession.<br/>Qualified secretaries often express disappointment in their profession because they feel that the public are unaware of the breadth and depth of their training and their significance which are indications that they seem not to be recognized.<br/>It is the under-utilization of personal secretaries that course them not to be promoted to the senior managerial position.  But it is doubtful if any organization can function effectively without the services of secretaries who are the image makers of the organization.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM:<br/>Over these years, there has been serious misconception about secretaries by the public and others who are not in the profession.  Some look down upon them as Secretarial Assistant II (typists and stenographers) who wait and work according to the wishes of the boss.  Others look at them as Subordinates who cannot actually act even when there is the need for them to do so unless with authority from the superior.  All these have been the problems facing them.  People take them as the inferior ones in an organization because they can never be the boss in that organization no matter their levels.  In the labour market, the secretary must, of a necessity, go beyond what is normally regarded as her duties event into the personal affairs of her boss.  For instance, going to the bank to withdraw money for the boss, serving him tea when he wants, sweeping the office if the cleaner did not come on time and this can even lead the boss to demand for self satisfaction from the secretary.  All these have been the problems facing the secretaries in an organization.<br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>This study is aimed at finding out the status of secretaries and their perceived role in establishments.  It is also aimed at investigating whether secretaries are needed more than their counterparts, and whether their remuneration is commensurate with their duties.<br/>The researchers are also delving into this topic to find out whether or not secretaries are allowed to take part in managerial function and whether they are seen as robots (wheel operators) that take and obey instructions without complaint.<br/>It is also the intention of the researchers to find out whether secretaries leave the profession to other professions and problem that militate against their effectiveness and productivity in the office.<br/>Finally, the finding will ensure uniformity in grading workers according to their qualification and merit if implemented.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The finding of this study will be of great help to many people.  Student in the secretarial professions will expose them to the actual place of the secretary in the labour market and her perceived role.<br/>The findings of the study will also correct the misconception on the part of the public regarding secretaries as typists or stenographers.  It will also give the undergraduate secretaries an insight into what their prospects will be or the completion of their course, it will expose the worth of secretaries in the business world.<br/>Moreover, the research work will help bosses to determine the quality and output of those they have in their employ or those they intend to employ.  It will also enable them to know the importance of motivation and commensurate benefits to secretaries.<br/>Finally, the finding will ensure uniformity in grading workers according to the qualification and merits if implemented.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:<br/>This study is on the status and impact of the secretary in the labour market.  It is restricted to the secretaries only for the purpose of thorough study, using some organization in Enugu North L.G.A. Enugu State as the case study.   It is hoped that whatever results obtained would be assumed to be applicable generally.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE STATUS AND IMPACT OF THE SECRETARY IN THE LABOUR MARKET (A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED ORGANIZATIONS IN ENUGU NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF ENUGU STATE)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE STATUS AND IMPACT OF THE SECRETARY IN THE LABOUR MARKET (A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED ORGANIZATIONS IN ENUGU NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF ENUGU STATE)", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEMS OF RECORDS MANAGEMENT IN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY ENUGU<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            Record management is the making use, control and disposition of records. So that the system works efficiently and economically.<br/>            Business organizations, government ministry, educational institutions and social institutions depend upon records for their existence. There are several problems that stand in the way of achieving an efficient and effective records management in institution of higher learning.<br/>            In view of this, the researcher decided to identify some of these problems of records management in institute of management and technology in Enugu state.<br/>            The main instrument of this study was questionnaire, administered on a sample size of one hundred and fifty respondents chosen from  these institutions. From the information gotten, the researcher concluded that given all other factors, the problems of records management in institution of higher learning are<br/>            Absence of well define records management policy or practice; the problems encountered in handling records or mails and inadequate storage space and equipment, the problems encountered in retrieval of disposal of records.<br/>            By these findings, the researcher gave some recommendations that may enhance records management practice and assets in offering solution to the above problems which are keeping of records retention policy of the institution by the institutions. Secondly, an efficient and effective records management department should  be maintained so that records would be properly kept and handled. Also, inactive files or records should be kept in an inactive area or achieves as it costs less than keeping them among the active records. There should be periodic training and education for personnel in the records management unit of the institution. Records management personnel should made to have abroad background in business and a training information area to enable them cope with the expanding needs of business.

Business organizations, government ministries, Educational Institution and social institutions depends upon information for the existence.  In the modern business offices in Nigeria, contracts, letters, memoranda, invoice, cheques, vouchers, price lists, catalogues, cost analysis statements,  personnel reports constitutes records that have to be preserved for future references. <br/>            Also, Educational institutes keeps records of their students names, address and even results of examinations taken either passed or failed, letters, transcript, reports, particulars of students.<br/>            All these records should be kept in the most appropriate and convenient methods to fasten their retrieval when needed. All sorts of records are recovered by the institution working day.<br/>            There is no doubts that if these records are not properly taken care of, the whole records office space will be flooded with papers and there will be no working space kept. This situation will then give rise to problems in records management. Records management ensures that important documents of the institution are retained and protected against damage, loss and unqualified assessments. Un-important and useless ones should be destroyed or discarded. Hence (Thelma 1990), the main purpose of record management is to eliminate papers that are temporary useless without delay and to identify and protect important documents of the institution.<br/>            In every institution today, the key question asked are; What type of records should be kept? How long should it be kept? What is the mode of their destruction? This project therefore will try to proffer answers to these problems.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>            Record keeping in higher institution has many problems which should be considered and solutions proffered. These problems are seen in the keeping, arranging and preparation of these records. The rate at which paper work accumulates every working day throws many heads into confusion as to how to deal with them.<br/>            Experience has shown that owing to inefficiency in the practice of records management, higher institutions find it very difficult to make decisions as and at when appropriate.<br/>            The problems of records management includes<br/>a.       Absence of well-defined record management practice or policy. This is a big problems to institution of higher learning. This policy is supposed to be adopted by institutions and  strictly followed (Lucy 1989)<br/>b.      Lack of storage space and equipment. When these records are not properly stored, it results t misplacement and loss of some essential documents. Moreover, most institutions have problems in records management because they do not find it necessary to train personnel in the areas of records management (Todd 1986)<br/>c.       Other problems are encountered in handling mails, delay in giving of documents, problems in retrieved and disposal of records.

From the above definition, secretaries are indispensable in business organization both small and large organizations. <br/>Unfortunately, the role of a secretary especially in Nigeria is not quite understood by most people.  It therefore, follows that most of the problems confronting the secretarial profession are as a result of misconception by people.  People don’t seem to understand what secretarial profession entails.<br/>Consequently, the married female secretaries in the profession always faced with numerous problems.<br/>The problems encountered by married female secretaries are numerous and are ranged from their homes, their jobs and from people with whom they work and transact business with.  Other hurdles they faced are those bearing labels such as sexual harassment, job stress and office politics.  The greatest conflicts which married female secretaries has to live within their day-to-day activities is marrying their official duties with their domestic affairs.<br/>In the same vain, married female secretaries also faced with some positive problems such as expecting them to exhibit a sense of responsibility show a sign of maturity, loyalty and reliability in the performance of their duties.<br/>A secretary is that person in an organization who deals with the correspondences, keeps accounts, keeps records and in addition, arranges appointments for her executives.  The nature of secretarial work is such that a certain degree of confidence and rapport must exist between her and her boss and this may lead to a social suspicion in such a relationship and this may trigger matrimonial hassles.<br/>In the same vain, a secretary is required to have administrative ability to keep an office running smoothly, insight to assign priorities and judgment to know when to issue orders in the boss’s name.  They conserve the boss’s time by screening telephone calls, visitors and the mail.<br/>Moreso, a secretary is that person who has undergone some training in secretarial courses and has acquired good speed in shorthand and typewriting and knowledge of secretarial duties, office practice and English language.  In addition, she should have a full measure of common sense and unfailing memory.<br/>Furthermore, a personal assistant or secretary means any person that works for another in the company no matter what she does have.  Secretary could be a typist or it could be a full blown personal assistant or administrative officer.  No one can say that they are secretaries without doing certain tasks regardless of whether they have got the qualification or not.<br/>A senior executive in a large Syndey based company defined secretary as an “appendage” of the boss.<br/>The boss secretary relationship is the subject of rumour and gossip and a secretary may either save or destroy their bosses.<br/>Consequently, a word processing assistant portrayed as the extension of her boss loyal trustworthy and devoted.  She is expected to have honour and obey, relieving her boss of the routine and the trial, creating the condition for his detachment from the mundane rituals of everyday life.  She is the gate keeper, protecting her boss from those who would waste his time and went to know his private business, meditating his relationship with the outside world.<br/>In the same vein, a secretary is a kind of co-partner with the employer.  It is the duty of a secretary to save the boss a great deal of detail and as much routine work as you can.  Think for him and anticipate his needs, learn his preferences and obey them even if you do not always agree with his ideals.  Assume that he is always right.<br/>She should be a person who is on the conservative side of dressing simple and neat.  Secretaries are the center of attraction all the time in the office, for both the employer and the callers.<br/>Always be a person who save the management and create the pre-conditions for their bosses advancement.  Most of the pressure of the job is in the sense of being close to the center of power, participating in decision making, having confidential knowledge, having power to act on behalf of the boss.<br/>When a person has successfully undergone training as a word processor, or secretary, such a person is then vested with some responsibilities like copying typed word production of official document like letters, news, reports, he or she also cleans and maintains the word processor as well as the general orderliness of the offices.<br/>STATMEENT OF THE PROBLEM:<br/> PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of the study include:<br/>1.                  To identify the reasons why some employers prefer unmarried female secretaries?<br/>2.                  To find out whether the official duties of the married female secretaries prevent them from paying proper attention to their families.<br/>3.                  To find out whether the husbands of these secretaries interfere with their wives’ job.<br/>4.                  To find out whether marriage on the part of the female secretaries plays any part in the secretary/boss relationship.<br/>5.                  To find out whether unmarried female secretaries have more changes of advancement on the job than the married ones.<br/>6.                  To find out whether married female secretaries divulge official secrets.<br/>7.                  Finally, to offer suggestion on how a married female secretaries can successfully combine her official duties with her domestic affairs to avoid conflicts.<br/>RESEACH QUESITON:<br/>The study shall have a look into the following research questions;<br/>1.                  Do organizations consider marital status in their employment policy?<br/>2.                  Do married female secretaries have equal change of recognition with their unmarried female counterparts.<br/>3.                  Does the secretarial work expressly affect the private lives of married female secretaries?<br/>4.                  Are female secretaries treated as inferior to their male counterparts?<br/>5.                  do married female secretaries divulge official secrets.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The investigation will no doubt help both married and unmarried female secretaries to tackle their problems successfully.<br/>It will also help to allay the fears of those involving to go into the secretarial profession.  This study will also offer more areas that students may wish to make further research of the problems encountered by the married female secretaries.<br/>This study will help to improve the chances of advancement of the female married secretaries.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:<br/>This study is designed to study some six parastatals in Enugu metropolis.  <br/>In order to have a fair representation, the following have been randomly chosen:<br/>1.                  National Electric Power Authority<br/>2.                  Nigerian

It is obvious to everybody, that the work of a secretary is very delicate and confidential, and as such, a healthy environment is necessary enable the secretary operates effectively.    <br/>A secretary whose office is equipped with communication gadgets as telephones, fax etc cooling gadgets, as fans, air conditions, fridge etc including execrative upholstery chairs and table is therefore regarded as an extra senior service worker by her unfortunate colleagues who unknowingly or out of ignorance does not know that hey deserve more than mentioned above for maximum productivity but rather retard progress thereby constitution a cry in the wheel of progress of such as establishment. <br/>An understanding of effect of office environment in enhancing the secretary’s morals is necessary in every organization, he/she is an indispensable staff and as such, management should place high priority on work motivation. This influences the amount of work, interest and happens  of secretaries. <br/>The provision of adequate and proper physical conditions in the office cannot be over emphasized.  Secretaries tend to be happier when hey work in a quiet, cool and inspiring environment, but hey are unhappy and suffers from mental strain when the physical conditions are poor or inadequate. <br/>Physical conditions refer to those things in the office that enable workers to work for periods without fatigue and distraction, so that work can be carried out effectively and efficiently. <br/>It should be bone in mind that most office work is as the accounts clerks job of putting figures together or the secretary’s job and others. <br/>However, the increasing sophistication of modern office machines and self awareness towards the maintenance of a more co-operate image have resulted in management looking more critically at the environment of secretaries work place “in encyclopedia”.<br/>The term secretary is derived from a Latin word “secrtarum” which means a confidential office. He is one ot whom secrets are entrusted and he has to maintain secrecy of the work he deals with.<br/>According to Act, 1980. sec 2 (45) states that a secretary means “one whose office is to write for another; especially one who is employed to conduct correspondence, to keep records and to transactrarions other business for another person or for a society, corporation or public body.” <br/>“Environment” in the management context consists of office building the furniture and layout, the physical conditions under which secretaries operate, lighting, ventilation, decoration, sound, proof, safety measure and so on. The influence of work environment on secretaries has become so recognized that management now calls it science of “ergonomics”. <br/>Experience has shown that secretaries cannot be happy if the ventilation is poor. Work is likely to suffer and in accuracy would result if the lighting is poor. The noise from machine and visitors constitute a barrier to a secretary’s efficiency. Example of an ideal office should be measured with that of the secretary to director Nigeria Bottling Company Plc Enugu. All these have strong bearing on the secretary morale and work productivity.<br/>The promulgation of the office, shops and railways premises Act of 1963, is a milestone in the advancement of good working condition. Management therefore has duty of providing a comfortable environment which is pleasure and conducive. <br/>1.2              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is  meant to investigate the following.<br/>The effect of the depressing and unstimulating nature of the office on the morals and productivity of the secretary.<br/>The effect of he physical factors such as office surroundings on the secretary’s morals to work.<br/>The importance of providing a good proper working environment for the secretary.<br/>The problems caused by lack of these good physical condition on the secretary productivity.<br/>Finally, to see to what extent the office environment affect the concentration of the secretary. <br/>1.3              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The secretary no doubt occupies a very important position in an organization and her inability to discharge her duties very well have an adverse effect on the image of the organization.<br/>Also a secretary’s moral boosted by the type of environment she works in. therefore, for a secretary to be able to perform her duties efficiently and effectively, she should be provided with a pleasant and conducive environment to work in.<br/>Presently, there are many problems encountered by secretaries with regards to their environment, and other facts like poor physical conditions in an office, lack of private office. <br/>Secretaries in business organization share offices with other staff. Sometimes, where one is lucky to be assigned any, there is always no privacy. <br/>In some organization, a secretary may be lucky to have a private office, but that office will be an entrance to his / her boss’s office. <br/>The study is to investigate the effect of poor conditions and lack of offices, how it affects the productivity of the secretary and find ways of enhancing her productivity. <br/>1.4              SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>A lot of organizations are now aware that secretaries need to be settled comfortably in order to ensure high productivity in the organization.<br/>Much has been said and written about he best way to ensure secretary’s high job performance and many people have argued that those secretaries have to be adequately motivated in order to ensure effective job performance on their part. <br/>They outlined such motivational incentives as increase in salaries and wages, priorison of certain social amenities such as free medical facilities, ensuring effective job performance among the secretaries and workers in general. All those motivational incentives no debt facilitates high job performance among secretaries, but it depends on the environmental factors affecting the organization.<br/>The study therefore, be of immense value to the management of Nigeria Bottling Company and PZ Company Services as well as other organizations and also to the secretaries at large, especially those who do not recognize that he environment under which the organization operate will in any way affect their performance.<br/>1.5              SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY <br/>Some organization do not realize that the environment under which their business operation has anything to do with the secretary’ job performance. Their belief is that only the motivational incentives administered adequately will confluence the secretary’s job performance. <br/>This study will benefit management readers or the staff counterparts responsible for improving secretarial service operations by helping them using the items. <br/>A management can usually benefit by holding all aspects service system operations up to standard. <br/>It will also benefit future secretaries of Nigeria Bottling Company (NBC). It hoped that the management will improve the office conditions of the secretaries, so that the secretary will have cause to smile broadly and improve in their productivity. <br/>For other employers of labour, this should help them to know better how their work will fit into a production environment, and the environmental considerations that should be studied when planning for personnel includes the physical element of lighting and the whole subject of design.<br/>The result help to establish a realistic / service having a guide to management responsibilities as a background for analysis. <br/>This study will benefit both the management and secretaries to improve their productivity<br/>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>1)                  Does the depressing and unstimulating nature of the office have negative effect on the morale and productivity of the secretaries? <br/>2)                  Does the small floor space and the congested nature of the office affect the secretary’s morale and attitude to work.<br/>3)                  What effect do  air conditions and floor covering in most offices of the secretaries moral and work productivity? <br/>4)                  What effect do lighting and ventilation have on the morals and productivity of the secretaries.<br/>5)                  How does the relationship between the boss, others and the secretary affects the secretary’s environment. <br/>1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>SECRETARY: A secretary is the image make of any organization for without a secretary, an organization is incomplete. <br/>According to Barrister N. A. Obodo 1998 He defined secretary as an executive assistance who secretary as an executive assistance who possesses the mastery of skills, who demonstrate ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who exercise initiative and judgment, who make decision within the scope of assigned authority. <br/>In enclopedea, the term secretary is derived from a Latin word “secreterum” which means a confidential officer. He is one to whom secrets are entrusted and he has to maintain secrecy of the work he deals with. <br/>OFFICE: In every well organized business there is the need for the record of its activities to be kept and protected. It is the office that such activities are carried out and its records kept. <br/>The term “office” was defined firstly by Geoffery Whitehead, as a room or building where clerical processes are carried out to start, develop and control the many activities of business. Ronald Warson et al, defined the office as “the place where information is received sorted, acted upon, file and passed on”.<br/>OFFICE ENVIRONMENT: Environment consists of the office building, its furniture and layout as well as the physical conditions under which workers do the jobs, it is also concerned with the external factors as the business which the office services, the industry or other activities within which business lies, the custom and laws of the community within which business operates. These environment factors are always changing and the office must react to change with them.<br/>When we are talking about office environment, we talk bout physical things in an environment.

Today, it has become of vital importance that a study be carried out critically, taking the public and private secondary and commercial schools into consideration to draw a comprise at their different students performance in shorthand.<br/>            This performance of students is a far cry based on the expected success of institutions of these kinds or nature.  A lot of reasons has been adduced for this inspite of the preparediness of teachers of those schools to deliver.  Some of the students absent themselves from schools for a long time.  This affects their performance because they have lost touch of the essence of regular practice and continuity in shorthand studies.<br/>            Secondly, the students do not avail themselves with the use of books white suppose to enhance their performance this is further caused by poor reading habit of some of them and loads of domestic work which their parents engaged them in.<br/>            In educational background that effect the public and private schools students in shorthand, it effect public schools students performance in shorthand very poor in the instance that public cannot know how to read and write shorthand faster because they are not interested on the shorthand and some of teacher that is taking them do not know it in a work place you can see that for advertisement of secretary’s many of them are required commercials schools students rather secondary schools students, but in private schools students performance they perform very well in shorthand  work is very easy for them to get, example institutions of higher learning and university some are not doing shorthand because it is very expensive to learn.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The subject, shorthand is one of the major subject taught in comprehensive secondary and commercial secondary schools in both public and private institutions.  As a result, it constitute a big obstacle to the success of the students.  There is the persistent problem of high failure rate and attrition in shorthand classes.<br/>            Like mathematics, it is expected to have particular method and special problem among other things.  It is on the realization of this problem that the researcher compared the performance of the students in the school system in the subject.<br/>1.3              OBJECTIVE OS THE STUDY<br/>The researcher primary purpose of embarking on the study.<br/>1.                  to investigate into the students performance in shorthand of private and public secondary schools.<br/>2.                  to compare their degree of academic excellence in the subject.<br/>3.                  to make recommendation for future improvement in the teaching and learning, of shorthand.<br/>1.4              IMPORTANCE / SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is significant in the sense that it aims at comparing the academic performance in shorthand of both private and public secondary schools students in Enugu educational zone, Enugu state of Nigeria.<br/>            The study may also enable educational planners to find out problems hindering excellent academic performane in shorthand and also, help find lashing solutions to the problems that contribute to the students failure in shorthand in secondary schools.  It will also, help to improve performance in the subject and create more positive attitude to it, on the side of students and populace.<br/>            The study also will be of help to subsequent researchers that may be interested in doing more work in this area of study with the aim of improving any performance in the subject.<br/>            And again, it will help to disabuse the mind of male folks in studying the subject by comprehending that none of the fainders of shorthand is a woman and therefore the subject is not for a particular sex.<br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.                  Do private schools students perform better than public schools students

These aim can easily be achieved through the use of high technology in the office. The over all operation of a secretary’s naturally involve a tremendous  amount of paper shuffing and record keeping, accounting procedures for payrolls, financial reports, invoices etc. in all integral parts of the Nigerian industries.<br/>Office methods and services are daily getting complex and the volume of materials and information to be handled are daily increasing and the reaction or response and time expected of the secretary is now shorter than it has been in the recent past. There is therefore the need for office administrator which include the secretary, to cope with the increasing quantity and quality of services required as a result modern equipment are rapidly spreading of Nigeria industries.<br/>Prior to the present information revolution called information age, most of the jobs performed by secretary’s in office are manually carried out. Consequent upon this, most outputs and services were of very how standard.<br/>Moreover, a great deal of time, money, energy and materials were lost in the course of producing one unit of an output. According to Stonick (1989) the workload was enormous and the staffing for the sake of economy, was as small as possible. The clerk a sort of combination photocopier, secretary and accountant, had too much to do, and time of the work was laborious, dull and time consuming.<br/>During the 19th century industrial revolution of Europe and that of America, many equipments were produced which possess the ability to perform most of the functions previously performed by man not only were the machines found to be capable of performing similar functions previously performed by man, they were found to be able to our-perform man quantitatively and qualitatively. Following this discovering the years a lot of improvement and innovation have been introduced to enhance and facilitate the secretary’s job. Various machines have been developed and introduced into the offices.<br/>Notable among them are<br/>1.            Computer<br/>2.            Telephone<br/>3.            Facsimile machines<br/>4.            Tele printers<br/>5.            Telex machines<br/>6.            thought tank machines<br/>7.            Tape call-maker<br/>8.             Intercom (PABX) facilities<br/>9.            Internet network.<br/>During the industrial revolution, the secretary achieved a ‘cog’ status, in that he had to work with these machines and was in real sense, part of the machines. But with communication equipment the secretary has been able to liberate himself from the status. His duties are now defined<br/>(a).      To control the mechanism<br/>(b)       To feed information and instructions into machines, through cards, tapes and to stand by for mechanical break that might probably not come.<br/>Office communications could only take place by the use of some of the modern office machines as communications is the process of creating, transmitting and interpreting ideas, facts, opinions and feelings. These new innovation brought a lot of changes to the secretary’s work in terms of memos, reports and the skill of communication, for instance giving instructions, interviewing e.t.c.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>The problem of this study is to gain information about the effects of the latest communication on secretary’s profession. In offices, secretaries are employed to perform secretarial function exclusively. In most case, these secretaries are deficient in the operations of these communication equipments. Thus it is caused by lack of adequate training on how to operate the machines. Moreover cost of purchasing the machines are exorbitantly high and cost of training is also high. This poses a great problem to the existing offices in the establishment and this research work will n its preceding chapters expatiate comprehensively on the problem.<br/>The latest communication office equipment are very indispensable and especially now that almost every office had gone technologically. The industries wishing to stand to survive the test of time are embracing every facts of the necessary automation.<br/>The basic motivation for communication office equipment arose out of the following desires<br/>1.            To increase productivity of labour <br/>2.            To improve quality of service<br/>3.            The need for decency: The communication office equipments makes the office environment decent.<br/>4.            And competition, which is one of the Chief, pressing reason for automation.<br/>In spite of the good things about these machines. It is observed that many offices have not installed the machines for their secretaries. What must have been the caused for his neglect? Would it be that they are not aware of the advantages of those machine that they lack the technical know how or that they do not deem the knowledge of the existence of the machines necessary. This study therefore tends to explore the possibilities of exposing to office under study to the benefits of the latest communication office equipment on secretary profession and investigate the needs and implications of office automation in establishments.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>For each work done, there must be a purpose or rather an objectives to justify  the work. The purpose of this study are:     <br/>(1)          To identify the latest communication office equipment that are of vital importance in the office and to the secretary particular.<br/>(2)          To consider the effect of the latest communication office equipment in a secretary’s profession.<br/>(3)          To evaluate the level of awareness of Nigeria secretaries on the existence and use of these facilities.<br/>(4)          To highlight the important and uses of the latest communication office equipment and how they increases productivity. This is with the view to making the management see the need of acquiring those that are not available in the establishment. <br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This piece of work is significant because it exposes the needs of the latest communication office equipment and create better awareness of the implication of automating office function.<br/>            The findings will among other things help: -<br/>1.            To dispose of the superstitution belief that the latest communication office equipment are the greatest enemy of men as it displaces man from the job, deny him of initiative in his job, and makes him a more machines operators and destroy old division of labour. <br/>2.            In determine the disadvantages of the non-availability of these equipments on secretary’s profession.<br/>3.            Potential secretaries to set up efforts to undertake some training on the operation of communication office equipment.<br/>4.            The establishment in applying various methods of operation.<br/>5.            In condition to academics in polytechnics and universities.<br/>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study covered the operations of secretaries in Nigeria Breweries Enugu branch, comprises of six department which are personnel management, accounts/finance department, data processing department, maintenance department, sales/marketing department and payroll department.<br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>(a)          Do the latest communication office equipment embark the integration of computer and sophisticated office equipment to support the activities of the work place.<br/>(b)          How does it help in facilitating the job performance of secretary in your establishment.<br/>(c)          Do secretaries derive job satisfaction from the use of these equipment.<br/>(d)          Do you have the latest communication office equipment in your establishment.<br/>(e)          Were the secretaries during orientation course and training exposed to the these equipment. <br/>(f)           Are these equipment display secretary’s efforts thereby resulting to loss of the secretarial personnel inn the establishment.<br/>    <br/>\n\nTHE LATEST COMMUNICATION OFFICE EQUIPMENT AND THEIR EFFECT ON SECRETARIES PROFESSION\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NIGERIAN BREWERIES PLC (NB) ENUGU\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE LATEST COMMUNICATION OFFICE EQUIPMENT AND THEIR EFFECT ON SECRETARIES PROFESSION\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NIGERIAN BREWERIES PLC (NB) ENUGU\r\n", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF MANAGERS LEADERSHIP STYLE ON THE SECRETARIES PRODUCTVITY IN ANAMMCO.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This research study was undertaken to investigate “The effects of the managers leadership style on the secretaries productivity in ANAMMCO.<br/>            The population consist of all secretaries with ordinary National Diploma (OND) and Higher National Diploma (HND) certificates.

The productivity of any organization can be enhanced by the leadership styles of the managers. The productivity of the secretary who is an integral part of the entire organization system is also affected by her/his managers leadership style to the extent she is affected because she or her work directly with the manager.<br/>            A leader can be seen as one occupies the highest position in an organization, influencing his subordinates to achieve group objectives in a given situation. This is to say that the leadership style is vested on a leader. According to Nwosu (1996:64) leadership is a managerial; ability to accomplish group goals by working with the secretary who is sometimes referred to as a partner to the boss.<br/>            Effective leadership seeks to give directions to the efforts of ill workers in achieving the goals of the organization. According to Akpaka (1990:228) goal as effective leadership organization would be composed of uncoordinated group of people lacking unity and direction. It is effective leadership that entails how well the organization tasks are carried out.<br/>            Leadership style represents the various approaches through which leadership goals and objectives are accomplished. Leadership style of the situation demands. The style must depend on the prevailing situation or circumstance. According to Nwosu (1996:66), no manager has aimed up of the styles of leadership exclusively. This means that the styles are manipulated by mangers to match with a fully situation at any point in time. The leadership style adopted by a manager determines the relationship that exists between him and the secretary and level extend of motivation of the secretary ad level of productivity. Bekwe (1981:28) saw leadership style as a major factor in the motivation of an employee.  A good leadership style gains secretaries commitment to work and elicits good behaviors towards increased productivity. Conversely, a bad leadership style constitutes unwholesome working environment and a poor relationship between the secretary and the manager thereby resulting in poor performance and low productivity.<br/>            This research is therefore an attempt to unveil the effect of leadership style of managers on the secretary’s productivity in ANAMMCO. However, the relationship between the secretary and the manager is such that the secretary serves as his representative, a partner, memory and is a link between the manager and public. She aids in fulfilling the  part of the plans allocated to her or him and expected to willing cooperate in any way which will promote the success of the organization.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            The leadership style adopted by the manager of ANAMMCO affects the productivity of his secretaries either negative or positively. A secretary can be frustrated, de-motivated, or otherwise by her/his manager’s leadership style.<br/>            Some managers leadership style tends to reduce the status of the secretary to a mere sedentary typist who carries out instructions without at least giving the opportunity to think her views as regards matters that direct affected her as a worker. The problems in this research work is to find out the effects of the manager’s leadership style on the secretaries productivity.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the manager’s leadership style on the productivity of the secretaries in ANAMMCO which among other things include<br/>i.                    To identify the leadership style adopted by the managers<br/>ii.                  To find out the factors responsible for the type of leadership style adopted by managers.<br/>iii.                To determine whether organization influences managers leadership style<br/>iv.                To proffer suggestions on the findings of the study.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This research study would highlight the various leadership styles of managers and its effects on the secretaries productivity and the responses of such attitude by secretaries. It is also hoped that this project will reveal the best leadership style to be adopted by the managers of ANAMMCO to enhance efficient and effective productivity of the secretaries.<br/>            The school (Institute of Management and Technology Enugu) will equally benefits from this work because it will give it an idea of the best leadership style to be adopted and also serve as a reference materials in the school library.<br/>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study only covers the managers and secretaries of various department of ANAMMCO.<br/>            The department include<br/>Purchasing department<br/>Advertising department<br/>Personnel department<br/>Sales department<br/>Marketing department<br/>Production department<br/>Accounts department<br/>1.6

business organis actions especially commercial Banks depend mainly on the contribution of personal secretaries.<br/>            According to the National secretaries Association of the united States of America, a secretary is defined as executive assistant who possesses a mastery of office skills, demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, exercises initiative and judgement and makes decision with the scope of assigned authority.<br/>            From the above definition it can be argued that a secretary is the pillar on which any business is erected.  It is vital at this stage to differentiate between a secretary and a stenographer vis-à-vis a typist.<br/>            However the Dictionary of occupation took a stenographer to a person who takes dictation in shorthand and correspondence, reports and other matters, and trans cribes dictated materials using typewrite, and also performs a variety of clerical duties” a typist is one who types correspondences and may or may not be a shorthand write.<br/>            The duty  of a secretary among other things is to assist the executive and this clearly shows the importance of the office of the secretary to a level extant the operational success Banks in Enugu Urbain depends.<br/>            The operational success first Bank in Enugu Urbain is among other firms struggling for proficient continuity in business.  There goods cannot be achieved if there are no able hands to handle the mails, keep records, take dictation, and receive visitors or  customers who come for business negotiations.  In the office operational success of the firms largely depends on secretaries because of the vitalts of the functions.<br/>            The history of the secretaries profession could be traced to the industrial revolution which gave rise to record keeping.  Further researchers were conducted and there gave rise to the act of typing, and as time went on there arose the need to employ somebody who will take up these important secretarial functions.<br/>            John Harnson and Marcon Leishman (1989 a personal secretary as one who is responsible for the general running of an office and has an important role for the form.  In receiving callers, handly telephone calles and communicating with clients duing the course of any work in the office.  She uses her own intiature to act when her boss is away and a lot of other duties essenlos for the survival.<br/>            This project, however invertigaliet the contribution of secretaries to the operational success first Bank in Enugu Ubain.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Secretaryship in this part of the world is underrated because people believe that the profession is for unintelligent people and anybody that uses the typewriter and takes dictation is a secretary thereby the duties of a secretary does not go beyond typing and taking dictation and she is seen as having little or no contribution to make towards the operational success Banks in Enugu ubain.<br/>            Secondly, lack of private office has been a problem that has affected the contribution of a personal secretary especially in the case of open general office, the noise of the other employees cannot allow the secretary to be effective in carrying out her duties.<br/>Thirdly, it has not been possible to determine the duties of a personal secretary form that of a clerk who can take down dictation in shorthand and type it out into a mailable capy and also efficiency and effectiveness of a personal secretary has not been will determined.<br/>            In the study therefore, the researcher attempted to find out the contributions of personal secretaries to the operational success of the first Banks in Enugu Ubain.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The main purpose of the study is to Delaware the contribution of personal secretaries to the operational success of the first Bank Plc.  Enugu.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The finds of the students will be useful to does education in the training of secretaries in Nigeria.  The finds of the students, will be useful also be useful to service secretarial in Enugu state.  Because it will enable them operat the magnitude of the functions.  Training secretaries will fine the result of this study very helpful in training the school to the operations as the role.<br/>1.5              ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY<br/>The researcher assumes that if personal secretaries are provided with conducive work environment they would contribute to the success of commercial Banks.  It is assume that if the roles of secretaries are importment to the operational and success of the bank, they will be motivated in doing that.<br/>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study.<br/>1.                  What roles do secretaries perform in first bank Plc.<br/>2.                  How far are the secretaries capable of performing those roles in first bank plc?<br/>3.                  To what do the roles contribute to the operational success of first Bank plc.  Enugu?<br/>4.                  What problems do secretaries encounter performing those functions in first bank Plc.<br/>5.                  What recommendations in better ways secretaries would contribute to the operational success of first bank plc.<br/>   <br/>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PERSONAL SECRETARIES TO THE OPERATIONAL SUCCESS OF THE FIRST BANK

It is also an experience that is becoming common or rather already common with students dispatched for their industrial training scheme. But we know that a large part of this problem can be traced back to the lack of adequate secretarial training facilities in our higher institutions. It is not a hidden truth that most of our higher institutions are not what they ought to be in the sense that they lack the variety of equipment they need to up to – date models of the equipment they need. <br/>            No doubt, this lack has affected the production of secretaries that is why this project work wants to look at these shortcomings their effects and people reaction to them. Now, when we talk about producing a secretary, a is different from a typist. If we are going to produce a secretary, the facilities or equipment required will be very much different and advanced than that required to produce a typist. It is, however unfortunate today that if one goes to some of our institutions of higher learning, he will discover that the totality of the facilities left to the disposal of the or the students look more like than it looks likes that of secretaries. A secretary is an executive assistant who possess a mastery of office skills, who demonstrate the ability to assume responsibilities without direct supervision, who exercises initiative and judgement and who make decision within the scope of assigned authority –NATIONAL SECRETARIES ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.<br/>            It when we have a knowledge of who the secretary is that we can assess the type of training. The secretary needs a good knowledge of general education, good knowledge of short hand, typewriting, office practice and administration, business law, law and practice of meeting, human resources management, accounting, data processing, industrial psychology, human relations, economies and a foreign language.  <br/>            For shorthand, the students need good shorthand laboratories equipped with ear phones cassette players and recorder etc. for typewriting, they need good and modern typewriters ranging horn manual typewriters, electron/electronic typewriters to computers. This is to mention but a few looking at all the facilities needed for effective secretarial training without which you cannot produce a secretary. The students don’t need to hear about office equipment with their ears only but need to know how to operate them practically in view of the fact that the secretarial profession is a practical one. For more emphasis, if we re talking about filing, the students must have been able to file documents. By definition  some students don’t known how these equipments look like until they meet them in the organization they find themselves out there in the labour market; and what do you think, the effects will be numerous. <br/>            When students don’t know what to do, they do what they know. With the consistent standard of the various examination bodies like the National University Council (NUC), National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), the students seek means of maneuvering their ways to pass. More of the after mart includes unemployment, incompetence, termination of appointments, loss of confidence, loss of reputation for certificate etc. <br/>            It is therefore the believe of the researcher that this research work will enlighten, educate as well as serve as a role model for production of first class secretaries from our universities and polytechnics. <br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>This research which will be carried out in the Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu in 2002/2004 will study the effects of lack of adequate secretarial training facilities an the production of secretaries.<br/>The problems are quiet enormous. The secretary produced will be half backed, in competent, inefficient and ineffective. With the increasing miniaturization in information technology which is increasingly being employed by most organization, secretary that was trained with out-dated facilities will non be able to she will be both stranded and frustrated finding herself in a completely electronic office. <br/>The co-ordinations of the various activities are and information of the organization, which forms a large part of the secretaries’ responsibility, is central to the profitability of the organization. This failing will mean the business /organization failing. Operating with the knowledge of out dated equipments have made her also outdated because she will be lagging behind in processing organizational information marking her inefficient and ineffective.<br/>The consequence of the above will be firing of the said secretary thus leaving him/her unemployed. Many to these graduates who have suffered the some fate in higher institutions will be bounced at the pre-employment interview which will make the unemployment problem more severe. <br/>The above will in turn study tells on our society will suffer some social vices without results from idleness, the idleness of the unemployed. The society reposed some confidence in the organization but when the organization cannot deliver because the secretary cannot deliver, these is loss f confidence in the organization and the business is bound to loose its customer to competing firms.<br/>The quality of education an individual acquires form part of his personality. But as long as modern information, communication and secretarial function is concerned, such ill-trained secretary has acquired half –baked knowledge. <br/>To carry out this study, secretarial staff and the Nigeria higher Institutions will be studied precisely those of IMT and data collected will be analyzed using percentages. <br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is very essential because lack of adequate secretarial training facilities effect the quality of secretaries produce from our higher institutions and once it is so, the individual i.e. the secretary is already affects, secretaries are going to work and then also affect the economy and society in general. This is so because of the enormous taste the secretary performs, it is that will is central to the progress of the organization and the contributions of the various organizations in the society forms a large part if not the totality of the economy. And if people go to spend years in the universities and come out to become unemployed because they don’t know the job, obviously idleness will degenerate to various social vices. On  the other the society will better if we have meaningful, responsible, educated and well trained secretaries. There will be less unemployment and reduced social vices. Furthermore, the society which deals will the organizations can actually have good confidence in the service the organization renders. <br/>The motto of the University of Nigeria is “to restore the dignity of man”. The institution believes in restoring the dignity of man through the rigorous discipline of the academia. So implementing this study will mean better citizen and better secretaries, all thing things being equal.<br/>To the organizations, its aims and objectives will met and this will mean increase turn over for such organizations. The same thing applies to the economy.<br/> The purpose drain of this study is as follows: -<br/>1.                      To find out the required adequate secretaries training facilities for students of higher institution. <br/>2.                      To uncover the lack of adequate secretarial training facilities by institutions of higher learning. <br/>3.                      To points out the importance or role of these facilities in production of secretaries. <br/>4.                      To find out the effect the lack of these facilities have on our students today.<br/>5.                      To make recommendations on the production of secretaries through the provision of adequate secretarial training facilities and to draw conclusion.<br/>1.4              SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study will be limited to the department of secretarial studies in the Institute of Management and Technology, (IMT), Enugu. And the results will be used to relate to other secretarial training institutes not only nationally but also globally. Since the facilities need to produce a secretary here is the same facility needed to produce a secretary anywhere in the world and lack of such facilities will produce similar effect any where in the world. <br/>1.5              DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>The following terms used in this study should be taken to mean: <br/>Adequate: Satisfactory in quantity or quality <br/>Secretarial training: The process of teaching or preparing someone to become a secretary. <br/>Facilities: Prices of equipments and systems used to prepare people as secretaries.<br/>Production: the action of manufacturing or growing of things or people for a particular purpose <br/>Effects: Results or outcome <br/>Incompetent: Not having or slowing the necessary skills or qualification to do something successfully. <br/>Inefficient: The failure of an individual or organization to make the best use of the available time and researches<br/>Invective: Not producing the required effect or result;<br/>Productive: The measure of the ability of an individual of organization to make good use of available resources in relation to the amount produced.<br/>Skill: The ability, experience and knowledge to be able to do something well. <br/>Fatigue: A feeling of being extremely tired, usually because of hard work. <br/>Telephone Technique: A system of talking to someone else perhaps over a long distance using wires and radios.<br/>A Partner card: Is a data processing card on which on single microfilm frame can be mounted. <br/>Microfiche (pronounced microfiche): Is a transparent sheet of film containing multiple rows of micro images.<br/>Microform: The format is which microfilm is stored.<br/>Microfilm: A photographic film used to record documents, prohibited pages, drawing etc in a reduced size.<br/>Switchboard: The central part of a telephone system used by an organization.

It is the life wire and the key to success of all business organizations.<br/>            Communication involves everybody, it is the pivot upon which the existence of human and business organizations revolves, and based on this, the issue of communication has developed into a major area of study and formidable social force.<br/>            Eyre (1983), stated that “communication is not just the giving information, it is the giving of understandable information, it is the giving of understanding the message”.<br/>            Bernard (1938), saw communication as “the means by which people are linked together in an organization to achieve a common goal”. When there is a link between people towards achieving a common goal there is communication. In a business organization, if a manager is to relate to his subordinates, he must communicate effectively. If an organization wishers to stay in business and enjoy high patronage; there must be effective communication. Also, if management wants its decisions implemented, it must communication its policies and programmes effectively. The questions one faces are: -<br/>(1)          What is effective communication all about<br/>(2)          What are the possible means to avoid the problems of ineffective communication? And<br/>(3)          What are the strategies to adopt to achieve effective communication.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            Inefficient communication constitutes a major problem to any organization. It goes a long way in preventing such organization from achieving the set objectives. Irrespective of the different perspective one may look at it, be it from the angle of the employee or the employer, it is always believed that inefficient communication is unfavourable towards the realization of the organizational goals.<br/>            Some of the problems associated with ineffective communication in a business organization using my case study as an example are,<br/>(1)          lack of proper channels of communication throughout which information is obtained. This explains why there still exists situations were minor problems which could be solved by simple dialogue between the workers and the management most times lead into major problems which cause some set back in the company.<br/>(2)          Secondly, the organization is not willing to carry its employees along, through sharing of information on management decisions. This gave way for workers to receive and give information from the grave vine rumours, and rumour being unhealthy development brings about negative opinion and also leads to unfavourable reaction to the organizational problems. The business organizations I am researching on, being a manufacturing and service company, often run out of stock of raw materials, this explains why productions is not carried out as scheduled, no other genuine reason could be given for this lack of raw materials but inefficient communication which breeds negative development in an organization. And as we all know disrupted production does not enhance regular payment of workers salaries and motivation and when workers are hungry, they go unhealthy about the organization who does not truly see communication as vital aspect of communication gap is bound to suffer.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>            This research work is embarked upon for the following purposes:<br/>(1)          To find out the problems caused by ineffective communication in an organization.<br/>(2)          To find out the strategies which could enhance effective communication in organization.<br/>1.5       Significance of the Study<br/>This research work is aimed at using the most effective means of communication and its impact on all aspects of human and business activities. The result of this research work will also help business organizations know the strategies and how to implement it to enhance effective communication in organization, and also how to reduce the barriers to effective communication.<br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            The following questions were produced to guide the researcher towards a meaningful and unbiased result:<br/>(1)          What are the problems caused by ineffective communication in organizations?<br/>(2)          What are the strategies employed by organizations to enhance communication?<br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS OF INEFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN AN ORGANIZATION: (A CASE STUDY OF VETCO GRAY NIGERIA LIMITED, PORT-HARCOURT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS OF INEFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN AN ORGANIZATION: (A CASE STUDY OF VETCO GRAY NIGERIA LIMITED, PORT-HARCOURT", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CHALLENGES OF SECRETARIES IN MODEL FINANCIAL HOUSES <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF FIRST BANK NIGERIA PLC, ENUGU MAIN BRANCH)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study investigated the challenges of secretaries in model financial houses.<br/>The theoretical frame work for this study was provided by the review of related literature.<br/>Research questions were designed and questionnaires prepared to enable the researcher collect enough data as regards the study.<br/>Information were sought through secondary sources such as textbooks, journals, lecture notes etc. were used in data collection and the researcher made use of all the secretaries as the population of the study.<br/>The finding of the research work were presented in tabular form and analysed using simple percentages.<br/>The researcher came up with the following findings, that secretaries.<br/>1.            Lack necessary office equipment that will enable them perform effective and creditably.<br/>2.            Are not properly compensated for the big job they perform.<br/>3.            Suffers low social status arising from low acceptance in the society.<br/>4.            Are not often sent on training as done to other personnel in other profession.<br/>5.            Lack good working condition.<br/> In view of the above, recommendations are thus given to improve the prevailing challenges of secretaries in model financial houses.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:<br/>            The work of secretaries in an organization is very vital and there is no way an organization can function well without their aid. The fast production of efficient work is assured since they are well trained in that line.<br/>            Whenever paper work, records and mostly written communication are needed in an organization the secretaries are likely to be involved. In  as much as secretaries have been undermined by the general public in many ways, the general conception is usually that any employee who sits behind a typewriter and does other forms of secretarial jobs is a secretary; therefore regarding them as typists or mere servants. It is therefore pertinent to start by knowing exactly who a secretary is, before going to the challenges facing them.<br/>            A secretary is an employment in an office who deals with correspondence, keeps records, makes arrangement and appointments for a particular member of the staff. He/she is the one who combines or has the mastering skills of shorthand and type writing and with a sound knowledge of secretarial duties.<br/>            A secretary is defined by the National Association secretaries in United States of America “as a executive assistant who posses mastery of office skills, who demonstrates ability to assume responsibilities without direct supervisor who exercises initiatives and judgment,  and who makes decision with in the scope of assigned authority”.<br/>            Office skills include typewriting, shorthand ability to operate photocopying machine, duplicating machines, cope with filings, do reception duties. Furthermore, a good secretary needs also to have accumulated enough knowledge about commercial work in general and this implications, on secretary is deemed to be genius.<br/>            A secretary in other words is a person employed in an office to care of correspondence/ records and in addition keep the day to day engagement of his/her executive in line with various demands.<br/>            Based on these factors, one can now say that a secretary is an indispensable factor in any office or organization. <br/>            A secretary has out-standing qualities – she understands the principles of keeping secrets, being polite to customers, callers and visitors, no matter how highly or lowly the visitors may be placed.<br/>            She appreciates the aims or goals of the organization in office or business, and conscientious works towards the achievement of the goals, together with the boss and other staff.<br/>            The secretary working in an industry should know all about the place. She should know the products, how they are produced, how raw materials are obtained, how the machinery works, how and where the spare parts are obtained, know managers and their individual assignments, other management staff, and indeed, the policy of the whole organization.<br/>            A good secretary is always alert, she reads newspapers, listens to News on electronic media and even to other people as they discuss. This is because, she might get useful information with minimum delay for the smooth running of the organization. Other attributes of a good secretary include tactfulness, self-control, neatness, politeness, ability to work without grumbling memory and pleasant speaking, services of a secretary are indispensable in every establishment. But, this fact notwithstanding, secretaries complain of one form of maltreatment or another from their employers in the course of carrying out their duties.<br/>            In spite of the important roles which secretaries play in organizations. Nigeria secretaries are still faced with a lot challenges and this paper or research will address these challenges.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:<br/>            The secretarial profession has become overwhelming indispensable in all spheres of life in recent times, but unfortunately the profession is higher and adequate recognition in financial houses.<br/>            Many people have this false notion that only never do wells enter the profession. Secretaries are most times misunderstood and misplaced, therefore they relegate to the background by many bosses as a result they are placed in their rightful positions.<br/>            This research work is aimed at finding out the challenges facing the secretaries and paving a way to gaining the attention for the secretarial profession by making both financial houses and secretaries to be aware of their positions as they work hand by hand.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The main purpose of this research is to identify the challenges of secretaries in model financial houses. Specifically the study seeks to:<br/>1.            Identify who the secretaries are in an organization.<br/>2.            investigate whether secretaries are sent on training to improve their skills.<br/>3.            ascertain whether secretaries are properly remunerated.<br/>4.            to find out if today’s secretaries are able to manipulate modern office machines and equipment in our model offices.<br/>5.            to determine how the secretaries relate with their bosses.<br/>1.4       THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Any study carried out must have some significance and it is strongly believed that this study when completed will be of immense benefit to all groups of people in the society.<br/>            For one thing, this study will identify the challenges of secretarial, help their employers to have a clear view of their problems and their device means of motivating their secretaries so as to enhance productivity. It will also help the manages to know what relationship that should exist between them and their secretaries.<br/>            Again, it will be beneficial to the secretaries themselves to enhance their prospects, if they adhere to the recommendations set out by this study. It will serve as an inspiration to secretaries Nigeria having known their problems and ways of averting them.<br/>            It will also have as a frame work in improving the ways, status, and working conditions of the secretaries in Nigeria.<br/>            However, this project will serve as an indicator to employers so as to know how to treat their secretaries, know the working environments that will be best for maximum efficiency  and productivity of secretarial work and the entire work of the organization and improve on their business in general.<br/>            Finally, the research will provide an up-to-date data of secretarial challenges for future researchers to look at in their studies.<br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            This study is undertaken to provide answers to the following research questions;<br/>(1)          What role does a secretary lay in model offices?<br/>(2)          How are secretaries remunerated in model financial

types of behaviour or acts which are inconsistent with the rules and regulations of an organizational set up.<br/>Organization as defined by Ejiogu (1990) is a social unit that pursues specific goal which they are structured to serve. Typical organization includes prisons, schools, churches and universities.  In each organization members interact with one another to achieve the desired goal.  This type of inconsistent behaviour can be seen in the homes, societies, establishments or institutions of learning.<br/>Social organization therefore can be described more operationally as the ways in which human conduct becomes socially organized and how the structure of the social relations therein and share beliefs and orientations that unit the members of the organization effect the members conduct.<br/>The school is a social organization and as such it has got its established pattern of behaviour expected in the form of rules and regulations which given the official actions of the rector, lecturers, students and anyone group of personnel that work in it.<br/>The noncomformity to the norms of any group or organization is what sociologist called “Deviant behaviour”.  It is a behaviour whereby one turns away from the social standard of the society.  IT is common in students of higher institutions not to follow the patterns of behaviour laid down for them by the school authority.  Higher education is the form of education received after secondary education and before going further to any other stage.  Students between the age of 18 and 24 are expected to be in higher institutions.  This is the age group where the students will be trying to understand their environment. While doing this many things may happen which may lead to juvenile delinquency, deviancy etc.  which are psychological problems.<br/>It is very hard any day passes without any comment on it coming from individuals, newspapers, radio news and television news and bulletins.  Opinions are divided as to who is to blame for deviant behaviour in institutions of higher learning.  Some hold management boards and lecturers responsible while others hold parents and students. Yet a section argues that it is caused by government take-over of schools, lack of moral and religious instructions in schools and some say it is caused by inadequate supply of necessary equipment and personnel to schools.  Apart form these views expressed, it is clear that many students have no respect for their lecturers and this attitude they carry over outside the school.<br/>No child can survive in isolation.  The peer group they move with, the parents, the school environment and our society in general contribute seriously to the problem of deviancy being faced in our community in general and higher institutions in particular.  Poor parental relationship causes deviant behaviour because some of the parents, in pursuit for money leave their children in the total care for themselves.<br/>Deviant learning experience in the school giving society the false impression that the development are not taught in the school or that the school administration is weak.<br/>In Nigeria society, deviancy may be conceived as a factor which militates against the good work of lecturers since it is believed that lecturers effectiveness is mostly evaluated in terms of student educational achievement and behaviour of the child.<br/>Some of the common deviant behaviour include stealing, truancy, disobedience to school, parents and community at large, mass demonstration leading to destruction of property, drug abuse, smoking etc.<br/>1.1              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>This study is an attempt to find out the causes and effects of Deviancy in tertiary institution.  As the wave of crime is mounting in our society, so also have experience and research shown that the rate at which school offences etc. are being committed in spite of strict school regulations.  There is no more respect for lecturers and even their own parents.<br/>Students go to the extent of joining armed robbers assassinating people and even trafficking in drugs.  Higher institutions seem to turn to institute for senior criminals where future-armed robbers, hired killers, drug traffickers and secret cults are trained.  Our society is corrupt to the extent that these students are looking for material things fame and other things.<br/>1.2              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.                  The purpose of this research is to find out the causes, effects and views of students and lecturers about deviancy.<br/>2.                  The effect on the students and lecturers about deviancy.<br/>3.                  The effects on the students academic and behaviour in the society<br/>4.                  It is also meant to find out the developmental stage that deviancy normally occur.<br/>5.                  The effects of the society, family, peer group and school environment on higher institution deviancy will also be found out.<br/>6.                  The study will also find out the contribution of lecturers and the society in general to deviancy.<br/>1.3              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will reveal the causes and effects of common deviant behaviours in some higher institutions of learning in Enugu. The finding of this research will throw more light to how each member of the society is contributing to the common deviant behaviour.<br/>In this study, the students will benefit from it by knowing the implications of deviant behaviour in the academic, character and social life.  Some students indulge in it because their friends are behaving like that without knowing what they are doing to themselves.<br/>Society will also benefit from it because when the student are behaving as expected, the society will be happy, their norms, belief will be respected and the social standard of the society will be improved.<br/>Parents will be benefited because their children will be listening to their teaching.<br/>The institution will benefit also because when the students have changed from their bad behaviour and turn to be new leave you see that there will be order, peace, discipline and standard in the school which will attract parents to sent in their children there.<br/>It will further help students to know how to behave well that is know the good behaviour, know how to behave in the society, know the norms, belief and culture of the society.  Discipline in the school will be achieved.  Respect and obedience will be observed in the home<br/>1.4              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.                  What are the causes of deviant behaviour?<br/>2.                  In what developmental stage does it normally occur?<br/>3.                  What are the most common deviant behaviour in our institutions of higher learning today?<br/>4.                  In what age range does deviancy occur mostly?<br/>5.                  How does deviant behaviour affect students academic?<br/>6.                  What extent has the society contributed to development

This advancement is growing rapidly and its impact is felt in all part of the world and all works of life. <br/>Everyday being about the birth of new organization. The incessant growth of business organization has created massive development in office technology. This development in office technology brought about the introduction of various types of machines and systems to enhance office efficiency. This includes the introduction of computer, fax machine dictating machines, word processor, teleprinter electronic typewriter and accounting machines etc.<br/>Communication is a process in which people share information, ideas and feelings.<br/>Today there are many ways we can receive information and also communicate back or give complete. Such as computer, electronics mail telephone.<br/>Information the oxford advanced learners dictionary of currents English described information as fact heard or discovered about somebody or something. Information techniques the same dictionary. Sees information technology as the study or use of electronics equipment, especially computer for strong analyzing and distributing words numbers and pictures. Information technology (IT) digest defines information technology as a technology phenomenon in the revolutionary sense of the word, which inter connects all fabrious of society and human activity and it mission is to change the way we live, educate people, work and engage all other life activities.<br/>Although information technology (IMT) made its input after the second world war, its remarkable impact could be said to have begin in the 1970’s with the rapid increase in computing power that resulted from advances made in microchips and semiconductors, by such companies like motorole an Intel. The process was accelerate by other factors as advances in computer operating system software, communication (fibre optics and satellite) as well as the internet, extract and internet.<br/>Information is power while communication moves the wheels of progress, but it is technology that rules the world. In the distant past, people hardly knew anything beyond their immediate neighbourhood. When they communicated, it was among themselves and their immediate neighbour but time changes everything wit the advent of the printing press which revolutionized information and communication technologies, giving birth as it were, to modern sophisticate technologies like the computer and the internet.   <br/>David Harry (1986) argued vehemently that the advancement of new technologies will generate redundancy among the staff as less hand will be needed to man the machine. It could also make some secretaries resign compulsorily their job as the machines will certainly replace the operations of many of them. <br/>It is not very easy for technologies to replace secretaries in the office because the place of a secretaries is very significant.<br/>The problems of the study is that many secretaries have been replaced in office while many others have been hindered from securing a good job by the introduction of technology in the society especially in the case of secretarial profession.  <br/>All these facts are what the researcher intends to find out in this study using one of the subsidiary company of (first bank) in Enugu Emene (Branch) as its main focus. It is done to enable the researcher established the effect of information and communication technologies on the performance of the office staff.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>In some organization the management prefer to employ computer operators, programme managers and equipment at the expense of providing adequate training and education for their secretaries to handle such machines and equipment. <br/>Sanders (1979) states that information technology wage has often made it possible for people to eliminate routine procedures and to use their operative abilities in more challenging and   rewarding wags. It is therefore feared that the introduction of this viable equipment may throw some secretaries out of job. It is a result of the complexity of office services automated devices. Computers have become indispensable in modern organization, the secretary who is an indispensable member of the office has been affected on one way or the other by the introduction of these information technology. Therefore this research work is designed to fine how true these are and also highlight instead the challenge and prospects there are for the modern secretaries in this era of advanced information technology.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research work will try to investigate the effect of information and communication technologies on the performance of the office staff, by doing the following.<br/>1.                  Finding out how information technology can reduce the work load of the secretary <br/>2.                  Find out if an office can function well without the use of a computer. <br/>3.                  Find out whether computer device has come to displace the role of the secretary or to improve the secretary efficiency.<br/>4.                  To identify the modern office machine that are of vital important in the office and to the secretary in particular.<br/>5.                  To find out the problems caused by effective information and communication technology on the performance of the secretaries.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  <br/>Information technology has brought repaid improvements through information technology the world has been globalized to a village. Access to information has become easier. Information technology has brought great improvement in our organization.<br/>This new equipment is capable of storing materials to the extent of its memory capacity which might be several thousand of words. The operators can correct, insert delete and edit materials easily it enable the secretarial staff to produce more work with less effort. It removes the need for repetitive typing and allows the secretary more time for other routine jobs. <br/>This project will help to enlighten organization on the need of training their secretaries on the use of computer devices for efficiency and productivity. Secretaries themselves will also see the need for them to get more versed in their profession by acquiring computer training. <br/>It is hoped that at the end of this study, organization will see the need to introduce information technology (IT) in their organizations for the benefit of the society and the secretary in particular. <br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>This research work will provide answers to the following questions.<br/>1.                  How will information technology reduce the work-load of a secretary. <br/>2.                  Can an office function effectively without the aid of computer <br/>3.                  Will computer take over completely the work of a secretary.<br/>4.                  Information technology is it changing the work of the secretaries or eliminating it.<br/>5.                  Has information technology enhance interpersonal relationship and co-operation among the staff of the establishment.<br/>1.6               SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The scope of this study is very wide if it was to be carried out in all organization. The study is delimited, based on the fact that there is limited time. Lack of finance and material resources to study the whole organizations. Therefore this research study will be confined to secretaries and staff of the First Bank of Nig. Plc.

A secretary is one who besides the possession of typewriting and shorthand skills is knowledgeable in management and organizational techniques. The secretary relies on her skills in dealing with people, such skills are tact, discretion, courtesy, common sense, pleasant speaking, good command of English language, ability and having a good retentive memory, to mention but a few.<br/>            It is a well known fat that every occupational carries some elements of risks usually referred to as occupational hazard, secretaries are to be found or seen in almost all business organizations worth the same. As is well known, the secretarial profession has come of age in Nigeria. Secretarial courses are now offered in all polytechnics in the country and in some reputable universities. The number of students offering the course seem to be growing from day to day. For those working, the task home pay is relatively attractive. Everything seems to be going for the secretary, yet many secretaries express dissatisfaction with their lot in their work places and some I know have abandon the profession for greener pastures.<br/>            The study therefore is being carried out to find out the problems facing secretaries in their work places and those impediments on their way to achieving full job satisfaction. Identification of these constraints will be a first step in seeking for solution to the problems and this is the objectives of this research.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            In every well organized business the services of the secretarial personnel are highly needed. It is usually asserted that the success or failure of any organization, or its good or bad image largely depend on the roles of the secretary plays in achieving the objectives of the organization.<br/>            In these modern times, the secretarial profession has become very lucrative and attractive. This has led to an unprecedented influx into the profession. Despite this enviable position, the secretarial profession appears to be bedeviled by some yet unidentified obstacles which may lead the secretary to resort to negative attitude towards their work and even leave their jobs for entirely different professions.<br/>            It is the aim of this research work to find out some if not all those impediments, obstacles and pitfalls which make may secretaries wish to leave this profession despite the attractive salaries usually offered to them. We will also seek to find possible solutions and offer recommendations that may stop these problems.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of this study include<br/>i.                    To find out the occupational problems encountered by secretaries working in some selected establishments in Enugu urban.<br/>ii.                  To find out the likely effects of these occupational problems on the secretary’s performance in the job<br/>iii.                To find out the causes of these problems<br/>iv.                To find out the likely solutions to these problems<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.      What are the occupational problems encountered by secretaries in these selected establishment in Enugu urban<br/>2.      What are the likely effects of these problems in detracting secretaries from their official performance<br/>3.      What are the causes of these problems<br/>4.      What are the likely solution to these occupational problems.<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            It is envisaged that this study when completed will be of immense benefits to secretaries working in some establishments to the management and the organization as a whole.<br/>            Firstly, this study intends to identify the occupational problems encountered by secretaries which can inject negative attitude in them so that their employers will have clearer pictures of these problems and devise ways of motivating the secretaries so as to enhance productivity. This study will also be beneficial to managers in these organization so that they will reveal what could be done to enhance the prospects pf these secretaries.<br/>            On the other hand, the study will be beneficial to the secretaries themselves in that, if the recommendations advanced in this study are adhere to, they will be better placed in the organization and their states enhanced. It will also serve as an inspiration to Nigerian secretaries to embrace the profession fully having known the already existing problems and ways to avert them.<br/>            Finally, the research will provide up to date information on the secretarial professions.<br/> 1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>ESTABLISHMENT: It is either a government, business organization or a large institution<br/>INCENTIVES: These are fringe benefits in various forms designed to motivate workers.<br/>MOTIVATION: The is the stimulation of workers to higher levels of performance by satisfying their different needs at different points in time.<br/>PRODUCTIVITY: It is the ability of labor and capital to produce the amount of output of goods and services compared to the input of  labor and capital     <br/>    <br/>\n\nOCCUPATIONAL CHANGES AND THE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE SECRETARY (A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED ESTABLISHMENT IN ENUGU URBAN)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OCCUPATIONAL CHANGES AND THE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE SECRETARY (A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED ESTABLISHMENT IN ENUGU URBAN)", "id": 75}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CHALLENGES OF MODERN AUTOMATION ON THE<br/>JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES IN FINANCIAL HOUSES IN ENUGU NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The functions of the sectary has changed drastically at present due to largely to the the introduction of modern automation in offices. The use of new machines like computers, facsimile, automatic typewriters, word processes etc has generated new business abilities and new job opportunities for secretaries.<br/>            However, it is also feared that this has posed a lot of challenges to secretaries. Hence the need for this research work which statement of the problems has to do with.<br/>To determine the effect modern automation have on secretaries, in other word dos the introduction of modern automation pose challenges on the effectiveness of secretaries.<br/>To determine whether the introduction of these automation constitute something to fear about by secretaries. Or is this innovation blessing for them. Guided by these, the researcher set out the objectives or the research questions to include:<br/>To ascertain whether modern automation pose challenges to secretaries who prior preparation in their operations.<br/>To determine whether secretaries who had no previous preparation in the manipulation of modern automation encounter problems <br/>To find out whether secretaries are exposed to training and retraining to meet challenges in modern automation.<br/>Relying on data collected from five giant financial houses in Enugu North Local Government Area that was used as a case study, the researcher made use of the primary data that involved the designing and sending out of questionnaire.

Consequently, there arise the need for development of improved devices for the purpose of increasing productivity levels, to make work less tedious. The history of the secretarial revolution of the 14th to 16th centuries. Record keeping and inventions of Manu scripting were first developed. When it becomes imperative that these two innovations could not provide a complete answer to smooth take off of business and full office operations, further inventions were made giving birth to the art of typing with machines.<br/>            The invention of the typewriter and its uses in the office were almost revolutionarizin  their useful to business application. Work could be done more quickly, more legibly, more accurately and more economically. But the expansion of business activities demand for more and better skill and experienced personnel. The invention of the typewriter was followed by adding and calculating machines, cash register and book-keeping machines.<br/>            The office today has changed largely due to technical advances, new business procedures and concepts and international movement.<br/>            The use of new machines like computers, fax, machines, electric typewriters, word processing etc has generated new skills and new job opportunities.<br/>            These have posed a lot of challenges to the secretaries.<br/>            Some secretaries cannot operate these electronic gadgets and other modern equipment. In a research carried out by Okoye (1992:48), it was discovered that “graduate secretaries were rated so low in their abilities to operate such equipments. Their knowledge and shorthand was appreciated but surprisingly, these secretaries could only exhibit a faint knowledge of the mechanism of the copiers and duplicating machines.<br/>            Added to this, most secretaries have problems in their work places because of lack skill needed to operate these machines. Lockhart (1991) as cited by Osagie (1992:110) stated that the whole role of typist changed by the impact of new technology. This could mean that the secretarial studies in which we are much involved may need a re0examination with more emphasis on the administrative role of office personnel and fresh look at the whole activities of office management.<br/>            Whistler (1970:38) opined that in a recent study of life 15 insurance companies were conducted to determine employment changes at various job levels as a result of automation. These companies believed that without the use of computer that they would need 60% more personnel. In effect, while there may not be (and probably is not) a reduced number of office employees, more work is now being done with electronic machines, than ever before.<br/>            For some industries, the installation of computer has hardly affected the total unemployment picture, on the contrarty, new skills have been required. In many companies the rate if turnover among office employees continues to hogh with the result that proposed, reductions in manpower requirements are compensated by moral attrition (Neuner et al, 1972:36 –37)<br/>            Further, in an economic and statistical analysis conducted by fortune magazine as cited by Neuner et al (1972:36-37), it was emphatically concluded that automation has made substantially less headway in the United Sates of America economy than the literature on the subject would suggest. Not denying that fact that technology does change and does displace a substantial number of workers, it was noted that ten years after computers have come into common use no fully automated process exists for any major project in any industry in the united states.<br/>            With the introduction of automation, an organization stands to gain among others, increased production, efficiency of work and low labor turnover and improved secretarial performance.<br/>            This study is therefore geared towards finding out the challenges of automation on the effectiveness of secretaries in financial houses in Enugu North Local Government Area <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            It is not clear what effect modern automation has on secretaries. While the impression is that the introduction of automation in business establishment appear to be a blessing to its users, secretaries who had not up-dated their skills fear that it would replace them. Is that a genuine fear? if an automated office would effectively replace the secretary,  how soon would that happen? Much is observed today about the changing office scene. Although many views are expressed concerning this subject, it is widely acknowledged that the future office operations and procedures are quite different from the ones the secretaries are accustomed to. For instance, Olusegun (1991:5) opined that, in a meeting, fear were expressed that another 10 years there might be nothing left for the workers to do since automation and technology might have become so improved that machines begin to operate themselves. While Stouter (1983:28) stressed that sophisticated equipment will never be able to replace the creative, articulate thinking of human being. What equipment can do is to assume the responsibilities for the more repetition o, routine part of office jobs.<br/>            Are toady’s secretary’s training programmes designed to accommodate the ever changing job demands to enable her cope effectively with them. These views are more guesses which have not been subjected to scientific study. Hence, this work, “An Investigation into Challenges on modern Automation on the Effectiveness of secretaries in Enugu North Local Government Area” is an attempt to find out the challenges of modern automation on secretaries.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purposes of this study are<br/>To ascertain whether modern automation pose challenges to secretarial performance and productivity.<br/>To determine whether secretaries who have no previous experience and skill in the manipulation of modern automation encountered problems <br/>To find out whether secretaries who are provided opportunities for training and retraining programes so as to meet challenges in modern automation.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study will provide a research based information on the current notion-wide argument on the challenges of modern automation to secretarial performance and productivity.<br/>            It will also be useful as it would show the adequacies or inadequacies to present day secretaries viz-a-viz the manipulation of modern automation.<br/>            Again, the study would be useful to organization and secretaries as it will reveal the training and retraining programmes that are available to meeting these challenges and hence facilitate the realization of set organizational goals.<br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            1n a bid to achieve the objective mention above, the researcher sought answers to the following questions.<br/>i.                    Do modern automation pose challenges to secretarial performance and productivity<br/>ii.                  Do secretaries who had no previous experience skill in the manipulation of modern automation have challenges<br/>iii.                Are secretaries exposed to training and retraining in order to meet the challenges of modern automation.<br/>1.6       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>DATA PROCESSING: The handling of data entirely by machine from the collection of the data to the production of the output data (Edum et al, 1996:145)<br/>FACSIMILES: An act of duplicating anything written, drawn or typed and transmitted between two distant points (Appleby, 1969:357)<br/>COMPUTER: An office machine with which office data is electronically processed at appreciable speed.

STUDY<br/>            Poor to the present day secretary which is consequently upon the advent of the European missionaries, there were records and record keeping of events that took place within that period.  During these period different types and methods of secretary services (Not modem) existed.  In Egypt instance, where civitization started, there were local drums to convey messages in the community and in Akan kindom of Ghana, messages were represented by carving woods (Hassan, 1998).  More over, most of the records of events in West Africa before the coming of the missionaries were oral.  The coming of the missionaries to Nigeria in 1842 changed the course of events in this direction.  The whife man’s first coming in Badagry in 1942 with the establishment of schools, churchs, and small scale business oriented enterprises led to the successful accomplishment of this mission and through administration the modern seccetary existed.  (Fouler 1980 “Todays secretary”).<br/>            A secretary is an indispensable asset to any organization or establishment in which their importance and sensitive position can never be over emphasized.  They play major roles in both the private and government establishment.  Most of the secretaries are trained in the tertiary institutions of learning in Nigeria, especially the polytheism<br/>The history of the polythecnics in training secretaries has assumed greater roles in recent times considering the special nature of secretarial course, peculiar instrument or equipment are normally used in secretarial training.  What are those equipments that makes a graduate of secretarial studies uncomfortable and unprepared to face squardy the challenges of the job and office automation as a result of technological advanement.  A secretary has to grow with technology in order not to be displayed from his/her job.<br/>The institute of management and technology (IMT) Enugu as one of the Institute to be studied is one of the reputable institution that trains secretarial students.  This institution came into existence in 1973 after two colleges, the college of technology and the institute of administration were merged to form the institute of management and technology (IMT). Before the marging of the two colleges, this two institutions were involved in training secretaries; and has produced more than 8,000 graduate since its existence (IMT edit 1975).<br/>Also our saviour institute of science, Agriculture and technology (OSISATECH), With the enactment of the then Anambra state government edit number 18 of 1989, the institute was legally established and lectures started in the institute on 6th November, 1990.  in December 1991, the National Board for technical education (NBTE) gave approval for the institution (OSISATECH) to admit the student into the programme.  And in 1992, secretarial studies together with some other department, example; mass-communication, food –technology etc started the National Diploma programme; and was planned that the Higher National Diploma (HND) programme in secretarial studies will commence by the year 2001.<br/> Now, the fact is though regrettable, most of the tertiary institutions today, mostly IMT and OSISATECH secretarial department, are consequently left with incredible poor financial base to the extent that they find if difficult to meet the cost of providing the required instructional facilities for their students.<br/>In view of this, poor instructional facilities under secretarial services and production of experienced secretaries.  Also the manipulative skill required, would be kaking due to inadequate poor equipment mostly in polytechnics in Enugu state which are the institute of management and technology (IMT) and our saviors institute of science, Agriculture and technology (OSISATECH). Enugu.<br/> STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            Secretarial studies programme in our polythecnics is in a poor state.  Due to the poor state of our economy, the programme lacks the required materials and equipment for effective academic instructions.  Most of the typing pools of these instructions still mentain the old out-dated typewriters, sometimes even those that are available are in a very poor condition as they do not function well.<br/>            Some of these departments never thought of the computer and other modern communication gadgets or equipment inspite of the importance of this machines in the modern time, that is why somw secretaries lack adequate knowledge of these required skills.  For this reason, they were unable to perform their functions effectively.  Thus ditegently due to poor instructional facilities.<br/>            What are the consequences of lack of these instructional materials on the secretarial studies programme? This is the task of this study.  To find out the effects of poor modern instructional materials of the educational programme of the department of secretarial studies: using IMT and OSISATECH in Enugu state.<br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>            Based on the above problems, this study is therefore designed to do the following:-<br/>1.                  Identify the instructional materials available in the department of secretarial studies of the two institutions.<br/>2.                  identify the instructional materials needed in the department.<br/>3.                  find out the adequacy of the those available.<br/>4.                  find out the effects of those not available on the programme.<br/>SIGNIFANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This research work just like every study is significance to the extent that it will enable the department of secretarial studies to look into the poor instructional facilities in the department and help the secretarial studies student like wise the lectures to be conversant with the relevant facilities.<br/>            From this study, the secretarial studies student will know about some of the facilities commonly used in offices and make efforts to purchase them.  It will also strengthen the link existing between the employer of labour and the secretarial studies student if this instructional facilities are adequately provided.<br/>            Lastly, if these instructional facilities are adequate it will be a pre-requisite for the award of ordinary National Diploma (OND) are the Higher National Diploma (HND).<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The scope of this research work is limited to the department of secretarial studies of the  institute of management and technology (IMT) and our saviour institute of science, Agriculture and Technology (OSISATECH) Enugu.  However the study will be carried out on the final year students and lecturers of both institutions, discussing the effects of poor instructional materials on students performance.<br/>             RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>            A survey of the effect of poor instructional facilities in the department of secretarial studies and how it affects student:-<br/>The following questions would be ask<br/>1.                  What are the available instructional materials in the department of secretarial studies of the two institutions?<br/>2.                  What are the  instructional material needed in the department?<br/>3.                  are the machine available adequate for training students?<br/>4.                  has non-availability of the modern machine have any effect on the student performance?<br/>HYPOTHESES<br/>HO:     There is no significant difference between the mean opinions of lecturers of IMT and OSISATECH on the instructional materials currently used in the department of secretarial studies.

This was to find out the impact of human relation functions on job performance of personal secretaries in financial institutions. The research was carried out in Enugu urban in Enugu state. The result was most successful in the sense that most secretaries and bosses interviewed agreed that it was an issue that required a lot of attention, especially in our institutions of higher learning.<br/>            Although some people felt that the name secretary is out-dated and is such should be scrapped for something or a name more appropriate and as well should be accompanied with a higher profile job description and specification.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              Background of the study<br/>1.2              Statement of the problem<br/>1.3              The purpose of the study<br/>1.4              Significance of the study<br/>1.5              Scope of the study<br/>1.6              Research questions<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE<br/>2.1              Definition of human relation<br/>2.2              Methodical approach to human relation<br/>2.3              Summary<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1              Research methodology<br/>3.2              Research design <br/>3.3              Are of study<br/>3.4              Population of the study<br/>3.5              Sample<br/>3.6              Sources of data<br/>3.7              Development and administration of data<br/>3.8              Research instrument<br/>3.9              Procedure for the statistical<br/>3.10          Analysis of data.<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1              Analysis, Findings, and Interpretation of data<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.1              Summary of findings<br/>5.2              Conclusion<br/>5.3              Recommendation<br/>References<br/>Bibliography<br/>Appendix <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            One of the basic problems in the society si just how workers should be motivated to achieve the goals in our industries. It is not an easy thing to go by since a little percentage of workers derive slight personal satisfaction from the jobs and enjoy little sense of accomplishment or creativity <br/>            This is why Carvel F.J in his book “Human Relation in Business” stated that in “Large organization people work together, follows instructions and order they do not understand” just few workers have the opportunity of self-expression or freedom. Then the question remains, how could this employees satisfy their personal need and that of the organization they are working with.<br/>            How can the secretary motivate workers at all levels of the organization? This was the saying of those who are old in the profession but to the way they view it, as frustrating and unrewarding. The young workers who faces the prospects of going to work with great fear of uncertainty (lack of understanding as regard to the new job or even inexperienced ones, need to develop their behavior which will help them adopt to the conditions of the job)<br/>            The best approach for a secretary to apply is the scientific and methodological system of human relations to achieve the desired goals and objectives of her organization. It is quite obvious that human relations deals with the interaction of a wide range of circumstances and of course social setting but I am going to limit this to the office conditions especially in financial institutions.<br/>            Carvel F.J (1977) say “That human relations can be pleasant and rewarding” the relationship between a secretary and co-worker, the boss and others even customers in her working environment should be very cordial in her day to day dealings. This he said will be compared with that of husband and wife, lecturers and students parents and their children.<br/>            Human relations is vital because it creates avenue for people to interact with both in offices and other parastatals because it has an influence over the nature and manner with which individual work out solutions to the problems in which they are confronted with.<br/>            The secretary with his or her psychological skills is also expected to understand different moods of co-workers, customers, the work conditions and how to arrest difficult situations in the office, how to get the best from his present group and how to take care of unexpected situation successfully. <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>            For a good number of reasons, secretaries in some of our financial institutions have been finding it very difficult to cope with the performance of their function as it regards to human relations. This has generated a lot of problems for secretaries.<br/>            Some of the situations are witnessed when an intolerant boss makes a mistake in the course of his duties with the secretary, but fails to admit such mistakes, rather he costs the blames on the secretary.<br/>            Struggling to meet up with the demands of these disgust executives as well as maintaining a good relationship with each other and at the same time keeping up with the demands of the job is stressful to the secretary.<br/>            Again lack of fact in performing official duties by the secretary constitute a very big problem, for instance when answering phone calls, secretaries with poor relationship radiate this attitude to phone callers.<br/>            This equally applied when handling clients affairs, because some secretaries by their positions in financial institution do not take cognizance of the client due to inefficiency in their job.<br/>            In that regards Carvel F.J (1972) say “That a problems arises when the boss finds the secretary sexually attractive. This he says creates room for insolent secretary and an awkward office relationship now prevails.<br/>            In this regard the researcher will try to find the solutions to these problems as it affects the secretary.<br/>1.3       THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of this study is to <br/>Highlights the fact that every one in the course of work comes in close contact with people.<br/>Understand the meaning of work and its impact on people<br/>Understand the background and development of human relations.<br/>Understand the impact of human relations function on job efficiency<br/>Understand the role of secretaries in organization development.<br/>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUSY<br/>            The study of the impact of human relation functions on job performance of secretaries in financial institutions is such that would have taken the researcher to different parts of the country.<br/>            But as a result of financial problems and time factor the researcher decided to ,limit the study to Enugu Urban.<br/> <br/>1.5       SIGNFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The significance of this study will be of tremendous aid to various institutions of higher learning in Nigeria, to know the importance of human relations in organizations. This will go a long way to propelling the various business organizations in the country to appreciate the need for effective training of secretaries and staff on human relations.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF HUMAN RELATIONS ON THE JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETRAIES IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU URBAN)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF HUMAN RELATIONS ON THE JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETRAIES IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU URBAN)", "id": 78}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE RELEVANCE OF COMPUTER IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF NITEL PLC ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>Is the computer really a new frontier opportunity and means to solve our problem is it of any help to management information system.  <br/>It is the aim of research work to concentrate on computerization of management information system application of computer to customer billing system in NITAL Plc and application of computers to any transaction.

Thus, the abuse adding machines and slide rule are all forms of calculating derives. <br/>The definition of computer has become more limited in a contemporary range. <br/>A computer is now define as an electronic device that process data and it is capable of receiving input and output and posses such characteristics as high speed, accrual and the ability to store a set of instructions for solving a problems.<br/>The computer took over centuries to endure, undergoing four generations, reckoning from time to time, serious efforts began toward simplifying mathematical computation. Quite a few people were involved in the eventual development of the computer and several of the scientists who made those useful contributions did not really aim at developing a computer extremely important to computer development. Four inventions and innovation were particularly useful in development of computers. These are contributions of Joseph Jacquard Charles babbage, Alar Trwnning and John Von Nenman.<br/>Between 1802 and 1804, Joseph Jacquard, a French textile manufacturer developed the Jacquard card to hold textile design information in form of brining patterns which revealed some of the advantage of using binary nations in machine design and data storage. <br/>This intention and innovation challenged other scientist, which led Charles Babbae to exploit the advantages of Jacquard innovation to invent the Difference engine and Analytical engine. This earned him the name father of modern computers. These engines were essentially for general purpose computation but they suffered a limitation of non-discovered of an electronic switch. <br/>In 1937, Alar Trunning showed that a computer can be build with a set of simple instruction which any problem having a logical solution can reduced to a solution based upon a small set of simple instruction. A few years later (1940) John Von Nowana set out a summary of the design requirement for a modern computer as follows.<br/>i)                    Binary codes should be used to represented data and instruction in a way that makes no distinction of the two and stall allow them, the storage space in the computer.<br/>ii)                  The ability of the computer to process these data and instruction which include the use of programmes and modified programmes accordingly.<br/>Based on these contribution and innovations of these scientist and others, the modern computer came to be. It underwent series of improvement which gave rise to fourth computer generation before we have today modern computer. <br/>However, the introduction of their general derive and machine and simpler programming langrage greatly increased the computer utility especially in management information system (MIS) which basically doodles on how information is obtained, retried and utilized hence computers are now indispensable tools of business, because electronic data processing or the use of computers I grooving and is capable of meeting the need of it’s and security and extends to other area such as marketing, accounting, inventory management and production process and office automation.<br/>Finally, there modern computers are still undergoing impartment which the computer age is experiencing a digital revolution which has now transformed the end of the last one and greatly improving the management information system of today’s.<br/>It is said that to manage the organization is to mange its future. How can the future be managed? The answer clearly is that the future can be managed through timely procurement of relevant reliable information system. The whole lot of activities therefore ranging from information procurement through it’s collation, valuation and analysis to feedback makeup what can be seen as a system. This type of system in management is known as management information system (MIS).<br/>Management information system is the formal process of data collection organization analyzing, procession, and dispensing of information in internal and external within the organization in an effective and efficient manner. It entails not only any organized and integrated approach at placing relevant and timely information on the denk of the managers for decision making, but also the control and accessibility of such information. At any point in time as may be demanded by  management (Wilkinson 1993).<br/>Primary, the management information system (MIS) is set up for the purpose of providing, planning and controlling information to all levels of management to effect appropriate decision making. Thus, it does by gathering data, inputting and processing them into information and further disseminating these ideas of information to management in form of financial as well as non-financial information system and the personnel information system depending on the type of organization.<br/>This management information system provides management with varying information depending on the level thereby making for increase in the efficiency of the organization through better management decision, more effective utilization of resources and increase profits better. <br/>A management information system perform four basic functions.<br/>a)                  Collection of data from a variety of sources: This means obtaining facts such as records of day today transactions either by observation or research from both external and internal source. <br/>b)                  Sufficient organization of data” Accessing and storing data in database: A database is an organized collection of data for instruction. An ordinary handwritten address is example of a simple manually datable.<br/>c)                  Data procession into information upon which to be used by management. Data is stored analyzed, compared, calculated and generally, worked onto producing messages in the form required by the managers, which form required by the manager, which is then termed information.  <br/>d)                 Presenting data in a meaningful and useful form. This could be means of various kinds of reports including statistical reports such as sales analysis and control information such as variance reports.<br/>However, owning to the fact that organization has grown in size, the information flow has become so voluminous that face to face communication and even writer memoranda can no longer effect adequate communication or effective processing of data. The management information system of these organization have in recent times found it difficult to meet with the increasing demand being made on it for information as a result, the manual means of operation is jam-packed with scores of data to be processed. Hence delay and inaccuracies in data collection and analysis. Also there is problem of misappropriation of important document of files or even cases of Stolen Files. <br/>These lapses amongst others parts a question mark on the manually assisted management information system hence solution have been sought in the introduction of mechanization with particular reference to the use of computer.   <br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS  <br/>In recent years, technology change have been introduced by many organizations. One of such is the advent of computers and it is being adopted by managers in many organization to help increase efficiency and output, to provide greater consumer and consumer satisfaction and to improve the management information system by manipulation, processing and distribution of data and other problem that in previous IMS were attended with difficultly. <br/> Investigation has shown that before the introduction of computers in the management information system (MIS) in the department of NITEL Plc Enugu the manually operated management information system in vogue then indicated lapses, which often beat the imagination on matters, consequently, the processes of decision making was almost reduced to grass root due to the essence of the effective and enduring information effective and enduring information storage and retrieval system. This affected the general productivity of NITEL Plc Enugu. <br/>However with the computerization of the management information system (MIS) in Nitel, not only was the problem of competence in decision making eradicated but also information storage and retrieval system become effectively and efficiently fit. But has NITEL Plc been fairly and well improved with the computerization of its management information system. <br/>The researcher seeks to know the impact of computerization of the management information in Nitel on profitability level of the organization.<br/>1.3              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>The objectives of this study are as follows:  <br/>1)                  To determine whether there is improvement in MIS in Nitel Plc since it has been computerized.<br/>2)                  To expose those areas in which management of computerized firm has failed to take advantage.<br/>3)                  To uphold or day some presumption that have existed around the computer, that is to know if computer displace people form their job. <br/>4)                  To know how the introduction of computer has solved the latent problem of the manual system. <br/>5)                  To know the extent of fraudulent practice in Nitel Plc. <br/>1.4              SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>This study is confined to the  management information system in NITEL Plc Enugu, with a particular reference to the designated are a of management information system which controls customers billing system. The adoption of the billing system will help in providing the relationship between the billing system and the profitability level.<br/>1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The satisfactory operation and control of an organization rests to a great extend on information or data. Data processing for business is not an end itself but it is used by the management to assist in achieving it’s objectives which is providing good and services, making profits, dealing fairly with employees, customers, suppliers and satisfying legal requirement regarding the keeping of records. This could enhanced by the introduction of the computer in management information system. <br/>This project will highlight the importance of computer on the management information system and heighten the emphasis by companies the computerized system of operation to the manual. Where as this work appears to be more beneficial to those in the management cadre.

functions of a good secretary in any organization.<br/>Preservation of records in an organization takes various forms depending on the size of the organization.  It involves the use of different equipment and systems.  Normally, records are preserved through filing, indexing and micro filing.  Filing is the commonest method for safeguarding important information and records.<br/>The efficient running of an office therefore depends largely on the existence of a good and effective filing and correspondence systems.<br/>Filing can be described as the care of records management.  The key stone of office organization is the maintenance of comprehensive, simple and efficient filing system.  Filing therefore is the process by which records are classified, arranged, stored, so that they may be quickly located when needed.  It entails storing records in a secure place and in a manner that permits rapid retrieval.  As Onibonoje (1976:115) puts it, “filing is the orderly collection, arrangement and safe keeping of information and prompt retrieval of such information as and when required for any decision.  Viewed differently, bathlomew (1974:214) sees filing as involving;<br/>“… collecting letters, carbon<br/>copies, accounts, forms and <br/>documents, sorting them by<br/>placing them in folders,<br/>binders, drawers etc, for<br/>future reference”.<br/>Whatever the meaning attached to it may be, the fact remains according to Denyer and Mugridge (1978:145), that “filing is the basis of record keeping …”Consequently, it should be seen as an independable and to any business organization.  The brain of every business as far as retrieval of information is concerned.<br/>            Correspondence is equally a very vital aspect of basic office routine of any organized body, be it private, government or club.  In each of these organized bodies, letter writing, typing, duplicating and in fact communication represent the core office routine.  Correspondence can be said to be communication in writing on subjects of mutual interest to both.  The internal and external publics of an organization.  The concise Oxford Advanced Dictionary (1974:192) defines correspondence as  “communication by letters”.  This takes care of in-coming and out-going mails.<br/>            Denyer (1980; 274) however sees correspondence as covering:<br/>”… many types of documents<br/>Including letters, which is<br/>Probably the most common<br/>Method of communication<br/>Between a business and its<br/>Customers of the public and<br/>Public organizations”.<br/>Carrying out a study of the problems of filing and correspondence systems in offices today is most essential especially as many contracts are lost due to poor filing and correspondence system.  Job offers and calls for interviews are lost and staff are denied promotion simply because their files cannot be located.<br/>            The choice of institute of management and Technology Enugu is informed by the fact that the school has a sizeable number of staff and does a lot of filing of its activities with both the staff students and external publics.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Academic institutions, today experience cases of delays and/or loss of  correspondence in their daily operations.  Where records are not loss, a lot of time is wasted in digging up people’s files and vital information often get to the final recipient highly distorted and filtered.  All these bring about a chaotic decline in academic activities in schools.<br/>The major problem in the study therefore is to identify likely problems facing filing and correspondence handling offices.  This will be done by studding the handling of these basic office routine in institute of management and technology (IMT) Enugu.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>            The study on the identification of the problems of filing and correspondence is concentrated on the institute of management and technology (I.M.T) Enugu.  The researcher principally aims at investigating the details of filing/correspondence in Institute of Management and Technology (I.M.T) Enugu for the purpose of revealing only weaknesses and /or strengths and suggesting improvements if necessary.<br/>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The study on the identification of the problems of filing an correspondence is concentrated on the Institute of Management and Technology (I.M.T) Enugu.  This study will not attempt to discuss deeply the benefits of filing and correspondence systems or the qualification of staff handling such basic routine.<br/> 1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>This research work will try to provide answers to the following questions:<br/>1.                  Does the retrieval of documents take a long time after filing in the Institute of management and Technology Enugu?<br/>2.                  Is the filing system in institute of Management and Technology Enugu properly organized?<br/>3.                  What is the cause of undue delays and loss of documents in Institute of Management and Technology Enugu?<br/>4.                  How can the system adopted by Institute of Management and Technology Enugu be reliable?<br/>5.                  Does improper filing and correspondence system in Institute of Management and Technology Enugu affect the growth and job satisfaction of the workers?<br/>1.6                          SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is essentially significant in the following ways:-<br/>(a)          It will highlight some of the problems of filing ad correspondence system adopted by correspondence and personnel in offices.  This will help management to appreciate the seriousness of the problems and thus take action to improve the situation.<br/>(b)         The revelations of this study will also be of special assistance to some future researchers who might be interested in finding out other problems of filing and correspondence system that are not related in this work.<br/>1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Filings:-<br/>This can be defined as folding clipping, holding papers for reference.  It is the process by which records are classified, arranged and stored so that they may be quickly located when needed.<br/>Correspondence:-<br/>This can be defined as communication in writing on subjects of mutual interest either within the organization or with outsiders.<br/>   <br/>\n\nPROBLEMS OF FILLING

SELECTED BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS IN PORT-HARCOURT METROPOLIS)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Information Technology that is formally known as modern office machines are widely been used in our offices today.  It is usually been used in order to facilitate office work and reduces labour cost.  The aim of this study is to determine the extent the Information Technology (IT) has helped the secretary in the dissemination/execution of his or her daily routine works.<br/>Prior to the technological development in offices, clerical works were done manually.  But today the invention of some equipment such as word processor, computer, electronic typewriter, facsimile transceiver, accounting machines and telephone etc.<br/>The purpose of this study is to investigate into the secretarial profession in order to find out the effects,  which the use of these modern office equipment have on the job performance of the secretary.  And in order to determine these, I designed questionnaires, which were distributed to secretaries and their boss.  After analyzing their responses, I found out among others that modern office machine enhances the efficiency of the secretary.<br/>I also found out that secretaries were satisfied with their job because they are now using modern office equipment.  Based on my findings, I recommended that business organizations that are still making use of obsolete gadgets should replace them with the modern office machines in order to enhance the job performance of their secretaries.  I also recommended that institution of higher learning should procure this modern equipment to be used in the training prospective secretaries.<br/>The scope of this research work is limited to some business organizations in Port-Harcourt metropolis, Rivers State.<br/>TABLE

Prior to the advent of Technological facilities improvement, such as computer, word processor, and <br/>Electric typewriter etc. Secretaries used reed pen in taking shorthand dictations, processing minutes and letters, that rather makes their job boring and less interesting.<br/>During the industrial revolution at the turn of the century, businesses offices faced a paper-work crisis.  And Secretary solved the crisis by adapting well to new technologies such as adding and calculating machines, telephone and electric typewriter.  Today, secretaries who are also known as administrative assistants, office co-coordinators, executive assistants etc, are using computers, Internet and other advance office technologies to perform vital “Information management” functions in the modern office.<br/>Secretaries no longer simply type correspondence for the boss.  But now, they often write that correspondence as well as plan meeting, organize data using spreadsheet and database management.<br/>In 1960’s the Information Technology came into existence, and it is a set of standards covering all processes involved in the development of an integrated computer database management.<br/>Information system, that are used today by the secretaries in the normal execution of their routine works.<br/>            The evolution of Information Technology (IT) was traced back to the age of Abacus Computer by the Egyptians around, 3,000 BC.  It was used for the systematic calculation of the arithmetic and numeric operations.  At the sometime “the Boroughs Machine”  has been developed to hold business information.<br/>            Later, Charles Babge developed a machine known as “Analog Computer”, this device have provision for input data, storing information, performing arithmetic operations and printing out results.<br/>            In 1970’s, the fist small computers known as “minis” and “Midis” were available which used floppy disks, Unix for storage of information and display of information that has been stored in the system.  These mini Computers include IBM PC, Electric typewriter, Word processor and Apple computers.  This information technology development had improved communication, unlike before whereby information were delivered through post office, which consumed a lot of time.  But today with aid of information technology you can reach somebody anywhere in a matter of a minute without much stress.<br/>            In those days, there was nothing like inter-com telephones that can linked various units or departments in an organization in order to save personal secretaries time and energy spent in running errands within the organization.  As against the traditional office, the modern office has a lot of activities to perform with help of modern office machines.<br/>            Moreover, these information technology gadgets act as an important tool in secretary’s job and minimize likely fraud, which could arise from numerous mathematical calculations done in the office.  And the result to a greater output than that of a secretary using manual equipment.<br/>            This development in Information technology has improved he effectiveness of secretaries in attaining their objectives in various organizations.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The problem of this study is to determine the extent the modern office equipment has helped the secretary in the performance of her duties.<br/>In solving this problem, the researcher would investigate the following areas:<br/>a.                   The job satisfaction the secretary derives from the use of this modern office equipment in performing her duties.<br/>b.                  The quality and accuracy of work done using the equipment.<br/>c.                   The amount of time needed to perform a task using the equipment.<br/>d.                  Reduction of cost brought about by the installation of these modern office machines.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.                  The purpose of information technology (IT) is to improve and control communication flow within an organization and outside the organization.<br/>2.                  To find whether these machines actually improve their productivity.<br/>3.                  To find out whether the training received at school by secretaries is adequate to enable them perform in an automated office.<br/>4.                  To determine the level of experience of the secretary.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The trends in use of Modern machines and growing urge of everybody to known and experience, to enjoy the distinctive features of a technological society are rapid.  This had instigated the researcher to have vested interest in this topic so as to find. Out how satisfied the secretaries that are using these modern office machines are and how efficient they use them in their work places to reduce their manual operations and physical activities in offices.<br/>The outcome of this study will be beneficial to the following:<br/>1.                  To secretaries, because it will create tremendous impact on their duties.<br/>2.                  To the suppliers of this modern office machines, as this will fetch them money, if their product’s performance creditable.<br/>3.                  To prospective secretaries who are yet to join the labour force to become aware of the importance of possessing a mastery of skill of Information technology equipment.<br/>4.                  To the readers of this work especially to students because it will be a source of added knowledge to them.<br/>1.5              SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The researcher restricted her work on the impact of information Technology on the secretarial profession, to some Business Organizations in Port-Harcourt Metropolis. Such as <br/>1.                  Exmark Technologies Ltd<br/>2.                  First Bank PLC<br/>3.                  Standard Trust Bank PLC<br/>4.                  National institute of information technology center (NIIT)<br/>5.                  Secretariat office Port Harcourt.<br/>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>The following questions were designed by the researcher to make her reach precise conclusion.<br/>1.            Do information technology machines aid secretary in performance of her jobs?<br/>2.            Does information technology influence secretarial job?<br/>3.                  Are the orientations and training acquired by the secretaries enough, to enable them use these information technology equipment efficiently and effectively?<br/>4.                  Do information technology machines replace the work of secretaries in an organization?<br/>5.                  Do secretaries derive job satisfaction from the use of these modern office gadgets?<br/>6.                  Does the use of information technology equipment enhance the secretary’s job output?<br/>7.                  Do companies or organizations benefit from the use of information technology equipment?<br/>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>In respect of this study, the following terms are defined and explained in order to understand the full meanings by the reader:<br/>a.                  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY:  These are the more mechanized machines that have been using in the modern offices, e.g. word processor, computer services and other electronic machines that required at least less human efforts.<br/>b.                  DATA BASE:  It refers to a group of related records and files.  Libraries mostly keep database to help them manage their collection of books.  A computer-based allows you use a database more efficiently than you would have imagined using paper records.<br/>c.                   INTERNET: The Internet, which is a worldwide network that are interconnected.<br/>It provides the following on-line services:<br/> Electronic Mail (e-mail) – Allows you to send and receive messages to and from any computer connected locally or internationally to the Internet via a service provider.<br/>World Wide Web (www) – This is graphical interface based on the multimedia framework that makes it possible to have text, picture, video and sound on the pages to be accessed.  Surveying the Web can be a pleasurable experience when visiting the sites of companies and even individual on the net, discovering new ideas and meeting new friends.<br/>EVOLUTION:  This process of developing into a different form.  Something that works out gradually.  The development of some modern offices machines have under gone many ages before the era of this technology which we are in today, i.e. from the age of Digital to Analog computer. <br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON THE SECRETARIAL

<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>In any organization time is rated very highly.  A secretary that doe not work with time cannot be productive in an office.  So the secretary must know how to manage her time properly, as well as that of her boss to be to be able to achieve the organizations set goals.<br/>            Time can be described as the one commodity that is unbiased, available to all in equal amounts, it does not cost us anything monetarily, and is completely at our own disposal.  We cannot store it, we cannot spend it in advance, we never seem to have enough of it and it is not possible to retrieve it once used.  Time wasting on the other hand has been observed as the major cause of secretary’s poor performance on the job.  Good secretaries are those who can manage themselves as well as others.  Time according to Bennett (1989) is the inexplicable raw material of everything.<br/>            Time can be given different definitions. In a day of 24 hours sometimes we hear some people say that the day is too slow while others say it is fast.  Even a year can be said to be can be said to be long or too short. It is a popular saying that time is money.  Invariably, it is important that time should be properly utilized or well managed.<br/>            An efficient secretary arranges her day’s work according to priority in order to meet up with the boss’s target, thereby achieving greater result in the work place.<br/>            Aromolaran (2000) identified time waters as in efficient procedures for handling tasks that must be done.”  He further explained that time wasters are also regarded as those vices which prevent office workers from accomplishing desired goals at the appropriate time.<br/>            A good secretary is one that always accepts responsibilities without grumbling, and should be able to carry out the work without supervision.<br/>            Akinola (1999) defined a “secretary as a very important person in an organization” and further explained that his / her contribution can either enhance or mar the efficiency and effectiveness of an organization.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The researcher in the course of her discussion with some secretaries discovered that a lot of them close very late from their offices due to heavy work load which however spill over to the next working day.<br/>This problem arose due to the inability of some secretaries to plan their work in order of priority.  This observation brought about the need to examine the roles being played by secretaries in improving their job performances, thereby achieving the organizational set goals and objectives.<br/>Sometimes, some secretaries do not go for lunch because of pressure of work.  Despite tight schedule of work, some secretaries still manage their time very well and succeed in meeting the required targets.<br/>The problem of this study was to determine the effect of self organization and time management on job performance of secretaries in New Nigeria Bank Plc, Lagos.  This problem arose due to the inability of some secretaries to plan their work in order of priority.  This observation brought about the need to examine the roles being played by secretaries in improving their job performance, thereby achieving the organizational get goals and objectives.<br/>Sometimes, some secretaries do not go for lunch because of work.  Despite tight schedule of work, some secretaries still manage their time very well and succeed in meeting the required target.   The problem of this study was to determine the effect of time management on the job performance of secretaries in New Nigerian Bank Plc, Lagos.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this research work is to view critically the effect of time management on the performances of secretaries in an organization.  The researcher intends to find ways secretaries can meet up with organizational set goals and objectives if they manage their time effectively.  It is very necessary for secretaries to learn how to manage time effectively in order to meet up with deadlines and targets.  Secretaries should organize their time properly as well as that of their bosses.  The researcher also intends to examine the factors that contribute to time wastage within the organization and to identify those factors that will lead to successful time management by secretaries.  Most importantly, to recommend ways on improving the situation.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is of great importance to secretaries in both the public and private sectors, as well as business men generally, administrators and top government functionaries engaged in one form of activity or the other.  It will be highly useful to secretaries in the sense that it will help them use their time more judiciously so that they can be effectively and efficiently programmed towards achieving the organizational set goals and objective’s there by having sense of accomplishment in their chosen field.<br/>The knowledge acquired from this study will enhance secretaries job performance and will also improve their knowledge on how to manage their time effectively, and reduce time wastage.  The study has been of immense

These are secretaries   to local state and federal government and also there are various grades or class of secretaries in both state and federal ministry such as assistant secretary deputy secretaries permanent  sectary. It is important to note that none of these received any formal training or possesses especial skill that is required in the performance of  secretarial duties. <br/>1.1       Originally a secretary was someone to whom, an absolute confidence is reposed on who could  write letters for a king or great nobler and  who could keep the content to himself by Lucy T (1990) that is he is qualified with the word confidential.

You will probably see also many people that seem quite bad. The reason is nothing but job dissatisfaction.<br/>It will not be an exaggeration to state that the origin of frustration to mankind dates as far back as the Biblical injection of Cain and Abel, since then, cases of frustration have been heard a midst school, families individuals and more especially in the working environment where I am restricting my research to.<br/>Job frustration is like a song on the lips of some Nigerian.  For Instance, if you are a worker and you have been working for the past five good months without receiving any salary or payment you will be frustrated.<br/>The history of coal exploitation in Nigeria dates back to 1916 when mining started at the foot of the Udi Hill along Enugu escarpment Coal production from inception maintained an upward trend and reached its peak between 1955 and 1959 when at most one million metric tones of coal was produced annually.<br/>The coal industry gave rise to the first set of industries in Nigeria and provided all the energy requirements for these industries up to the late 1960’s.  These include the Nigerian railways, the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (now National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) and the Nigerian Cement Company (Nigerian). Nkalagu.<br/>The leading of coal in the Nigeria’s energy mix started to decline with the discovery of oil in commercial quality in Nigeria in the late 1950’s and was hastered by the Nigerian’s civil war which tool place between 1967 and 1970 during which period all the coal mines in the country were abandoned.<br/>There rapid development of the oil industry in Nigeria and undue Government’s attention’s on the oil sector gradually resulted in a near total reliance on oil for the country’s revenue and   energy needs since the late 1960’s and a neglect of the solid fuel coal which is an alternative energy resource.<br/>Even NEPA has consistently maintained a policy of not using coal, depending wholly on gas and fuel oil or dieses for electricity generation.  The Ijora Coal fired  power station was switched from coal to fuel oil and later gas in the 1970’s while Oji River power coal fired station was shut-down permanently in 1990.  This is unlike what obtains in other countries that have most of the energy resources such a crude oil, gas, coal and uranium.  In these countries, at least 50% of their electricity is generated form coal.  It is hoped that the country will correct this imbalance in its energy mix through the on-going privatization process in the upstream energy sector.<br/>Nigerian coal corporation Enugu is a federal organization that is well known over the year as a coal manufacturing organization.  It provided employment for many Nigerians.  Despite all these, the workers also experienced frustration.  Therefore this research will focus on the effect of frustration on secretaries working in the organization.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Human beings has some ambitions to fulfill in life but where those ambitions are not fulfilled due to some circumstances it become frustration.<br/>Nigeria Coal Corporation Enugu has been facing a lot of problems, such as non-payment of salary to workers which secretaries are.  As a result of this some members of the state and outsiders engage themselves on illegal business in the organization like selling the properties of the organization.<br/>This has also lead some workers especially the secretaries to relocate jobs in another organization.<br/>To their Boss and other people around them.  And even the once that has no alternative to their problems die in object poverty or hunger.<br/>Finally, all these negative effects lead to the decline of productivity <br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study is to:<br/>1.                  Identify the real causes of frustration and its effects on secretaries<br/>2.                  Ascertain whether the frustration of caused by secretaries of their work environment, or<br/>3.                  Highlight the problems of frustration and suggest ways to enhance job satisfaction of secretaries in Nigeria.<br/>1.4                          SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is delimited to a study of effects of frustration on Secretaries in Nigeria Corporation, Enugu.<br/> 1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The essence of this research is just to explore and identify the causes of frustration and how for it affects the secretary in an organization.<br/>It is therefore intended to be a useful companion to the managers whose primary junction among others is to provide the most conducive working atmosphere for their secretaries.<br/>To potential secretaries in this research work is hoped to be valuable source of reference.<br/>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>(1)               What can we do to stop the causes of frustration?<br/>(2)               Which way or method is useful to quench frustration in Nigeria Coal Corporation?<br/>(3)               The workers that have been affected by this frustration, what strategies are to be to used to bring them back to life in the organization?<br/>1.7                          HYPOTHESIS<br/>For the forgoing, the following hypothesis have be postulated:-<br/>1.                  Management and works can cause frustration as well.<br/>2.                  Frustration can decline productivity<br/>3.                  A frustrated secretary is a corrupt worker.<br/>4.                  Frustration always leads to

 <br/>Appendix: Sample of Research Questionnaire                      <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The introduction of the secretarial profession is as old as man and nature.  The role arose out of the natural need for a prominent person to whom confidential matters could be entrusted and who could act as an assistant for a principal.<br/>It is known that secretaries existed in Rome prior to the establishment of the empire.  They were usually educated men who took dictations as “scribes” and often times acted as trusted advisors.<br/>Before the invention of parchment and reed pens, tools of the trade for scribes ranged from chisels used upon stones to styluses used on clay, wood or wax tablet.  Events and works of great men during that time were recorded in one form or the other.  Like Alexander the great said, “reliable records shows that the present day secretary came from the genesis whose oldest is ‘penman’.<br/>The first personnel officer trained was stylishly called ‘penman’ and this art is known as ‘penmanship’.  The penman originally used quill feathers as pen in making fanciful writings.  Other classes of secretaries emerged after the penman called ‘the writer’ and constituted themselves into what may be regarded as “chartered secretaries” who rendered useful service to individuals and organizations that requires their services.<br/>A Brief History of Shorthand and Typewriting<br/>            According to new encyclopedia Britannica (1990:1052) noted that most historians date the beginnings of shorthand with the Greek historian euphony, who used an ancient Greek recording the memories of Socrates. it was in the roman empire however, that shorthand first became generally used.  Marcus tallies tiro, a learned freedman who was a member of cicero’s household, invented the tironians notes – which was the first Latin shorthand system.  It was devised in 63 B.C. it lasted over a thousand years. t he Latin triennia shorthand became popular enough to be compiled into shorthand dictation and used by emperors and learned clergymen in speed writing contents.<br/>            As a result, a number of shorthand systems were invented.  In 1837 Isaac Pitman published his first Latin edition of the art.  In 1840, the second edition of his work appeared, under the title ‘photography or writing by sound, being also a new and natural system of  shorthand”.  His work which was in different forms include Pitman’s shorthand Instructor and Key; New Era; Pitman 2000 and Pitman Script.  “The light line photographic of John Greeg was also published in 1888.  Soon after their publication, these systems started to flourish in America and have now spread tentacles to almost every country of the world.<br/>            Before the invention of the typewriter, all written material was done by hand-writing. William Austine Bunt invented the first typewriter in the United States of America (U.S.A0 in 1829.  The machine, which he invented, wrote slower than a biro pen.  However, in 1874 Christopher Sholes introduced a machine, which was faster than a biro pen.  At the period under review, the typewriter keyboard was arranged alphabetically, and the improved version was made in 1872 for convenience reasons.<br/>            Naturally, typewriters invention changed the cause of things for the secretaries because they started to learn how to manipulate it with their.<br/>            In early modern times, members of the nobility had secretaries who were always men, who had command of several languages, including Latin, and were required t have what we could consider today as broad generalized education.<br/>            As commerce and trade expanded people of wealth and power needed secretaries, confidants and trusted agents, to handle correspondence on private or confidential matters, most particularly matters of state.  Men continued to dominate the secretarial field.<br/>            Secretarial profession underwent another evolution with the coming of the World War II in the Year 1940, when the men were drafted into the armed forces and only the women were left behind to carry on the secretarial jobs.  Since that time, secretarial profession all over the world had been feminine in nature with men getting into it considered largely as intruders.<br/>            Recognizing that continuing education was imperative to career success, a group of secretaries in America’s heartland became the nucleus of an organization that would help to professionalize the occupation.  In 1942, the National Secretarial Association (NSA) now known a International Association of Administrative Professionals was formed. NSA first administered the certified professional examination, a standard of excellence for the profession in 1951.<br/>            Sir Frederick Lord Lugard (the first Governor General of Nigeria) who brought his wife to assist him in keeping and storing important documents introduced the secretarial profession in Nigeria in 1914.  Today it has generally spread everywhere throughout the country.  Every organization now has a person who takes care of important and confidential documents in the name of a secretary.<br/>            Akintola (1992) had it that the profession of stenographers was a male affair up till the 1950’s few women were found in the profession and these were expatriate executives.  These male stenographers were never placed as Confidential Secretaries rather only the female expatriates were given such opportunities because their language was used, secondly, they were well trained for the skills before coming to Nigeria.  He further stated that by 1960, the expatriates left Nigeria while some Nigerian men and women on training replaced their positions.  Lectures, seminars and workshops were organized for secretaries.<br/> The Definition of Secretary<br/>            The word “secretary” ultimately cam from the same Latin word “Sectrum” meaning secret.  Originally, it meant, “one entrusted with secrets and confidence of a superior”.  In Middle English, it was secretaries and in Middle Latin, it was Secretarius.  In France from 13th to the 16th century, the word secretaries meant a confidant.  It also became an administrative term meaning “someone who transcribes or arranges for another”.<br/>            By 1847, the definition in the First Millennium Webster Dictionary was greatly expanded. “Secretary” – (1) A person employed by a public body or by a company or by an individual, to write orders, letters, dispatches, public or private papers, records and the like.<br/>            Secretary – (2) An officer whose business is to manage the affairs of a particular department of government as the secretary of state.<br/>            Today, the word “secretary” is commonly stereotyped to mean a “person who types correspondence” or a “dictation taker”.  To better describe the administrative and information management functions of today’s office support staff, the term “administrative professionals” is recommended as blanked term for office support staff by the International Association of Administrative Professionals (IAAP).<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>This research work intends to compare secretarial profession of yesterday and today and effect of education, training, working conditions and the modern technology on the profession.<br/> 1.3              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is essentially significant in the following ways;<br/>i.                    It will highlight some of the differences between secretaries of yesterday and today.<br/>ii.                  The findings from his investigation will enhance the image of secretaries and thus place them in their rightful position along other officers.<br/>iii.                The outcome of this study will be beneficial to all practicing secretaries who are already in the system.<br/>iv.                Another set of people that will benefit from this study are all student secretaries all over the country.

Some of these duties were not enforced, but a branch of them normally provoke public condemnation and effect their growth. With the unfolding circumstances. The profession is fact acquiring a distinction as one of the most versatile essential services of modern economic communities. Nonetheless, the profession is becoming challenging and too many people perhaps enroll into the ranks as a future prospect. With more technological and industrial development, the secretary shall fully realize his potentials in the country. (Utomi; 1990). <br/>As defined by National Secretaries’ Association (International), a secretary is an executive assistant who possesses a mastery of office skills, who demonstrates the ability to assume responsibly without direct supervision, who exercise initiative and judgment and who takes decision within the scope of assigned authority. With the above definition we can see that the present day secretary is a potential officer. A secretary is indispensable to management and it is true that a good secretary can make an average manager very effective and also a bad secretary can make an able executive very ineffective. (Odenigbo; 1990).<br/> Lack of job description for secretaries has led to the misappropriation of skills unequal distribution of work, low morals, and bored (Appt; 1979). He stressed thereafter, that each secretarial position should be analyzed and task requirements of the job identified for better job description.<br/>Job description of secretarial staff should contain a statement bout what a secretary does on the job and what she knows and should include also other classes of things that are done on the job such as preparation of a venue for meeting provision of refreshments, seeing to the cleanliness of the office which do not actually relate to the basic skills (Mayes and Beach, 1967). <br/>Experience has shown that inspite of all that a secretary does to promote the image of the organization little or even the very boss whom she serves accords her no recognition. Lack of recognition and undefined job role have contributed to the poor self-image of a secretary in the Nigerian society. It is common that anyone who can type is referred to as a secretary by many, despite his not possessing the skills required of a secretary. This misconception of who a secretary is and what she does had led to non-challenging job experiences, law payment and lack of respect by the executive for whom she works. As a result, secretary are either underused or overused by organization without creating any room for their advancement. A situation whereby the advancement and promotion of secretaries depend solely upon her boss does not encourage personal initiative. <br/>It is therefore necessary to look into those factors that effect the advancement of secretaries in our business organizations <br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>The position of the secretary in any organization is very distinct. She is very essential and an image-maker of the organization. She is the mirror of her organization while some describe her as the life wire of the organization. Hence it because doubtful if any chief executive can discharge his duties properly without the assistance of a secretary. <br/>Apart from being an administrative assistance the secretary perform such other functions such as clerical and receptionist duties and in some cases does some accounting jobs, which are not quite in line with her job description. The work of the secretary cuts across every aspect of the organization’s activity. As a result of being and all purpose staff, the secretary has been described by some schools of thought as an “unclassified” office personnel who is neither here nor there.<br/>In the actual sense, a worker should be assessed based on his / her job description such assessment gives room for promotion and recognition. <br/>Unfortunately, the secretary is not assessed based on the duties in corporate in her job description to recondite what she is doing with what she is supposed to do. The discrepancy between job description and the actual job done by the secretary does not given room for proper assessment thereby making promotion and advancement to be hindered. <br/>This work therefore is aimed at discussing the various factors, which affect the advancement of secretaries in business organizations, and seeing how such factors can be elimination.<br/>Such factors to be discussed includes: <br/>•Structure of the profession <br/>•Work competences of secretaries <br/>•Relationship with management<br/>•Relationship with other workers <br/>•Lack of protection from formal organization.<br/>1.3              OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The objective of this study is to discuss the factors that affect the advancement of secretaries in business organizations in some selected private organizations in Enugu Urban.<br/>This will be done by determining:<br/>•Whether the structure of the profession in Nigerian is always such that secretaries are subordinate to higher authorities and executives. <br/>•Whether work competencies of a secretary affect the advancement of secretaries in business organizations in Enugu State.<br/>•Whether the working relationship between management and secretaries affect the advancement of secretaries in business organization in Enugu State. <br/>•Whether the failure of formal organization in Nigeria to protect and project the secretarial profession affect the advancement of secretaries in business organizations.<br/>•Whether the working relationship between the secretaries and other workers affect the advancement of secretaries in business organizations in Enugu State.<br/>1.4              SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research work covers only two business organizations namely; National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) and Emenite Limited Enugu due to limited time and scare resources. <br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>•What are the factors that improve the advancement of secretaries in a business organization?  <br/>•Does the structure of the profession as always subordinate to a higher authority and executives improve the advancement of secretaries?  <br/>•To what extent does the relationship with co-workers improve the advancement of secretaries in business organizations? <br/>•To what extent does the relationship between secreareis and management improve the advancement of secretaries in business organization in Enugu State?<br/>1.6              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  <br/>This study will reveal the factors that improve the advancement of secretaries in business organizations.<br/>It is sincerely hoped that the findings of this study will be of immense benefit to secretaries of organizations who are not only going to have a well defined job description but will also have a brighter prospect for growth on their professions. <br/>The findings of this research of adopted by business organizations will help boost the output of the organizations since a more cordial atmosphere will now exist between the secretaries and management.   <br/>With a brighter future and unlimited growth for secretaries, the findings of this research project will encourages young people to take to secretarial profession and seek employment in business organizations. <br/>Nigeria as a nation stands to gain from the result of his research since the success of all business organizations put together will ensure an increased foreign exchange earning and a better standard of living for the citizenry.<br/> <br/>\n\nA

<br/>Questionnaire <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>In the public and private sectors of the Nigerian economy, secretaries are usually very helpful to the management in the accomplishment of organizational goals.  With the advent of technical know how in our modern establishments there is an increase in demand for sophisticated and modern technologies in Nigerian organization.<br/>            In the light of the above situation this research work is aimed at identifying the Negative Impact of Technological Development on secretaries in a modern office.<br/>            There are various categories of secretaries, which includes: the executive, secretaries, the company secretaries, confidential secretaries, parliamentary secretaries and others.<br/>            Each of them is changed with well-articulated and defined functions and roles, which are expatiated of them.  This study concentrates on the role of the executive secretary, employed by a company who is attached to an officer who is of the executives cadre.<br/>            A secretary may be viewed as a person who has acquired the basic knowledge of secretarial skill of shorthand, typewriting and sufficient knowledge and practical experience in office routine.  Depending on the objectives of the organizations a secretary meant all things to all people.<br/>            However, there are some basic functions which secretaries perform and these form the basis of their identify in an organization these functions are:<br/>a.                   Initiating relevant correspondence on all routine, matters and drafting letters as authorized <br/>b.                  Collecting relevant information from relevant sources for office use.<br/>c.                   Follow up the diary of her boss daily.<br/>d.                  Dealing with visitors and telephone callers on issues which the secretary is knowledgeable.<br/>e.                   Preparing the boss for meetings and other entertainment etc.<br/>In spite of this very important functions performed by secretaries, the secretary still needs the modern office technology to efficiently carry out his/ her duties.<br/>            Prior to the technological development in offices, clerical works were done manually the sizes of offices were small and little work was done manually.  Then there was nothing like the modern equipment like, typewriter, telephone, photocopying, machines, addressing machines etc.<br/>            Technology is the application of scientific principles and knowledge to solve societal problems.  It could be defined as the study, mastery and utilization of industrial and manufacturing methods as well as their application to practical tasks in the industry.  Considering the degree of accuracy, convenience, speed and efficiency provided by modern technological aids, people have increased their awareness and utilization of modern technology in their organizations.<br/>            Though, modern technology assists, yet secretaries are afraid of being displaced by them, because some of the manual equipment used by secretaries are being supervised by automated machines and processes.<br/>            It is not very easy for technologies to replace secretaries in the offices because the place of a secretary is very significant.  This is because any technology applied will be operated by a trained secretary if efficiency and effectiveness must be maintained.  There are also human attributes that the secretary possess that modern technology cannot offer.  Adequately trained, reasonably motivated and royal secretaries aid the executive in the performance of duties will be needed to complement the modern technological innovations in the offices.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Because of the increasing demand for the use of automated processes in our organization in Nigeria, technology has been introduced to perform most of the jobs in the organization, more especially the duties of a secretary in an office.  In some organizations, the management considers it fit to employ computer operators, programme managers and technologist instead of providing adequate training and education for their secretaries to handle such computers.  As a result of this secretaries have been regarded as mere typist who cannot handle these machines, nor who do not have the capacity to leaver and caravel new skills.<br/>            The problem of this study is that many secretaries has been displaced in the office while many others have been hindered from securing a good job by the introduction of technological development in the case of secretarial profession.<br/>            In the light of all these, this research work aims at encouraging secretaries to put aside their fears and anxieties of being replaced by technological advancement in the office or getting people that will effectively use such machines without involving the secretaries.  The researcher intends to tackle this problem by investigating the place of secretaries in a technological advanced organizations like Banks such as: first Bank Nig plc, STB and Union Bank of Nigeria all in Umuahia.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The general objective of this study is to evaluate the place of a secretary in a technological advanced economy.  The specific objectives includes:<br/>1.                  To examine the kind of modern technology that exist in the organizations.<br/>2.                  to find out if modern technology pose any threat to the secretary.<br/>3.                  to find out, if secretaries will adequately fit in the modern technological office environment, when they are sufficiently trained.<br/>4.                  to examine if technological advanement can generate job opportunities or unemployment for secretaries.<br/>5.                  to study how technological advancement in offices can facilitate or mar the job of secretaries.<br/>6.                  to appraise the changes which technological advancement can cause in the duties of secretaries. <br/>7.                  to recommend measures for blending the job of the secretary and sophisticated modern equipment in achieving high productivity in offices.<br/>1.4              SIGIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>When this study has been concluded, an elaborate examination of the role of a secretary in an organization must have been done.  Some organizations are not aware of these modern office technologies.  This type of organizations will benefit from this research, because, after getting through this work, they would be well exposed about the various equipment, that they could use to carry out their duties effectively.  There are other organizations who knows or are aware of the existence of this modern office equipment, but are not informed about their applications, these organizations will equally benefit.<br/>            What about organizations that are privileged to have access to this equipments? They will be at an advantage in that, they will be better placed to know the different roles which secretaries can play and their ability to operate complex and automated machine.  This research work will also be useful in institutions of higher learning that offers secretarial studies.<br/>            Hence, after reading this research work, they will be able to redraw their circular and syllabus to accommodate subjects that are computer oriented.<br/>1.5              SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The primary aim of this study is to examine the negative implication of technological oriented business environment on the modern secretaries.<br/>            However, because of some constraining factor such as lack of co-operation from information administrators sources, finance and poor transportation system, the research decided to limit the scope to only some selected banks in Abia State, such as first Bank and Union Bank.  Which represents a sample of the population of Nigeria enterprises.<br/>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>Some research questions has been designed, to guide the research work in achieving its focal points.  They include:<br/>1.                  What kind of modern technology exists in organizations in Nigeria.<br/>2.                  Is modern technology a threat to secretary&gt;<br/>3.                  Will adequately trained secretaries be employed to improve office environment<br/>4.                  can technological advanement generate employment or unemployment prospects for secretaries?<br/>5.                  what changes can advancement in technology bring to the duties of a secretary?<br/>6.                  how can technological advancement facilitate or man the job of a secretary.<br/>7.                  what measures can be taken to blend the job of the secretary and the modern equipment in achieving high productivity.<br/>1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>SECRETARY<br/>            A skill practitioner of the basic office who is employed as an administrative assistance to a superior officer.<br/>TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT<br/>            This is a complex modern labour and cost cutting equipment that are now increasingly utilized in organizations.<br/>WORD PROCESSOR<br/>            It refers to the process by which an idea is translated into written communication.

Presentation and transmission of all type of communications as well as the conventional secretarial duties of confidential nature at various levels.<br/>The company and Allied Matters Act of 1990, s.273 (1) stated that “a secretary is an executive assistant who possess a mastery of office skills”.<br/>Copeland, L.,  (1980), in his Encyclopedia of useful information states that a successful secretary must have stenographic skill, a clear and intelligent understand of the rules and personality as a result of good training and exposure.<br/>Mr. Aniche G.C, (1990), aptly defined a secretary as “the window in the organization”.<br/>Hanna et al, (1974), in her book, Secretarial Procedures and Administration, defines the modern secretary as an executive assistant, who possesses a mastery of skills, who demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision and who makes decision within the scope of assigned authority.<br/>The National Secretaries Association of United States has defined as secretary as an executive assistant who possesses a mastery of office skills, who demonstrates ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who exercises initiatives and judgment and who makes decisions within the scope of assigned authority.  However, the pertinent question is in what way does the secretary assist the executive?  The answer to this question is partly individualistic and partly organization dependent.<br/>For the boss, the secretary can be described as his indispensable assistant who possesses mastery of office skills, demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility without direction or supervision, exercises initiative and judgment, and makes decisions within the scope of assigned authorities.  Eni, 91987), Also she serves as the interlace in the organization’s public relations image.  She therefore, is a vital link between the public and the organization which makes Duru, (1991), to say that the secretary.<br/>Must maintain a good relationship with members of the public, as the attitude of the secretary would have repercussions for a field”.  In any business setting, be it industry, government, scientific, radio and television as in a list of other fields, the person who ensure the efficient and smooth running of the office is the secretary, “she must be intelligent versatile with initiative and drive National Concord, (27th December, 1991).  Says that a secretary needs to be more,<br/>“Social mentally flexible, emotional stability and <br/>exercising good judgment as perhaps <br/>the most important  qualifications of a secretary”. <br/>She serves a multi-disciplinary function, and is also the vital ink in coordinating various activities, Eni, (1996).  Being an intermediary between the organization and the public on one hand and between the boss and the rest of the staff on the other hand, the secretary must be of sound judgment and must be able to take right decision even in the absence of her boss.  It is perhaps on this rather than anything else lies the competence of the secretary.  Competence is defined as the ability to perform work activities to the standards required in employment. It embodies the ability to transfer skills and knowledge to new situation within the occupational area.  It encompasses organizing and planning of work, innovation and coping with no-routine activities.  It includes those qualities of personal effectiveness required in the work place to deal with co-workers, managers and customers, Sheila, (1990).<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>There is a tendency to judge the competence of a secretary by ill-defined references.  These references for competence, like the role of the secretary, is both individualistic and organization dependent. Some judge the competence of a secretary based on the secretarial skill of the secretary mainly on typing and shorthand.  Others on the speed with which such skills are performed and still others on the personal attributes of the secretary such as punctuality, reliability, tact, discretion, mannerism, organizing ability and mode of dressing.<br/>However, there is tendency to the term modern secretaries (executive secretaries) as part of the management team.  Thus, with this trend, the judgment of competence of the secretary is also looked at differently.  Perhaps, this made Whitehead, (1977) to say that, it is not enough to perform all secretarial skills which all executive need, or event he personal attributes such as, punctuality, discretion and tact which the good secretary displays.  The secretary has to become a valuable part of the management team, knowing fully well about the policies of the organization and that of his boss’s work.  One must also stress that machine operation (e.g. Computer), book keeping, accounting adequate knowledge of the boss’s work are also referral points in judging the competence of a secretary.<br/>The problem now is, who is the competent secretary? Who do we describe as competent? What qualities are required of a competent secretary/ This is what the researcher intends to look at critically in order to make valid suggestion for the betterment of the secretarial profession.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this research is to find out the qualities of a competent secretary.  Strategically, this research is set out to study and possibly identify the nature and major problems in the concept and practice of secretarial competence, which has virtually crippled the administration of most business establishments.  The researcher will therefore, look into the specific or different secretaries’ competence.<br/>1.4              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>To achieve the objective of this research, the following questions will guide the researcher.<br/>1.                              What special skills, qualities and attributes do secretaries need to function efficiently in an organization?<br/>2.                              How are these skills and attributes developed over time?<br/>3.                              what factors impede the acquisition and development of these skills and attributed? <br/>4.                              In what ways can these factors be removed so as to achieved competence?<br/>5.                              What is the impact of a competent secretary organizational effectiveness and efficiency?<br/>1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>There is no doubt that a study of this nature will yield positive and significant contribution.<br/>Firstly, it will help to identify the knowledge and skill requirements that make a secretary competent carry out his/her various roles and functions in a dynamic society.<br/>Secondly, it will help to identify the type of training development and exposure that is required by a secretary<br/>Thirdly, it will assist in unveiling factors that contribute to secretarial competence as well as those that impede so as to develop the skills and knowledge accordingly.<br/>Finally, findings of this study will add to existing management literature.<br/>1.6              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>The following terms used in this study should be taken to mean the following:<br/>COMPETENCY<br/>It means possessing the required knowledge, skills and ability to perform a task adequately.  It is a grade or rank denoting a stage of expertness and skillfulness.<br/>SECRETARY<br/>It can be defined as a person employed in an office, usually working for another person, dealing with letters, typing, keeping records, etc and making appointment and arrangement.  A secretary is an executive assistant who possesses a mastery of office skills, who demonstrates the ability to assume responsibilities without direct supervision, who exercises initiative and judgment and who makes decision within the scope of assigned authority.<br/>BUSINESS<br/>It is the activity of making, buying, selling or supplying things for money, commerce and trade.  Business as against leisure is any productive activities geared towards making a profit or any productive activity aimed at making profit.<br/>ESTABLISHMENT<br/>The action of creating or founding something on a firm or permanent basis.  Also it is a group of powerful people won influence or control policies, ideas, taste, etc.  and usually support what has been traditionally accepted.<br/>ORGANISATION<br/>An organization is a group of people who gathered together in order to achieve a specific goal.<br/>PROFICIENCY<br/>This means being able to do something in a skilled or an expert way because of training and practice.  It is the state of being well versed and adept.  It is proficiency that gives dimension to the concept of competence.  It simply means the incite of accomplishment.  This measure indicates the extent to which given sets of skills, abilities, knowledge, capability, attitude and values have been acquired.<br/> <br/>\n\nCOMPETENCY REQUIRED OF SECRETARIES IN SELECTED BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT.

He spent half  a century improving it, and the great work has since been continued by several generations of expert writer and teachers. <br/>Millions have used this system as a means of earning a livelihood, and today, throughout the world wherever accurate and immediately  legible recording of  spoken English is reguired in parliament and congresses of every size. <br/>Isaac pitman devised his system after profound and epock making study of the phonetic structure of the English language. The system is a result of his scientific analysis. Systems before pitman and even systems in use today, could achieve speed only through the laborious memorization of hundreds of special forms and arbitrary abbreviations. In pitman shorthand speed and facility of writing and safety of   reading are achieved by following a coherent and comprehensive scheme: each individual sound has its signs and  sounds of the same family have signs with an appropriate family likeness, after a little practice the signs seen to produce  themselves like snapshots from the sounds and the sounds themselves seem to speak from the written page. <br/>Historians date the beginning of shorthand with the Greek historian xenophobe, who used an ancient Greek system to write the memos of secretes. In the fourth century B.C Marcus Tulluis Tiro, a secretary to the Roman Orator cecero, invented a  shorthand system called Tiroman According to stoddard and scalter good (1983:93) the time that Tiro invented his system was not quite clear and some people so as far as to say that he stole a system used in Greece. However, most  agree that  Tiro’s notes were the first organized system that enabled a writer to  take down notes as fast as they were  said. <br/>Although, shorthand writing has undergone many modifications since its invention, the gregg and pitman methods are the beast known system using symbols. About 1913, shorthand  written by machine was introduced and Gregg simplified version of shorthand written by machine was introduced in 1949 revised in 1963) and in the latter part of 20th century, the use of shorthand machines became widespread. <br/>In 1973, institute of management and technology started offering secretarial study as a course. <br/>In 1989, the N B Y E introduced advanced transcription in the curriculum and course specification studies lectures in this department relied on dictation and general principles and techniques of writing and subsequently transcription in type writer. Shorthand and has been the bare of most students. Shorthand as the name suggests spells terror and doom to the students with exeption of a far.<br/>The pitman organization has carried out series of research and emerged with some teaching methods, techniques and even the publication of books, programmed to enable students so through this course with minimum rata of failure. However   the government  infura approved several commercial schools and colleges where shorthand is being taught attend extra classes in the   evening. Like institute of management and technology, students are being divided  into groups to create attentiveness  and interest from the students. <br/>Inspite of these the problem of high rate of failures in shorthand still persist.  <br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Shorthand in business today is basically English. Writers/ students in this country have had to endure lots of problems in the writing of shorthand due largely good facilitators ignorance on the part of student etc. this leads to the high rate of failures in shorthand.<br/>The problem of shorthand is not hinged on the subject propert. Most students come in with already ill convinced belief that shorthand is a difficult subject; every subject is difficult, and there are experts in all subject. This has been identified as contributory toward students high rate of failures in the subject, shorthand like mathematics is expected to have its peculiar methods and problems among others. Student ill-convinced motion that shorthand is a difficult subject inflicted a lot of psychological damage to their understanding of shorthand. It gave rise to many needs and imagined problems which hinder the much desired progress in shorthand. Some students are interested in the course but when they encounter minor problems, their interest fizzle out, the high rate of failures in shorthand is also due largely to the fact that students treat shorthand like any other  suject. They study only at the approach of an examination (i.e. when it is already too late to get the skill and the speed students should know from the earlier stage that shorthand is a delicate subject and must  be learned with assurance confidence, and consistent studying habits. It is not learned with nervousness. <br/>1.3              PURPOSE OR OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY:<br/>            The falling are in purpose of their study survey mirity high rate of failures in shorthand.<br/>The study will <br/>Survey  the high rate of failures in shorthand <br/>To identity the high rate of failures in shorthand.<br/>Find out if the students are responsible for their failures<br/>Find out if the teachers are responsible for the student failures.<br/> Identify the role of the school authorities in alleviating the problems facing the teaching and  learning of shorthand.<br/> 1.4              SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research work covers the department of the secretarial studies institute of management and technology Enugu.<br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>(1)        What are the causes of high rate of failures in shorthand?<br/>(2)               How can problem be solved?<br/>(3)               Would you attribute this failure rate to the students?<br/>(4)               Could  the rate of failures be attributed to the lecturers?<br/>(5)               What are the contraption of the school authorities alleviating the problem?<br/>17                SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The important of the study is to survey on the high rate of failures in shorthand.

The time and time again throughout the human history. Year after year in Nigeria, the increasing number of graduates joining the labour market keeping rising geometrically and any hope for them to secure jobs looks pessimistic. The tempo of economic development does not keep pace with the rate of educational advancement. That a developing country should suffer from surplus labour is hardly surprising, but generally, unemployment is one thing and graduate unemployment is another. Unemployment has in all it’s ramification come to stay with us sine the era of oil boom which has unfortunately turned to our doom. <br/>According to Daily Star, June 30 1986, unemployment is descried as a situation where there are few jobs to go round the great number of people wiling to work”. Here, it could be both educated and uneducated people in the country. Graduates unemployment has became some of the basic economic social and political problems facing so many states in Nigeria recently. The graduates in this context are generally the school leavers from our post primary and higher schools of learning. This pitiable “labour forces” who are left redundant are ever ready to put in their best services in any kind of jobs, but would not be called upon to do so because of the situation in the country. <br/>In Enugu metropolis, there hs been a persistent increase in the number of unemployed graduates of institutions of higher learning. It is a problem that has consistently forced itself on the minds of different people in different ages. It is time we redressed our mind sincerely to the issue of graduate unemployment. The past government officials in the state had failed to give an accurate employment figure of the labour force available and this has perpetuated to pose some dangerous threats to the socio-economic stability of the state than usual. <br/>On this note, therefore, it becomes imperative to give a brief definition of unemployment. According to Nigeria Statesman May 28, 1986, “Unemployment connotes the scarcity of job both in public and private sectors”. Also according to Weekly Star, August, 17 1986 “unemployment is the state of being unemployed” it further describes a person as unemployed when despite his ability and willingness to work is jobless. It is worthwhile to mention that all mentally and physically incapacities people are excluded. The researcher intended to concretize her ideas on those employment resulting from an unusual rise in the number of jobless graduate. This may be traceable to mismanagement of productive resources, immobility of labour between jobs, economic crisis like oil doom etc. especially in our predominately capitalist economy. <br/>Onsite unlike in the past, graduates of schools of higher learning now roam the streets and motor parks in search of non-existing job opportunities and this has created immeasurable number of social and economic problems in the states quo of the society. This problems therefore, is of staggering magnitude because idleness influences all our actions and designs. It corrupts the graduates and is the bane of the middle ages. This research is also intended to find out the root causes of the increasing number of unemployed graduates.  <br/>It is also inteneded to study in detail the past effect by both the pesent and past governments to pave out the predicament. It is of paramount importance to stress that no other economic problem needed more immediate attention than finding job for the growing number of unemployed graduates. <br/>In he light of this problems, the former Head of State and Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces General Sani Abacha in his 1st October, 1995 broadcast lifted the ban on employment. There is no doubt that the country has witnessed an upsurge in crime such as  drug addiction and sophisticated armed robberies while broken homes, malnutrition and many other social vices are on the increase too. <br/>Other factors that contributed to this situation also remain an integral part of this research. Such factors include the expansion of the existing schools and establishment of new schools without a collateral increase in industries to absorb produced graduates, the behaviour of graduate themselves towards jobs like farming construction of roads, bridges, school taxi cars and also the over-dependence of a mono-export-oriented economy etc. the efforts of the previous government in areas of infusion of skill-orientation in educational scheme will be scrutinized in order to have a balanced analysis.  Did the government evolves stringent measures aimed at eradicating problem of unemployment in the state or did they apply the myopic machineries which appealed to policy makers because of case or execution?  <br/>The answer to this question with relevance to the historical background of Enugu urban requires meticulous evaluation in order to find a lasting solution. <br/>The researcher will therefore, use questionnaire and review of past work in the same direction. <br/>Most regrettably, however, there is scarcity of domestic data relating to the number of unemployed graduate of school of higher learning.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>The unabated increase in the rate of unemployment among the youth, with particular emphasis on higher institution graduate has been a source of concern to the entire nation. Moreso, being aware of the social vices that this situation could result it makes sit more disabusing. This situation is a delima  when we consider many policies, and legislation so far put in place by the government  to cub this mince and how ineffective they have been as an instrument to reduce unemployment. The researcher having considered the above and decided to study the under listed problems with the view to x-raying then and possibly proffering lasting solutions to them. <br/>1)                  The increase in the rate of unemployment amongst higher institution graduate not withstanding that the federal government of Nigeria have lifted embargo on employment.<br/>2)                  The cream of he university graduate we have today includes those who have studied in very essential field which before now was not so. Nevertheless they suffer unemployment. <br/>3)                  The increase in eh scope of private sector participation which should result I the increase in employment of university graduate has not been true in our situation. <br/>4)                  The federal government recently increased the capital base of the bank of industry so as to allow more graduate to participate in the federal government graduate loan scheme, with the aim of being self employed, but this has not yielded any meaningful result or reduced the unemployment toll. <br/>1.3              OBJECTIVE / PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>This research aimed at identifying whether t here is problem of graduate unemployment of higher schools in Enugu metropolis. If the answer to the above is positive then, where it is shown to be in existence and at what magnitude and class of graduates find it difficult to secure employment? <br/>Having know the class, this research would also delve into knowing the impact and effect it has on the government and private enterprises generally.<br/>All these and many more will be effectively tackled in the course of the study and proffer solution to the problem in order to make a fruitful recommendation. The study will enable students in this field to make further research on the topic being treated. The recommendations there in will also help the government to find ways to alleviating unemployment problems.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Owing to the down turn in the economic fortunes of this country over the years, the Nigerian graduates have lost their pride of place. Their status in the society has continued to dwindle. <br/>Today, it is sheer mirage for fresh graduates to dream of the good things of life. They are made to understand and accept that the graduates, unemployment should be seen as a passing phase in the history of the nation. It is very doubtful if the much desired change in the near future will bring us anything. <br/>Therefore, this study is aimed at showing how these problems of unemployment among the graduates of institutions of higher learning could be eradicated. <br/>It is desirable to create a new forum in which the government plays a dominant role and actively promotes private enterprises, establishes new enterprises with a centrally directed mobilization of resources towards the definite objectives of solving the graduate problem. One makes hold to add that in choosing their course of studies, they should bear in mind that times have changed. No more straight jacket thinking. She should would excel in. <br/>The solution to this national malaise lies in turnaround or direction on the economy. <br/>1.5              SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>The study on the problem of graduate unemployment in institution of higher learning is such that would have taken her to different parts of the country. However, as a result of financial problems and more importantly the time factor she will be limiting this study tot here local government areas in Enugu Urban metropolises. They are Enugu North, Enugu East and Enugu West Local Government Councils. <br/>Due to the nature of topic, the researcher limits the respondents to unemployed graduates and some managerial.<br/>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.                  How is the current educational system serving our societal needs? <br/>2.                  Why then are the educated unemployed? <br/>3.                  Why is it that so many students still rush in search of education when they know that there is unemployment galore?  <br/>4.                  How for has the government address itself to the problems of graduate unemployment galore? <br/>5.                  By what means could the graduate unemployment be eradicated? <br/> 1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>UNEMPLOYMENT: This means involuntary idleness.

world today because of its ability to store, process and disseminate large amount of information accurately, efficiently and effectively for quick decision.<br/>According to Ani (200:5A), computer can be defined as an electronic tool capable of accepting data, interpreting data, performing ordered operation on data and reporting on the outcome of these operation.  It is therefore a tool managers can use to assist them in the complicated and time consuming task of generating information.<br/>The computer took many centuries to come to the age of four generation, reckoning from time, serious efforts began towards simplifying mathematical computations Quite a few people were involved in the development of the computer and several of the scientists who made those useful contributions did not really aim at developing a computer but their inventions turned out to be an important step towards the development of computer<br/>According to Alan Trunning (1937) showed that a computer can be built with a set of simple instruction while any problem having a logical solution can be reduced to a solution based upon a small set of simple instruction.  A few years later, John Von Neuman (1946) set out a summary of the design requirement far a modern computer as follows:-<br/>1.                  The processing of data instructions which include the use of modification of programs.<br/>2.                  Binary codes is used to represent data and instruction in a way that makes no distinction of the two and still allow them the storage space in the computer.<br/>Based on those contributions and innovations of these scientists and others, the modern computer came to be.  IT underwent series of improvement which gave rise to farth computer generation, before we have today, MODERN COMPUTER.<br/>However, the introduction of this general purpose device and machine and simple programming languages greatly increased the computer utility especially in management information system (MIS) which basically deals on how information is obtained, retrieved and utilized.  Computers are now indispensable tools in any business activities because electronic data processing is growing and meeting the expected need of people’s speed, accuracy and efficiency in handling of data and security.  IT also extended to other areas such as marketing, accounting, inventory management and production process.<br/>      According to Lutter Quick (1954) The concept of management information system (MIS) was formulated by Lutter Quick whole delivering a speech in October, 1960 at Ihe Rochester Institute of Technology, their are then it become obvious and necessary that information should play a vital role in the solution of business and management problems in a price-meal fashion thereby focusing almost entirely on the mechanization of all office chores.<br/>      Basically, Management Information System attempt to provide managers at all levels with the information they need to guide their enterprises.  It provides an organization with flexible integrated tool for the planning and control function of their endeavours, with the ability to planned and unplanned information requirement at all management levels.<br/>      According to Onuigbo (1990:487) Management information System (MIS) is he formal processing and dispersing of information in internal and external within the organization in an effective and efficient manner.<br/>      Primarily, the management information system (MIS) is set up of the purpose of providing, planning and controlling information to all levels of management to effect appropriate decision making.  Thus, it does this by gathering data, inputting and processing them into information and further dissemination these items of information, we can therefore, say that management information system can be sub-divided into functional information system such as marketing information system, Ihe financial information system and Ihe personnel information system and so on depending on the type of organization.<br/>      The management information system provides managements with varying information depending on the level, thereby making increased in the efficiency of the organization through better management decisions.<br/>            However, owing to the fact that organizations have grown in sizes, information flow has become so voluminous that face to face communication and even writing memoranda can no longer effect adequate communication or effective processing of data.  The management information system of these organizations have in recent times fond it difficult to meet with The increasing demand being made on information as a result, The manual means o operation is Jam-packet with scored of data to be processed.  Hence delay and inaccuracies in data collection and analysis.  Delay often makes decision making to be inaccurate.  Also, there is problem of misappropriation of important document of files or even cases of stolen files.<br/>HISTORY OF FIRST BANK AND ITS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM<br/>            First Bank of Nigeria Plc, was founded in 1894 by a shipping magnate form Liverpool, Sir Alfred Jones, the Bank commenced as a small operation in the office of Elder Dempster and Company in Lagos.<br/>            The Bank was incorporated as a limited liability company on March 31, 1894, with Head Office in Liverpool.  It started business under the corporate name of the Bank for British West African (BBWA) with a paid up capital of 12,000 pounds starting, after absorbing its predecessor, Ihe Africa Banking Corporation, which was established earlier in 1892.  This signaled the pre-eminent position which the Bank was to establish in the banking industrial in West Africa.  In the early years of operations, Ihe bank recorded an impressive growth and  worked closely with the colonial Government in performing the traditional functions of a Central Bank, such as issue of specie in the  West Africa sub region.<br/>            To justify its west Africa coverage, a branch was opened in Accra, Gold coast (now Aghana) in 1896 and another in Freetown, Sierra Leone in  1898.  These marked Ihe genesis of the Bank’s international banking operations.  The second branch of the Bank in Nigeria was in the old Calabar in 1960 and two years later services were extended to Northern Nigeria.<br/>            To satisfy the needs of its customers, first bank has diversified into a wide range of Banking activities and services.  The include corporate, Retail and Mortgage Banking, Registrar ship private equity financing, trusteeship and Insurance Brokerage.  In addition as part of its strategy of progressive internationalization, in November 2002, Ihe Bank become the first financial institution in Nigeria to establish a subsidiary bank in the United Kingdom.<br/>            Over the year, Ihe Bank has experienced phenomenal growth.  With a share capital of N53.6 million in 1980, Ihe Banks share capital grew to N1.270 billion as at march 2003.<br/>The Banks total asset base was N320.58 billion while its deposit base stood at N193.955 billion as at March 2003. Also, Ihe Bank’s market capitalization stood at N66.05 billion i.e N25.00k per share as at 31st March 2003.<br/>            IN 1957, it changed its name from Bank of British West African to Bank of West Africa.  In 1969, Ihe Bank was incorporated locally as the standard Bank of Nigeria limited in line with the companies Decree of 1968.<br/>            Changes in the name of the Banks also occurred in 1979 and 1991, to first Bank of Nigeria limited and first Bank of Nigeria Plc, respectively.<br/>            The Bank has continued to be a leader in financing loan term development of the economy which was demonstrated.  In 1947 when the first long term loan was advanced to Ihe then colonial Government.  To demonstrate its commitment to its customers and Ihe development of the Nigerian economy, Ihe bank has since broadened its loan and credit port-floes the various sectors of the economy.<br/>            The Bank has improved tremendously judging from a number of parameters including number of branches, growth in deposit base, asset size and size of loans and advances.<br/>            Furthermore, its track record of profitability and reliability in sound banking has continually placed the Bank in its leadership position.<br/>1.1              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Many years ago, all business data were processed manually.  This was not always a satisfactory method because it was so slow.  Most organization in this country have been encountering business information problem because of manual method used.  These problems affected their level of performance in terms of output and quality of services.<br/>Furthermore, there are other problems relating to the international structure and functions of the organization which include personnel turnover, loss of records, expensive communication, equipment, record, storage system problem such  as collection, processing, storage and retrial and distribution of information which play a vital role in the decision making processes.<br/>            The first Bank personnel have in Ihe past been denied of the gadget with modern technology to aid them in enhancing efficient and effective service in discharging their professional carrier.<br/>It is in the light of the awareness that  Ihe researcher chose Ihe topic A study of computer in management information system to solve the problem of ineffective information system which bugged organization far many years.<br/> 1.2              THE AIM/PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>The aim of this study is<br/>1.                  To determine to what extent management information system has facilitated information flow in First Bank Plc, Enugu.<br/>2.                  To determine if there are lapses in the management information system in First Bank PLC, Enugu.<br/>3.                  To find out the contributions of management information system towards Ihe achievement of First Bank’s goal?<br/>1.3              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study will be most useful to First Bank Plc, Enugu.  It will be also be useful to individual, public sectors, state and federal government establishment that uses computer on management information system.<br/>It will also serve as a data bank for future research on mis and addition to materials already existing in the library.  The study will also be of much significant important to institutions that offer management information system as a course and Ihe establishment that may like to open the union on management information system.<br/>It will also remedy the force found on those already operating Ihe system with some discrepancies.<br/>1.4              SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is delimited to the use of computer in Management Information System in First Bank PLC, Enugu.<br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>The following questions will be used in writing the project:<br/>1.                  How far has management informative system facilitated the information flow in First Bank PLC, Enugu.<br/>2.                  What are Ihe lapses in the management information system of First Bank PLC Enugu.<br/>3.                  What are Ihe contributions of management information system towards Ihe achievement of First Bank’s goal?<br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE USE OF COMPUTER IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM IN FIRST BANK PLC, ENUGU<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE USE OF COMPUTER IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM IN FIRST BANK PLC, ENUGU", "id": 91}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>IMPACT OF MOTIVATION OF WORKERS IN SOME SELECTED ORGANIZATION<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE LIMITED ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study investigated the impact of motivation on the staff of Emenite Limited Enugu.

However, the answer we got points at motivation which is a term popularly used to refer to the cause or way of behaviour.  Because psychologist are aware that many aspects of behaviour are determined by motivation or learning.  They confided the concept of motivation to those factors which energize and give direction to behaviour.  Usually a motivated person will engage in an activity more vigorously and more efficiently than an unmotivated person.  Apart form activating a person or other organisms, motivation tends to direct or focus behaviour.  For instance, a thirsty person is always ready to look for water to drink.<br/>Motivation is the act of making workers strive hard in order to achieve the overall objective of the organization and the employer does so in anticipation of attaining specific goals.  The word motivation is derived from the word motive, which is impulse or desire that moves one towards a goal.  A motive is an inner states that direct a person to seek to satisfy a felt need.<br/>In this country (Nigeria) the positive instrument in the motivation of labour is money.  Some management think that by increasing the worker’s pay or wage packet, they have gone a long way to achieve industrial peace, harmony, low labour turnover, increased productivity, employees loyalty, commitment and dedication to duty.<br/>The Nigerian workers does not only want increase in pay, he also wants to be recognized, enjoy the work he is doing, be proud of the work and also to be identified with it<br/>In the time past, Nigerian workers might be satisfied with mere basic necessities of life and cared less about the future.  But in recent times, they have been exposed to the good things of life, and are willing to work hard to get them.<br/>            Motivation could be channeled towards the wrong direction by management’s concentrations on good payment and allowances only.  This means that the motivation will be ineffective.  A good motivational factor could be in the form of provisions of transport facilities for workers who experience difficulty in getting to the work place, housing allowance, medical services etc these will help the workers and at the same time induce productivity.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>In these days of harsh economic conditions many industries are finding it difficult to keep a float.  On the other hand others like Emenite, Anammco etc.  are growing from strength to strength.  Both the thriving and non-thriving industries are operating under the same environment.  Why then are some succeeding and others not succeeding?  This brings us to the central point of this research motivation.  What strategies are being adopted by the different companies in motivating their staff.  Is the success of a company dependent on the motivational strategies being used in the company? Could a company’s futures be improved by adopting a more forward looking motivational strategy.  These and many more are the questions which this research seeks to answer.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study are:-<br/>1.                  To identify some of the impact of motivation on the workers.<br/>2.                  To identify some of the problems associated with motivation of workers<br/>3.                  To identify some of the prospects of motivation on staff<br/>4.                  To identify whether adequate motivation on the part of the workers has any effect on production.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This project if successfully completed shall help some of the selected organization in adopting the best motivational procedures that will enhance productivity; as well as boosting the morale of the workers.<br/>Also it will help some other consumer – students, workers, manager etc. in their further studies of motivational structures and approaches.<br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>The following questions have been formulated as a guide for this study:<br/>1.                  What are the impact of motivation on staff?<br/>2.                  What are the problems associated with motivation on staff?<br/>3.                  What are the prospects associated with motivation on staff?<br/> <br/>\n\nIMPACT OF MOTIVATION OF WORKERS IN SOME SELECTED ORGANIZATION\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE LIMITED ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF MOTIVATION OF WORKERS IN SOME SELECTED ORGANIZATION\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE LIMITED ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 92}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>STAFF DISENGAGEMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON THE MORALE OF WORKERS<br/>A CASE STUDY OF FEDERAL, RADIO CORPORATION OF NIGERIA, ENUGU<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The project work is a survey of the effect of diengagement on the moral of workers in federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria Enugu.

Nigeria Broad casting corporation (NBCC) and was opened in march 28, 1955 by Sir Lan Jacob K.B.E.C.B. who was then the Director General of the British Broad casting corporation.  Later the name was changed from Nigeria Broad casting corporation to federal Radio corporation of Nigeria by a Degree promulgated on February 28, 1979.<br/>            The degree took retrospective effect from April 1, the degree has since been changed to an act of parliament No. 8 of 1979 in consonance with the democratic presidential system now being operated in Nigeria.<br/>            Consequent upon the provisions of this act quoted above, the federal government of Nigeria has established four zonal stations in Enugu Ibadan, Kaduna, Lagos including the voice of Nigeria (VON) which though on its own but nevertheless takes care of the external services of the corporation.<br/>            The federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria now has its head quarters at Abuja, the federal capital Territory of Nigeria.  Also on 1st July, 2001 the Radio Nigeria started its own FM transmission in Nigeria.<br/>            The act which Established, the federal Radio corporation of Nigeria also stipulated that the corporation shall amongst other things to the exclusion of any other broadcasting authority in Nigeria be:-<br/>i.                    Responsible for radio broadcasting in short-ware or powerful medium wave for effective and simultaneous reception in more than one state of the federation at any one time.<br/>ii.                  It shall be the duty of the corporation to provide as a public service, in the interests of Nigeria.<br/>iii.                The corporation shall ensure that the services which it provides, when considered as a whole, shall reflect the unity of nIgeria as a federation and the same time give adequate expression of the cultural characteristics and opinions of each state of the federation.  A part from its legal name of federation radio corporation of Nigeria, the corporations national character is equally reflected in as –on-the-air identifications name of Radio Nigeria as appellation exclusively of Nigeria.<br/>The structure of corporation as at present constituted, it based on zoning of the country with emphasis on broad casting in twelve Nigeria language viz Edo, Efik, fulfulda, Hausa, Igala, Igbo, Izon, Kanuri, NNPe, Tio, Urhobo and Yoruba, such as to ensure that at least 85% of the population of the country are covered by their programmes in these languages.  Staff strength of about 847, 340 workers were disengaged that is about 40% of the total work force.<br/>      Subsequently, in December 31, 1995, out of about 400 staff, 95 were disengaged and in March 1999 out of 300 staff about 80 workers were disengaged.<br/>In almost all the instance of disengagement of workrs, the major reasons have been:-<br/>a.                   years of service:  that is some workers may have reached the retiring age and service of 60 years

condition<br/>f.                   Over-staffing<br/>The above reasons shall be discussed in detail in chapter 2 of this research work.<br/>            The problems of this research work will there fore be to find out of the above claimed reasons for disengagement of workers were the true reasons for the exercise or not a combination of other sets of behaviour by a worker and the criteria for selecting them.<br/>            In addition, the researcher work  will also be interest in finding out the effect of this be interest I finding out the effect of this exercise on the remaining workers in the corporation that is it there has been any noticeable change in productivity and in what direction.  The researchers lens will also be focused on the effect of this exercise on the external environment.<br/>            That is the people outside the organization, socially, economically and so on.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The containing economic depression which Nigeria has been passing through for some years now has compelled citizens, industrial and business establishment big and small to take for reaching measures in the struggle for survival the economic depression such as:-<br/>1.                  The difficult and stringent conditionality, which Nigeria government must, met before a IMF loan is given.<br/>2.                  delay in passing the budget estimate in Nigeria.<br/>3.                  delay in given subvention to parastatal.<br/>The successive disengagement exercises currently taking place in Nigeria public service poses Economic and social problems.<br/>            According to Websters winth new collegiate dictionary (1983:1007) Retrenchment is the act of cutting down expenses live more cheaply.<br/>            While disengagement means to the (oneselt) from an engagment, to reduce amount of curtail expenses in order to elenomize, it could also be seen as the act of terminating the services of a worker, when the job ceases to exist, usually as a result of technology, political or economic changes.  Disengagement, which is a recent-phenomenon in the history of public services in Nigeria started in the middle 70’s by then military Head of state as a result of economic recession during the period.<br/>According to Adebayo (1994:113) there was a general purge (in 1975) of the public services in which though the intention was lauclable, the execution left much to be desired.  The good were thrown, out with the bad.  Those who survived the hole cast were told that their advice would be sought it and when need and that their main task was to carry out orders handed down to them.<br/>            It may not be an overstatement to say that most developing countries of the world including Nigeria has been going through a recession, but nevertheless the Nigeria case has been a very peculiar situation because it has resulted in many people losing their job.  This could be seen in an editoral, agory of Retrenchment, by Agbese (1985:6-7) where in federal radio corporation of Nigeria Enugu zone, out of a total enable him give out his best in the achievement of the organization objectives.<br/>            This research work will therefore proceed pragmatically on the above theory Y, taking cognizance of the fact that, no one suffering from a feeling o fear and depression can be expected to be efficient at his work (Adebayo 1994:115).<br/>Research questions<br/>1.                  Why were workers in federal radio corporation of Nigeria Enugu disengaged recently?<br/>2.                  what are the effects of this disengagement on the mrale and productivity of the workers in federal radio corporation of Nigeria Enugu.<br/>3.                  what are the possible social and economic consequences of disengagement?<br/>4.                  what alternative action would you have preferred to government take?<br/>1.3              OBJECTIVES / PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>Disengagement of workers is an event currently taking place throughout the country.  It had reached its heights since th emilitary found themselves into the position of leadership in Nigeria.  It is therefore the aim of this study to find out the effect this exercise has had on the morale of the still employed workforce.<br/>            To this end, the researcher will find out amount other things:-<br/>a.                   Reasons for the disengagement of workers and the criteria in selecting who were to go.<br/>b.                  How workers feel and think about disengagement exercise.<br/>c.                   How disengagement affects their productivity and attitude to work, that is whether the exercise has made them work harder because of the fear of loosing their job and also it they feel alienated from jobs.<br/>d.                  Social and economic consequences of disengagement of workers.<br/>e.                   Prefer solutions to the findings other researcher.<br/>1.4              THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>According to Iie (1999: 252) city Mc Gregary (1960:35-48), here developed two theories or assumption of human behaviours namely, theories X and Y theory.<br/>            The basic assumptions of theory x are:-<br/>1.                  work, it not down right distasteful is an enormous there to be performed in order to survive.<br/>2.                  the average human being has an inhenent dislike of work and will avoid it he can.<br/>3.                  because of his characteristic dislike of work, most people must be coerced controlled, directed or treated with punishment to put forth adequate effort, towards the achievemtn of organizational objectives.<br/>4.                  the average human being prefers to be directed, wishes to avoid responsibility, has relatively little ambition, wants security above all.<br/>Theory Y<br/>The basic assumptions of theory Y are:-<br/>1.                  the expenditure of physical energy and mental effort in work is as natural as play or rest.<br/>2.                  external control and the threat of punishment are not the only, means for bringing about effort towards the achievement of organizations objectives.  Man will exercise self direction self control in the service of objectives to which he is committed.<br/>3.                  commitment to objectives is a function of the rewards associated with their achievements.<br/>4.                  the average human being learns under proper condition not only to accept but seek responsibility.<br/>5.                  the capacity to exercise a relatively high degree of juvenility and creatively in the solution of organization problems is widely, not narrowly distributed in the population.<br/>6.                  under the conditions of modern title intellectual potentialities of the average human being are only partially utilized.  According to Olewe et al 91994: 168) the level of performance of a worker is a function of his abilities and will.  A workers ability determines how he can do the work, while will determines what he would do.<br/>When the will is positive, workers output would increase, but where it is negative, works’ performance level would be low.<br/>            As a result of the above and in agreement with theory Y above.  It is the opinion of the researcher that disengagement of workers should not be used as a deterrent to the still employed state as this could be counter productive an average human being needs to be motivated and assumed of the security of his job to the incessant frequent and unplanned disengagement (Lay-offs, management successions etc) of workers especially in Enugu zone of the federal radio corporation of Nigeria has in no small way militated against the achievement of the set goods of the corporation.<br/>            The research is therefore, aimed at finding the effect of disengagement on the morale of the skill employed work force of the corporation.  That is, if they felt threaten and their morale is high and they have become more productive because of the exercise.<br/>1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>For quite some years now, disengagement of workers have been the order of  day especially in the public service.  It has reached a crises situation since the ministry take over of government in this country.<br/>            The seriousness of this exercise has made the executive of the Nigerian Labour congress (NLC) to cry out on behalf of their members to the government, both federal and state to stop further disengaement of workers, because it is subjecting members of NLC to some very hard conditions and untold hard ship.<br/>            It is based on the above premise that the research is being carried out. Hoping that through the resulting of this research, the true effect of disengagement would be known.<br/>            However, where disengagement is done on the basis of in efficiency, redundancy etc.  this work would emphasis the fact that employers do not always disengaged just to save cost or to come out of recession  but also, that efficiency dedication and hard work.  On the part of employee are rewarding.<br/>            Finally, it is hoped that the research paper would be of help to others who would want to explore the more.<br/>1.6              SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will be limited to the federal Radio corporation of Nigeria, Enugu zone is a delimitation on its own since federal radio corporation of Nigeria has four zonal offices plus Abuja.  The Headquarter, therefore the researcher has decided to restrict the scope of this study to the identification and making of recommendation on the problem of disengagement with emphasis on Enugu zone of the corporation located at Onitsha road, in the Northem part of the capital city of Enugu state.<br/><br/>\n\nSTAFF DISENGAGEMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON THE MORALE OF WORKERS A CASE STUDY OF FEDERAL, RADIO

STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This study was aimed at examining the role being played by the small and medium scale enterprises towards economic growth of an economy with E-nugu state as our case study.  From the study, it was observed that indeed, small and medium scale enterprises contribute to the economic development of Enugu state.<br/>            Lack of adequate finance was identified as one of the mayor problems hampering the development of small and medium scale enterprise in Enugu state.<br/>            In order to provide a sound theoretical framework and sound judgement for the work, the work of other researchers in the same issue were reviewed.<br/>            The use of Taro-Yamani Statistical formular was used in selecting an adequate sample size for the study from the population.<br/>            A total of six hypothesis were formulated and also tasted using the chi-square method of hypothesis testing.<br/>            In order to elicit proper information from the respondents who are both illitrate and litrate, the researcher utilized both questionnaire and interview.  The data collected were properly analyzed using the table and simple percentage response formular.<br/>            In the final analysis, the research work found out that small and medium scale enterprises affects the economic growth of the Enugu State Economy.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The term business, has over the years turned out to be a house hold name.  In different places and under different circumstances, people have tended to give the term “business” different definitions and meanings.  However, it is also important to note, that in some instances, the dimension and size of an organization or an enterprise can determine the order of its definition.<br/>            In some instances, business can be regarded as the performance of the entrepreneurial function of co-rdination of all the factors of production – labour, capital, natural resources and management to provide goods and services which may be sold at a profit.<br/>            It therefore follows that business entails the proper coordination of the various factors of production with a view of utilizing them in the production of the necessary goods and services in order to maker prodit.<br/>            Business enterprises have also been identified to operate of the basis of different levels and capabilities.  These ranges from small privately owned enterprises to large organizations that are either privately or publidy owned.<br/>            Based on the above definition of business, one would understand some basic issues.  This include the fact that business are organized with the purpose of making profit.  Therefore in essence, a good business venture is one in which is geared towards profit making.  Therefore in a qust to make profit, the business organization must surly operate in an existing environment.<br/>            Having said that established the fact that most business establishments are geared towards profit making and at the sarve time that business organization exists within an environment, it will be wise to say that the environment of any business venture surly contributed to the success or failure of such a business.<br/>            Based on this, it is wise to examine on the other way round if there is any role the business organization on their own part does for the environment.  This assentron will for the bedrock of this study which centers on examining the role of small and medium scale business enterprises to the economic development of the economy with emphasis on Enugu state.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The import of entrepreneurial resource as a crucial input process of material development is becoming widely recognized, with growing emphasis on the role of small and medium scale enterprises in view of their contribution to general economic growth. (Ezeh 1998) Observed that, even where there are incentives and inducements, it is found from experience that entrepreneurs do not respond spontaneously to available business opportunities.  This according to (Makinde 1999) can be attributed to inadequate intrastructural facilities and lack of access to bank credits.  However, in most cases this is attributed to the low economic activities within the economy.<br/>It is thus against this backdrop that the researcher intends to find out the impact of the small and medium scale enterprises towards the economic development of the economy, with emphasis on Enugu state.<br/>1.3              STATEMENT OF RESEARCH OBJECTIVES<br/>One of the objectives of this study is to find out if small and medium scale enterprises in Enugu state have any effect on the economic development of Enugu state economy.<br/>Having noted that Enugu state is one of the environments in which there is the existence of small and medium scale enterprise.<br/>More importantly, the study is also directed at ascertaining of the effect of the small and medium enterprises in Enugu state is positive or negative oriented.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study intends to analyze the small and medium scale enterprise in Enugu state with respect to their contribution to the development of Enugu state.<br/>            The study will help in a proper understanding of the role and effect of small and medium scale enterprises on an economy.<br/>            It is hoped that this research work if properly and adequately done to its logical conclusion will enable policy makers and manyers understand the impact and the nud to encourage the establishment of small and medium scale enterprises in Enugu state as well as the other states of the federation.<br/>            The study will help policy makers and business men and women to appreciate and evaluate the impact of small and the medium scale enterprises.<br/>            Finally it is hoped that this study will benefit feature researchers in this area of study and also help every Nigerian appreciate the small and medium scale venture in Enugu state and Nigeria.<br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>To be in a very good position to tackle the problem environmental in this study, a number of questions are outlined which the researcher feels would aid in the proper tacking of this study.  The questions includes the following.<br/>1.                  Has small and medium scale enterprise played any role on the economic development of Enugu state?<br/>2.                  To what extent has the small and medium scale enterprises contributed to economic development of Enugu state?<br/>3.                  How does the small and medium scale enterprise contribute to the economic development of Enugu State?<br/>4.                  What factors contribute in helping small and medium scale enterprises contribute to the economic development of Enugu state.<br/>5.                  Are there need to encourage the establishment of small and medium scale enterprise in Enugu State?<br/>1.6              RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>In order to enable the researcher adequately arrive at answers to the already outlined research problems and research questions, the following hypothesis were drawn.<br/>Hi:       Small and medium scale enterprise have effect on the economic development of Enugu state.<br/>1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>ROLE<br/>OPERATIONAL<br/>            The contribution or the significance of the small

Shortly after the initial stride at technological advancement, many scientists delved deeper into the various strata of technologing, thus arousing a conscious investigation of the consequences of the trend. <br/>          The introduction of machines becomes the second development in man’s need to increase productivity and job performance.<br/>          However, the urge to introduce these machines is as old as man. It started with the pre-historic man, the tool maker, who used stored tools to represent a conscious extension of man’s physical effort under the control of man’s intelligence to the time when Christopher shoes presented the world with the first practical typewriter in 1973.   <br/>          Henceforward, technological advances in office machines and related equipment have continued to progress with amazing speed. <br/>According to Gratside (1976). <br/>          Efficiency in the office is just as important as efficiency in the factory, and efforts to improve productivity in the office have never been greater than now.<br/>          This shows therefore, that the technological advancements in the present day offices did not come by chance but the necessity in the office to increase the job performance of office workers. <br/>          Generally, the pre-modern office was characterized and powered by human muscle. Technological advancement therefore saw t the introduction of more mechanized or modern office machines particularly, the present day ‘automated office.’ Encyclopaedia Britannica (1980: 509) defined ‘automation’ as these processes in which mechanism are used to perform tasks the previously required the attention of control of human beings. It went further to say that the manufacturer of such machines and appliances had become a major world industry in which new product were constantly under development. <br/>          The computer, as a consequence of the advance in technology, has greatly revolutionized the concept of secretarial work in the office. The complexities and tediousness involved in the job of secretaries are drastically reduced. Certain anomalies ranging from monitory (job boredom) loss of record transportation cost, expensive bottlenecks to records, storage, etc which a common phenomena in the pre-modern office which used to lead to job dissatisfaction of secretaries are fast phasing out. <br/>          Nowadays, owing to the advancement, particularly, in information technology, data communication systems and automatic retrieval of information, sophisticated IBN electric typewriters, automatic typewriters, word processors and host of others are now in vogue. Infact, the office has taken urgent step towards a more advanced stage of mechanized and computerized environment. <br/>          One should therefore, not be astounded when aspect of secretarial work is found to be automated with great momentum.  This is because the modern office is information based and the secretary is the private on which the wheel of information rotates, therefore, the fact that information is of cardinal importance in an industry is undoubtedly, the rationale behind the creation of awareness of technology in office function. <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>This study is concerned with finding out the “contributions of technological advancement towards the job satisfaction of secretaries.  <br/>The study will inter-alia, reveal the rate at which the use of high sophisticated office machines affected the accuracy and productivity of secretaries.<br/>1.3 THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY   <br/>Technology has a broader meaning than mere equipment/machines. It involves new way to value our work force to configure our organization to assess productivity and manage the ever more complex cycle of change in the job, meanwhile, the purpose are:<br/>1.      To find out some of the automated machines and equipment that are manned by secretaries. <br/>2.      To find out whether secretaries are happy using these machines or whether they view it as a burden.<br/>3.      To find whether these machines actually improved their productivity and ensure accuracy in their job performance. <br/>4.      To find out whether the period and methods of training received at schools by secretaries are enough for them to acquire the skills necessary to face the challenges of manning these modern office machines effectively. <br/>5.      To offer suggestions and recommendations based on the findings.<br/>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research was limited to secretaries and their bosses in twenty-two organizations made up of both public and private co-operations and government ministries in the research town, Enugu. <br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>For the purpose of this study, the following research questions were formulated by the researcher:  <br/>1.    Are there special modern or mechanized machines in the office for secretaries to increase their product? <br/>2.    How does the introduction of modern office machines which seem to turn secretaries into mere machines operators result in job dissatisfaction on the part of secretaries?  <br/>3.    To what extent are secretaries exposed to proper orientation and training in school to enable them operate the modern machines effectively and efficiently? <br/>4.    How adversely do machines that lack adequate maintenance affect the job performance of secretaries? <br/>5.    Do you think that secretaries are paid amount commensurate with the training received and the type of job performed? <br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  <br/>This rise in office work, the trends in use of automation and the growing urge of people everywhere to know and experience, to enjoy and endure the distance features of a technological society have investigated the researcher to have vested interested in this topic. <br/>The researcher is of the opinion that the out come of his study will be beneficial:-  <br/>1.    To the suppliers of office machines and equipment as the will provide them with the much desired feed back as to the effectiveness and acceptability of their products. <br/>2.    To secretaries as they will become aware of the extent of satisfaction devisable from the use of modern office machines. <br/>3.    To secretaries because it will create tremendous impact on their standard of performance on their duties.  <br/>4.    To both private and public sector employers who are yet to take decisions as to whether or not to automate their offices. <br/>5.    To prospective secretaries who are yet to join the world of work to become aware of the importance of possessing a mastery on how these hi-tech machines are manned.<br/>6.    To the public as they will now be able to identify secretaries from other tied staff and their actual roles. <br/>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>1.   Modern Office Machines:- this are the more mechanized that are in use in the office in our present day e.g, word processors computers and other electronic office gadgets that are capable of operating automatically or at least with minimum human intervention. <br/>2.   Robot:- Machines made to act like man, machines that does the work in place of human.<br/>3.   Hi-Tech Machines:- Machines that are virtually on the verge of computer automation. <br/>4.   E.D.P:- Electronic data processing.<br/>IMPACT: The influence or storing effect on impression that hi- tech machines have on the duties of secretaries. <br/>5.    OFFICE AUTOMATION:- this office machines used to perform tasks that are previously performed manually. <br/>6.   JOB PERFORMANCE:- the act or process of carrying out duties by secretaries. USA refers to work in which details are to added or one reduces the smallest possible numbers.<br/> <br/><br/>\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT TOWARDS THE JOB SATISFACTION OF SECRETARIES.

A critical look at this statement reveals that the secretarial profession is being dominated by the female secretaries in recent years the sole aim of every organization is its survival. As a result of this the employer of labor should make conscious efforts to ensure that the organization has the right to cheval caliber of employees who will contribute vigorously to the achievement of the organizational goals and who are also expected to portray a good image of the organization. All these have a lot of impacts in an organization particularly when it comes to business. As a result of numerous and sensitive nature of secretarial profession, there is need for a balance labor force to save the employers from the problems of whom to employ and whom not to employ in the past secretarial profession was perceived to be for females only and that males who engage in it do it as a last resort. Some have the impression that secretaries are females who took down notes and correspondence like shorthand and transcribe on the typewriter for their male executives or managers. It was also a synonym for females who organize and run small offices for their male employers they carryout all office jobs ranging from hiring junior staff keeping cash books and arranging for the day to day office routines, they are regarded as the channel of communication between their employers and the rest of the staff with constant demand on their ability, they are expected to be tactful, loyal, efficient discrete and maintain confidentiality they are expected to put in all their energy and enthusiasm to their boss interest, protecting him from undesirable demand and interruption, the above assumption about secretaries in the pas as “female who run office for males employers or boss is not the case these days. Analysis recently has shown that the advancement of secretarial profession was expanded and  this is becoming more complex and challenging the roles of secretaries have increased tremendously to include other functions which are of great importance to any organization these made if possible for males to engage in the profession not as a last resort once more. At least in out of fire secretaries two are males.<br/>            National Secretarial Association of the United States of America defines a secretary as “An executive assistance, posing a good mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibilities without direct supervision display initiatives exercises judgment and make decisions within the scope of his/her authority”<br/>            Harding (1988) went further to define a secretary as “one who provides a full range of management support which calls upon in a variety of skills and abilities that would certainly not be prerequisite office staff generally”. In these definitions, we see that secretary is an important officer in any establishment his works has even become more technical especially the advent of computers and other machines.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            The issue of down-turn in male students enrollment in secretarial studies department is reaching an alarming properties as industries employ more female secretaries this among others problems gave rise to this topic generally, the problem include that <br/>1.      It is not known whether parents no longer afford to support their male children financially once they get close to adulthood.<br/>2.      It is today a saying that males are becoming impatient with the unemployment status of the males graduates in the society.

<br/>Business center or company is not merely a work place in an office, but in addition to that it is a social environment. Business activities in this aforementioned places embraces human relations which in turn involve individual and group behaivour and these attitudes emanate from different natural instincts and circumstances affecting us as individual or as a group. <br/>In any organization, the effectives and overall efficiency depends on the people in the organization. It then follows that the sole aim of the study of behavior in an organization is to observe, analyze and see how incentives influences people’s at work. In carrying out this task, we ought to know what people do why they do it and how they are doing it to reach the desired goal.  <br/>In working condition, two pivotal questions seem to be on one’s mind: what causes people to do the things they do? And how their performance can be improved substantially?<br/>According to Thorndike; we tend to respect those actions which attract satisfaction and reward and avoid those ones which brings reprisal and punishment (Zimbardo and Ruch 1997). <br/>The theory tagged “The imperial law of effects states that any act which in a given situation produces satisfaction, tends to be associated with that situation, so that when the situation re occurs, the act is more likely than ever before to reoccur again; conversely, any act which in a given situation produces discomfort becomes disassociated from that situation so that when the situation reoccurs, the act is less likely than before to reoccur again from practical point of view; Thorndike’s observation is still valid. Most people tend to see reward and avoid punishment in most of their activities.<br/>On the same line of reasoning, skinner noted that “animals learn to associate potential rewards with certain activities and strife to achieve reward CPM Film 1975”; if there is no reinforcement for behaviors, skinner maintained, it will gradually disappear, for example; Emery air freight (USA) developed a system that provided feedback to employees on their job performance. Workers could then measure their own improvement and success. Management reinforced the changes with praise and recognition. <br/>The programme has produced significant cost saving and improved quality; lowered absenteeism and raised employee’s hope and moral. In any organization, both the managers and employees in a were environment frequently discover that they have different priorities and areas of primary interests. It has also been observed that managers tend to think mainly towards achieving the organizational goals; the overall effectiveness and efficiency of services and profit while non management staffs or employees are more concerned with personal or human values like good pay packet, fair treatment, security of job and opportunity for advancement etc. <br/>Managers in trying to achieve the organization goal have to work with people in the organization to achieve these goals. It is an established fact that people have always worked for the benefit derivable from such work. However, according to Akpala (1990) “pay is only one element of work”. Employees have complex needs that are not only influenced by their immediate managers but also by other employees and the type of work they are assigned and the organizations to which they belong. <br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>In an organization, there exists a policy on human relations. These are also officers who handle such human relations issues for the organization. The problem is that is has not yet been know whether business institutions often have good or solid policies on human relations that affects both their staff and their customers.<br/>The researcher does not know the impact these policies have on the secretaries in these organizations. Equally, the secretaries continually wonder whether sound human relation policies have any impact on them. consequently if it has, they have never know the impact whether positive or negative. <br/> Therefore, this study sought out human relations policies available in Emenite Plc and Amah Breweries Limited Ngwo. The study also sought out he effect while there policies have on the productivity of secretaries serving in there companies. <br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of the study is to <br/>1.                  Find out whether there are human relations policies in EMENITE PLC and AMAH BREWERIES LIMITED NGWO.<br/>2.                  Find out what these policies are <br/>3.                  Find if these policies affect secretaries. <br/>4.                  Find out whether these policies have impact on secretaries performance.  <br/>5.                  Find out if these companies entertain difficulties in maintaining these policies.<br/>1.4                SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study will be useful to business organization in Nigeria, in determining how to maintain sound human relation policies that would increase the morals of their workers. It will also enable them to know where to adjust and to adopt standard and documented human relations policies that would help to achieve effectiveness and efficiency. <br/>The study will also be beneficial to secretaries as it will enhance their knowledge and to be aware of what is expected of them form their employees. The study will of human relations as it will give hem more knowledge on the nature of human relations policies. The study will also be a reference point in solving human relations problem.<br/>1.5              THE EFFECT IN ASSUMPTIONS OF TE STUDY <br/>It is assumed that in an organization where people come together to work and produce, there must exist human elations policies which may either not document. Therefore we  assume that EMENITE PLC and AMAH BREWERIES NGWO and THE EFFECTS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES have human relations policies. We assume that good human relations policies help to achieve the organizational goals and improved efficiency and effectiveness at work.<br/>The researcher assumes that if human relations policies in EMENITE PLAC and AMAH BREWERIES NGWO and THE EFFECTS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES are such that motivates workers adequately, secretaries morale maybe raised. It is also hoped that increased morale would result to increase output of workers. <br/>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1)                  How many policies do EMENITE PLC and AMAH BREWERIES NGWO and THE EFFECTS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES make for human relations? <br/>2)                  Which of these policies influences the performance of secretaries? <br/>3)                  What are these human relations policies?<br/>4)                  What are the best human relation policies that can adequately motivate secretarial staff? <br/>1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>IMPACT <br/>The word “impact” according to as Hornby (1980) has a strong impression or effect. The impact of human relations policies on the secretaries means the effect of these policies in the performance of secretaries impact therefore can be negative or positive.<br/>HUMAN RELATIONS<br/>This is the dealing, affairs that has to do with one person or group of persons. It is an invaluable link between the management and the workers. Since on man is an island. There is need for people to interact for their mutual well-being. <br/>POLICIES <br/>Policies are defined as the guidelines to managerial actions. Dale Yoder (1972) ahs described policy as the standing line for all managerial relationship with employees. It can also be regarded as a predetermined, selected course as a guideline towards accepted aims and objectives. <br/>  SECRETARY <br/>According to the National Secretaries Association (International), a secretary is an executive assistant who possesses a mastery of skills, who demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility without supervision, who exercises initiatives and judgments and who makes decision within the scope of assigned authority. <br/>1.8              IMPLICATION FOR THE STUDY <br/>A study of human relations policies available in Emenite and Amah Breweries Ngwo, shall have obvious implications for business organizations to build up sound human relations policies to motivate their employees for greater productivity. Concerning the two companies used for these study sound human relations policies, if it’s exist in these companies we imply that the employees shall be happy with the condition of services offered to them. The condition of services maximum output of work. <br/>However, if there is no healthy human relations policies in these companies the employees will not be happy with the condition of services and effect shall also be how productivity; and effect shall also have obvious implications to business organization in Nigeria to maintain sound motivational; if their companies are to survive and grow. <br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF HUMAN RELATIONS POLICIES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES IN EMENITE PLC AND AMAH BREWERIES NGWO<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF HUMAN RELATIONS POLICIES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES IN EMENITE PLC AND AMAH BREWERIES NGWO", "id": 97}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECTS OF MODERN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON YESTERDAY’S SECRETARIES<br/>(A STUDY OF SELECTED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS IN ENUGU METROPOLIS).<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This research has been carried out to discover the impact of modern information technology (IT) on the job of the effect of modern information technology on yesterday’s secretary focus on public and private metropolis, Enugu.<br/>            The theoretical frame work for this study was based on the use of related literature.

For the fact that secretaries are the backbone of business organizations, this revolution seems to have affected them more than any other group. Yesterday’s secretaries are therefore witnessing new changes and challenges in their jobs and responsibilities.<br/>            These changes have also reflected in the tools of rendering secretarial services and the environment in which the services are rendered.<br/>            The office is a nerve center of every organization and its functions have not changed over the years but the responsibility placed on an office and the expectations from it has drastically sky rocketed. The modern office, like the primitive office, collect information, records information, protect the business and safeguards its assets. However, the world we live in is a place were the only thing that is constant is change. Office methods and services are daily going more technological and the volume of materials to be handled are daily increasing.<br/>            In addition, the reaction or response time expected of the office worker is now shorter than what it has been in the recent past. There is, therefore, the need for office administrators, which includes the yesterday’s secretary, to cope with the increasing quantity and quality of  services required in today’s modern offices which modern information technological instrument and machinery are handling effectively.<br/>            Over the years, there have been some changes in the status and work of secretaries. With this ever-changing role, has come the introduction of modern information technology variously called   automated office, electronic office, mechanized office, paperless office, peopleless office etc.<br/>            Today, the secretary is expected to combine, in addition to his traditional role of taking dictation, typing, keeping records and appointment, the responsibilities of an office manager. More importantly, he should be versed on the operation and efficient use of such modern information and communication equipment like electronic (memory) typewriters, electronic notebooks, electronic filing system that makes use of disc, word processors, fax machines, microfilm equipment, teleprinters, computer etc.<br/>            Thus, this sophisticated nature of today’s office is such that an ill-equipped secretary stands the risk of being displaced as the global match as both private and public organizations gather momentum, unless he is retrained.<br/>            However, at the present, opportunities for high education is gradually widening, as could be witness in some colleges of education, most Polytechnics and some Universities. But these opportunities, do not guarantee that the secretary will be adequately armed and exposed to meet with the demands of the fast growing high technology in the modern business offices.<br/>            The effect the introduction of the modern information technology is making on the job of yesterday’s secretaries has attracted the attention of many including the educational planners and the practicing secretaries themselves. The new generation office executives also appreciate the benefits of office technology in the area of documentation, data processing, communication, storage and retrieval system done by secretaries almost effortlessly and with jet speed.<br/>            Motivated by the ideals, afforded by the use of modern office technology and the gap between what is on the ground in the country an what supposed to obtain and most importantly the effect of this development to yesterday secretaries, an investigation has been considered necessary by the researcher.<br/>            The researcher therefore intends to explore the effect the modern information technology has done on the job of yesterday’s secretaries in both public and private organizations and to use the findings as basis to discover how an availability of similar equipment in our schools where today’s secretaries are trained. The researcher equally hopes to prove that the computer as part of the modern information technology, in the form of word processor, personal computer, electronic typewriter, telecopies, fax machine, etc, does not displace the secretary’s role but has come to enhance her performance on the jobs and elimination of drudgery. Also the researcher hopes to position the dangers these modern information technology has on yesterday’s secretary who refuses to embrace the demands of this modern age.<br/>            Finally, to prove how technological advancement have provided the secretary with the necessary tools needed to have all her routine tasks performed automatically. This leaves her free for more creative work which in turn increases individual and collective productivity and promotes the best climate for maximum efficiency.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            Due to the complexity of office services, technological devices are becoming indispensable in modern organizations. Hence, office automation is a necessary technology in any set-up or firm.<br/>            Before the advent of information technological devices, the secretary was considered an indispensable member of the office. We can be that the secretary’s  work is affected in one way or the other by the introduction of these devices. Thus, automated services have come to enhance the secretary’s performance and productivity. <br/>            On the other hand, one would ask whether technology would indeed provides solution to the drudgery and monotony of secretarial practice of yesterday’s. will it not make additional demands on the yesterday’s secretary in terms of skill training (in keeping abreast of development) and will not indirectly lead to loss of jobs of some).<br/>            It is to these questions that this research work intends to address itself. This project will attempt to enumerate the advantages of technological advancement as well as the disadvantages,  with particular reference to the role of the secretary.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The main purpose of this is to investigate the effect of modern information technology on yesterday’s secretary. Specifically the study intends to:<br/>1.            Find out if yesterday’s secretary can fit into today’s modern office.<br/>1.4       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of modern information technology on yesterday’s secretary. Specially, the study intends to:    <br/>1.            To find out if yesterday’s secretary can fit into today’s modern office.<br/>2.            Find out whether modern information technology has replaced manual systems used by yesterday’s secretaries.<br/>3.            To ascertain whether modern information technology has come to displace the role of the secretary.<br/>4.            To investigate how modern information technology reduce the work load of the secretary.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            It is hoped that at the end of this study that both present and future secretaries will realize whether modern information technological advancement has come to eradicate their roles or to increase their efficiency and productivity. It will also enlighten the readers that modern technological advancement represents an evolution of ofiice equipment and thus the job security of the secretary need not be jeopardized.<br/>            In most companies, both private and public, secretaries are being over-loaded with a lot of activities, a situation which leads to over working, just because they lack the knowledge of modern technology. This scientific study will help to enlighten, organization on the need for training their secretaries. On these modern devices for more efficiency and productivity.<br/>            In addition, the researcher will be afforded the opportunity of getting more versed on the topic. And finally, it will also serve as a source of literature to those who may get interested researching in this or other related areas.<br/>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This research work is expected to cover the secretaries of selected public and private organizations in Enugu metropolis. <br/>-       find out whether modern information technology has replaced manual system used by yesterday’s secretaries.<br/>-       Ascertain whether modern information technology has come to displace the role of the secretary.<br/>-       To investigate how modern information technology have reduced the work load of the secretary.<br/> 1.7      DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Technology               -           This is the study, mastery and utilization <br/>of manufacturing and industrial methods, systematic application of knowledge to practical tasks in industry.<br/>Automation               -           It is the implementation of processes by <br/>automatic means<br/>Programme   -           A programmes a set of actions or <br/>instruments that a machine is capable of interpreting and executing.<br/>System                       -           This is an assembly of computers united <br/>by some form of regulated interpretation to form an organized whole.<br/>Input                           -           Pertaining to a device, process or <br/>channel involved in any input process or to the data or state involved in any input process.<br/>Output                        -           Pertaining to a device, process or <br/>channel or to the data or states involves in an output process.<br/>Data                            -           It is a representation of facts, concepts or <br/>instruction in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation or processing by human or technological means.<br/>Wordprocessing       -           This is a text editing unit design for <br/>preparation, storing and dissemination of text initiated on typewriter – like devices. <br/>Manual                      -           Things done with hands.<br/>Computer                  -           A computer is an electronic device, which <br/>is capable of doing things at high speed, of making certain decision, storing and analyzing data.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF MODERN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON YESTERDAY'S SECRETARIES\r\n(A STUDY OF SELECTED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS IN ENUGU METROPOLIS\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF MODERN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON YESTERDAY'S SECRETARIES\r\n(A STUDY OF SELECTED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS IN ENUGU METROPOLIS\r\n", "id": 98}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLE OF A SECRETARY IN OFFICE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF MINISTRY OF FINANCE ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>This topic is the role of management with particular reference to the ministry of finance, Enugu.

That there are various effort played by government in uplifting the states of secretaries in the employ.  That there are various factors militating against the effective functions in the ministry. Those secretaries are not paid enough remuneration for their roles in the organization that there are views on whether the modern facilities needed by the secretaries in the organization adequate. The researcher therefore recommended that: A board should be set up to look into the immediate problem of secretaries with a view towards resolving modern equipment or machines should be provided for these secretaries most of whom should be retained as well as allowed to attend seminar and conferences to update their knowledge.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS <br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Introduction                                                                <br/>1.1       Background to the Study                              <br/>1.2       Statement of problems                         <br/>1.3       Objective of the Study                         <br/>1.4       Scope of the Study                                      <br/>1.5       Research Questions / Hypothesis            <br/>1.6       Significance of the Study                              <br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>2.1    Review of Literature                             <br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>3.0    Research Methodology                                 <br/>3.1       Research Design                                  <br/>3.2       Area of Study                                             <br/>3.3       Population of the Study                                <br/>3.4       Sample and Sampling Procedure            <br/>3.5       Instrument for Data Collection               <br/>3.6       Validity of the Instrument                     <br/>3.7       Reliability of the Instrument                  <br/>3.8       Method of Administering of Instrument   <br/>3.9       Data Analysis Technique                               <br/>3.10    Discussion Rule                                  <br/>CHAPTER FOUR    <br/>4.1       Data Presentation and Results                       <br/>4.2       Summary of Findings                           <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>5.1       Discussion Implementation and Recommendation <br/>Conclusion <br/>5.2       Conclusion                                          <br/>5.3       Implication of the Results                      <br/>5.4       Recommendation                                        <br/>5.5       Suggestions for Further Study                       <br/>5.6       Limitation of the Study                         <br/>References<br/>Appendices <br/>LIST OF TABLE <br/>Table <br/>4.1    Respondents view on the role of secretaries in an organization <br/>4.2       Opinion of respondents on the role played by the governments in up lighting the state of secretaries in the employ<br/>4.3       Views of the respondents on the factors militating against the effective performance of the secretarial functions in the ministry.<br/>4.4       Opinion of the respondents on if secretaries are remunerated enough for their roles in their organization.<br/>4.5       Respondents view on whether the modern facilities needed by the secretaries in the organization adequate.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0                   INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Generally, the office no doubt makes an important contribution to economic and social life of any nation or society.  Hence any complex industrial society would rapidly come to a stand still if the office is not there. This efficient organization must provide its management with efficient and sufficient information, planning control and financial services.  <br/>It is limit to expenditure on administrative services. If every one were engaged in office work there would be imbalances between productive activities and administration. The correct balance must be struck between the resources devoted to directly to productive activities so as to sustain rapid economic development of that nation.<br/>Little Mill Standing ford and Appleby (1986) remarked that administration is that part of the management process concerned with the institution and carrying out of procedures by which the programme is held down and communicated the progress of activities is regulated and checked against target and plans.<br/>Essentially the purpose of the office is to provide services of communication and records. This can be amplified under five headings as follows receiving information recording information giving information arranging information and safeguarding of asset.<br/>Office can make only these vital contributions if there is both efficient office services by general management and department manager. (that is the production manager, the marketing manager the secretary and others).<br/>Today the office is becoming such a complex place and more demanding that the executive finds it difficult to cope with the task. In other words she needs someone that would help her accomplish her tasks hence the need for a secretary. On the whole a secretary today is part and parcel of the executive and so is very indispensable. She is the person who assists the executive by displaying an export skill (imitative tact judgment and others) in performing her office function without close supervision by the executive. Thus she should posses the ability to relieve the executive of designated administrative detail when the need arises.<br/>The role of a secretary in office administration and management to a large extent depends on the type of office she work in the post occupied by the boss and her qualification (s). The secretary deals with the boss staff visitors and all paper works.<br/>This study is therefore an attempt to identify and analyze the role of a secretary in office administration management using ministry of finance, Enugu state as the reference point.          <br/>1.2STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Secretaries play multiple roles in any organization. They are the life wire of establishment or business outfit. By virtue of their position and the performance of their job, there exists some imminent problem. Such problems are likely to influence the role of secretaries.<br/>1.     Lack of respect and recognition to secretaries from employers of labour who look down on secretarial administration and regarded those who practice it as never-do-wells <br/>2.     Inadequate modern equipment used by secretaries hinders their efficiency and effectiveness of their jobs.<br/>3.     Secretaries are not apportioned to use or manipulate the required equipment necessary for their profession thereby making them not fit for their profession <br/>4.  Secretaries are always regarded as a professional servant to the executive<br/>5.  Some bosses use their secretaries as scope goat and dehumanize them <br/>before their visitors because such bosses  see the secretaries as supporting staff who he believed cannot stand on their own <br/>1.3  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The main purpose of this study is to identify the role of a secretary in office administration and management specifically the study intends to:<br/>1.  Find out the role of secretaries in office administration and management <br/>2.  Ascertain the   played by government in uplifting the state of secretaries in their employ<br/>3.  Determine the factors militating enough for their roles in their organization <br/>5.  Find out if modern facilities needed by secretaries in organization adequate.    <br/>1.4  SCOPE OR DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY <br/>The study delved into the role of secretaries in office administration and management. It focus mainly on the ministry of finance Enugu.  <br/>1.5RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.  What are the roles of secretaries in office administration and management?<br/>2.To what extent have government at various tiers succeeded in uplifting the states of secretaries in their employ?<br/>3.  What are the factors militating against the effective performance of the secretaries function in any organization <br/>4.  To what extent have secretaries been remunerated for their role in their various organization?<br/>5.  To what extent are the facilities needed by the secretaries in the organization adequate?<br/>1.6  SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY<br/>It is only when the result of any research is effectively used that the time and resources invested on it can be justified. Thus the result of this study would be of great importance for effective discharge of secretarial functions in all the office of ministry of finance. At least all the secretaries would be recognized hence their roles.<br/>Office administration and management is a crucial issue as no organization can function without a properly managed office. The result would extent to the public services and business houses all over the country, as the role of a secretary would be adequately known and discharge.<br/>This study would equally be of immense benefit to those students who whish to take secretarial administration as a profession.<br/>It is hoped that the result of this research would educate the general public as to who a secretary is and the importance attached to the profession. Equally it would educate the secretary in understanding more about herself her role prospects constraints and chosen profession.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE ROLE OF A SECRETARY IN OFFICE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF MINISTRY\r\nOF FINANCE ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF A SECRETARY IN OFFICE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF MINISTRY\r\nOF FINANCE ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 99}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>COMPUTER AND WORD PROCESSING APPLICATION IN SECRETARIAL OFFICES<br/>(GAINS AND THREATS TO JOB OPPORTUNITIES)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The purpose of this work was to find out the gains and threats of computer and word processing application in secretarial offices as regards to job opportunities and other secretarial functions.<br/>            In the cause of the study, the work examined the gains of computer and word processing application packages on the job performance of Secretaries in an office or organization.<br/>            It was discovered that the computer as a device been introduced into the secretarial field had made it possible for the secretaries to perform effectively and as a result yields high productivity to organizations and offices.<br/>            As regards to job opportunity, a secretary who has the knowledge of computer is likely to be employ more than those without the knowledge.<br/>            For this reason, secretaries should try as much as they can to influence the office or organization to provide computer for them for effective and efficient result.

This was as a result of the methods which they used in doing them.  But in the recent past, it was brought to the knowledge of so many people that computer has come to help the secretaries in performing their duties. Yet there are some failures and doubts about the value of computers and perhaps regretted becoming involved with computer. Some computers have been unsuccessful in office, businesses and even in organizations as a  result of the low knowledge of operating them.<br/>            In as much as all the failures and doubts that may have occurred, there are also successes recorded. This piece of work is to help secretaries, managers and even students to appreciate the efficiency of computers.  According to Graham (1976) he said that secretaries should try as much as they can to master and use computer in performing their official duties for the achievement of the organizational goals.<br/>            The basic fact is that a secretary should know how to operate a computer, to know what is expected from the machine that is how a computer will influence the efficiency and effectiveness of a secretary and to realize the penalties and effects of not having the proper knowledge of computer. A secretary who is computer literate has the opportunity to be employed in a computerized office or organization.<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>            Secretary being skilled and specialized types of employee in an office or organization is charged with some of the organizational functions including dealing with people correspondences and other business matters. Secretarial profession is an age-old career. It is one of the oldest in the world. Secretaries encountered several problems before the invention of office computer on their duties. These problems took many shapes and forms.<br/>            The method of carrying out secretarial functions/duties in the olden days were very worrisome and painful. Secretarial functions were mainly executed through manual efforts.  In those days secretaries used to produce every mail by handwriting using sharp objects with a pointed feather pen.<br/>            Since the event of computer technology, secretaries are more efficient in their work than before. It is widely believed that the computer saves time wasting and tedious in practically all fields of human endeavour.<br/>            This study is aimed at finding out the impacts of computer and word processing application in secretarial functions. It will also find out how much the computer has eased the work of the secretarial practitioner, how much it has made the profession lazy that is the threats of this machine.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>            The authors had the following problems in mind before embarking on the research:<br/>(a)                It has not been known whether this machines and some of these word processing application packages are relevant for the execution of certain secretarial responsibilities.<br/>(b)               Many new machines have been introduced for the execution of certain office jobs.<br/>(c)                Most astonishing is that it has not been documented whether those machines directly or indirectly will enhance the performance of secretarial functions.<br/>(d)               It has also not been known whether the acknowledgement of these computers has come to hinder, displace secretaries or help them in carrying out their day-to-day activities.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            Every business aims at managing its resources for the purpose of achieving both organizational and individual goals.  It is a common saying that secretaries are the life wire of every organization. There is the need to get all the necessary data for effective decision. Before the advent of computers, secretaries perform their duties including against the old method of using manual means.<br/>            Therefore the purpose of this study is:<br/>•To find out whether the rate of employments turnover of secretaries are affected by the advent of computer.<br/>•To find out the future prospects of secretaries in the computer age.<br/>•Whether computer has improved the effectiveness and efficiency of secretaries.<br/>•Whether the use of computer has rendered secretaries redundant.<br/>•To identify the extent secretaries need computers in performing their duties.<br/>•To identify the problems secretaries encounter while using computer in performing their duties.<br/>•To identify the extent secretaries need word processing application packages in carrying out their duties.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>            The research on the topic being discussed would give us some insight into the benefits of computers to secretaries as regards to job opportunities are the extent they need it. It will also be useful to students of secretarial studies who are expected to sue computers and word processing application packages in performing some office tasks. This work will benefit immensely practicing secretaries, organizations, private and public in the utilization of computers.<br/>            Additionally, since much has not been written on this issue, it is obvious that this study will equally find application in the Universities and libraries as it will contribute to the stock of knowledge.<br/>            Finally, this research will be significant to all the students of secretarial studies  department of IMT Enugu and to other students from different institutions of higher learning and to the society at large because if by the use of the computer, production could be enhanced.<br/>1.6       DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>COMPUTER:<br/>Computer is an automatic machine that is capable of accepting data known as input, stores data, use predetermined instructions to process the data with speed and accuracy and supplies the result of such data processed in a more meaningful way known as output.<br/>WORD PROCESSING <br/>            This is a programme that helps the user in typesetting documents, producing letters, reports, magazines, curriculum vitae (cv), term papers etc.<br/>DATA<br/>            This is the raw facts and figures we feed into the computer through the input devices for processing. Data is made up of letters, numbers and symbols which can be organized to become a piece of information.<br/>OFFICE<br/>            This is a place where electrical or administrative work of a firm is carried out. It is also said to be the repository of information. Example, files, reference books and all manner of reports.<br/>INPUT <br/>            It refers to all information, instructions and commands keyed in or sent into the computer either for storage or for processing. Input devices are agents that enable the passing of information into the computer.<br/>OUTPUT<br/>It refers to all information sent out of the computer either on the screen as soft copy or on the paper as hard copy.<br/>1.7       RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>            This study is under taken to provide answers to the following questions:<br/>(i)                 Have secretaries improved in their job performance since the introduction of computer and word processing packages.<br/>(ii)               Has computer affected the rate of employment of secretaries in offices or organizations?<br/>(iii)             What functions can the computer assist the secretary to perform?<br/>(iv)             Do computer and word processing application packages have impact on secretaries?<br/>  <br/>\n\nCOMPUTER AND WORD PROCESSING APPLICATION IN SECRETARIAL OFFICES (GAINS AND THREATS TO JOB OPPORTUNITIES)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary

Time was described as a natural element, a period when activities takes place, while time management  was essentials materials in order of the importance and productivity  as possible some of the literature reviewed on time and time management are first things first (Stephen R. Cover) procrastination Monter (Rayeen Devadasor) Time (David Allen) e.t.c  <br/>with the aid of the questionnaire designed, it  was discovered that all the benefits that accrues to the secretary as a result for time management, is also applicable to other staff in organizational the major one which was discovered to be efficiency; it was however concluded among others that towards achieving maximum productivity, efforts should be made to given an in-depth orientation to staff on how to manage time<br/>Ways through which the study can be implemented in institutions is by including and integrating the study of time management in the curriculum because it will help in imbibing the culture of managing time.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODCUITON<br/>1.1              Background of the Study <br/>Time can be described as a natural element a period during which activities take place. It is aloe an embodiment of destining unfolding in stage. Time is unending and unavoidable. The most neglected and most regretted.<br/>Time cannot be controlled or handled with levity but can be properly managed to fit any activity. Many have redesigned time to suit their poor attitude to it. They see time as a resource that can be made up. This is absolutely wrong as time and tide waits for no one and any part of it wasted can never be replaced or brought back.<br/>Time is measured in seconds, minute, hour play, week, year, century, decade, etc. the effectives sum of time as what is referred to as “Time management” and it entails management skills.<br/>Time management means an intelligent identification of essential matters in the order of their importance and utilizing effectively very moment available as mean fully and productivity as possible. It also refers to the discipline to adhere to a predetermined time already schedules. Managing time is not the same as spending hours on an assignment; it is simply about determining priorities and the use of managerial techniques to reach set goals effectively.<br/>As there is often a general problem. Arising from time management  in our daily activities, corporate world and other business ventures, techniques of time management, constrains and the enormous benefits derivable with particularly references to these secretary’s efficiently in an organization structure.<br/>1.2   Statement of the Problem <br/>It is observed that lack of adequate attention to time and its importance has been responsible for the low productivity in some organization. Essentially as profit  is measured against time, management, it leads to discomfort, in forms such as headache, stomachaches, cramps loss of sleep, difficulty in concentrating etc. a person under stress had the tendency to go off work for a while during that period, time which would have been used constructively is being wasted.<br/>It is also noted that secretaries encounter problems like unpredictable daily routine which arises when a secretary, for one reason or the order takes on the  responsibility originally belonging to another person. The work of the secretary in question suffers a temporary set-back in time and also affect time management.<br/>1.3               Purpose of the study <br/>This project is highly significance and relevant in the sense that the needs for time management In every business activity are now being appreciated and as the dividend realized by those who head appreciated and practiced it are quite enormous.<br/>Introducing time management techniques gradually will help in solving contemporary management problem faced by the secretary.<br/>1.4              Research Question  <br/>The under mentioned points/ question and other are proposed to guide the conduct and analysis of the project work.<br/>What are the factor responsible for time management problems?<br/>What are the consequences of time mangamagent?<br/>How can poor time management be resolved?<br/> What are the benefit accrued to a secretary to time management?<br/> 1.5              Scope <br/>This study will be limited to

EFFECTS OF STRESS ON THE SECRETARY’S JOB PERFORMANCE <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF ANAMMCO AND EMNITE ALUMINIUM COMPANY, ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>According to research studies into the relationship between a worker’s life and his job, stress is assuming a position as number one killer disease in the modern society.  The purpose of his work was to find out the effects of stress on the secretary’s job performance, what factors caused this stress and how their effects were manifested and could be controlled.<br/>To do this, literature review relating to the effects of stress on the workers especially the sedentary worker, was conducted.  A questionnaire was drawn up with which data were collected.  This was supplemented by face-to-face interviews with secretaries and observations.  The respondents were from Anammco Company and Emenite Aluminium Company, Enugu.  In all, 100 questionnaires wee distributed and 88 were returned while 12 were not returned.<br/>The researcher from data analysis found out that secretaries under-face a lot of stressing situations in the course of doing their job but that some were more devastating in the effects than others.  The three most significant stressors identified were:<br/>1.                  Lack of adequate and sufficient working materials and equipment.<br/>2.                  Strenous human relation in the workplace and<br/>3.                  lack of necessary qualification, both physically and mentally on the part of the secretary to handle the job efficiently.<br/>Recommendation were however made that adequate

INTRODUCTION:<br/>The secretary works in a dynamic environment pack full with conflicting situations and instruments – so much that no two working days are exactly the same.  These conflicting decisions and instructions crop up all the time and they demand prompt attention and decisions, but the role of it is that the time to perform these function does not increase rather, it seems to diminish and with this apparent shortage of time comes “stress”.<br/>The roles and functions of the secretary are basic to the organizational roles and so cannot be confined within the purview of a job description.  They range from covering of meetings, taking care of office duties, keeping schedules in both hers and her boss’s desk diaries for complete and effective job performance up-to-date and supervising subordinates as well as keeping order generally in the office.  All these to be done without a pause to enable the smooth flow of work.  Thus, she is also important to the organization because of her ability to remain calm under extraordinary condition of work pressures and human demands.<br/>The secretary’s obligations to the boss can sometimes be strenuous and conflicting with her other obligations to herself and to the company.  This view of secretary’s function is an archaic one in view of the changes that have taken place in her training and job, but some employers still cling to it and cause her stress on the job when she finds difficulty in obeying these instructions.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:<br/>The medium organization operates in the dynamic and ever changing environment.  Because the modern organization exists in rapidly changing environment, the secretary is faced with a lot of physical and mental hazards on the job which may cause her stress – noise, lack of preparations for certain jobs or duties, attitude of the public to the job she does and the societal and organizational structures and their effects on her job are some of these factors that may affect her performance on the job.  As well, the sitting arrangements, dangerous chemicals and substances used in the course of her work and lack of proper qualifications for the job may cause her stress.<br/>Added to these stressors is the fact that technology may eventually make her learned skills unwanted in the work place.  Though not manifest in quantifiable terms, these threats cause stress that may eventually spell doom to the secretary mentally as well as physically.<br/>Fache (1981) said “for every successful businessman, executive or organization, there is always an efficient and hardworking secretary”.  In view of the adverse effects of stress on the performance of the secretary on her job, which may in turn cause her boss or even her organizational performance not to be up to what it would have been or not to realize its goals, it becomes of urgent need to take a very keen look at the job the secretary does and find out what does cause her stress.  If this is done, then plans on how to eliminate in control than can be successfully made and executed.<br/>1.2              PURPOSE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The purpose of this research is to find out the environmental factors associated with the secretary’s job stress, and their effects on her job performance.  The study, in looking at this problem, attempts to find out:<br/>1.                  What specific factors in the job situations cause the secretary stress.<br/>2.                  Who is to blame for her stress – the boss, management or secretary herself.<br/>3.                  What could be done to reduce or eliminate stress from the job environment.<br/>Further significance of the study, the researcher based on the importance of the study, which will be of great importance to the society at large and primarily be useful to the following:<br/>1.         The management (secretary’s boss).<br/>Ignorance of how well to treat a secretary in order to get her best performance may be one of the reasons why the secretary is subjected to stressful conditions at the place of work.  It is hoped that after reading this work the boss will be better informed as how to handle a secretary to get maximum performance from her.<br/>2.         The professional secretary:<br/>It is hoped that as a result of careful perusal of this work, the secretary will be in a better position to recognize stressors, avoid them whenever possible and control their effects on her performance.  This should lead to a better job performance on her part.<br/>3.         Trainers:<br/>Sometimes, people who train the secretary for the job are hopelessly out of contact with what is required of her at the place of work so that training programmes are not up to what they should be.  It is hoped that this will help trainers identify vital training areas on which to lay emphasis and from time to time improve on facilities to meet with modern office procedures.<br/>4.         Academicians:<br/>This work may later prove useful to academicians who may find all or it as useful points for further research work on the secretary’s job.<br/>1.3       SCOPE OF THE STUDY:<br/>This research was on the study of the effects of stress on the secretary’s job performance.  The researcher covered some selected organization in Enugu metropolis only.  The findings, after analysis would be used as generalization upon the organizations under review.<br/>The organizations are as follows:<br/>•Anammco Manufacturing Company (ANAMMCO) Enugu.<br/>•Emenite Aluminium Company, Enugu.<br/>1.5       DEFINITION OF TERMS:<br/>The following terms are defined in the specific sense in which they were used in this research study.  They are as follows:<br/>1.                  Stress<br/>2.                  Stressor<br/>3.                  Secretary<br/>4.                  Job<br/>5.                  Performance <br/>(a)

<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       Background of the Study:<br/>            Many advanced countries of the world that have attained or are attaining the peak of their industrial development and economic growth began with business centers.<br/>            Technology has evolved the functions of the office to rely on different types of improved and standardized equipment.  It has also devised varied stages and concepts for effective communication within and outside the organization.  It enables the host of system, equipment and materials essentially computer-based to achieve the set goals of an organization in relation to the function of office such as obtaining storing processing and distribution of information.<br/>            Business centers serve as centers of information, such centers take in, process, store and relay data and messages in different situation such as financing, marketing, building, manufacturing, servicing or advising so as to enable the different types of people tom function in their jobs.<br/>            Some time ago, this set ups were neglected in our economic sectors.  But in recent times, due to unemployment trend in our country, business centers have started to grow in all aspects of our economy.<br/>            According to Omordion (1970), “it is dominated that the industrial sector in most countries in terms of the number and employment.  There simply can be no doubt whatsoever that the business centers constitute the real fabric of the nation’s economy.<br/>            Government of most nations particularly in the development countries have started recognizing this new shift with great enthusiasm as against their former policies of capital intensive.<br/>            It is in recognition of this positive bearing of business centers in national development that Nigerian governments both federal, state and local are now mounting series of programmes designed to sensitize and stimulate the people into appreciating the impact of business centers in out national economy, going through the positive effects which increased activity of business centers could have on the national economy, it will be clear that it is mostly for national policy which encourage establishment of business centers and through this enterprises the nation realize long run betterment of hr balance of payment position.<br/>            Starting of one-man business is venturing into the known, which if fraught with many problems.<br/>            In realization of this obvious fat and the importance of this category of<br/>business to our national economic growth, the study therefore studies some of<br/>the peculiar factors hindering industrialization Enugu state n terms of business<br/>centers.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Being a paid employee now in the country is a very risky business <br/>because country is a very risky business because of the state of the Nigeria economic which is not stable.  This has motivated both government (Federal, stage, and local governments.) as well as individuals to focus their interest on business centers development.  At least, it will solve the problem of unemployment for the owner and create some employment opportunities for others.<br/>            But to their dismay, the venture, which they thought to be a profit one seem not to break even probably because of lack of financial and administrative acumen.<br/>            Oshogbemi, (1979) maintained that the enthusiasm not-with-standing, only very few individuals succeed in establishing their own business centers.  This shows that the dynamics role of business centers in our national economic progress and the motivation of entrepreneurs are not being realized.<br/>            Realizing the prospects of business centre development to any developing nation such as ours, the fundamental quest that arises is how can the dynamic role of this sub-sector be more effectively and economically enhance?<br/>            It is therefore important to create serious awareness among the people with more emphasis on business centers as best alternative trade.<br/>            Most importantly, there is need to find the possible fctors militing against the sectors developments, thus the need for research on this subject as this.<br/>1.3       Purpose of the study<br/>            Therefore, this research work is designed to find out the following:<br/>a.                   Whether lack of capital outlay inhibit the establishment of business centre.<br/>b.                  To know the effect government policies have on establishment business centers.<br/>c.                   To know if lack of raw materials is one of the problems<br/>d.                  To know  if land as one of the major factors in establishing of industry discourages people to set up business centers.<br/>e.                   To know if lack of machineries and equipment is one of the problems<br/>Another aim of this study is to identify the core problems that hinder people from establishing their own business centre in Awgu local government area of Enugu state .  Also, how the result of this will benefit the people who own the business centers.<br/>      How it can also benefit the entire Enugu and more so, those who manage the business or about to engage in one<br/>1.3              Scope of study:<br/>This research project cover the problem, of establishing business centers <br/>with particular reference to at least ten (10) business centers  in Awgu and its satellites towns of Awgu  town, Mgbowo, Mmaku, Agbogugu, Ihe, Owelli-Court, Ugbo, Ogugu, Ituku, and Isu – Awaa.<br/>1.5       Research Question<br/>            To satisfy the inquiring nature of this study the following questions will be answered.<br/>A.                Does lack of capital outlay inhibit the establishment of business centers?<br/>B.                 What effects do government policies have on the establishment of Business centre in Awgu<br/>C.                 What effect does lack of raw materials have on establishment of business centers in Awgu?<br/>D.                What are the effects of land as one of the Major factors have in establishment of Business centre?<br/>E.                 What effect does lack of machineries/equipment have in establishing Business centers?<br/>1.7              Significance of the study:<br/>Business centre ownership is the shortest route to the acquisition of <br/>capital and of course participation and contribution towards the economic, social, political and industrial growth of any nation-Enugu state in particular.<br/>            This research will enable any person who may read it to appreciate what business centre are, benefit of it, the expected problem a entrant may encounter and finally, proffering possible solutions to the problems.<br/><br/>\n\nA SURVEY OF THE MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS OF\r\nBUSINESS CENTRE IN AWGU

(Okafor 1987). <br/>Prospect on the other hand according to Oxford Advanced learner’s Dictionary of the English Language is defined as the chances of being successful. <br/>Harding (1988) define secretary as someone holding a very responsible position with in an organization, who provide a full range of management support which cells upon variety of skills and ability that would  not be pre-requisites of office generally. <br/>Horny (1996) also defines a secretary as an employee in office who deals with correspondence keeps records, makes arrangement and appointment for a particular member of staff. <br/>Ofuru (1997) sees secretaries as the image makers, who combine both official and one-official duties for  overall success of their bosses as well as the organization where the work. <br/>The   American secretarial Association  defines a secretary in the most acceptable way as an assistant to an executive, possessing mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibility initiative, exercise judgement and makes decision with in the scope of his authority. <br/>With the above definitions, in mind one can easily seen the need  for a secretary in any organization or institution be it secondary or tertiary can not be over emphasized. <br/>A secretary is a major comminuting link between the executive and his association the office staff and the public. He/she  is the life wire of that organization. <br/>As a result of this important linking  position, a secretary can display vital roles in helping to create and maintain the smooth running of business organization  <br/>For a secretary to perform his/her to undergone some educational studies and obtain the basic office knowledge  and skills Days  are gone when any person that works in an office is being regarded as a secretary. <br/>However, for one to quality as a secretary one must have taken courses in shorthand, typewriting, office practice and secretarial duties and must be computer literate for easy adaptation in morden office challenges.    <br/>A close look at some selected higher institution like the institute of management and technology Enugu, Federal polytechnic Oko, Anambra state, federal college of Education current problems and  prospects of secretaries. <br/>Some of these problems include the following: <br/>poor placement of their sartorial staff <br/>lack of good working environment <br/>Lack of modern office equipment like computers printers modern electric typewriter etc.<br/>Lack of attending external course or seminars or even in-house training. <br/>In a situation where the above mentioned facilities are lacking the advancement of  the secretaries both in academics and otherwise will be a mirage. <br/>THE INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT  AND TECHNOLOGY I.M.T ENUGU.  <br/>The institute of management and technology Enugu was established in the year 1972 and was known ass institute of public Administration then east central state (ECS) . it was later re-named institute of management  and Technology in 1976 by then old Anambra state Government. The institution is now owned by Enugu state government after the  creation of Enugu state form the old Anambra  state. A survey shows that the institution has produced many and famous professional who  have excelled in their endeavors. <br/>Since its inception and it is still leading in academic in Nigeria as far as polytechnic education is concerned inspilt of all constraints  <br/>Various higher institutions these days have realized and on their stressed on the impact of modern technology on their secretaries. <br/>The service of secretaries are utilized by various organization and institutions. Secretaries work  directly with management of those organization as supporting staff and they help in realizing effectively the missios and objectives of the organizations. <br/>In view of all these facts, the problems and prospects of  the secretaries in these higher institutions are critically investigated in this study. <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>The state of a secretary in the civil service has been a vexed issue for quite sometime. While some think of the secretary as a mere servant of the boss while others regard her as another boss. While she perform every work in her office her position is still relegated to the ground thus lead the research to investigate these factors that prospects secretaries in office administration and management. <br/>How ever, some of the problems are as follows:<br/>1.         neglect and lack of adequate motivation of secretaries on their  job. <br/>2.         Poor perception of secretaries as never – do – wells by the society. <br/>3.         Lack of modern office equipment has handicapped the high performance of the secretary. <br/>It has been a problem to understand the nature of bosses in organization as the role of serctaries. <br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.         To find out the extent of neglect and lack of motivation of secretary on the job. <br/>2.         To determine the extent of poor perception of secretaries as never do  wells in the society. <br/>3.         To find out extent lack of modern office equipment has handicapped the high performance of the secretary. <br/>4.         To  find out the extent of problem to understand nature of bosses in organization. <br/>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY  <br/>The study is limited to the institute of management and technology (IMT), Enugu.  <br/>IMT is one of the oldest polytechnic in the eastern part of Nigeria. <br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.         To guide this study, four (4) research question were formulated as shown below: <br/>1.         To what extent are the secretaries motivated to enhance high <br/>performance on the job? <br/>2.         To what extent do the poor perception of secretaries as never do well is in the society? <br/>3          To what extent do lack of  modern of fice equipment handicapped the high performance of the secretaries? <br/>4          To  what extent do the type of boss and leadership style affect the job of secretaries? <br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is significant for the following reason: <br/>1.         It is hoped that the suggestion from this study will help the masses have more  knowledge on what secretarial profession is all about. <br/>2.         The result of this work will  help in exposing the implication of secretarial profession so that most young men and woman will realize the good prospect  of taking to the profession <br/>3.         The study will also expose to the heads of organization and             establishment that a highly talented secretary is a professional rather than a strong or an appendage to the management profession. This will enable an  improved recognize their interdependent on one another, and thus form a formidable management team for management efficiency. <br/>4.         The study will also help secretaries to play down the misconception and stereotyped view of their professions to take pride in their professions deserves, while they struggle for profession. <br/>5.         Finally, it may serve as a work of reference to future researchers in the future researchers in the  area. <br/><br/>\n\nTHE PROSPECTS OF SECRETARIES IN OFFICE ADMINISTERATION AND MANAGEMENT\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF I.M.T ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROSPECTS OF SECRETARIES IN OFFICE ADMINISTERATION AND MANAGEMENT\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF I.M.T ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 104}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONSEQUENCES OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES IN SECRETARIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN NIGERIAN POLYTECHNICS<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY, ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This study was carried out to discover the possible consequences posed by the office technologies in secretarial education curriculum in Nigeria Polytechnics.  This study was conducted using the Institute of Management and Technology (I.M.T) Enugu as a case study.<br/>            The instrument used for data collection was the questionnaire and literature review, while a total of four research question were also posed.<br/>            The information collected from the respondents were analyzed using simple percentage method and they were used in answering the research question.<br/>            The data collected and analyzed showed that enormous consequences were imposed on secretarial education curriculum by constant change in office technologies.<br/>            The consequences entails the re-training and attending of seminars, conferences and workshop by the teachers/lecturers on the uses and operations of the new office equipment/machines, this is with a view to imparting such knowledge on the student secretaries together with the introduction of some new relevant courses to enable them face squarely the consequences of incessant office technological changes now rampant in the business environment.<br/>            The finding upheld the need for easy introduction of accepted new courses.

ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>As life is becoming more dynamic, more complex in educational, socio-cultural, industrial and commercial developments due to the increasing technological advancements, the secretarial profession is not left in the loaves and the jobs of secretaries appear at first sight among those threatened.  This is because new machines, are threatening to take over the jobs performed by secretaries thereby making them face job hazard of redundancy, retirement and retrenchments and mass unemployment.<br/>Presently, Nigeria is undergoing technological revolutions just like any other developing country of the world.  This technological advancement has actually revolutionized most office activities and procedures.  Until recently, the study of secretarial educations programme in our polytechnics especially in Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu was based mainly on shorthand, typewriting and office practice.  But the activities had greatly changed since supervision of the polytechnics by the NBTE.<br/>The task and activities these categories of workers in most offices and business circles have also increased tremendously because of the high office responsibilities expected of the secretary to now handle with little or not supervisions,  the scope of the course they now cover before qualification, has also greatly increased.<br/>They now have to be trained and educated in too many courses and have to acquire more technical skills to be able to handle and manipulate the very modern office automated machines now inherent in most business offices. This will make them to be marketable and employable.<br/>Secretarial profession now has to battle with the skills of handling the electric typewriters, scanners, word processors, the facsimile (Fax) machines, the computer etc.  Will enable her meet up with the increasing demand of collecting, processing, storing and disseminating information as and when urgently required unlike the era of manual typewriters and filing cabinets that waste time.<br/>It should be noted that these automatic high-technological machines cannot do everything or operate themselves without human aid, thus making the needs and quests for the professionals in the secretarial field necessary.<br/>The most current and implicating question in the minds of the present day secretarial studies educators and curriculum planners is what to do in order to keep pace with the new technological changes in secretarial office automated equipment. This is because the more knowledgeable the secretaries are in the use of these office automated equipment, the better prepared our country will be to develop technologically.<br/>Hence in the opinion of Kanu (1987), there must be positive attitude towards continuous up-dating of knowledge for everyone, especially the secretaries, if this age of technological advancement is to be acquired and improved advancement and inter-personnel skills developed.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>The incessant changes and advancements in office automation has given rise to an urgent and constant training of the employees who handle and operated these new machines.  It should be realized that most of these new high technological equipment like the computers, which stole into the business offices throughout the world unnoticed are very expensive to acquire and maintain and no organization would like these all cost effective equipment to lie idle, waste or become obsolete within a short period simply because there is no capable hands or professional to handle them.  Therefore, these technological changes therefore represent a very demanding implication on the secretarial education curriculum.<br/>Since a lot of office work is based on the basic knowledge of keyboarding and clerical skills, it becomes apparent that if secretarial education curriculum in out polytechnics is not reviewed, revisited and updated from time to time, to adequately take care of these technological changes, the products turned out with this curriculum might not be able to face challenges they are bound to meet when they are finally employed.<br/>If therefore, becomes apparent that those concerned with the training and education of secretaries in out polytechnics and other institutions of higher learning should always adjust their curriculum so as to catch up and stay afloat with the incessant technological changes and advancements. The problem then is how far have Polytechnic especially Institute of Management and Technology, Enugu been able to adjust its curriculum to reflect the current development? How far have they been able to purchase the required equipment necessary for the training of Secretaries?  Do they have qualified personnel to handle these equipment?  Are the students being adequately prepared for the business world/  These and many more are what they research is out to answer.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/> The main purpose of this research work is to:<br/> i.                    To find out the consequences of office technologies in secretarial education curriculum in I.M.T., Enugu.<br/>ii.                  Find out cause of frequent changes in educational curriculum especially that of secretarial education programme performance.<br/>iii.                To ascertain whether these office technologies that are used in different offices today are available in the department of Secretarial Studies of Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu which is actively involved in the training of secretaries<br/>iv.                Identify whether the curriculum planners recognized these consequences before going on the drawing board, especially as it concerns Secretarial Duties.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            Technological development has taken a rather tremendous new dimension since the middle of this century.  According to Ndubuisi (1981), since there is need to promote interest in more and advanced technology, provision should also be made for institution and Nation as a whole, curriculum planners and business world.<br/>            By finding out the effects of consequences of office technology on the secretarial educations curriculum in our polytechnics especially the Institute of Management and Technology, Enugu all that are involved in the training of these category of professionals and the curriculum planners, will be able to adjust their curricula and course contents to suit the needs of the expanding technological business world. Their products, the students secretaries would then be prepared well enough to enter the new world of automated offices and still face squarely the challenges inherent in high technological environments without fear of retrenchment.<br/>            The study will among other things, serve as a guide to the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) in determining these new trends that are destined to become an integral part of business studies and include same in the program/school syllabus.<br/>            Finally, the country and the business parastatals will also benefit from this study since the school of business has been producing very proficient and marketable personnel that will stand the vigorous test of time through updated planned curricula, especially in this era of technological advancement.<br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>In order to obtain more purposeful and significant results from the data analysis, the following questions will be tested in the course of the study.<br/>a.                   What are the consequences of office technologies in the Secretarial Education Curriculum in Institute of Management and Technology (I.M.T), Enugu?<br/>b.                  Is the Institute prepared to meet up with the consequences in training students for today’s and future sophisticated technological office environment?<br/>c.                   What effect have the frequent changes in curriculum brought to the secretarial Studies Department?<br/>d.                  Being aware of the technological changes in the country do you think the frequent changes will have any effect in your career as secretaries?<br/>1.6              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Breeding unemployment Graduates:<br/>Training and turning-out of graduates who cannot be employed because they lack the required skills for handling and manipulating modern office machines and equipment.<br/>Curriculum:<br/>            Subject/courses included in course of study like secretarial studies or taught in a particular school or college.<br/>Office Technologies:<br/>            The application of the use of modern office machines and equipment in performing office tasks for quicker and greater productivity.<br/>Computer Literacy<br/>            Being educated or enlightened on the uses, functions an operations of the electronic data processing machine called the computer which is capable of handling, processing, storing and retrieving information at the shortest possible time.<br/>Office Automation<br/>            The use of different types/kinds of machines aided devices to work in an office in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the employed manpower.<br/>Technological Revolution<br/>            Drastic change/shift from the use of old fashioned machine and equipment to the recently manufactured (modern) ones.<br/>Techniques<br/>            Methods of getting things done.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONSEQUENCES OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES IN SECRETARIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN NIGERIAN POLYTECHNICS\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY, ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONSEQUENCES OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES IN SECRETARIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN NIGERIAN POLYTECHNICS\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY, ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 105}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A SURVEY OF WELFARE PACKAGES AVALIABLE TO THE EMPLOYEES OF <br/>THE NIGERIA RAILWAY CORPORTAION AND THE EFFECT ON THEIR PERFORMANCE.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This research work, investigation welfare packages available to the employees of the Nigeria railway corporation, Enugu and effects on their performance. To conduct the study, a well structured questionnaire validated by three experts in secretarial studies at the Federal Polytechnic Oko and Osisatech polytechnic Enugu. About 298 questionnaire were distributed to correspondents. The completed questionnaires were presented in the table and analysis using percentage scores. A sample of 230 was drawn from the population of 296 using stratified random sampling.<br/>            From the analysis of the data collected, it was found that employees in Nigeria railway corporation are not adequately motivated and the welfare packages available to them are very few and such that will not motivate the employees to higher productivity.<br/>            Some recommendations were made to the organization on how employees will be motivated better to bring maximum productivity. Management should hence forth make the employees benefits in the organization a permanent reward. Employees should be involved in decision making, bonus and in service training should be given as well. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              Background of the study.<br/>1.2              Statement of the problem<br/>1.3              Purpose of the study<br/>1.4              Significance of the study<br/>1.5              Delimitation of the study<br/>1.6              Assumption of the study<br/>1.7              Research questions<br/>1.8              Definitions of terms.<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE<br/>2.1              General <br/>2.2              Concept of employees welfare programme<br/>2.3              Types of employee welfare programme<br/>2.4              Employees welfare scheme and the real economic situation<br/>2.5              Employees benefit as motivator<br/>2.6              Employee benefits and the employee needs<br/>2.7              Summary of literature review <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>RESERCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1              Design of the study<br/>3.2              Area of the study<br/>3.3              Population<br/>3.4              Sample and sampling technology<br/>3.5              Instrument for data collection<br/>3.6              Method of administering and collection of data<br/>3.7              Method of validating and reliability of the research instrument.<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>DATA PRESENTATIION AND ANALYSIS<br/> CHAPTER FIVE<br/>DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS, SUMMARY OF FINDING, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.1              Discussion of findings<br/>5.2              Summary of findings<br/>5.3              Conclusion<br/>5.4              Recommendations<br/>5.5              Suggestion for further study <br/>5.6              Limitation.<br/>References<br/>Appendix 1(i)<br/>Appendix 2 (ii)<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            Benefits and services represent a tangible gain to employees in form of monetary or non-monetary rewards. As the years rolls by, diverse firings benefits continue to be introduced. Ubeku (1985) noted that fringe benefits have grown in the country today as a result of the economic situation while others have grown  either as a result of pressure from trade unions or from sheer invitations. He further noted that once a benefit has been given to an employee, it would be difficult to remove.<br/>            Nwachukwu (1984) in related study, pointed out that Nigerian employers offer many types of incentive which are competitive and attractive in nature. Flippo (1971) listed some of the most frequent cited advantages of offering employees services which include effective recruitment, improved morale loyalty and good public relations.<br/>            This study, however examined the importance of employee welfare service in the Nigeria railway corporation, Enugu. The welfare programme have helped to enhance productivity in the organization. This study is also aimed at finding out whether or not there is positive relationship between incentive to workers and their productivity especially as it applies to the Nigeria railway corporation Enugu.<br/>            Earlier researches on employees motivation have revealed that employees have the greatest tendencies to respond to incentives in a most positive manner. The case with Nigeria railway corporation may not be different, but it is freer that the present down turn in business of the corporation may be attributed to issues connecting motivation of employees. During the colonial era, rail transport has been a right means for movement in the country. This research was motivated by the fat that presently Rail transport is no longer promising. The reason is not known but looking at the rail business in Enugu metropolis, one will say that it is not promising. Hence the need to determine the extent of employee motivation in the corporation in other to find out the causes foir the down turn in their business.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            The assumption that civil and public servants in Nigeria are adequately motivated seems to be far from the truth. This is because those offices often embark on industrial strike. Most often the causes of such industrial unrest are genuine especially where they are adjusted to infringe on the rights and privileges of employees.<br/>            In paratatals also industrial crises seems to be much more on the increase than in the other sectors. Frankly of the national economy, Nigeria Railway corporation has had her own faire share of the National Industrial Crises. Some times, these crises are stretched and some other times, it is usually brief. The labor situation in Nigeria Railway corporation has not been thoroughly investigated. In the same vein, it is difficult to determine the type of welfare packages provided by the Nigeria Railway corporation to their present employees.<br/>            Most disturbing is that it has also not been known whether these packages are enough to motivate the employees to higher productivity or not. Hence this research work determined welfare packages provided by Nigeria railway corporation Enugu to their employees and whether such packages are capable of motivating their employees to higher productivity.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study is to find out welfare packages available to the employees of the Nigeria railway corporation. Specifically the study is to<br/>1.      Find out employees welfare packages available in the Nigeria railway corporation Enugu<br/>2.      Find out if the employees are happy with the packages provided by the Nigeria railway corporation.<br/>3.      Find out if such packages have helped to increase the efficiency and affectivity of these employee.<br/>4.      Find if the Nigeria railway corporation entertains any problem in offering those packages<br/>5.      Make recommendations on how employees welfare packages should be controlled and administered.<br/>1.4       SINGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study about welfare packages available to the employees. Nigeria railway corporation Enugu will go at lent at determining the type of welfare packages that can motivate employees to greater productivity in an industrial setting. Frankly, it will be unreasonable to assume that employees will continue to find satisfaction in their job, if they are not properly motivated <br/>            However, the findings of this study shall be useful to parastatals and corporations in Enugu state, to find ways through which they can motivate their employees. The findings of this study shall also be useful to those holding administrative positions in business organizations to determine the way they should better motivate their workers for greater industrial productivity.<br/>            Finally, the study will be useful to educational institution where management courses are offered to determine appropriate ways through which employees could be motivated.<br/>1.6       ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY<br/>            The following assumption where made to the study<br/>i.                    Nigeria railway corporation provides welfare packages to their employees<br/>ii.                  If the welfare packages are capable of motivating the workers, it will result to increase in productivities on the part of such employees.<br/>iii.                Where these welfare packages are poor and not capable of motivating workers, their productivity will be low. <br/>1.7             RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>      The following research questions were formulated to guide the study<br/>i.                    What are the welfare packages available to the employee of the Nigeria Railway corporation Enugu<br/>ii.                  Are the employees happy with welfare packages provided to them.<br/>iii.                How far have those packages helped to increase the productivity of these employees.<br/>iv.                What problem do Nigeria railway corporation encounter in maintaining welfare packages with their employees.<br/>v.                  What recommendations are necessary for maintaining employee incentives in Nigeria railway corporation.<br/>1.8       DEFINITION OF SALIENT TERMS<br/>            The following terms are explained in these manner they are used in this project are explained in the content they are used.<br/>EMPLOYEES: The oxford advanced dictionary of current English defines employee as a person paid for wages. Employee are used in this project to mean people whose services are engaged in an organization for commensurate pay, especially done in form of salaries.<br/>WELFARE PRPGRAMME: The oxford advanced dictionary to current English define welfare programme is an organized effort to improve the welfare of those who need help, it is also used in this work, to mean a programme introduced to motivate workers and enhance their morale and bring fort good productivity.<br/>NIGERIA RAILWAY CORPORATION: This is a corporation of company that is in charge of railway lines in Nigeria.<br/><br/>\n\nA SURVEY OF WELFARE PACKAGES AVALIABLE TO THE EMPLOYEES OF THE NIGERIA RAILWAY CORPORTAION AND THE EFFECT ON THEIR PERFORMANCE.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SURVEY OF WELFARE PACKAGES AVALIABLE TO THE EMPLOYEES OF THE NIGERIA RAILWAY CORPORTAION AND THE EFFECT ON THEIR PERFORMANCE.", "id": 106}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARAL CAREER <br/>IN SOME SELLECTED ORGANIZATIONS.

An office being  nerve center of an organization needs good managemented to achieve its desired goals. <br/>However, there are certain factors which affect secretaries while on job and these minder  production and secretaries stability on this career. <br/>Some of these factors are technological factors poor language structure, sociological factors environment factors, and economic factors. <br/>Presently, the need for exposing secretaries to the use of modern office equipment has risen due to challenges they face in the modern word. The effect of language structure that secretaries in institute of management and   Technology receive  during truing can not be over emphasized as in labour marked available jobs are mean for those who have sound knowledge of good English. <br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>It is  degrading and under statement to say that secretarial career is of no importance because secretary is an eye opener. Through which every organization sees. <br/>According to Onabanya (1990)  A secretary is a skilled and specialized type of  employee in an establishment  or part of it who is charged with some aspects of organization functions in the unit dealing with people  correspondence and other business matters;<br/>In today modern world secretaries are faced with a lot of challenges offices due to what they are required to offer. There fore it is basically necessary that secretaries be giver equipment in institute of management and technology Enugu and other tertiary institution in Enugu capital territory.<br/>This profession is a career that attracts disregard from people enqluating eyes. Most employers do not accord them a befitting recognition and respect, rather they show disregard and  disrespect for the career. Often the people misunderstand the word secretary. They are of the opinion that anybody who write some seen it as a mere woman’s career and non-prebtigions. The secretary suffers image and personality degrades and thus  crosses cabinet to other profession. <br/>1.3              purpose of the study <br/>The purpose of this study is to highlight on find out the factors which affect secretarial career in some organization in Enugu capital territory. It would also look into the causes of  misconception and disregard for secretaries and their profession or career in our society and find solutions to these problem. <br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research will help to identify the factors that contribute to secretaries dissatisfaction in offices. <br/>It will also reveal to prospective secretarial in the career what they should expect from the profession as regards people misconception and misunderstanding of the career. <br/>1.5              SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research work is designed to finding out the factors affecting secretarial career in some selected organization in Enugu capital territory only. <br/>Time constraint! This research words was carried out while school is still in session hence, time constrain. The time for travelling to places to gather more facts was limited as I was doing the research work and also trying to meet up with my normal academic works. As a result, this project work was affected to be restricted within the ares of facts I could get within the short available time. <br/>Finance! This is another problem that affected the effectiveness of this research work. As a student researcher, there was not enough money to assist myself to make this work a standardized one. There are some textbooks due to monetary incapability and organization outside Enugu. I could not visit them due to lack of finance to transport my self. In effect, this work was limited only a few organization. <br/>1.6              HYPOTHESIS <br/> Considering the nature and scope of this study, the following hypothesis were used as guide to this study. <br/>(1)               Poor environment affects secretarial career in Enugu. <br/>(2)               Language is a problem to secretaries<br/>(3)               Secretaries are recognized as members of management team. <br/>(4)               Lectures not properly guides the secretaries affect them in their career. <br/>(5)               Secretarial suffers for inadequate equipment in some organization.<br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE FACTORS THAT AFFECT PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARAL CAREER IN SOME SELLECTED ORGANIZATIONS.

These skills include Shorthand, typewriting etc. of all these skills, shorthand happens to the most important and most challenging of all.<br/>         But in secretarial departments of most tertiary institutions, most students believed that secretaries no longer write shorthand in business offices with the invention and installation of such machines e t c.<br/>This nation has contributed to their poor performance in the course since their interest is restricted to passing the course only and not in mastering the<br/>skill.<br/>      The purpose of the study is to determine whether secretaries still apply this skill in the discharge of their duties.<br/>                In order to achieve this purpose, the research as reviewed the contributions of some anthers on the research topic. This made up their literature Review. They also selected five business organizations in Enugu state for their study. The population of her study is all the secretaries in the area of the study.  They also constructed questionnaires which were distributed to all the respondents in the area of the study. These questionnaires were letter collected and the responses analyses.<br/>        After the analysis, the researchers found out that shorthand is still an indispensable tool to the practicing professional secretary in spite of the modern office equipments at her disposal.  They also found out that most executives do not give office dictation often never the less, they take it for granted that the practicing professional secretary is a wizard in the art of writing shorthand.<br/>               Based on their findings, they reprimanded that students should accept the challenges posed by shorthand, take measures to master the skill and devote more time to their studies. They also recommended that lecturers should review their methods of teaching often and on to ensure adequate supervision and guidance.<br/>           Having done justice to the research topic, the researchers suggested that other project researchers should investigate those areas<br/>(a)      Factors responsible for students poor performance in shorthand.<br/>(b)       Strategies for effective teaching and learning of shorthand.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       Introduction<br/>1.1       Background of the study<br/>1.2       Statement of the problem<br/>1.3       Purpose of the study<br/>1.4       Significance of the study<br/>1.5       Scope of the study<br/>1.6       Research limitations<br/>1.7       Research questions<br/>1.8       Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0       Literature Review<br/>2.1    History of shorthand.<br/>2.2       Development of shorthand<br/>2.3       Usefulness of shorthand<br/>2.4       The vale of the secretary in a business office<br/>2.5       The secretary and other modern office equipment and machine<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0       Research methodology<br/>3.1       Research Design<br/>3.2       Area of the study<br/>3.3       Population of the study<br/>3.4       Sources of Date collection<br/>3.5       Method of Date collection<br/>3.6       Analysis of Research instrument<br/>3.7       Description of research instrument<br/>3.8       Validation of Research instrument<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0       Presentation and analysis of data<br/>4.1       Presentation and analysis of data<br/>4.2       Presentation of respondents by organisation<br/>4.3       Analysis of data<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>4.0       Finding, Recommendations and Conclusion<br/>5.1       Discussion of the Findings<br/>5.2       Implication of the study<br/>5.3       Conclusion<br/>5.4       Recommendation<br/>References     <br/>Appendix 1<br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/>Tables<br/>3.1              Analysis of data<br/>4.1a    Presentation of responses by organisatons<br/>4.1b    Presentation of responses on test of skill before appointment<br/>4.2                Presentation of responses on speed administered during the test.<br/>4.3                Presentation of responses on the importance of the test to getting the job<br/>4.4                Presentation of responses on the designation of the secretaries<br/>4.5                Presentation of responses on the applicability of the skill in the performance of duties<br/>4.6                Presentation the uses of the skill<br/>4.7                Presentation of responses on the availability of modern office equipment<br/>4.8                Presentation of responses on the type of modern office equipment available<br/>4.9                Presentation of responses on the possibility of using machine in place of shorthand skill<br/>4.10            Presentation of responses on the effect of modern office equipment on the application of the skill<br/>4.11            Presentation of responses on whether bosses give dictation<br/>4.12            Presentation of responses on the reteat which bosses give dictations<br/>4.13            Presentation of the speed at which bosses give dictations<br/>4.14            Presentation of responses on the performance of secretaries during dictation<br/>4.15            Presentation of responses on the opinion formed of the secretary by her boss in relation to her performance during dictation<br/>4.16            Presentation of responses on the relationship that exist between the secretaries and their bosses<br/>4.17            Presentation of responses on typing of manuscript<br/>4.18            Presentation of the reasons why bosses give manuscript instead of dictation<br/>4.19            Presentation of responses on the attitudes of secretaries to writing shorthand<br/>4.20            Presentation of responses on the preferability of typing form shorthand outlines<br/>4.21            Presentation of responses on the relevance of the skill to effective discharge of duties<br/>4.22            Presentation of response on whether the skill of shorthand I still relevant in this modern age<br/>4.23            Presentation of reasons why shorthand should be encouraged<br/>4.24            Presentation of responses of the problematic nature of the skill<br/>4.25            Presentation of kinds of problems pose by shorthand<br/>4.26            Presentation of responses on whether secretaries take measures to improve on their skill<br/>4.27            Presentation of theses measures<br/>THE STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>In recent times, shorthand writing enjoyed wide acceptability and applicability due to the benefits inherent in its use.

In fact, a secretary who cannot take accurate dictations and transcribe correctly is tantamount to a typist.  That is why so much emphasis is laid on the study of shorthand as a ‘core’ course in secretarial study.  It has the highest allocation of credit loads which students must excel into graduate successfully.<br/>That notwithstanding, students continue to fail the course fearfully.  It seems as if the course is a burden to most students.  Inspite of their love for the profession, some students desert the secretarial department to other departments like Mass Communication, Purchasing and Supply, Business Administration and Management etc.  for fear of shorthand.  When asked, they would confess, ‘I can’t cope with shorthand’.  True to their words, most students cannot cope with shorthand, no matter how hard they try to practice and study the course.  They treat the course with disdain and even hate their lecturers calling them ‘enemies of progress’.  It is important to note that shorthand is the only course (as far as I know) a student stand to get zero in, simply because he/she missed some lines during transcription.  For that, students resort to several means to pass the course and not to master the skill.  As a result, a great number of students graduate from the department as bad as they entered as far as shorthand is concerned.  They no longer regard shorthand as the secretary’s stock-in-trade”.  Most of them believe that they only have to deal with shorthand school and nothing more.<br/>The assertion that shorthand is an indispensable tool to the secretary is to them but an age-long principle which has lost its credibility because of the advent of technology into business offices.  Most of the students interviewed (which necessitated my writing on this topic) maintained that the secretarial department is merely being old fashioned by giving shorthand a ‘monarch’ position among other course.  They believe that shorthand should give way for such courses as data processing, word processing, office information system, etc. and other courses that are better suited to this jet age.<br/>The researchers being so much interested in this issue, intend to investigate  the secretarial  profession vis-à-vis business offices in order to determine, whether the secretary still apply this skill in performing her duties ,whether the use of modern office equipments have in any way displaced this skill<br/>The result  of this research project will go a long way in determining the importance of the skill to the secretary and its position, in relation to other courses, in the secretarial department.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>       In recent times, shorthand writing enjoyed wide acceptability and applicability due to the benefits inherent in I its use. An advantage of shorthand lies in the area of its cost effectiveness. The system also helps in facilitating secrecy in business transaction and for quick recording and processing of information. The need for shorthand writers increased daily with the increase industrial and business activities. It was expected that in so far as business organizations exist; speeches being delivered; that shorthand shall continue to enjoy a pride of place in business offices.<br/>            But today, technology is taking the world by surprise.  Modern office machines and equipment are being produced.  These machines include the1.4 computer, word processors. Tape Recorders, Dictating machines etc.<br/>            The problem of this study of determine;<br/>(a)            Whether technological developments have affected the application of this skill in business offices.<br/>(b)            Is the practical skill of shorthand (and type writing) still a starting point for defining the role of a secretary?  Is the skill still the secretary’s stock-in-trade?<br/>(c)            Do bosses/Executives give office dictations?<br/>(d)           What is the secretary’s attitude to applying this skill is it one associated with pride or contempt?  Do they feel that the course should be encouraged or phased out?<br/>    1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The purpose of the study is basically to investigate the secretarial profession in order to determine whether shorthand still maintain its role as a vocational tool that enables the secretary to obtain and hold interesting and rewarding position in business. Does the secretary still report to shorthand as a relief to the burden of writing cumbersome longhand during note taking?  OR has she employed alternative measures like using Tape Recorders, Dictating Machines, Computer etc.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>This study will help to define more clearly the importance of the skill to the professional secretary, in establishing or destablishing the importance of the skill in business today.  It will also help to clear some deluding notions already conceived and nurtured by lazy students and at the same time influence students’ attitudes to this course.<br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY:<br/>This study is restricted to five business organizations in Enugu state; Nigerian Breweries PLC 9th mile corner Nsude, Anambra motor manufacturing company, Emene, EMENITE Ltd, Emene, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC, (Regional Office), okpara Avenue, Enugu and Nigeria Bottling Company plc, 9th mile corner, Ngwo,<br/>            The researchers intend to construct questionnaire based on the research questions and distribute to all the secretaries in these organization.<br/>1.6     RESEARCH QUESTIONS:<br/>The questions below were constructed by the researchers to enable them collect data for the study.<br/>            The data obtained would be analyzed (using percentages) to arrive at the findings of the project.<br/>QUESTION I<br/>Is the shorthand skill an indispensable tool to the practicing professional secretary?<br/>QUESTION 11<br/>Has the advent of technology into modern business offices affected the application of the skill?<br/>QUESTION 111<br/>Do Bosses (Executives) give office dictations?<br/>QUESTION 1V<br/>Do secretaries enjoy taking shorthand<br/>1.7      DEFINITION OF TERMS:<br/>Shorthand:                                               The system of rapid writing special signs; stenography.<br/>Secretary:                                                 Employee in an office, who deals with correspondence, keeps records, make arrangements and appointments, for a particular member of staff.<br/>Office:                                                       (Rooms) used as a place of business. <br/>Memorandum:                                         Informal business communication usually without a personal signature, on paper headed “memo”.<br/>Sine qua non:                                           - (lat) condition or qualification that cannot be done without, essential.

A secretary is one who besides possession of typewriting and shorthand skills is knowledgeable in management and organizational techniques. The secretary relies on her sill in dealing with people. Such  skills are tact, discretion, courtesy, common sense, pleasant speaking ability and having a good memory, to mention but a few.<br/>            It is a well know fact that every occupation carries some elements of risks usually referred to as occupational hazard. Secretaries are to be found in almost all business organizations worth that name. As is well known, the secretarial profession has come of a age in Nigeria. Secretarial courses are now being offered in all polytechnic in the country and in some reputable universities. The number of students offering the course seems to be growing from day-to-day for those working, the take home pay is relatively attractive. Everything seems to be going for the secretary, yet many secretaries express dissatisfactions with their lot in their work places and some I know have abandoned the profession for greener pastures.<br/>            This study therefore is being carried out to find out the problems facing secretaries in their work paces and those impediments on their way to achieving full job satisfactions identification of those constraints will be a first step in seeking for solutions to the problems and this is the objective of the research.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            In every well organized business, the service of the secretarial personnel are highly needed. It is usually asserted that the success or failure of any organization largely depends on the role of the secretary plays in achieving the objectives of the organization.<br/>            In this modern times, the secretarial profession has become very lucrative and attractive. This has led to an unprecedented influx into the profession. Despite this enviable position the secretarial profession appears to be bedeviled by some unidentified obstacles which may lead the secretary to resort to negative attitude towards their work and even leave their job for entirely different professions.<br/>            It is the aim of this paper to  find out those impediments, obstacles and pitfalls, which make many secretaries wish to leave this profession despite the attractive salaries usually offered to them. We will also seek to find possible solutions and proper recommendations that may stop these problems.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of this study are<br/>i.                    To find out the problems encountered by secretaries working in some selected establishments in Enugu metropolis<br/>ii.                  To find out the likely effects of those problems on the secretary’s performance on the job<br/>iii.                To make suggestions and recommendations for improve of the lot of secretaries.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.Do secretaries in some selected establishment in Enugu metropolis encounter problems in their working place<br/>2.Do these problems detract them from their official performance<br/>3.What are these problems<br/>4.What are the likely solutions to these problems<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            It is envisaged that this study when completed will be immense benefit the secretaries working in some establishment to the management and the organization as a whole.<br/>            Firstly, this study intends to identify the problems encountered by secretaries, which can inject negative attitude in them so that their employers will have cleaver pictures of these problems and devise ways of motivating their secretaries as to enhance productivity. The study will also be beneficial to managers in those organizations so that they will reveal what could be done to enhance the prospects of these secretaries.<br/>            On the other hand, the study will be beneficial to the secretaries themselves in that, if the recommendations advanced in this study are adhered to, they will be better placed in the organization and their status enhanced. It will also serve as an inspiration to Nigeria secretaries to embrace the profession fully having known the already existing problems <br/>            Finally, the research will provide up-to-date information on the secretarial profession.<br/><br/>\n\nOCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY AND THE EFFECTS ON SECRETARIES OCCUPATIONAL PROSPECTS\r\n( A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN ENUGU URBAN)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY AND THE EFFECTS ON SECRETARIES OCCUPATIONAL PROSPECTS\r\n( A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN ENUGU URBAN)\r\n", "id": 109}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A SURVEY OF WORK INCENTIVES OFFERED TO THE EMPLOYEES AMA BREWERIES LIMITED <br/>9TH MILE CORNER, NGWO<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>In this thesis, the researchers did all her best to see that no step necessary for carrying out a qualitative and quantitative research study was ignored.  The objective of this study is to provide readers of the project, with information on how a survey work incentive offered influence the organizational success in Ama Breweries, 9th Mile Corner, Ngwo.<br/>It is also very important to the practicing managers who constantly needs to refresh and update their knowledge.<br/>Other revelations were that:<br/>(1)        A survey incentives offered present in the organization are few and the little ones are not permanent entitlements to the recipient of such benefits.<br/>(2)        The involvement of workers in setting up a survey work incentives offered was found to be non-existent.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>DELIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>ASSUMPTION OF STUDY<br/>DEFINITION OF STUDY<br/>CHAPTER TWO LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE<br/>CONCEPT OF A SURVEY WORK INCETIVE OFFERED<br/>TYPE OF A SURVEY WORK INCENTIVE OFFERED<br/>EMPLOYEES SECURITY (FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGAINST RISK)<br/>A SURVEY WORK INCENTIVE OFFERED AND THE REAL ECONOMIC SITUATION <br/>A SURVEY BENEFITS AS MOTIVATIOR<br/>A SURVEY BENEFITS AND THE EMPLOYEE NEED<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>METHODOLOGY <br/>EXPLAINS<br/>INSTRUMENT FOR DATA COLLECTION<br/>PRIMARY DATA<br/>SECONDARY SOURCE<br/>POPULATION<br/>SAMPLE AND SAMPLING TECHNIQUES<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>RESEARCH FINDING<br/>SUMMARY OF FINDING<br/>CONLUSION<br/>RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>APPENDIX<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>Benefits and services represent a tangible gain to employees inform if monetary or non-monetary rewards.<br/>As the years roll by diverse fringe benefit continue to be introduced. Ubeku (1985) notes that fringe benefits have grown in the country today as a result of the economic situation while others have grown either as a result of presave from trade unions or from sheer imitation. He further notes that ones a benefit has been given to an employee, it would be difficult to remove.<br/>            Nwachukwu (1984) in a related study points out that Nigerian employers offers many types of benefits which are competitive and imitative in nature. Flippo 91971) lists some of the most frequently cited advantages of offering employee services which include effective recruitment, improved moral and loyalty, good public relations- (by effective recruitment) I mean the ability of the organisation to employ and retain the right class of personnel in their employ.<br/>            This study, however attempts to examine the importance of a survey incentives service to the employees in particular and the Nigeria Coal Corporation, Enugu in general and how the incentives scheme have helped to enhance productivity the organisation. It also aims of finding out whether or not there is positive relationship between satisfaction and productivity and how far the benefits administration in Nigeria Coal corporation, commensurate productivity in the organisation and whether the all fringe benefits they receive and why.<br/>            Finding, the research seeks to justify the contention that “A survey incentives offered does not necessarily increase productivity but at best, acts as hygiene factors and why inspite of such believe organisations continued to provide incentives services scheme to their employees.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            The assumption that Nigeria workers are other salary supplements, such as paid leave, free health care programme, bonus, pension and gratuity plans, insurance has received some support from leads to setting up at Eleven different commission on salary review between 1934 and 1938. All these were done in the assumption that workers can be motivated to achieve the goal of the organisation through valued incentives.<br/>            Finally it has not yet been known the type of incentives available to the employees of the newly established.<br/>            AMA Breweries Limited, 9th Mile Corner, Ngwo. It has also not be known whether such incentives are capable of motivating employees to higher productivity.<br/>            Here, this study attempted to find out the type of incentives available to the employees of AMA Breweries Limited, 9th Mile Corner, Ngwo.]<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>            This is the study that seeks to provide an indepth and thorough examinations of work incentives offered, Enugu and to evaluation the appropriateness of the program with a view to ascertaining how they influence workers to perform efficiently and effectively specifically the study will<br/>1.                  Make critical examination and evaluation between fringe benefits and services schemes of the AMA Breweries.<br/>2.                  Evaluate their appropriateness with a view to ascertaining if there exist a positive correction between fringe benefits and services with increased performance.<br/>Ascertain the contributions which fringe benefits can make to the peace and harmony of industrials.<br/><br/>\n\nA SURVEY OF WORK INCENTIVES OFFERED TO THE EMPLOYEES AMA BREWERIES LIMITED \r\n9TH MILE CORNER, NGWO\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SURVEY OF WORK INCENTIVES OFFERED TO THE EMPLOYEES AMA BREWERIES LIMITED \r\n9TH MILE CORNER, NGWO\r\n", "id": 110}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECTS OF COMMUNICATION BARRIERS IN ACHIVEING ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS IN NIGER GASS, EMEME ENUGU<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            If communication is adequate in organizations, there will be proper coordination between the staff and the management and hence achieving the organizational goals on the other hand, if communication is on adequate, it hampers the smooth running of the affairs of the business and general a lot of problems.<br/>            The researcher is aware of the problems posed by inadequate communication and it is in a bid to make detailed study of the effect of these problems and offer solutions for them that this research work is being designed.<br/>            At the sometime, the researcher reduced from the study that management in organizations should be ought that communication is as important as the objectives of setting the organization.<br/>            In addition it was found out there are very wide gap between the executives and their subordinates in the areas of communication.<br/>            If this chasm created is properly handed, there will be proper coordination of activities in business organization.

Because communication barriers have hampered progress to a large extent in many organization, adequate communication should be made because if communication is adequate it will be the best way of improving good relationship between the management and staff in any organization.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              Background of the study<br/>1.2              Statement of the problems<br/>1.3              Purpose of the study<br/>1.4              Scope of the study<br/>1.5              Research questions<br/>1.6              Significance of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1              What is communication<br/>2.2              The process of communication<br/>2.3              Communication purposes<br/>2.4              Essentials of communication<br/>2.5              Factors that may impede effective communication.<br/>2.6              General problem of communication<br/>2.7              Interfering variables in communication<br/>2.8              Types of communication<br/>2.9              Communication in business organization 4<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1              Area of the study<br/>3.2              Population<br/>3.3              Sample and sampling techniques<br/>3.4              Instruments used for data collection<br/>3.5              Validation of instrument used<br/>3.6              Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1       Data presentation and Research<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.1              Discussion of the result<br/>5.2              Implication<br/>5.3              Conclusion<br/>5.4              Recommendation<br/>5.5              Suggestions for further study<br/>5.6              Limitation of the study.<br/>References<br/>Appendix<br/>CHPATER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            God’s creation encompasses all means of getting together, like speaking, laughing, sign going, listening, twinkling of eyes, body movement seasons, weather, cock-crows, sunrise and sun set which are indicators of the time and many others. As a result of this, God’s creation, communication is as old as God’s creation. When God made every living creature on earth, He created then with the possible means of understanding themselves according to their various classes.<br/>            In the first instance, the natural ability of understanding and using signs to communicate among human beings was as old as man’s creation. A good example of this is the dumb and deaf means of communication (signs/symbols) this on its entirety does not involve any formal education in developing the charisma or potential of different ways of sending message and as well decoding the encoded message which feedback is the proof of message well communicated.<br/>            It is not only the above, smoke was and is still a means of communication, the early man invention of fire and its used dies not and there rather  extended and is still a means of communication. When fore is made, a smoke comes out, signifying to a person standing at a distance that a fire has been made of that some where is burning. The burning instrument might either be building, bush, cut-out grasses that was sent on fire, a cooking place where fire was made for cooking. This system of relating among people was in vague in the age. That was a period in the ancient times when the meaning of making fire through stone. This conveys to the early men that food is under preparation of the hunting is going on and so on.<br/>            In addition to the above means getting messages to people, cock-crow was very noticeable and utilized means of communication. Though the hipper increases in technological invention is reducing the effectiveness of this means of communication but, it is still in use in some third-world countries especially in the remoter districts to mark time of the day most in the early morning hours.<br/>            It worth nothing that the early means of communication does not do away with dressing, talking, body language like twinkling of the eye, facial expression, nodding of the head, beckoning of the hand and so on. The way people convey message to another other people. An 1gbo lady for instance, when dressed will be easily dictated the same applies to Yourba, Hauses and other tribes in Nigeria.<br/>            Dressing conveys a lot of message in the case of some people that are bereaved. In the eastern part of the country, black cloth is most used active for a person mourning of deceased relations. Talk also conveys information. A person who stammers for instance is easily dictated by his/her way of doing/handling talk. A deaf and dumb is not noticed by organ representation rather, he resorts to signs and forceful endeavors to get his/her messages encoded. This means of communication portrays lot of importance in the field of communication and it started from the advent of man on earth.<br/>            The beginning of twentieth (20th) century marked the up spring of technology in mostly the third world countries. This saw the birth of new and advancement of communication. The first among trhese modern communication method was “telegram”. This is a means where electrical method and engineering process come in to play. Nigerian telecommunication is for Nigeria alone while other countries have their own communication media or houses. Developed countries of the world have gone far beyond the stage Nigeria is, in the carder of communication, letter writing, fax, report writing telephone are among the current used means of communication.<br/>            The introduction of telephone as a means of communication has ceased man the fatigue of bending down to write volumes of letters and the cost risk of traveling to their business partners to discuss their businesses. <br/>            Tele fax has good in getting in carbon copies of business letter or conversation of executive in organizations. The benefits of modern means of communication cannot the over-emphasized <br/>            Though there exist a lot of communication benefits there exist also a lot of hindrance to effective communication.<br/>            Some of the barriers are technical barrier poor language in attentiveness, Semitic technological barriers and soon.<br/>            Effort have bee geared towards ascending measures for curb these canker – worm  eating deep in our communication system,. A number of firm/organizations have wound-up as a result of the communication barriers. It has lead to poor performance at all levels of business, poor coordination among employers and employees, job termination, lack of progress and vice versa.<br/>            In conclusion the following above analysis, it is noticeable that owners of business organization need to really work hard to overcome most of the communication problems. A corporate and integrated approach is called for here.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>            In Niger ga, Emene Enugu, several queries have been issued to the junior staff members from management to staff management have been accused wrongly and the rank and file threaten down tools or go on strike. Some staff have been denied promotions due to incomplete documents or lack of them partening to their appraisal, production level has slacked and sales and profits effected adversely too due to improper communication or lack of them.<br/>            The writer therefore tried to reason into the effects of communication barriers in achieving organizational goals in Niger gas Emene.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This is to<br/>Find out the causes of communication barriers in the organization<br/>Recommend possible solution to the problem <br/>Find out the effects of these communication barriers in achieving organizational goals<br/>To know the levels in the organization these communication barriers generate most and the extent<br/>And also to ascertain if the management of such organization are aware in the first place of these barriers.<br/>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study is restricted to firms and business organization in Emene with particular reference to Niger Gas locating in Emene Enugu state.<br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>            To get at the root of the barriers to effective communication, the following research questions are essential <br/>1.      Does communication barrier effect organizational functions <br/>2.      Does good communication system make for the existence of organization<br/>3.      What are the remote as well as immediate causes of communication barriers in Niger Gas Emene Enugu<br/>4.      Does poor communication system make for ineffective and inefficient management in Niger Gas company<br/>5.      re there any solutions communication barriers.<br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OD TH STUDY<br/>            The findings of this research will be useful to employers and employees in any business organization like Niger Gas Emene Enugu executives who are the policy makers will also benefits from it in the sense that they will know where their failures on the organization emanated. It will also be useful to the public which most of these organizations serve because where every thing moves well in an organization the workers will serve netter.<br/>            And lastly, it will help the management of such organizations like Niger Gas. This is because where her money is achieved. <br/>  <br/><br/><br/>\n\nEFFECTS OF COMMUNICATION BARRIERS IN ACHIVEING ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS IN NIGER GASS, EMEME ENUGU<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF COMMUNICATION BARRIERS IN ACHIVEING ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS IN NIGER GASS, EMEME ENUGU", "id": 111}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A SURVEY OF PROBLEMS OF CYBERCAFE IN DELTA STATE, NIGERIA.<br/>A CASE STUDY OF 80 CYBERCAFES IN ASABA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This study reveals that the problems of Cyber-cafes in Delta state, Nigeria by means of questionnaires<br/>            Data were collected from Cyber-cafes, frequency counts and simple percentages were used to analyze the data generated.<br/>            Findings revealed the problems militating against internet services in the cyber-cafes as well as some recommendation that can facilitate the operations of cafes.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              Background of the study<br/>1.2              Statement of the problems<br/>1.3              Purpose of the study<br/>1.4              Significance of the study<br/>1.5              Research questions<br/>1.6              Definition of terms.<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1              Definition of Cyber-Café<br/>2.2              Review of Empirical research<br/>2.3              Summary<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1              Design of study<br/>3.2              Area of the study<br/>3.3              Population of study<br/>3.4              Instrument for data collection<br/>3.5              Method of data analysis.<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>PRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS <br/>Reference:<br/>Appendix I<br/>Appendix II<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>            This is an overview of the project topic. It gives the history of the circumstances surrounding the topic<br/>            The internet has mad changes in almost all aspect of our lives as it plays important role in most of what we discuss today about access to distribution and retrieval of information. According to Cachage “Internet explorer” (2001) he declared that Internet explorers have high expectation of internet services which  range from a  simple desire to find something interesting (for no particular reason) to searching for useful information on a specific issue as a result of the great diversity and volume of information contained in he internet. Chen et al (1998) stated that internet can enable the user to have access to information on diverse and specific areas that can meet his needs.<br/>            According to Paul (2002) he said that the internet which began in the 1960’s as a project of a few researcher has grown to be a commercial success with billions of dollars of annual decades into a mass developed within three decades into a mass medium that influences most or all domains of life from education to recreation, from business to medicine and from academic to politics. He notes further that today’s mega-trend and vision of the global village and globalization are based on and influenced by this technology. The influence of the internet allows all aspect of life. In developing as well as developed countries.<br/>            Statistics show that the use of the internet has grown in the most urban area in Africa relatively rapidly in much the same way as the adoption of the mobile phone which followed shortly after. Jensen (1996) observed that over half of African countries have despite their poor telecommunications infrastructure developed some form o low-cost dial up store end e-mail service with a gateway to the internet – 33 of the 54 nations on continent as at 1996, that of these 20 countries have live internet cities.  E listed these as Algeria, Angola, central African Republic, Benin, Cote d’ ivory, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Tanzania, Tunisia, Egypt, Senegal, Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique and of course South Africa, which is among the top 20 countries on the internet when ranked by number of the internet nodes. He noted further that an additional eight countries had well advanced plans for establishing an internet node, namely Burkinafso, Botswana, Gabon, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Guinea, Sierra Leone, as can be seen from the foregoing, Nigeria of which Delta state is part had no live internet public access services in her cities at that time<br/>            At present every capital city and major towns in Nigeria have internet public access services. As indicated by 2002 status report on the Africa internet (1) as of mid-2002 the internet of dial-up internet subscribers was close to 1.7m in Africa, 20 percent up from the previous year mainly bolstered by growth in a few of the larger countries such as Egypt, South Africa, Morocco and Nigeria, that charred public access and the use of corporate networks is continuing to grow at greater rates than he number of dial-up users. The report further notes that there are now many thousands of cyber-café in the major cities of Nigeria run by small entrepreneur who are allowed by the regulator of provide VOIP services as part of the cyber-café license, which costs about $500 a year. These cyber-cafes are growing in number at the passing of each day.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>            This means the reasons why the researcher have chosen to study a particular research. Cyber-café has variety of problems that affect them. It include<br/>High cost of internet connectivity<br/>Frequent/occasional loss of contact with internet service provider (ISP)<br/>Frequent electricity interruption<br/>The poor state of high telecommunication charges in Nigeria.<br/>High cost of maintaining equipment.<br/>HIGH COST OF INTERNET CONNECTIVITY<br/>            Cyber-cafes have thus become very important in Nigeria, as the cost of having internet connectivity is so high that private individuals cannot afford it.<br/>            However, some educational institution (especially tertiary institutions) corporate organization and business centers do have computer in the country – though except in a very few organization and some cyber-cafes, most of these computers are not connected to the internet. This is  due to the high cost of connectivity.<br/>FREQUENT/OCCASSIONAL LOSS OF CONTACT WITH INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP)<br/>            It is common place to experience loss of contact from internet service provider when one is using cyber-café. The loss of contact could last for a few second, minutes, hours or could last for a day to several days and is very discouraging hen it is experienced.<br/>FREQUENT ELECTRICITY INTERRUPTION.<br/>            There are a number of circumstances which prevent cyber-café from offering more and better services in addition to internet access provision. From time to time electricity supply is interrupted in the country and this affects the provision of internet services by cyber-café<br/>POOR STATE OF AND HIGH TELECOMMUNICATION CHARGES IN NIGERIA<br/>            Local telephone systems are very important for the widespread use of the internet but the Nigeria telecommunication limited (NITEL) current infrastructure has too low a capacity for the internet.<br/>            In Nigeria communication technology development is restrained by NITEL the sole distributors of telecommunication services<br/>HIGH COST OF MAINTAINING EQUIPMENT<br/>            Computer consultant is very important in cyber-café to help the customer who need assistance and to ensure that café runs smoothly.<br/>            However, in Delta state consultant are scare in that it is difficult for the cyber-café to have or invite a good consultant for services when the equipment breakdown. Therefore any consultant in the cyber-café could get to service the equipment usually charge them very high.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>            This means what exactly the researcher is ging to do. The researcher’s target which she set out to reach are as follows<br/>The main purpose of this study is to identify the problems of cyber-café in Delta state<br/>On the other hand, to find out if such problems exist<br/>To know the extent of these problems if they exist<br/>To suggest solutions where necessary<br/>To recommend actions to be taken to avoid problems of cyber-café in Delta state.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This mean the benefits to be derived from the study<br/>            This study is significant to that its findings should enable stakeholders to know the current state of cyber-café in the state and then take steps to increase public access to the internet.<br/>            It is also significant to relevant authorities to moderate the amount charged for internet connection so as to encourage people to establish internet cafes.<br/>            The findings and recommendations would thus enable individuals and corporate bodies to put more efforts to set up more cyber-cafes, especially in the rural areas, to cater for the teaming population of the state.<br/>            Its findings should enable students, business men and women, lecturers etc to know the existence, the importance of the internet and access to and use of the internet.<br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>            These are questions posed by the researcher which will be help her find solution to the problems. It is the objectives of this study to know<br/>What are the causes of high cost of internet connectivity<br/>Why do cafes have occasional loss of contact with internet service provider<br/>How does electricity interruption affect the cafes<br/>What are the causes of poor state of and high telecommunication charges in Nigeria.<br/>What are the effect of high cost of maintaining equipment<br/>1.6       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>CYBER-CAFÉ: This is a café from which people can access the internet. It is also a chartroom or can be called a business center.<br/>INTERNET: It is global network which anybody can hook onto. It is rich online sources of information from  bulletin, boards electronics mail, exchange of audio/video, data to business transaction face to face discussion with any body in the world or distant relations and friends.         <br/>INTERNET EXPLORER: This mean any person who uses internet for internet or enjoyment. <br/>\n\nA SURVEY OF PROBLEMS OF CYBERCAFE IN DELTA STATE, NIGERIA.

It is eviolent that new jobs usually required training in new skill.<br/>            The fact that in service training helps to eliminate the numerous problems faced by old employees in coping with the new technological trends is self evialent <br/>            In addition the motivation of employees who have just been used or promoted is likely high. Though training may become more problematic when it involves experience employees who require additional training to enhance their performance. The training needs of such employees are not always easy to determine, even when determined the individuals involved may resent being asked to change their established way of doing their jobs.<br/>            The purpose of in service training is usually to achieve some set goals, which will be beneficiary to both the individuals and the organizations.

Having seen the definitions of in service training, ,let us consider the strategies f improving its functionalities. <br/>            The aim of in service training for the secretaries being to help them overcome many challenges posed to them by the modern technologies such as computers, fax machines, word processors etc. to now improve the functionalities of this training for secretaries it becomes imperative to train them in the use of these equipment to enhance their productivity and efficiency<br/>To also improve on the functionalities of in service training for secretaries in a modern business organization, such must be well articulated and well designed toward personal and organizational goals.<br/>            According to Wyn Reilay (1979) he said that there are two schools of thought as to the extent the design and running of their services  We are more interested in the second school of thought which agrees that trainees should participate in determining what should constitute an in service training for them. For it helps to develop a sense of responsibilities.<br/>            Granti8ng study leave instead of on the job training will improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in no small measures, in that they will have enough time to consulate on the training and also remove stress which will not help in the training.<br/>            Attachment of incentives like promotion, monetary reward etc, can as well enhance the functionalities of in service training of secretaries. The type of personnel assigned to conduct the training will equally in no small measure improve the functionalities of this training, seeing that in service training si a two way course that really involves a trainee and a tutor. How the tutor handles the course will go a long way to arouse the interest and dedication of the trainees. Using qualified personnel will in turn bring in new motivation, fresh insights, whose teaching techniques is based on many years if experience will impact and improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in a modern business organization in Enugu sate. <br/>            A good communicator is e1qually a great asset to this course of study.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            The inability of employers to send their staffs for in servuice training posses a lot of problem and pulls down efficiency and productivity.<br/>Most modern business organizations in Enugu state lack qualified secretaries. They employ secondary school leavers as secretaries, when they don’t even know who a secretary is not to talk of what her duties are. There in experience and lack of training posses a great problem as to what assets of training to give them. <br/>            The establishment of staff development and distant education for staff training is one thing but lack of facilities,, non chalet attitude of employers and lack of funds are militating against the up-liftment of such projects like in service training of secretaries.<br/>            Some of these employers lack adequate knowledge as to how in service training can really improve their workers and in turn bring about greater productivity and efficiency <br/>            Selfishness and greediness is another problem facing the improvement of the functionalities of in service training og secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state in that over use these secretaries and at the same time pay them very little amount of money as salary, which makes it difficult for such secretaries to go for in service training and when the attempt to attend one is usually not a very qualitative one and the result is usually learning little of nothing at all.<br/>            These days, people are mainly interested in the acquiring of certificates and not really on skill acquisition of learning what they are suppose to learn. In this situation, such secretaries will inevitably receives what they have asked for which is inadequate training.<br/>            Considering the above background, the study therefore, awareness should be created in the need for improved functionality of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state, to be able to promote efficiency and increase productivity.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF STHE STUDY<br/>            The study is therefore designed to <br/>1.      Examine the literature on in service training of secretaries with the intension of improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organization in Enugu state.<br/>2.      Determine if secretaries in modern business organization in Enugu state are given adequate training<br/>3.      Determine the need for improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state,.<br/>4.      Create awareness on the needs of employing qualified secretaries and on he need of sending them for an improved in service training.<br/>5.      Offer immediate and long term suggestion for the improvement of the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            This study will seek to answer the following questions<br/>1.      What literature can be examined to improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state<br/>2.      How far are secretaries in modern business organization given adequate training<br/>3.      To what extent is the need to improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organization in Enugu state.<br/>4.      What level of awareness is to be created in the needs of employing qualified hands in modern business organizations and on the need of sending them for an improved in service training programmes.<br/>5.      What immediate and long term suggestion should be offered for the improvement of the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state.<br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study is significant for the following reasons <br/>1.      It will go a long way in helping to create the necessary awareness required of employers in achieving an improved in service training of their secretaries, for an improved functionalities of these secretaries. Thee by making them more productive and deficient in their jobs to the benefit of the employers and to their joy and satisfaction.<br/>2.       It will help build the desire for self development as the secretaries are provided with the opportunity of self evaluation, which will in-turn move them to strive for greater competence in their job to the benefits of the employers.<br/>3.      This study will serve as a guide and also as a motivational tool for both the secretaries and the employers of labor in modern business organization in Enugu state.<br/>4.      This will help the Nigerian labor congress to put-up a common front and fight against mediocrity in the   employment and training (in service) of the secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state, thereby creating job opportunities for qualified secretaries and creating good ground for qualitative and improved in service training of same. <br/>5.      The study is significant in that it will help our policy makers take into account the strategies of improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations ion the state, thereby formulating development plans to favor them. The policy makers can even go to the point of making a uniform and standard rule on how the in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in the state should be carried out. This in turn will put the secretaries in the lime-light and also make for their better utilization <br/>6.      It will take away redundancy and make the secretaries feel fulfilled. <br/> <br/>\n\nTHE STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF SECRETARIES IN MODERN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION IN ENUGU STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF SECRETARIES IN MODERN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION IN ENUGU STATE", "id": 113}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>SECRETARY AS THE IMAGE – MAKER OF A BUSINESS ORGANIZATION <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF NIGERIAN BREWERIES PLC ONITSHA AND OUR LADY’S INDUSTRIES NKPOR-AGU ANAMBRA STATE <br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>            This study investigated the role of the secretary in the image making of a business organization with particular reference to Nigeria Breweries Plc Onitsha and our Lady’s Industries Nkpor-Agu Anambra State.

Form the data collected through questionnaire administered to the secretaries, the researcher found out the following:<br/>            Firstly, most secretaries at the above named organizations possess the standard speed of 100wpm in shorthand and that means that they are first class secretaries, while most of then also have the speed of 50 and 60wpm in typewriting.<br/>            Secondly, the secretaries confirmed that a better conclusive office will enhance their performance, that they should be provided with conducive offices, which will enhance their performance and promote the image of the company. <br/>            Thirdly, most secretaries in the above named organization agreed that the possession of personal and business attributes is very important to a secretary in the discharging of her responsibilities and functions. <br/>            It was also found out that the secretary is really the image maker of the organization, a living dairy for his / her boss and as such it cannot be as over statement to say that the efficiency of a an organization is judged through the performance of the secretary. <br/>            Finally, recommendations were made.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1         BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>1.2         STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>1.3         PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.4         SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY  <br/>1.5         SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.6         RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>2.0       LITERATURE REVIEW  <br/>2.1         WHO IS A SECRETARY <br/>2.2         THE QUALIFIED SECRETARY <br/>2.3         TYPIST V SECRETARY<br/>2.4         IMAGE MAKING FUNCTION   <br/>2.5         BUSINESS ATTRIBUTES <br/>2.6         PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES <br/>2.7         SUMMARY OF LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>3.0       RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  <br/>3.1         AREA OF STUDY <br/>3.2         POPULATION AND SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION <br/>3.3         METHOD OF COLLECTING DATA <br/>3.4         QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN AND ADMINISTRATION<br/>3.5         METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS<br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS      <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>5.0       SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION   <br/>5.1         SUMMARY OF FINDINGS <br/>5.2         RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.3         CONCLUSION <br/>5.4         LIMITATION OF THE STUDY <br/>5.5         SUGGESTION FOR FURTHER RESEARCH <br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1         BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY  <br/>Secretary-ship is an important hub around which modern office and management revolves. Like the heart which is involved in the manufacturing, pumping and distribution of blood to various organs of the body, secretary-ship provides the bridge the body, secretary-ship provides the bridge which links the functions of different arm of an organization, creates a whole out of disjointed branches of activity. <br/>The history of the secretarial profession could be terraced back to the industrial revolutions of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries which gave birth to record keeping and the invention of the art of manuscripts. When it because imperative that these two innovations could not provide a complete answer to smoother take-off of business and full office operations, further inventions were made and these were the art of typing and printing, with the resultant training of the first batch of officers in the allied trades. <br/>Because of the free use of the word “secretary” by all and semidry, only a few people have taken time to analyzed the important and concept of this essential vocation. In modern terms, secretary has become an omnibus terminology associated with a wide range of practitioners who have varying framework of correspondence and record keeping. For instance, no reasonable employer can go to the employment agency or put up an advert in the press today merely stating secretary wanted, unless he specifies the type and peculiar qualification or breed, the result is most likely to be negative. This confirms the age-long omission of appropriate nomenclature for many classes of paper workers now conglomerated under the tag secretary.<br/>This background now leaves us with the question. Who is a secretary? Secretary-ship is a career, a vocation that has by its wide application and tendency accommodate many breeds of seemingly related but differing groups of correspondence workers almost lost its original identity. It has gradually assumed the posture of a No man’s line.<br/>Form the professional term secretary-ship come the technical name secretary meaning, the practitioner or operator of the secretarial careers. Secretary is not an accidental appellation given merely to satisfy philological need. It is a technical expression denoting job relativity and   pointing to job motive.<br/>The word secretary is derived from the latin word secretaries menacing “a person entrusted with secretes. According to Advanced English Learners Dictionary, secret means (to be) kept form knowledge or view of others, to conceal. The same Dictionary defined “secretary” as an employee in the office who deals with correspondence, keeps records, make arrangement and appointments for a particular member of the staff.<br/>If the secretary by derivation means “the keeper of secretes” (wide secret is a fitting synonym for confidentiality) and the functions borders on handling of correspondence and keeping of records, it follows therefore that while other classes or species of record keepers and correspondence handlers may borrow the title “secretary” for appropriate descriptive nomenclature. The fit and proper class entitled to the appellation “secretary”, is that class which by training, education and grooming in the art of record keeping, is secret or confidentiality-oriented. It is that species which in actual work situation is more seen than heard. In other words, secretary refers most appropriately to that class of correspondence or records worker whom by training and orientation assumes the posture of a repository of confidence.<br/>Interestingly, the traditional maltreatment and belief of people have deteriorated with time. This is because training for the profession is not only emphasized but sophisticated methods and materials, modern techniques and facilities have been introduced and obviously this has evidently facilities the turn out of good and qualified secretaries. <br/>A secretary is much more important nowadays than in the past. She is an administrative officer of the company. As regards matters concerning administration the secretary has ostensible authorities to sign contracts on behalf of the company. The secretary within the capacity of the office portrays a positive image of the employees in the organization. It is also observed that the secretary, in the course of her daily business, associate with those above her level and those on her level. <br/>In his book “the effective secretary” Onasanya stated that a secretary should be able to dine with kings and mix with the commons.<br/>Migini (1982), while apprising the dynamic and tasking position of a secretary in the office posited that the secretarial work is a career indeed. In the business world and in the professional field, the not bother him with petty problems that she can solve with little thoughts or research. These are the basic ingredients to find out the whether the secretary is really the image-maker of a business organization.<br/>1.2         STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>It has been observed that despite all the duties performed by the secretary, business organization and individuals have continued to under-rate the secretaries and do not the organization. They see the profession as one for unintelligent people their right positions. They believe that anybody who uses the typewriter and takes dictations is a secretary, hence secretaries are paid very poorly.<br/>This study is aimed at investigating whether the secretary is really the image maker of a business organization.  It will under take to examine the roles of a secretary to see if these are enough to describe her s the image maker of an organization. <br/>In solving this problem, the researcher would investigate the following areas:<br/>1)            Her ability to compose and initiate correspondence<br/>2)            How she answers telephone calls and receives visitors <br/>3)            Whether a good image of the company is portrayed through his / her activities <br/>4)            Whether the environment where he /she work is conducive enough for the performance of his / her duties <br/>5)            Whether the secretary possess these attributes: punctuality, neatness, Tactfulness, confidentiality, courtesy, Royalty, politeness, orderliness, reliability, Honesty etc. <br/>6)            Whether these attributes help him / her to carry out his / her function efficiently and effectively <br/>1.3         PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  <br/>The researcher effort on the project is geared towards the accomplishment of the following goals:<br/>1)            To find out who a secretary is <br/>2)            To find out whether the secretaries in the Nigerian Breweries Plc Onitsha and the secretaries at our Lady’s Industries Nkpor-Agu are doing their work effectively and efficiently. <br/>3)            To find out whether secretaries are really the image-makers in a business organization; using NB Plc Onitsha and sour case study Lay’s Industries as a case study <br/>4)            To find out whether these secretaries have peculiar attributes in the discharge of their duties. <br/>5)            To find out whether the secretaries are provided with expected materials and conducive offices in the discharge of their duties <br/>6)            And finally to suggest possible solution to any perceived shortcoming.  <br/>Secretary is an essential link in the diversified daily activities of the organization. The pivot on which organizational activities rotate, the contract between the organization and the outside world. The smooth and efficient running of the organization depend solely upon the secretary’s ability and she has more to do with the practical running of the organization then any other officer does. <br/>  To those who regard on office clerk or typist to be the qualified secretary, the national secretaries association of the united states of America, defined a secretary “as an Executive assistant, who possesses a mastery of office skills, who demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who makes decision within the scope of an assigned authority.<br/>The secretary is employed initially because he / she possesses at least one office skill which the company needs and from that point, it is up to her to grow in knowledge and skill in order to aid in the systematization of her office. <br/>The position of a secretary in an organization is neither below nor on top of the organization. Her office is used to build up staff requirements and staff classification. By virtue of her work, she knows practically everything relating to her organization. She is the first to come to work and the last to go.<br/>The secretary is a public relations experts, a staff assistant, the boss’s office memory. She must be able to carry out her duties without supervision and direction. She represented the company and her employer and generates good human relationship in working with all employee in the organization.<br/>She is almost the one who posses desirable qualities that promotes her professional competence, accuracy, highly efficient, great and sound in judging when to use her initiative and when to consult her employer about handling a job.<br/>She adjusts to the changing roles and situations, she can recognize and meet a deadline. She informs her employer about developments that may effect office efficiency but she does.<br/>1.4         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>1)            The Nigerian Breweries Plc Onitsha and our Lady’s Industries Nkpor-Agu Anambra State will benefit from this study as they will learn of the important roles their secretaries play to their image making. <br/>2)            The secretaries will as well realize their importance to the image making of the organization and will be prepared to do their job better.<br/>3)            The study will be beneficial to students of secretarial studies and other researchers as the study will add to the pool of knowledge in the field of secretarial profession. <br/>4)            Similarly, the study will be very handy for different business organization that over took the secretary under their employment took the secretary under their employment as the image-maker of the organization and then devise means of making effective utilization of their services. <br/>1.5         SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will be limited to the secretaries that work in the Nigeria Breweries Plc Onitsha and our Lady’s Industries Ltd Nkpor-Agu Anambra State.<br/>1.6          RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>In other to achieve a more purposeful and significant result form this study, the researcher though it necessary to ask the following questions.<br/>1)            Do secretaries require special training? <br/>2)            To what extent does secretary create an image for a firm? <br/>3)            What are the duties of a secretary?<br/>4)            Are secretaries’ office conducive for the performance of their duties? <br/>5)            To what extent do the secretaries’ attribute help them in discharging the duties creditably? <br/>  <br/>\n\nSECRETARY AS THE IMAGE - MAKER OF A BUSINESS ORGANIZATION \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NIGERIAN BREWERIES PLC ONITSHA AND OUR LADY'S INDUSTRIES NKPOR-AGU ANAMBRA STATE \r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SECRETARY AS THE IMAGE - MAKER OF A BUSINESS ORGANIZATION \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NIGERIAN BREWERIES PLC ONITSHA AND OUR LADY'S INDUSTRIES NKPOR-AGU ANAMBRA STATE \r\n", "id": 114}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTER LITERACY ON MODERN SECRETARIES IN NEPA ENUGU<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This project attempted to identify the effects of computer literacy on the job performance of modern secretaries and to find out if secretaries without computer knowledge can be conveniently employed in a modern office.<br/>            The researcher used all the secretaries in NEPA Enugu Zonal office which is 75 secretaries as the population of the study. Because of the smallest of the population size, the researcher used the entire population of 75 secretaries for the study. <br/>            The instrument used for data collection was a 20-iten structured questionnaire called ECLOSEC (effects of computer literacy on secretaries) which was prepared by the researcher.<br/>            The researcher in order to get the needed result distributed questionnaire to some staff of National Electric Power Authority, NEPA Enugu zonal office which was the area of study of this project, and their responses were converted. The researcher was able to found out that there are some effects of computer literacy on modern secretaries which are speed and accuracy, neatness,  easy edition, formatting and saving of documents. Also that secretaries without computer knowledge cannot be employed in a modern office<br/>            Furthermore, the researcher agreed that the major problem of secretaries is the fear that computer has come to replace them because they know fully well that without computer knowledge they would not be able to do their work perfectly in a modern office. The researcher noticed that students are not taught word processing as a serious course and this has contributed to their failure in performing their job.<br/>            It was as a result of these findings, the researcher suggested that every secretary should try hard to become computer literate by going for the training so as to secure gainful employment in a modern office.<br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/>Table 4.1         Responses of the respondents on the effects of computer literacy on the job performance of modern secretaries<br/>Table 4.2         Responses of the respondents on whether the use of computer affected the efficiency of secretaries<br/>Table 4.3         Responses of the respondents on the effects of computer application of the productivity of secretaries.<br/>Table 4.4         Responses of the respondents on whether the advent of computer affected the demand for secretaries.<br/>Table 4.5         Responses of the respondents on whether modern secretaries who are not computer literate be employed in a modern office<br/>Table 4.6         Responses of the respondents on whether secretaries without computer literacy skill maintain their position in the modern office.<br/>Table 4.7         Responses of the respondents on whether their office still accept secretaries without computer knowledge<br/>Table 4.8         Responses of the respondents on whether the continues growth of computer in modern business world would make secretaries without computer literacy be conveniently employed.<br/>Table 4.9         Responses of the respondents on whether the knowledge of computer facilitate the work of secretaries.<br/>Table 4.10       Responses of the respondents on how computer facilitate the work of a secretary<br/>Table 4.11       Responses of the respondents on how you ease the output of work you produce with computer<br/>Table 4.12       Responses of the respondents on whether computer has displayed secretaries in modern office<br/>Table 4.13       Responses of the respondents on the importance of computer to modern secretaries<br/>Table 4.14       Responses of the respondents on how they accept the importance of computer to secretary.<br/>Table 4.15       Responses of the respondent on how had the use of computer made your role as a secretary<br/>Table 4.16       Responses of the respondents on whether computer has reduced the boredom of a secretary by making their routine task easy.<br/>Table 4.17       Responses of the respondents on whether the introduction of computer has come to replace the work of secretaries.<br/>Table 4.18       Responses of the respondents on how were the job opportunities of the secretaries.<br/>Table 4.19       Responses of the respondents on has the introduction of computer in your office<br/>Table 4.20       Responses of the respondents on if yes, what are the challenges <br/>TABLE OF CONTENET<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              Background of the study<br/>1.2              Statement of the problem<br/>1.3              Purpose of the study<br/>1.4              Research question<br/>1.5              Hypothesis<br/>1.6              Scope of the study<br/>1.7              Significance of the study<br/>CHAPTER TOW<br/>REVIEW OF LITERATURE<br/>2.1              The meaning and development of computer<br/>2.2              Importance o computer and computer literacy <br/>2.3              The effects of computer literacy on modern secretaries<br/>2.4              The problems of secretaries encounter in the use of computer<br/>2.5              Summary of the literature reviewed.<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1              Research design<br/>3.2              Area of the study<br/>3.3              Population of the study<br/>3.4              Sample and sampling procedure<br/>3.5              Instrument for data collection<br/>3.6              Validation of the research instrument.<br/>3.7              Reliability of the research instrument<br/>3.8              Methods of data collection<br/>3.9              Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>DATA PRESENTATION AND RESULTS<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>DISCUSSION OF RESULTS, IMPLICATION AND RECOMMENDATION.<br/>5.1              Discussion of results<br/>5.2              Conclusion<br/>5.3              Implication of the research results<br/>5.4              Recommendations<br/>5.5              Suggestions for further research<br/>5.6              Limitation of the study<br/>References<br/>Appendixes <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            In the past, centuries, secretaries keep important documents or mails in their files or drawers. These files will be kept in the file cabinet as the storage facility and this process will be in progress for years. Although these facts are kept at a stage some of these documents may get too old and tore, it can get lost or the cabinet may not contain it any longer thereby leading to its relocation. Also another worker in the organization may take away an important document without the secretary’s knowledge<br/>            Further, stones and sticks were initially used as counting tools or machine before the industrial revolution. Charles Babbage who invented the first calculating machine fore see the ineffectiveness of using the Abacus method of calculation. Computer came into existence with the help of the Harvard University coupled with the idea of Babbage with the experience gained from the use of punched cared machine. The first electric computer was build in 1944 and it was called the Electronic Numerical Integrator and calculator (ENIC)<br/>            Over the years, (during the 19th and 20th century) business officers have been under going the process of computerization in terms of installing computers and other modern equipment in pace of old And absolute ones. This computerization process started in Europe after the industrial revolution and has since gone round the world including Nigeria and Enugu.<br/>            Moreover, the duties of modern secretaries in offices and the use of computer revolves round the secret for the achievement of organizational goals because a modern office that does not have this computer may not achieve their goals effectively. A modern secretary is a person who possesses a mastery of office skills who demonstrate the ability to assume responsibilities without supervision, who exercises initiatives and judgment and who make decisions within the scope of assigned authority with the knowledge of computers.<br/>            Today most offices have been computerized and it is the secretaries that manipulates these equipments in the course of discharging their duties effectively. The question now is “To what extent does the use of computer affect the job performance of modern secretaries in terms of efficiency, quality of work done reduces mistakes in circulation and gives offices efficient cost effect analysis that would be nearly impossible with manual operations. The effects of the computer literate on the modern secretaries than becomes an issue of discussion.<br/>            Computerized technology is more powerful, more versatile and more flexible than the mechanical technology that the world has now outgrown. In the rapidly changing world where information technology and the electronic office is fast becoming a reality, secretaries cannot be pleased and rely on their basic office skills or secretarial training. Although skills and discipline will be necessary, the ability to be conversant with word processors, computer, desktop publishing equipment and computer application and future innovations will be an essential requirement. Introduction of computer technology improves the secretarial skills and experience. Office work is the area of business which has been most influenced by computer and micro processor. Secretarial work requires the use of word processor, printer and monitors to control their operations and it also help artists, scientist, engineers, accountants, etc. computers are vital to the secretaries in their management systems and storage of information.<br/>            In spite of this computer age, some secretaries are still carrying out their duties manually without the aid of computers because they are completely ignorant of the usefulness of the computer. This research therefore is carried out in order to carefully identify how computer literacy can help modern secretaries and how it will effect their duties.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Since the introduction of computer into the business world, secretaries now find it difficult to cope with the latest development in micro age. Because there are many problems associated with the use of computer. According to Terry (1970:155) stated that the problems associated with the use of computer is heavily with the cost of maintenance. The cost of repairing and maintaining computer are so high that most of them are dumped in the office making secretaries who are acquainted with them handicapped to tackle their job. Recurrent expenses in the form of cost of stationery, ink, training of staff and special pay for such staff are problems encounters in procuring computer Onasanya (1990:248). He further said that computer reduces inefficiency on the part of the secretary, problems such as delay in production due to break down of the machines arises.<br/>Also modern secretaries without computer literate find it difficult to cope or perform their duties  well in a modern office. Many modern office now no longer employ any secretary without computer literate.<br/>Again, the old system of filing or storage has been phased out since the introduction of computers in to the business world. Some modern secretaries cling to the use of manual machine due to their ignorant of the usefulness of computer because of their lack of knowledge of it. Hence her interest for this study to identify the effects of computer literacy on modern secretaries.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The aims of this study is to identify the effects of computer literacy on modern secretaries using NEPA Enugu as the focal point. <br/>Specially, the study will try to<br/>Identify the effects of computer literacy on the job performance of modern secretaries.<br/>Find out whether modern secretaries who are not computer literate can be employed in a modern office<br/>Identify whether the knowledge of computer facilitates the work of modern secretaries.<br/>Find out the importance of computer to modern secretaries.<br/>Find out whether the computer has come to replace the work of secretaries.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            To achieve the above objectives, five research questions were formulated and the research will provide answers to the following research questions.<br/>What are the effects o computers literacy on the job performance o modern secretaries<br/>Can modern secretaries who are not computer literate be employed in a modern office<br/>Does the knowledge of computer facilitates the work of secretaries.<br/>What are the importance o computer to modern secretaries<br/>Has the introduction of computer come to replace the work of secretaries.<br/>1.5       HYPOTHESIS<br/>            The following null hypothesis will be tested.<br/>Ho:      There is no significance difference between the mean responses of female and male secretaries of NEPA Enugu on the effect of computer literacy on the job performance of modern secretaries (P&lt;.05)<br/>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This research is focused on an identification of the effects of computers literacy on modern secretaries in NEPA Enugu. Also to the use of observation which were employed to assess both view of the senor secretaries and  junior secretaries and the top managers that work directly with the secretaries.<br/>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study is going to identify the effects of computer on the job performance of modern secretaries in modern office, to recommend solutions for the up-liftment of everybody in business and for the growth of Nigerian economy in particular.<br/>SECRETARIES<br/>            This study is significant in that it will help modern secretaries to know whether computer literate is important in performing their jobs. This is to minimize and where possible to eliminate computer ignorance on the side of secretaries, workers and nature itself.<br/>            It will also help to clear the argument on whether the introduction of computer will make modern secretaries jobless or not. Many secretaries now bear it at the back of their mind that the only reason of introducing computer into our business is to chase them away from their normal position in the office<br/>EMPLOYERS<br/>            On the side of employers, the notable significance is to inform the employers on the category of secretaries to organizations will equally enjoy this research since it will help them to know, choose or employ qualified secretaries in their organizations.<br/>            The secretaries are said to be the life wire of any organization or business. When the secretaries and their employers are happy, the business itself will be invariably happy. The position of secretaries in office affair is a function of the world position in office line. Therefore, the world as a whole is a beneficiary from the study<br/>            Finally, this study is immensely significant, primarily with the respect to the fact that it constitutes a major requirement to the conferment of the Higher National Diploma in secretarial studies on the writer. The study will be beneficial to those who need the information for literature enrichment of the subject such as director, managers, secretaries and those interested in secretarial information.<br/><br/>\n\nAN IDENTIFICATION OF THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTER LITERACY ON MODERN SECRETARIES IN NEPA ENUGU<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTER LITERACY ON MODERN SECRETARIES IN NEPA ENUGU", "id": 115}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN THIS MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL ERA<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED ESTABLISHMENTS IN ENUGU STATE)<br/>          ABSTRACT</b> <br/>High productivity is the pursuit if every public corporation. To allow for this, it is therefore necessary that the organization should tackle all the problems that could hinder the objective, purpose, growth and target for which the organization was established. This project therefore, is undertaken to give actual background on the problems that affect secretaries on their jobs, their prospects, the need to tackle these problems and the effect of these problems on secretarial productivity. According to the study, these problems could lead to under utilization of secretaries, dissatisfaction with their jobs and lower productivity. Using observation, interview and questionnaire methods, it was found out that the secretaries were also affected with poor promotional morale, lack of adequate motivation, lack of modern equipment and poor conditions of employment compared with their counterparts.  Also discussed were the prospects of secretaries in public corporations. The major findings was that there is poor promotional prospect in the secretarial profession. However, the appraisal of secretarial profession should be advocated because it will avail the organization the opportunity of proper utilization of the secretaries. The secretaries will be willing to put in their best on the job thereby enhancing productivity.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction                                        <br/>1.1        Background of the Study                      <br/>1.2        Statement of the Study                        <br/>1.3        Purpose of the Study                   <br/>1.4        Significance of the Study                              <br/>1.5        Research Questions                             <br/>Reference                                                          <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Review of Literature                             <br/>2.1        Introduction                                                <br/>2.2        The Problems of Nigeria Secretaries<br/>2.3        Prospects of Nigerian Secretaries           <br/>2.4        The Current Problems and Prospects <br/>of Secretaries in Public Corporations               <br/>2.5        Summary of Related Literature              <br/>Reference                                                          <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1        Introduction                                <br/>3.2        Research Design                  <br/>3.3        Population of the Study                        <br/>3.4        Sample and Sampling Technique            <br/>3.5        Sources of Data                          <br/>3.6        Questionnaire Design and allocation        <br/>3.7        Method of Data Collection             <br/>3.8        Method of Data Analysis                               <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0    Presentation and Analysis of Data          <br/>4.1        Introduction                                                <br/>4.2        Data Analysis                                              <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0        Summary of Findings, Recommendations<br/> and Conclusions                 <br/>5.1        Discussion of Findings                           <br/>5.2        Summary of findings                    <br/>5.3        Conclusions                                <br/>5.4        Recommendations                               <br/>5.5        Limitations of the Study                                <br/>5.6        Suggestions for Further Studies<br/>References                                                 <br/>Appendix                                                            <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>        Secretaries as seen in the secretarial world and business organizations today, are faced with many problems and also have some prospects.<br/>        A secretary according to Hornby (2001), “is an employee in an office who deals with correspondence, keeps records, makes arrangements and appointments for a particular member of the staff”<br/>        The American Secretarial Association defined a secretary in the most acceptable way as – “an assistant to an executive, possessing a mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who displays initiative, exercises judgment and makes decisions within the scope of assigned authority.”<br/>        A secretary    can also be defined as a person who maintains a high standard of confidentiality and a repository of information. Infact, there are numerous definitions of the word secretary as far as there are many authors. With the above definition in mind, one can easily see that the need for a secretary in any corporation cannot be overemphasized.<br/>        A secretary is a major communicating link between the executive ad his associates, the office staff and the public. As a result of this important linking position, a secretary can play a vital role in helping to create and maintain a smooth running business office. Thus a secretary seen as the bedrock and image-image of any business organization.<br/>        For a secretary to perform her functions efficiently and effectively, she must have undergone some educational training and obtained the basic office knowledge and skills to be efficient and effective on the job. A secretary is quite different from a clerk, a typist and other office workers.<br/>        However, for one to qualify as a secretary, she must have taken courses in shorthand, typewriting, office practice, secretarial duties and must be fairly computer literate for easy adaptation in modern offices.  <br/>        Shorthand and typewriting are the key working tools of a secretary and it is expected that any person who aspires to take up any secretarial post must have passed typewriting ad shorthand within the following speed range – 25-100 words per minute, 80-120 words per minute in typewriting and shorthand respectively.<br/>        It is not uncommon to see people who have only passed typewriting at any of the recognized speeds without shorthand or those that have typewriting and shorthand skills are referred to as secretaries. These categories of secretaries are not qualified secretaries.<br/>        Some of the certificates recognized  in our business organizations and of course our corporation for secretaries are – Royal Society of Arts Certificate, Pitman Certificate, Federal Technical College certificates, national Diploma certificate all in Secretarial field obtained in the Polytechnics, and Colleges of Technology. Bordus Diploma of Mc Cann Erickson Advertising once said, “professional training on a good secretarial course is the basic requirement for the would-be top secretary”. It will help her perform her duties efficiently and effectively.<br/>        A close look at some selected public corporations like the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Nigerian Telecommunications (NITEL) and National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) revealed a lot of problems and prospects of the secretarial profession. For instance, in Nigeria Telecommunications (NITEL), Enugu, the corporation stride towards meeting subscribers’ expectations has always bee made impossible by some of those problems inherent in the organization.<br/>        In an attempt to remedy the problems in the organization, the Federal Government as well as the management of the corporation has introduced a lot of innovations for the effective functioning of the corporation. The former Post and Telecommunication (P &amp; T) and the Nigerian External Telecommunication (NET) were incorporated into one department on January 1, 1985 and by June 1985, the department was split into NITEL and NIPOST  (Nigerian Postal Services).<br/>        The Nigerian Railway Corporation is one of the many corporations owned fully and controlled by the Government of Nigeria. Hence, it is a public corporation, which is meant to provide adequate transportation through the rail system for the growing population of the country, to assist the commercial growth by carrying goods from the interiors to the urban cities. The Nigerian Railway Corporation can be traced back to the early colonial masters who ruled the country. The corporation was set up for profit purposes or social benefits of the population. A study into the Nigerian Railway Corporation shows a lot of irregularities. The organization has put in more efforts to improve its services both to workers and customers.<br/>        The other training corporation stressed on the impact of modern technology on their secretaries. The services of the secretarial profession are utilized by various organizations. Those in the secretarial profession work directly with the management of these organizations as support staff and they help in realizing effectively the missions and objectives of the organizations. Most of these objectives are geared towards resource management, which shows in the production, distribution and utilization of goods and services.<br/>        Today therefore, technology has become the centre point of the secretary’s performance. The role of secretaries in the highly automated   industries tends to become that of monitoring, maintaining and adjusting the equipment involved in the production process. Generally, in this era, those in the secretarial profession do not actually work on the product directly, rather, they maintain and monitor the equipment and records of operations. Those in the secretarial profession have tender opportunities to interact socially since the number of people with whom interaction may occur has been reduced and replaced by machine. The availability and the use of those modern technologies have led to increase in the job interest of secretaries. There is efficiency in production also; there is maximization of profits in organizations.<br/>        This immediate point is the prospect of the secretarial profession. In view of all these facts, the problems and prospects of the secretarial profession in these selected establishments are critically investigated in this study.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>        The invention of computers (word processors) into the business and academic sectors which secretarial profession is not an exception, has exposed the secretary to acquisition of modern skills necessary to improve on the secretarial challenges.<br/>        Storage facilities have been reduced to a small compact called disk. How reliable this medium of storage is, is still a mirage to the secretary. A file can remain as long as a secretary or an organization wants it to last.<br/>        The use of intercommunications, audio-recording equipment and the likes has alienated the secretary from her boss that the interpersonal relationship which she used to enjoyed, is virtually not there. In this isolated situation, how can the secretary morally cope with the present day challenges?<br/>Many other professions where major improvements were made in their scheme affects their “nomenclature” or the nature of their professions but that of the secretary, till date, has not experienced any change to reflect her present status with that of the computer. Old “nomenclature” and the nature of their profession still remain and in use.<br/>It is the purpose of this work, by the time it is completed, to make absolute recommendations and bring to light the challenges and prospects of the secretary in the present day dispensation.<br/> <br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The purpose of this study is to find out the problems facing the secretarial profession and their prospects in relation to their job on selected establishments in Enugu State and make recommendations.<br/>The study specifically, aimed at:<br/>1.     Identifying the problems and prospects of the secretarial profession in the following establishments;<br/>a.     Nigerian Telecommunications (NITEL)<br/>b.     Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC)<br/>c.      Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN)<br/>2.     Determining the cause of those problems, which affect the secretarial profession in these establishments?<br/>3.     Highlight the prospects of secretarial profession in a growing economy.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        It is hoped that this study will reveal the problems that the secretarial profession battles with and it will go a way in finding ways of improving the performance of the profession which will lead to increased productivity and enhanced prospects. The study will give more light on the major causes of these problems and then highlight what the employer should do to eliminate most of them in order to motivate the secretary towards achieving the corporation’s goals. <br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.     How could inadequate training and under utilization of secretarial staff pose problems to any establishment?<br/>2.     How could lack of modern equipment and unfriendly attitude of the boss cause problems to a secretary?<br/>3.     Do you think that the use of modern equipment and proper motivation can improve the productivity and prospects of the secretary?<br/>4.     Do you think that inability of the government and private employer’s of labour to reviewed the secretarial status affects the secretarial output?<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nTHE CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN THIS MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL ERA\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED ESTABLISHMENTS IN ENUGU STATE)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN THIS MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL ERA\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED ESTABLISHMENTS IN ENUGU STATE)\r\n", "id": 116}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A SURVEY OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES IN <br/>PRIVATE ORGANIZATION IN NSUKKA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF ENUGU STATE.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The aim of this study was to determined the factors that influencing the performance of a secretaries in private organization in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu state.<br/>            This study looked into the course of low performance of secretaries in the above mentioned local government and sought for possible means of redressing them in order to promote the efficiency of the secretaries.<br/>            Data was collected through questionnaires, findings that facilitated the study were as follows that absence of office equipment result to inefficiency of secretarial work.<br/>            There is lack of cordial relationship between the secretary and the executive which contributes to job inefficiency.<br/>            That low pay level and absence of promotion and recognition brings about poor performance of secretaries.<br/>            The study also discovered that the following measures will help in improving secretaries in service training promotion opportunities good working environment and incentives etc.<br/>            The researcher used simple percentage to analyze the data.

ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The name NTA means Nigeria Television Authority.  The station has brought forth over thirty other television stations in different parts of Nigeria.  It is headed by a general manager and six other managers who help in day to day running of business.  Nigeria Television Authority being a very big family has some roles they play as a communication Industry and these include:<br/>1.                  To inform, entertain and enlighten their audience, maintaining its leadership position in Television broadcasting<br/>2.                  Enrich the life of Nigerians by influencing positively his social, cultural, economic, political and technological thinking through a wide choice of programmes; to mention but a few.<br/>    Nevertheless, the roles they play in communication Industry seem <br/>to be carrying them away from giving their secretaries chana to contribute  our play their roles effectively in the communication industry.  They indulge in using their journalists and reporters for any information they need.  Managers and staff in the communication industries have equally acquired the knowledge of the use of modern office equipments like computers, tapes, and disc for information recording and report writing thereby neglecting the roles of efficient and effective secretaries especially when it comes to profession and effective secretaries especially when it comes to profession.<br/>            Most of the employees in communication industries are mainly journalists, reporters/correspondent. And news casters with just a few copy typists.  The few secretaries there are not always recognized let alone givng them ample opportunity to exhibit their initiatives.  An investigation into Nigeria Television Authority proves that the secretaries there are not receiving adequate attention needed to motivate them and that when it comes to promotion, they are not promoted as and at when due; compared with their counterparts in other professions.  The bitter part of it all is that they see people whom they academically occupying higher positions and secretaries find themselves subordinate to incompleted ones as their boss.<br/>            All these norm and  problems faced by secretaries pushed the researcher into carrying out a survey of the roles and performance efficiency and effectively of secretaries in modern communication industries in Enugu Urban.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>In most offices today, objectives are difficult to realize.  These in <br/>most cases have been blamed on the secretaries who are the mirror of the executives.<br/>            To  a large extent of their responsibility and thus limits the scope of their job to only typing documents which is always full of errors and taking dictations which they cannot even transcribe accurately.<br/>            In some communication industries, there exist communication break-down which results from poor relationship of the so-called secretaries some secretaries do not know how to answer, call, some do not know how to deliver messages and this hinders effective communication.  The importance of adequate information management flow to employees in organization cannot be over emphasized.<br/>            The success of an industry to a large extent is determined by how objective are effectively realized.  This in actual sense has to be done with the co-operation and efficiency of secretary.<br/>            In addition, some executive, also contribute to a number of pitfalls in communication industry.  For instance, some of them do not allow their secretaries and employees to share in the organizational policies nor express their opinion on what they feel would help to achieve the industrial goals.  In this case, the boss or executive may not see it as the right of secretary to play such roles.<br/>            The problem of this research project therefore is aimed at finding about the roles and performance efficiency and effectively of secretaries in communication industries since there has not been adequate literature written towards identifying these problems and how to curb them.  The researcher views it pertinent to sought  and investigate these problems and make proper recommendations and suggestions towards solving  them.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE PF THE STUDY<br/>1.                  The main purpose of the study is to determine the roles and performance efficiency and effectively of secretaries in modern communication industries in Enugu Urban.  Specifically the study is aimed at:<br/>2.                  Finding out if secretaries are efficient and effective in performing the roles.<br/>3.                   Finding out the problems they encounter performing those functions.<br/>4.                  Determining if such roles enhances the operational success of the communication industries.<br/>5.                  Recommending other ways improving operational efficiency and effectively of secretaries in those communication industries.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANE OF THE STUDY<br/>It is a fact that in some organizational setup, secretaries are <br/>confused as to what exactly constitute their roles.  This made the researcher to undertake the survey into the roles of secretaries in communication industries.<br/>      By identifying these problems, the study would help in creating <br/>and motivating, co-operation and encouraging work environment for the secretary and other employees.<br/>            On the part of executive, it will enable them understand that there are benefits accruing to allowing their secretaries prform their duties and implement certain principles which will help in achieving organizational goa.<br/>            It will also portray to secretaries that they are the mirror image of the organization which calls for all round diligency and efficiency i.e approach, modesty in dressing and occupational excellence.<br/>            It will enable the organization appreciate a mutual understanding between the secretaries and the boss as this will enhance collective pursue of organizational goal.<br/>1.5              ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY<br/>If this research is successfully carried out it will relieve the <br/>executives of certain administrative responsibilities as they will delegate duties to their secretaries appropriately. Educational background of qualified secretaries which calls for their special need and importance in communication industries and offices at large.<br/>            It will also reveal to an extent the educational background of qualified secretaries which calls for their special need and importance in communication industrious and exercise caution in executing their duties as any deviation will mar the image of the organization in the business word.<br/>            This research will also show the communication industries that secretaries are indispensable and irreplaceable tool in the industry no matte the extent of technology evolution.<br/>            The research will also show the communication industries that secretaries are indispensable and irreplaceable tool in the industry no matter the extent of technology evolution.<br/>            The research will also boost the ego of secretaries among their professional counterparts instead of limiting them to only typing documents.<br/>            It will also explore the task ahead to the student secretaries, which make them serious in their training.<br/>1.6              RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study:<br/>1.                  What roles do secretaries perform in modern communication industries in Enugu Urban?<br/>2.                  How far are the secretaries efficient and effective in performing those function? <br/>3.                  What problems do they encounter in performing those role?<br/>4.                  How far do the roles increase productivity in those communication industries?<br/>5.                  What recommendations are necessary for improved performance of secretaries in modern communication industries in Enugu Urban?<br/>1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>ROLES<br/>            Duties for which persons are accountable for.  The term can be equated with duty, activities or authorities.  Roles refer to the mental and physical activities which must be performed to carry out a task or duty.<br/>EFFICIENCY:  This  is the ability to produce the desired result.<br/>SECRETARY<br/>An employee who posses a mastery of office skills, who demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who exercises initiative and judgment and who make decision within the scope of assigned authority.<br/><br/>\n\nA SURVEY OF ROLES AND PERFORMANCE EFFECTIVITY OF SECRETARIES IN MODERN COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES IN ENUGU URBAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SURVEY OF ROLES AND PERFORMANCE EFFECTIVITY OF SECRETARIES IN MODERN COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES IN ENUGU URBAN", "id": 118}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING BUSINESS STUDIES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN NUSKKA ZONE<br/>ABSTRCAT</b><br/>This study is an investigation into the TEACHING AND LEARNING OF BUSINESS STUDIES IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENUGU URBAN .<br/>            Data collected was analyzed and discussed in different chapters that make up this research work.

The dictionary sees the commercial studies of education as the area that comprises such school subjects as typewriting, shorthand, book keeping and elementary accounting at defines business studies a studies of commerce and management subjects.<br/>            This definition however does not indicate the level of education at which the title should be used.<br/>            The difference in title is a matter of sentiment which does not in any way determine the content of the courses at the various levels of education.<br/>            In the secretary school in Nigeria the course is regarded as business studies but in the higher levels, in colleges and universities it is known as Business education or management science which covers subjects as well as related courses like business law, business management, accountancy, marketing data processing and computer.<br/>            Under the new system in education, these subjects are not studies in isolation in the junior secondary school. As a result of this problem, there has been less interest and motivation on the part of the students who offer business subjects in schools.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>            Business education in Nigeria is at its developmental stage at the initial introduction of this course into our education system there was no interest nor motivation from the government. According to Nsofor (1979) “The government was not only uninterested in including commercial subjects in the educational curriculum it made a deliberate and calculated attempt to frustrate the efforts of come of the philantiopicts”. Due to lack of attention which business education received at the introduction stage, efforts by the private proprietors no attention to crumple down. The proprietors gave no attention to the training of business teachers. This may be due to professional complications and financial burden which were not within their reach.<br/>            It is discouraging to note that despite all the problem business education faces at the earlier stage and the opportunities at had offended to the country, much has not been done to improve the situation. Schools, students still today lack qualified business teachers  which may be as a result of the period of former inadequate when compared with the complexities and dynamic nature of knowledge required. A major problems that face business education today is lack of equipment which are very necessary for proper mastery of the subject. As a result of these problems, there has been less interest and motivation on the part of the students who offer business subjects in school.<br/>            Another problems which will inhibit a smooth teaching of business studies in secondary school is lack of libraries. The important of which cannot be over emphasized nor will not occupy lengthy discussion in this work..<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of this study is to find out the problems and prospects of teaching and learning business studies in secondary schools in Nuskka educational zone of Enugu state.<br/>            These include the following.<br/>To identify the problems of teaching and learning business studies in secondary school in Nsukka Educational Zone of Enugu state.<br/>To find out if such problems test in Nsukka Educational Zone of Enugu state<br/>To know the extent of these problems if they exist<br/>To recommend actions to be taken to prevent or avoid/reduce future problems of teaching and learning business studies in Nsukka Educational zone of Enugu State.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>a.       Does lack of business studies teachers affect the teaching and learning of business studies subject<br/>To what extent are materials and equipment available for the teaching and learning of business studies in the secondary schools.<br/>Does lack of fund contribute to ineffective teaching and learning of business studies in the secondary schools.<br/>1.5       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of the study is to research, look deeply and to find out the teaching and learning of business studies in secondary schools. It also attempt to blend the differing view points in such a ways as to stimulate interests not only in the casual readers. <br/>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The significance of this study definitely lies on the hope that an early identification of the existing problem in the teaching of business studies in secondary school call per measures to be adopted to eradicate them from the grass root. This will not doubt place the students on the right state with other areas to studies,<br/>            It would serve as a reference point for further research not will also assist the government and the people in designing future educational policies to meet the need of the people.<br/>1.8       PROBLEMS OF BUSINESS EDUCATION<br/>            Business education in Nigeria is at it development stages.<br/>            At the limited introduction of this course into our educational system. There was no interest nor motivation from the government.<br/>            According to Nsofor (1979) “The government was not only uninterested in including commercial subjects in the educational curriculum. It made a deliberate and calculated attempts fir frustrate the effort of some of the philanthropists.<br/>            Due to lack of attention which business education received at the introduction stage, the efforts by the private proprietors stated to crumple down. The proprietors gave no attention to the training of business teachers. This may be due to professional complications and financial burden which were not within their reach. <br/>            Another problem that face business education today is lack of equipment which are very necessary for proper mastery of the subjects.<br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING BUSINESS STUDIES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN NUSKKA ZONE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING BUSINESS STUDIES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN NUSKKA ZONE", "id": 119}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE SURVEY OF THE EFFECT OF MOTIVATION ON JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE LTD, ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The field of motivation is a very wide one.  However, the researchers set out to see how motivation works in a management set using EMENITE LTD as a case study.  The concentration is also on the secretary in order to reduce generalization and focus on a specific management personnel.  A general introduction of chapter is presented to relate management to motivation as well as the secretary to management.<br/>A literature review is also given to see the direction others related literatures similar to the researchers’ title have followed.  In doing so, attempts have been made to improve on notice lapses.  This is joined in a chapter with theoretical framework of motivation.  Therein the researchers dealt extensively into renowned theories including Abraham Maslow’s Hygiene Factors, McGregor’s theories X and Y, Frederick Herzberg’s theory, Victor Vroom’s expectancy theory.<br/>The researchers equally defines the objectives of the study which include identifying motivation factors that affects secretary on job performance and identifying environments which make the secretary either efficient or inefficient.  As a prelude to the case study data analysis, a number of questions were asked each revolving round the stated objective.<br/>The researchers devotes a lengthy space to data analysis presented tabularly in chapter four after which recommendations are put forward in chapter five.  The objectives as the introduction says is to identify motivational factors which enhances the secretary’s performance.  No doubt the objective is achieved to a large extent going by the researchers’ recommendations and conclusions.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE:<br/>1.1              Introduction<br/>1.2              Background of the study<br/>1.3              Statement of the problem<br/>1.4              Purpose of the study<br/>1.5              Significance of the study<br/>1.6              Scope and limitation of the study<br/>1.7              Research questions<br/>CHAPTER TWO: Literature Review<br/>2.1              Introduction<br/>2.2              Definition of motivation and secretary<br/>2.3              Duties of the secretary<br/>2.4              How motivational factors boost the morale of the secretary<br/>2.5              Benefits of motivation to the entire work force<br/>2.6              Problems of lack of motivation to the Nigerian workers<br/>2.7              Recommendation on the best three motivation techniques that enhances the performance of the secretary<br/>2.8              Summary of the related literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE:  Research Methodology<br/>3.1              Research Design<br/>3.2              Sources of data collection<br/>3.3              Description of the population of the study<br/>3.4              Instrumentation<br/>3.5              Method of analysis<br/>3.6              Population of study<br/>3.7              Area of study<br/>3.8              Sample Size<br/>3.9              Establishment of Validity of the instrument<br/>CHAPTER FOUR:  Presentation and Analysis of data<br/>4.1              Research Question<br/>4.2              Characteristics of Respondent<br/>4.3              Summary of the findings<br/>CHAPTER FIVE:  Summary of findings<br/>5.1              Summary of findings<br/>5.2              Conclusion<br/>5.3              Recommendation<br/>5.4              Questionnaire<br/>Reference<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1       “Management” has been defined by various scholars in different ways. Some say it is made up of “the owners or Directors of an organization” or a system by which diverse resources are utilized in such a way that pre planned economic performances are achieved”. The Gloss any of Marketing Terms” , gives additional meaning to this definition as “comprising the interlocking activities of planning, organising, staffing, directing, controlling and co-ordinating using all liaison and communication resources available to the end”.<br/>            These definitions by different scholars are very important to this study as we can easily see the position and importance of the secretary as well as the need for her efficiency and how she can be motivated towards contributing to profits of the organization.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:<br/>            Emenite Limited, a member of the Belgian Etex Group started operation in 1963 under the name ‘Turners Asbertos Cement Company Nigeria Limited’. The company was incorporated in 1961 with registration number Rc 2712 and the shareholding were as follows:<br/>            Turners and Newall Limited               - 80%<br/>            Government of Eastern Nigeria          - 20%<br/>Due to indigenization decree of 1973, the shareholding of the company changed as follows:<br/>            Turners and Newall Limited               - 60%<br/>            Government of Eastern Nigeria          - 40%<br/>With the name of the company changing to Turners Building Products (Emene)<br/>            Owing to dwindling fortunes of the company, in March 24, 1988, Turners and New all Limited divested its interest in the company and transferred 51% of its Shareholding to Entrepreneur Societe Anonyme of Belgium (Now Etex Group S.A) and the balance of 49% went to the then Anambra and Imo States, now Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia and Eboyi State. As a result of the new shareholding arrangement, the company changed its name to Emenite Limited as is presently known.<br/>            Emenite Limited Specializes in the production of Roofing Products an leiting products. Under the Roofing Products, they have: Bigsix corrugated Sheets (Grey, Red, and Gren colour) 1086mm x 2400mm, Prestige Concrete tile, ultimate corrugated sheets to mention but a few.<br/>            Also under the leiting products, they have Emenite flat sheet, Duraceit decorative Ceiling, Emlux decorative Ceiling and so on. The above products of Emenite are made from fibre and cement and very qualitative in building. No wounder Emenite has a slogun which says “Wherever people builds, there comes Emenite”.<br/>            Emenite Limited, just like every organization has a very grod aim. Hence their aim is to be the leader in the manufacture and sale of high quality building products with zero waste management, culture and to sustain the business in a profitable manner with the knowledge that Emenite will stand by its customers while continually improving the creativity, motivation and safety of all their employees.<br/>            Judging from their aims one will see that they are not far from it since it has achieved almost all as this is made manifest in the benefits its customers derives which includes:<br/>            Universal application<br/>            Non combustible<br/>            Strong and hang lasting<br/>            Rof and Rust free.<br/>            Unique.<br/>Wide range of accessories<br/>            Cost effectiveness<br/>            Completely weather proof and<br/>            Available in different Colours.<br/>            It is interesting and worth mentioning that Emenite has in addition to their numerous products launched (Duratile) into the market on 25th day of November 2001 in Enugu State in the first instance, and other areas later.<br/>            Before now, Emenite produces flower pot, pipes used for water and other things. But thanks to Emenite for improving on their products. Their products range are sold through  a wide range of distributor network located in such a place that will be close to project sites. They also offer free pre and after sales technical advice to ensure, that their customers enjoy problem free roof.<br/>            Consequently, Emenite Limited was Certified to 150 9001-2000 in 1998, 2002, and are the first to obtain such international Standard East of the Niger. This entaits that their products could be sold in any market both locally and internationally.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            As the title suggests, the main problem of this project is to study the Effect of Motivation on job performance of a secretary. In other words, the research is aimed at knowing those factors that will normally increase the job performance and efficiently in an organization. For instance, the study/research wants to know if “Motivation” ends only when a secretary’s salary is increased regularly or when she is promoted or given commendations by her supervisors. On the other hand, would she be inefficient if she is not given medical facilities or if she is not aware of the company’s corporate goals. The research intends to unravel these and many other questions through the case study. This therefore obvious that lack of motivation affects the morale and spirit to;’ work. Inadequate motivation produce, anegaline work attitude.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The performance of secretaries in Emenite Limited has been regarded as both inefficient and ineffective. As already stated, the secretary occupies an important position in the organization. Hence it will not be surprising to say that behind every successful boss, there is an efficient secretary. Such importance requires that she must put in her best, display her talent and integrity and demonstrate a high level of proffesionalism. What factors make her to achieve her best, how can she achieve high efficiency? Hence it is the aim of this study to find answer to these questions with the following objectives<br/>i.                    To identify the factors which the secretary will regard as motivational.<br/>ii.                  To examine the relationship between motivation and secretary’s performance in an organization.<br/>iii.                To identify an environment which will make the secretary either efficient or inefficient.<br/>iv.                To have an indepth knowledge on the effects the motivation of secretaries has on their job performance.<br/>v.                  To meet practicing secretaries to get on the spot assessment of how best secretaries can attain the pinnucle of their profession.<br/>vi.                To drive at reasonable conclusion and make recommendations that will enable the secretary to achieve high efficiency as a professional.<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>On completion of this work, administrators will be supplied with important information relating to motivation and its effects on secretary’s performance.<br/>Also, it will reveal how adequately secretaries are motivated in Emenite Limited Enugu.<br/>Again in the field of academics, it will constitute an enormous contribution in the field of business Administration.<br/>This petce of work will in addition be an invaluable material for future researchers who would like to do more research work on motivation as a tool for improving secretaries performance.<br/>It is just the above mentioned, it will enhance general understanding about organisational efficiency and will be our humble wish to contribute to the national strive towards finding a feasible and lasting solutions to the problem of inefficiency in our organization.<br/>Lastly, it is our firm belief that this study will be of immense benefit and of great use of the generality of the public.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE SURVEY OF THE EFFECT OF MOTIVATION ON JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE LTD, ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE SURVEY OF THE EFFECT OF MOTIVATION ON JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF EMENITE LTD, ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 120}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPUTER ON THE SECRETARIAL PROFESSION<br/> (A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED BANKS IN ENUGU METROPOLIS)<br/>            ABSTRACT</b><br/>The degree to which computer is used in offices has been of serious concern to secretarial profession.

Questionnaire and Oral interview were used to collect data.<br/>The statistical tools used are average and percentage. When the data was analyzed, it was found that secretaries do not react adversely to the introduction of computer in their offices, computer have created new skills for the secretary and have added some spices to their work. With the acquisition of such skills, secretaries are now seen as indispensable tool in the office, thus giving them good professional status. And it was recommended that secretaries should develop attitudes and learning skills that would enable them to take advantage of new opportunity.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction                                                               <br/>            Background of the study                   <br/>1.1              Statement of problem                        <br/>1.2              Purpose of the Study                         <br/>1.3              Research Questions                                        <br/>1.4              Significance of the study                               <br/>1.5              Delimitation of the study                               <br/>1.6              Definition of terms                                                    <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature review                                                                    <br/>2.1              Perspective on Computer                   <br/>2.2              Computer and organizational output/productivity    <br/>2.3              Computer and workload                    <br/>2.4              Computer and workers health<br/>2.5              Computer and redundancy    <br/>2.6              Synthesis of literature            <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Research methodology                                              <br/>3.1              Area of Study                        <br/>3.2              Research design                                 <br/>3.3              Population                                          <br/>3.4              Sample and sampling technique                     <br/>3.5              Instrument for data collection           <br/>3.6              Method of gathering and Administering of data      <br/>3.7              Validation of research            <br/>3.8              Method of data analysis                                <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Data presentation                                                       <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Summary of findings, conclusion,                                                     <br/>And recommendation                                    <br/>5.1              Summary of findings <br/>5.2              Conclusion                                                                 <br/>5.3              Recommendations                                                     <br/>5.4              Suggestion topics for further research                       <br/>5.5              Limitation                                                                  <br/>Bibliography                                      <br/>Questionnaire                                                                                     <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            Today, the business world  is  undergoing  far-reaching<br/>Technological revolution due to  the  advancement  in  science. For all types of organizations to  succeed  in  today’s  rapidly  changing environment, they  need  to  be  able  to  be  process  data   and information  effectively.<br/>             In conducting them  day  to day  operations  organization  use  information  for  functions  such  as  planning, controlling, directing,  organizing  and  diction  making.   Information therefore  is  unique actionably  a critical  resources  in  the  operations  of  all  organization  the  business men,  secretaries, students and  in  fact  everybody, would now readily see the indelible impact of modern technology on people lives.<br/>             In an organization, information moves from person, forms are completed, filed and received and individuals communicate variety of both simple and complex concepts. At the turn of the century most written information were complied by hand in pen and ink copies were made by hand and communicated was by letter, telegraph or in person.  Today most of the tedious functions related to information handling and processing are done through the computer. <br/>            For the secretaries, not only have their equipment changed, but also their administrative processes office routine management systems are similarly evolving into new forms.  Computers have replaced manual typewriters and electric typewriter while for machines replaced telex machines.  There are also different type of advanced communication gadget such as cellular phones, pager etc.  With this radical change, the secretaries are expected to change and be able to keep up with all these professional changes around them.  In accordance with the law of motion CHANGE is a constant phenomena.  If we look at the beginning of man to the present day, we would see that there had been tremendous change. If there had not occurred, man would have remained primitive hill today.  Change is a challenge and if we abide by change, it brings out the best in us thereby leading to erroneous progress.<br/>            The first office automatic machine were introduced 1930 and used paper rolls later paper tape as a form of memory.  BY the 1960s the international business machine (IBM) had introduced the selective go If ball typewriter which allows the typist to change the print element, the go If – ball to provide a different type font (character design and sign) another break through was the introduction of IBM’s magnetic tape selective typewriter.  This was followed by the introduction of a visual display unit (VDU) this allows the typist to see what I happening to the text as if being tyed amended and stored, but before it I being committed to paper or printed out.  In fact, electronic systems are now possible that they can sense absorbs store, categorize ponder, very high quantity.  Yet with greater accuracy, speed and reliability.  Coventry, (1981) indicated that Recent development of the micro processor, founded on the silicon chips has potentials likely to have a vast social repercussion through out financial industry, for a simple chip take over a high proportion of today’s office job P.21.  When we refer to computer system, we refer to information and communication system which are necessary for the functioning of the office.  We assume that data processing and word-processing play a large role and also that human system under lie these technical systems.  In an ideal situation therefore, the technology and the people function together harmoniously.<br/>It is important to recognize that development and implementation of the computer is moving through several overlapping phases, each affecting differently.<br/>In general, a distinction can be made between two classes of office workers.  The first are the information worker they are those who are involved in the routine entry, recording, storage and transmission of information, those who fall under this group of worker include – Typist, secretaries, clerks and data entry personal.<br/> <br/>The second group are the knowledge works-this group aconite of those worker who create, interpret, analyze and utilize this information these knowledge worker can be divided into two (2) groups professional/technical employees and managers.<br/>The main impact of the computer is simply to facilitate office operation as they are now being carried out.  For example the word professor replace the secretary’s type writers, the mini-computer replaces the clerk’s filing cabinets etc.  More recently professionals and secretaries have begun using personal computers and sophisticated calculators to speed up their work.  The timing of there development has largely been dictated by the emergence of the technology starting with the widespread introduction of word processor’s in the 1970’s, and it in the late 1970s and its legitimating as a business tool in 1981, with the introduction of the IBM P.C.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Up to the 190’s the use of the computer in this country was limited to very few multinational companies.  The secretary then had to contend with using manual and electric typewriters in performing her word processing function.<br/>            Furthermore storage and retrieval of information was by use of files, filing cabinets, index cards etc.  Accessing of other information had to be through telephone directories and other relevant specialized text meant for such purpose.<br/>            Many of the secretaries of the 80’s are still in employment. With the advent and widespread use of the computer are then wonders how these secretaries are adjusting to be new devices now prevalent in modern offices are they finding it easy or difficult?  Is the profession generally under threat by the introduction of the computer and the Internet?  What can be done to keep the secretary still relevant in to day’s modern business setting?  These and many more are what this research aims to find solutions for.<br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study is to thoroughly investigate on the impact of the introduction of the computer on the secretaries.<br/>1.                  How secretaries react or the attitude of secretaries towards the introduction of computers.<br/>2.                  To ascertain whether the introduction of computer has in any way improve the secretary’s work.<br/>3.                  To ascertain whether the introduction of computer has made it easy or difficult to adjust (especially the secretaries of the bank under investigation).<br/>4.                  To determine the problems encountered by secretaries in trying to adapt to changes in the nature of their work.<br/>5.                  To find out whether or not secretaries are involved in the planning and introduction of computers.<br/>1.4              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The research provided answers to the following research questions;<br/>1.                  How do secretaries react to the introduction of computer<br/>2.                  What problems are encountered by secretaries in trying to adapt to changes in the nature of their work.<br/>3.                  Are there orientation programmes in facilitating the adaptation to new changes of work<br/>4.                  Are secretaries involved in the planning and introduction of computers.<br/>1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The investigation of the impact of the introduction of the computer on secretaries in some selected banks in Enugu Metropolis.  Would give some insight in the performance of secretaries on the advert of computers.<br/>            Many of the major problems that organizations have faced in the past have been that they are in awe of technology, they failed to recognize the need to use technology as a competitive weapon against their rivals, they expected technology to be difficult to use and also the unwillingness to address the compelling human issues which has been the major cause of low productivity.  This study will help secretaries to full understand how their career will change as a result of the introduction of computers in their offices.<br/>            From this study, banks will now recognize the need to use technology as a competitive weapon.  Winning a competitive edge has become of fundamental importance within national and international Banking, institutions.  The prime emphasis of activity now rests on providing an ever improving levels of services to existing clients and customers and winning new business through the sheer quality of service provided and the ingenuity of marketing activity.  Ultimately, it is only through establishing a competitive advantage over rival institutions that an institution can hope to maximize profitability.<br/>            In Banking sector where establishing a competitive advantage has become so important, it is necessary for them to pay particular attention to the role which technology plays in offering them an opportunity to gain this advantage.  The main function of technological deployment is to assist an institution to gain a competitive advantage.<br/>            Finally, this research work will be of significance to the society at large because if the computer is well utilized, productivity (efficiency and effectiveness) would be enhanced, there by leading to a higher standard of ling for the society.<br/>1.6              DEFINITION OF

responsibilities of a business and their organization has been extremely important to every society and Nigeria at large. Every society makes sure that those who engage in any form of business should engage in good morals in their daily activities. Ethics and social responsibilities are related concepts that pay special attention on moral conscience of business. The idea of ethical responsibilities has to do with those issues and problems that concerns people in business, and their faithfulness to their organization and to their customers also. Social responsibilities and its problem is the interest and need of every society.<br/>There are laid down rules that govern every profession. In enabling us understand what “ethics” actually means, we shall quickly look at the following phenomena that could rapidly be misconceived as ethics. We are referring to such phenomena as law and morality: Laws are laid down rules made by administrations, communities, governments etc. And the motives of these laws are primarily to regulate or check discrepancies or misconduct as may be observed in human character or behavior. Summarily; laws improves human character, which when absent could bring about disorderliness and chaos.<br/>Morality on the other hand is related to the opinion principal of good and evil as it affect human conduct. It comes from the mind to differentiate good from evil. We can in other words refer to morals as love and ethical virtues. Finally morals involves individual character considered by the winning standard of moral honesty.<br/>Ethics has been defined as the principal of right and wrong conduct by the American heritage dictionary (second college edition). It is also the general study of the entire nature of morals and the specific moral choices made by a person as it affect his relationship with his fellow individuals.<br/>Those used in an organization in achieving it’s objectives, makes up the workforce of that organization and also of competence of any organizational objectives.<br/>A very high level of performance and efficiency has to be attained by the staff as a workforce: Efficiency is a function of so many different factors like, political, social, societal and economical, just to mention but a few. The staff is an essential factor of production in any given establishment since their proficiency and contributions can either promote or demote the efficiency of an establishment. In the eyes of an ordinary person, a staff could be considered as a group of individual or persons that operate in an establishment in order to achieve a common purpose. They also indulge in accounting, managerial and clerical functions.<br/>A good staff is one that uses his intellect and positive opinions to make suitable decision not beyond the scope of approved governance without having to be monitored and also with a reasonable degree of moral standards.<br/>Members of every professions are being guided by some codes of conducts; such professions include, Lawyers, Doctors, Customs, etc. There are some ethical conducts that are written down on paper, whereas others are verbal or unwritten. The said rules are made known to the members of a particular profession. To be ethical means, keeping these rules in your relationship with your fellow staff whereas, to be in ethical means not abiding by these rules.<br/>Social and ethical obligations are concepts that concentrate o the conscience of business managers as an image-maker of an establishment with the outside world. This is normally achieved by the reasonable use of telephones, faxes, letters, etc. To an extent, this encourages positive public reaction towards the organization depending on the moral character of the staff. It is therefore of interest that since the staff engage in various forms of business administration ranging from agriculture to production and manufacturing, they should be socially and morally obligated to the community where they operate so as to excel in their operations.<br/>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>An office personnel should be a mirror through which an organization restructures its duties and functions.

Highly skilled personnel is sought for in business organization nowadays and to this effect, Russo et al (1980) advocated that the more productive a secretary is, the more the organization can afford to pay with in reasonable limits and hence create employment opportunities for secretaries.<br/>            The invention of office equipment necessitated the growth in large enterprise and also a technological break –through. The office, therefore, receives much on sophisticated office equipment in order to cope with the ever- increasing roles in the organization.<br/>            It seems, however, that although the higher levels of management might not make much direct use of technology, the secretary.

The future for office automation for this job is in providing the secretary with system that meets the real need identified as being important, rather than the ones of typing and stenography that are thought to be important.<br/>As against the traditional office, the modern office has a lot of activities to perform with the aid of modern equipment. These day’s uncountable organizations have installed these equipment and the sectaries are present to manipulate some of them in discharging their duties officially. However, modern office equipments which act as improvement tools in the secretary’s job arose from the numerous mathematical calculations done in offices, and the use of the equipment by a secretary can result to a greater output than that of a secretary using manual equipment.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Automation in office emerged to replace work and enhance office efficiency and productivity<br/>Today, Secretaries profession has witnessed a marked change in terms of technological advancement.

It would also serve as a means to ease workload of secretaries in office and bring about job efficiency to secretaries.<br/>            Finally, business organization would appreciate the importance of these equipment and thus procure them.<br/>1.6       ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY<br/>            The researcher assumes that if modern office equipment were provided in various offices they would contribute to secretarial effectiveness and efficiency.<br/>            It is also assumed that the reverse may be the case where secretaries have the skill and there is lack of modern office equipment.<br/>The researcher also assumes that if these equipment are provided and the secretaries do not have the competence to manipulate them, their productivity would also be affected.<br/>1.7       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>i.          What type of office equipment does Emenite and Anammco      use in their offices?<br/>ii.         How many of these equipment are modern?<br/>Iii         To what extent has the use of these equipment helped        the secretaries in their jobs?<br/>iv.        What problems do the secretaries encounter in the use         of these office equipment?<br/>v.         What economic advantage does the Emenite and Anammco derive from using these office equipment.<br/>1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>EFFECTIVENESS: The oxford advanced learners dictionary defines effectiveness as having the desired effect, of producing the intended result.<br/>  EFFICIENCY: The oxford advanced learners dictionary also defines efficiency as the ability of the people to the work well and without waste of time or resources example, competent and efficient secretary.<br/>   EQUIPMENT: The some oxford advanced learners dictionary described equipment as those things needed for particular purpose, example, equipments, are needed in offices for work.<br/>ENHANCEMENT: Oxford advanced learners dictionary also explains enhancement as the way to increase or to improve further quality, value or status of something.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION (A CASE STUDY OF ANAMMCO &amp; EMENITE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION (A CASE STUDY OF ANAMMCO & EMENITE", "id": 124}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A SURVEY OF THE ROLES OF RETAIL BUSINESS HOUSES IN PROVIDING <br/>EMPLOYMENT FOR SECRETARIES IN SELECTED BUSINESS HOUSES IN ENUGU URBAN<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            Historically, people drifted into secretarial work after studying basic shorthand and typing, often beginning in the typing pool and processing from junior to senior secretary, then to personal assistant.

Secretaries are respected for their skills and their professionalism. It is no longer such a female-dominated environment, with a growing proportion of male secretaries being accepted in the business environment.<br/>            Historically, people drifted into secretarial work after studying basic tyoing and typing, often beginning in the typing pool and progressing from junior to senior secretaries. Then to personal assistant. The job is planned and designed that no matter a secretary’s level of degree – ND, HND or BSC he/she must be assigned to a boss before carrying out his or her duties. Despite the fact that a secretary holds a valuable position an essential piece of the corporate bigsaw, there is certainly no or little opportunity for advancement beyond the limited secretarial world compared to other profession such as Accountancy, Legal and medical etc.<br/>            They are more ambitions, looking for a career and not just a job. Those who join the secretarial ranks are frequently seeking a fulfilling and rewarding career in which establishing a retail business house.<br/>            A secretarial career as such to offer. It is a self-satisfying role or stepping-stone to gain extensive knowledge of an organization or firm before moving into a different area.

There is certainly no opportunity for advancement beyond the secretarial world compare to other professions. Thus there is inferiority complex among colleagues with the same level of degree and no plans or motivations for self-employment.<br/>            There researcher therefore attempted in this work to find out the roles of retail business house in providing employment for secretaries in Enugu urban.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The main purpose of the study is to find out the role of retail house in providing employment for secretaries in Enugu urban.<br/>            Specifically, the study is to determine the following<br/>1.      Determine the traditional role of retail business houses in Enugu urban<br/>2.      Find out if secretaries perform any of the roles<br/>3.      Find out if those retail business houses value the roles perform by secretaries <br/>4.      Find out how often this retail business houses employ secretaries to perform those roles<br/>5.      To find out if secretaries are interested in performing their roles.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            The following research questions were formulated to guide the study<br/>1.      What traditional roles do secretaries perform in Retail Business House in Enugu urban<br/>2.      What roes do secretaries perform in Retail business house in Enugu urban<br/>3.      To what extent do the retail business houses value the role perform by secretaries. <br/>4.      How often do retail business houses employ secretaries<br/>5.      How far are the secretaries interested in the role they play in retail business houses<br/>1.5       SIGNFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The significance of this study is to expose to the society that secretaries are in the best positions in handling retail business houses, thus it plays a vital role in providing employment for secretaries in Enugu urban. Since they are trained as professionals in secretarial field.<br/>            The study intends to educate the secretaries in the need to embark on employment provided by the retail business houses.<br/>            The reason for this study is to erase the erroneous public perception that secretarial personnel are subordinate and lazy workers and certainly have no opportunities for advancement beyond the limited secretarial world. Moreover, secretaries are to be respected for their skills and professionalism, seeking a fulfilling and rewarding career in administration, communication or public relation by seeking self-employment in retail business houses.<br/>            Also, the study will be useful for further research work by secretarial students.<br/>1.7       ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY<br/>            The following assumption were made in the study<br/>1.      If Retail business houses are many in Enugu urban they will need the services of secretaries.<br/>2.      If services of secretaries are valuable to retail business houses in Enugu urban, they would need secretaries to perform their functions<br/>3.      If the retail business houses are successful in their business, they will be need for their expansions, thereby requiring the services of secretaries.<br/>1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>ROLE: The function or position that somebody has or is expected to have in an organization in the society or relationship <br/>BIMBO: A young person, usually a woman who is sexually attractive, but not intelligent <br/>ORGANIZATION: This is a corporate business setting with a collection of workers that are arranged in bureau tic manner with every employee given an assigned role to play in their area of specialization <br/>CAREER:       Is the period of time that one spend in one’s life working or doing a particular thing.<br/>SELF-EMPLOYMENT: Is the act of working for yourself and not employed by a company.<br/>ENTERPRENEURSHIP: Is a person who makes money by starting or running business, especially when this involves taking financial risks.<br/>RETAIL BUSINESS HOUSE: Is where goods produced by manufacturers are being sold or handle to people in a small quantity instead of bulk.<br/><br/>\n\nA SURVEY OF THE ROLES OF RETAIL BUSINESS HOUSES IN PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT FOR SECRETARIES IN SELECTED BUSINESS HOUSES IN ENUGU URBAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SURVEY OF THE ROLES OF RETAIL BUSINESS HOUSES IN PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT FOR SECRETARIES IN SELECTED BUSINESS HOUSES IN ENUGU URBAN", "id": 125}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF COMMUNICATION BARRIERS IN ORGANIZATIONAL SUCCESS <br/>( ACASE STUDY OF ANMMCO)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The main purpose of this study is to find out the problems of communication on organizational success using the Anambra Motor manufacturing Company ANAMMCO as a study.<br/>            In line with this, three research questions were framed.

It informs all our actions and inaction in relations to others and it takes place all the time. It can manifest itself in symbolic, verbal and non-verbal forms we can communicate with all apart of our body, our posture, smile and even the dress we put on communicate one thing of the other.<br/>            Different scholars have defined the word communication variously. However, there is the central theme that runs through all these definitions. That is the giving of information, ideas, opinions attitudes etc. by one person or group of persons to another person or group of persons<br/>            Communication particularly in a business organization provides a means by which people in the organization interact, exchange information, ideas, plan proposal and execute them. It is a medium through which relationships are established and maintained. It is also a means by which commendation is given and condemnation is handed down.<br/>            Business and organizational communication helps to orientate workers to their jobs as well as helping the supervisors monitor activates of the workers. Communication is an extremely invaluable asset in human organization. His is because at all levels in the organization among and between executives, managers, staff, supervisors, foremen and employees, the communication process is always in action conveying information, ideas, attitude and feelings among individuals and groups<br/>            Communication affects all the management function since none of them can be effectively performed without it. Plans and innovation cannot be executed unless they are communicated to those who will carry them out. The organizational structure is designed to set up channels of communication through which information is passed downwards, upwards, horizontally or laterally.<br/>            Interference are barriers to effective communication because of changes in a desired direction.<br/>            The effectiveness of communication discourages better performance, high productivity and job satisfaction in an organization. This reduces the essentials for the internal functioning of an organization, which could integrate the managerial; functions.<br/>            The problems in an organization as a result of communication problems reduce and obstruct the chance of such an organization achieving their goals.<br/>            For the purpose of this study we shall focus all our attention on the major courses of communication problems with a particular emphasis on the Mercedes Benze Anambra Motor Manufacturing Company (MB-ANAMMCO)<br/>            MB – ANAMMCO limited was incorporated on January 17, 1977 and the plant was commissioned on July 8, 1980 by the firs executive president of Nigeria, Alhaji Shehu Shagari. It started official production in January 1981 and has to date made enable mark on the nation’s industrial growth, adding over 25,000 vehicles to the nation’s transportation sector, backed up effectively with a network of over 36 after-sales service pints and spare parts supply depots. The company’s central spare parts deport stocks over 35, 000 line items<br/>            Mercedes Benz ANAMMCO is a joint ventures between the federal Government of Nigeria and the Daimler Chryster AG. MB ANAMMCO manufacturers Commercial vehicles and leads in the commercial vehicles markets from five tine payload and above in Nigeria. The plant, which occupies a sprawling 300,000 square meter site in Emene, near Enugu, is a shine example of a profitable and viable economic and technological corporation between the government and people of Nigeria and Daimler Chrysler AG and so there exists a combination of white/black system of administration.<br/>            As a result of the white/black relationship there are time when one system administration disagree with other both in the formulation and implementation due to communication problems. <br/> 1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>            Communication is a very important instrument in every organization.<br/>            The problems of effective communication is pre-requisite for improper understanding and interaction of people in an organization. Poor communication system makes for ineffective and inefficient management and this affects the preset goals. Some of these problems include<br/>Lack of proper channel of communication in the organization. This can explain why there still exist, situation where minor problems which could be sorted out by discussion and understanding between the workers and the management escalate into major problems which causes some set back in the company.<br/>The management is not willing to share information with employees. As a result workers normally get information from the grapevine which usually lead to unfavorable actions in the company<br/>MB – ANAMMCO is a multi-national company that carries information from different parts of the federation and outside the country too. The information is so much that the channels cannot handle all the messages that are been sent. Sometimes the telephone lines cannot get through of all the lines are in use at the same time. This information overload occurs when ,ore message are transmitted than the human receiver can handle, this leads to reduced efficiency <br/>Since the company does not fully consider communication as a very important aspect of the organization and therefore allows communication gaps to exist between it and the workers the productivity level of the company will suffer.<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVES/PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The objective/purpose of the study is to survey the effect of communication barriers to organizational success. The smooth operation of any business undertaking lies largely on its efficiency in the circulation of information with and outside the organization and the presences of barriers in this circulation could be very disastrous therefore the researcher is going to <br/>i.                    To determine communication problems create improper coordination of the organizational functions<br/>ii.                  To  find out the communication channel that exist in MB-ANAMMCO<br/>iii.                To determine it the desired organizational goals achieved through this communication channels<br/>iv.                To find out if good business opportunities be lost by an organization through communication ineffectiveness.<br/>1.4       SIGNFICANE OF THE STUDY<br/>            It is through communication that understanding information, motivation cooperation and job satisfaction necessary for groups efforts is being provided. Better communication get better job performance and more work satisfaction. In MB-ANAMMCO the challenges posed ineffective communication in the part of the management and the staff nearly grounded the multi-national promising enterprise that has supplied succor to teeming population made up of Nigerian and expertise so it is believed that the analysis of data, findings and solutions proffered in this write-up will be beneficial to<br/>i.                    Mercedes Benz Anambra Motor Manufacturing company (MB – ANAMMCO) who will make use of the communication to solve any problem arising from ineffective communication.<br/>ii.                  Managers of other companies in the course of improving their knowledge will find this write-up useful in that they will not want to fall into the same unfortunate situation before implementing the solution proffered in this study.<br/>iii.                Although already dealt with by many authors, it is believed that this is yet another contribution to such existing materials. Also students and other researchers who may want to carry out a project of this nature will use this as a reference point <br/>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The object of this research work is to fine out the effect of communication barriers on organizational success. Its scope is limited to the Mercedes Benz Anambra Motor manufacturing company (MB-ANAMMCO) which is the organization under study. However, this study will go a little further to discuss communication in some details. <br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>i.                    Does communication problems create improper coordination of organizations<br/>ii.                  What is the communication channel that exist in MB – ANAMMCO<br/>iii.                Are desired organizational goals achieved through this communication channels<br/>iv.                Can good business opportunities be lost be an organization through communication ineffectiveness.<br/>1.8              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>ACHIVEMENT: The successful finishing or gaining of something especially through skill or hard work.<br/>BARRIERS: Objects consciously or unconsciously placed in the way that prevents other objects from going forward or backwards.<br/>BYPASSING: When the sender and the receiver of a message allubuted different meaning to the same words or use different word through intending the same meaning<br/>COMMUNICATION: The process of sending and receiving messages.

Seminars and workshop held in the past were of immense value as they gave the government the positive stand towards the encouragement of such ventures. The seminars which were very encompassing extended to both national and inter-state for better optimal result the private organizations thus play a very vital role especially in commercial schools of vital role especially in commercial schools of the academic development. the question to ask is, are over private business schools producing appropriate manpower, required for the present and  future development of the Nigerian economy?<br/>Where do private business schools fit in, this scheme? PRIVATE BUSINESS SCHOOLS can be side or defined as the personal or individuals / joint trade or commerce institution the up-bringing or education children in nursery, primary, secondary and commercial schools in the state organization.<br/>However, the desire for educational knowledge and the development of this venture was not left in hands of the government alone. It is a well-known individual and private organization have played an important role in the development of education in any country. This has gone a long way to encouraging the campaign against illiteracy in our society. His wise decision taken by individuals or organization to supplement government effort in the development of education is commendable and a proof to show that if education is left in the hands of government alone. The aims and objectives of academic knowledge may not be fully achieved. This is because, the government being faced with other projects and welfare services may not invest all she has for education alone hence the interventions of the individual hands and private organizations is important.<br/>The problems of these private hands in the establishment of private schools cannot be overemphasized. Both the government and the general public have availed themselves of the opportunity of schools in he private hands for the purpose of achieving the aims and objectives of education. The survey of the problems of private business schools in Enugu Urban in manpower development.<br/>A study of modern ideal college Abakpa Enugu and immaculate commercial school at Ochi Street Achara Layout, Enugu is an interesting one and this will give an overview of not only the situation report in the above mentioned schools alone but the state in general as it effects other schools in Enugu Urban.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>Private business schools in Enugu Urban have suffered a lot of criticism from several authors and writers.

Secretaries and their bosses were selected from different organizations as well as the student secretaries of the Rivers State University of Science and Technology and those of the college of education both in Port-Harcourt metropolis. The instruments used in this study were questionnaire and face to face oral interview. These were administered to the sample population. Questionnaires were administered to 150 student secretaries in which 130 responded. The result of the study observed that practicing secretaries dissatisfaction stems form the non recognition of their career as management team, no job prospects lack of rapid promotion. The career has being considered as inferior to other professions as well as being perceived as predominantly female profession. This is as a result of their non contributory attitude to decision making on the organization. This research work has five chapters. Chapter one contains a general discussion of the meaning of a secretary and the important role they play in an organization and what people feel we are in the society. Chapter two is discussing about the problems facing secretary in their offices. They are used as domestic skivvies and are regarded as shorthand typist. The main problems of the secretaries remains the perceived lack of status, we have always been perceived as just supported unequal treatment to secretaries compared to other professionals. Chapter three deals with the design of the study/research methodology, the methods used in collecting relevant date was administering questionnaires and conducting oral or face to face interviews on relevant persons, that is, secretaries and their senior manager as well as student secretaries.  It was conducted in two higher Institutions, rivers state university of science and technology and rivers state College of education both in Port-Harcourt and in various organization.

But with the advert of the new breed of secretaries who are given better education and the first exploration of the career by men, the  impression about the career will eventually die a natural death and will be left to history  <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1        BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>In this part of the world a careful observer would discover that what we refer to as sociological factors affecting professional secretarial career in Nigeria has always been mistaken. The management of some entrepreneur and  institution management has failed in their duties of providing these basic needs to their secretaries.<br/>The world “secretary” has been defined by A.S Hornby, in the Advanced Learners Dictionary, as an employee or an official who deals with correspondences, keeps records, makes arrangements, appointment and other business affairs of the firm, society or club.<br/>The Lexicon Webster dictionary, an encyclopedic  edition, defines secretary as one entrusted with secrets, one who caries on another’s correspondences and performs other routine task; an officer of an organization or business who keeps records and assists in major decisions, a government officer whose business is to superintendent and manage the affairs of a particular department.<br/>Office is of paramount importance to the organization since it is a decision making centre and it is through the office functions that the organization achieves its goals.<br/>The importance of a secretary in any organization is not to be over –emphasized but the profession has been misconstrued due to small ill informed masses. M. blight (1983) in duties of a professional secretary commented on this. He said that, this argument is, in part, attributed to the inability of employers to clearly specify job description for professional secretaries. Again, B.O.Ekong (1984) in his article titled problems in professional secretarial career’ hold that, ‘some employers believe that the secretarial school merely teachers shorthand and typewriting to its  graduates therefore, did not see the reason as to the substance of making them beneficiaries of some service conditions and promotional benefit, with their counterparts in other fields. This could be the reason why a secretary’s opinion is always neglected in decision making. Although he has been employed by the boss for his assistance, but his opinion is not always appreciated.<br/>        He attends meeting just as minutes jotter and reporter, his opinion is not being sought for in decision making. L.N.Mbaga (1984) in contemporary views, said that, “a professional secretaries are held as drop outs forced by self –induced disappointments and frustrations to specialize in typewriting and shorthand”.<br/>Due to this misconception of the profession, less importance is attached to the secretary position. The secretary in an organization, is seen by other members of the organization, as merely an appendage. In most cases, he is regarded as a shorthand/typist by a majority of people. People well informed who are supposed to acknowledge the importance of secretaries in the society and consequently he feels slighted.<br/>Some employers seen not to know the difference between the work of an office messenger and that of a secretary. Some secretaries are expected to do the boss’s wife or other co-workers and consequently this affects her psychologically. This was confirmed by an interview conducted by Nicola Tyre (1984), when a lady secretary said that at one time she had two houses to run as well as her normal job. She went on complaining that she was used as a domestic skinny, doing her boss’s personal errand running such as buying a present for the wife and her weekly shopping.<br/>These type of problems facing secretaries in the job tend to affect their productivity and stability, even those with genuine interest for the career one scared away and consequently secretaries change of occupation becomes more, than in other fields like engineering, business administration etc.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>It is an understatement to say that the professional secretarial career is unimportant. It is obvious that it is much important, it is also competitive and marketable and deserves nothing but recognition from every perceiving eye. A training secretary is capable and prominent office hand hence has presence is essential to the office. Infact, he is the boss as a nurse or a paramedical staff into the office. Surgeon and this contributes is no small way to the success of the boss and the entire organization.<br/>The secretary profession is indeed on career that attracts a discrimination image from society’s evaluating eyes. Most managers who require to assistance of the secretary in the office fail totally to accord him a befitting recognition, rather they show disregard and disrespect for the career.<br/>As a matter of fact, the word secretary is often misunderstood by many people. While some are of the opinion that anybody who can write short-hand and use typewriter as well as known as a secretary, others see it as merely a woman’s career and consequently, a non –prestigious one<br/> The trend of though is due to a misconception and the culminating results from this trend of events are for reaching and affects the secretarial career very adversely. The secretary feels slighted, he is demotivated both to join and stay in the profession, he suffers image and personality (ego) problems and these accounts for his detraction and adherence and thus mass exodus to other profession.<br/>Based on the foregoing, therefore the study was geared towards identifying the factors responsible for the dissatisfaction of professional secretaries on their job performance and solutions to salvage the profession.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study is to investigate the causes of non-recognition of secretaries and their profession or career along side similar professions in our society.

These are the sociological factors; non-recognition and low esteem rating of the career, which resulted to the poor treatment of secretaries and also the physical factors which is known as environment as well.<br/>Environment: In the management or organization contact, environment consist s of office building, the  furniture layout and the physical conditions  under which an office worker or secretaries operate such as lighting, ventilation, sound and safety measure etc.<br/>Lighting<br/>Bad lighting accentuates the possibility of low performance or output and inaccurate work result in secretarial job function. Enendu O. (1993) mentioned that bad lighting causes eye strain and fatigue to the secretaries causing low job output. Poor standards of lighting obviously affect the secretaries interest, attitude top work and makes them suffer from degree of eye strain, fatigue, irritability and other physical disorders. The effect of poor lighting should be understood as it adversely affects the productivity of the secretaries job function. <br/>Poor ventilation also affects secretaries health thereby causing poor performance on the job function.<br/>SOUND/NOISE CONTROL<br/>        Noise is known to have detrimental effects on the physical and mental mechanism of individuals. Secretarial work cannot be carried out efficiently if there is a constant interruption. Slamming of doors, sounds of footsteps on floor have remarkable influence on the moral and level of performance of secretarial careers. <br/>SAFETY MEASURE<br/>S.Mills and O. Standing ford has this to say; the health and safety at work act (19974) requires an employer to provide employee with a written statement of policy of the organization and arrangements pertaining to health and safety at work.<br/>        Every office should have a first aid kit the staff should be prepared in case of fire outbreak.<br/>OFFICE<br/>        In every well organized business there is the need for the record of its activities to be kept and protected. Office is where such activities are carried out and its record kept. The term office was first defined by Geoffery Whitehead, as a room or building where clerical processes are carried out to start, develop and control the many activities of business.<br/>        Ronald Warson et al, defined office as the place where information is received, sorted, acted upon, filed and passed on.<br/>        Many organization have been said and written about the best way to ensure secretaries high performance on the job function and many people have argued that those secretaries have to be adequately motivated, in order to ensure effective job performance on their part. They outlined such motivational incentives as increasing salaries and wages, provision of certain social amenities such as free medical facilities, ensuring adequate recognition on the secretarial parts. All these motivational incentives would not increase the productivity of the professional secretarial career in Nigeria.<br/>FUNCTION OF AN OFFICE<br/>        With the growth in information requirements and developments of processing techniques which gives the office an increasing important position in the enterprise, the functions of an office have drastically increased.<br/>Receiving information: One of the main function of an office is to receive information. These can be inform of orders, letters, fox, telephone calls, e-mails and reports from the various parts that the business covers etc.<br/>Recording information: Information’s are recorded in the office as they come in such information record are; faxed messages phone calls, memoranda as well as other messages contained in there are recorded by the office for current and future  use.<br/>Arranging information: information received and recorded are arranged in the office for management use. This brings the need for the information to be arranged to meet the requirement of the organization.<br/>Giving information: since the office accumulates information of various kinds and shapes and since it is in the office that information is arranged in the form that organization require to give out this information to people who need them eg the prizes and weights  of some goods, date, time and venue of examination such as WAEC, JCE etc.<br/>Safeguarding information and Assets: It is the duties of an office work specially, “secretaries” to ensure the safety of the information so that it can be given out when needed. These information safeguard are; computers, photocopying machines, fax machines etc. these assets must be safeguard against fire outbreaks, thelf and other hazards.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nA STUDY OF THE

THE\r\nSTUDY<span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\nHuman Relations refers to a management tool that is concerned with the\r\nintegration of people into a work face. It is the study and application of\r\nknowledge about human in an industry as it relates to other systems.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>Human\r\nrelations come about at the early stages of industrial Revolution on the 18<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury when land, labor, capital and entrepreneur were the focus of industries\r\nas a means of serving community interest. The objectives and goals of\r\nindustries/organizations later transformed to relationship and finally to human\r\nrelations concept.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\n A group of researches organized by Elthen Mayo (1927 – 1932), established\r\nhuman relations in industries to motivate workers, ensuring cooperation and\r\nmaximum production for their survival in a dynamic business world, thus\r\nescaping the dehydrated or depersonalized atmosphere of the work place or\r\nindustry. The neoclassic therefore, rate human relations as the fifth important\r\nfactors of production. The secretary helps in the achievement of the above goal\r\nas she is well equipped by her training to carryout functions that ensure harmony\r\namongst people and create good organizational image. Experience shows that some\r\nemployers who have acquired the necessary technical skills in respective\r\noccupational fields have failed in their job because of their poor attitudes\r\nand lack of their interpersonal/human relations skills.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\nSecretaries are therefore, someone who carryout official duties with a good\r\nsense of relatively and a realization that things, have order of importance and\r\nthe skills in discovering what this order is, by keeping abreast with\r\ncolleagues, the boss and the customers thereby maintaining a cordial\r\nrelationship amongst members of the organization, enhancing its efficiency and\r\nboosting the image of the organizations to the public.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\n A secretary and indeed every employee should develop human relations\r\nskills as it will make for human relations skills as it will make for\r\nharmonious existence among the workers of an industry, thereby increasing\r\nproductivity and makes the secretary to last and progress on the job.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\nSince the human specie inhabited the earth centuries ago, their behavior has\r\nbeen a subject of public discourse and compared to the applied science, the\r\nstudy of human behavior is relatively new</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\nIndustries exist to achieve a set objectives or goals. In accomplishing the\r\nbroad objectives of the industry, the individuals involved also attained\r\nobjectives that are of great importance to them. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\nIn order to understand people, we need to consider the whole person. The human\r\nbeing is total person influenced by input received from external factors. For\r\nexample, family, schools, trade associations, political associations etc, the\r\nsecretary in dealing with people must consider the impacts of these forces on\r\nthe workforce.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\nIt thus, becomes imperative to recognize that individuals are much more than a\r\nproductive factor, they are citizens members of a social system in any industry\r\nand they vitally influence demand and supply.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\nIn recognition of this, it is then believed that there is no average person\r\npeople are unique in their own ways, they play different roles, they have\r\ndifferent needs, different ambitions, attitude, different levels of knowledge\r\nand skills and different potentials, it then becomes imperative for the\r\nsecretary to recognize these unique differences in human behaviors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\nHence good human relations/interpersonal skills of secretaries ensure good\r\nquality in both human and material resources in industries. Interpersonal\r\nskills breed harmonious co-existence which ensures organizational and\r\nindustries efficiency that leads to organizational success. Society that lack\r\nhuman relations oriented secretaries would find it difficult to attain her\r\ndesired objectives hence this study.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">1.2       STATEMENT OF THE\r\nPROBLEMS<span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"'>           \r\nThe secretary can be looked upon as a vital link in an organization, an image\r\nmakers, more that than that, she is expected to carry out nearly a thousand\r\ndifferent activities in assisting the executives (Wikdall 1958). The inability\r\nof some secretaries to meet up with these expectations has brought frustration\r\nto their bosses. This has equally raised quarrels between the secretary and her\r\nboss, other employees, customers and the public of which the reason might be\r\nlack of interpersonal/human relation’s skills.

carry out special tasks for the welfare of its citizens.  These types of tasks cannot be carried out by private individuals or people due to the nature of the financial involvement and the effectiveness of its services.  They are nonprofit oriented, since their aim is not to maximize profit, it is sub-divided into two viz:- federal and state owned parastatals.  Federal owned parastatals.  Federal owned parastatals are those owned by the federal government.  Some of the federal government owned parastatals are:  National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), Nigeria Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Nigeria Postal Services PLC (NIPOST), Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC), Nigeria Teaching Hospital (NTH), Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) etc State owned parastatals are those owned by the state government.  Some of the state government owned parastatals are:  Enugu State Broadcasting Service (ESBS), Enugu State Water Corporation, Enugu State Schools, and State Hospitals etc.<br/>            Their responsibilities – NEPA are responsible for the generation and distribution of power.  NITEL are responsible for Telephones, Telex, Telefax, installation and servicing.  NIPOST are incharge of postal services, telegram, overseas mails and parcels.  Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) are incharge of transport by train Nigeria Airways Corporation (NAC) are in charge of transport by air or plane.  Nigeria Broadcasting Corporations (NBC) are responsible for radio and Television broadcast services.  Water Corporations are responsible for treatment and distribution of water to the people.  Hospitals are in charge of treating the sick and immunization.<br/>            These government parastatals are only established and run by the government to ensure equitable distribution of its services to the generality of people, for it the parastatals are left in the hand of private sectors or individuals, they may tend to politicize it, thereby distorting the assumed equitable services or equitable distribution services or equitable distribution rendered.<br/>            According to Akande (1999) government parastatals or public corporation means business organizations that come into existence through appropriate enabling Acts of parliament, Decrees or Edicts in a particular country or state.  They may be commercially oriented or public service oriented.  Most of them have been commercially oriented in Nigeria in recent time.<br/>Its characteristic features are:<br/>(i)         They are usually state or federal owned.<br/>(ii)        They are established purposely to render public services.<br/>(iii)       Over-reliance on government subventions survive.<br/>            According to any Anyanwuochi (2002) Public Corporations are sometimes called state enterprises.  In a mixed economy, public corporations involve economic activities undertaken by the state.  They form what we normally refer to as the public sector.  Although, they are operated on commercial basis, the intention behind their establishment is for the benedict of the members of the public.  They are not usually established to maximize profit although, in some cases they are expected to at least break-even.  Through these parastatals the government now provides the services which could have been too expensive and unprofitable for private sectors.<br/>            Besides, the word secretary is one of the most misunderstood concepts in contemporary life.  Almost any body who involves him or herself in skill jobs such as typing, writing of shorthand is been referred to as secretary.  But secretary in this case is a person who have been trained for this noble profession and equally have work experience as a secretary, people do not know the importance of secretary in those government owned parastatals.  Secretaries are the life wire of every business organizations.  They are the keeper of secrets, public relations experts, handling of mails and correspondences, a staff assistant and boss’s office memory, meeting organizers etc.  They are the representative of their organizations and their employers gives good human relations in working with the employees in the organizations.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            The government of any nation has the legitimate responsibility of providing certain essential services for the welfare of all individuals governed by that nation, sometimes, government hijacks the provision of certain  essential services which, if left to the hands of private sector would led to out right exploitation of the masses, thus the rationale for the establishment of certain government owned parastatals would be achieved.  These government parastatals are known to have been rendering certain services to people.  At times, the quality of these services are proved by people and some other times, the quality of their services are also condemned because of their healthiness.  The problem is that it has not been known whether secretaries in those government prarastatals within.  Enugu urban do contribute at all towards the improvement of the quality of services which their organizations render to the public.  It has also not been known how well the management of those government owned parastatals appreciate the duties of secretaries.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of this study is to:-<br/>i.          Investigate the impact of secretaries in improving the quality of services rendered by government parastatals.<br/>ii.         Find out, the peculiar problems secretaries encounter in government parastatals.<br/>iii.        Find out the extent a secretary’s job is evaluated in an organization.<br/>iv.        Ascertain certain obstacles that hinder a secretary from performing his or her functions effectively.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The importance of this study will be of immense benefit to NEPA management and also to other employer of labour, policy makers and those who want to achieve the desired goal in setting up organizations.  On the other hand, both of NEPA or an other organization need mostly the services of secretaries before the organizational goal can be achieved.<br/>            Furthermore, this study will contribute to the understanding of the word secretaries and even lead to upgrading them, when the findings of this project are implemented secretaries then render effective services to government parastatals in Enugu urban.<br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            The following research questions will guide and direct the study:<br/>1.         What are the impact of secretaries on improving the quality of services rendered by government parastatals in Enugu Urban 2.<br/>2.         What are the peculiar problems that secretaries in government prarastatals encounters.<br/>3.         To what extent are secretary’s job evaluated in an organization?<br/>4.         What are the obstacles that hinder a secretary from performing his or her functions effectively?<br/>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>            Secretary means one who is next to the executive,
