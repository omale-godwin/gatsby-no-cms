To access the situation, well structure questionnaire were administered using stratified random sampling techniques in other to cover the branches and hierarchy of staff of the bank used for the case study. The data collected were analyzed using simple table percentage and Chi-square statistical techniques. The result that provision of training by the bank has enabled the employee to increase ultimately, prepare employee adequately to assume higher responsibility on their job. Little wonder why contemporary organizations are now spending huge amount of money on employees training and development in order to cope with the challenge posed by the dynamic business environment.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Management practitioners and researchers have gathered information through the research conducted on the effectiveness of training and development on employee performance in the past the fact that human resources are the most dynamic of the entire organization's resources calls for proper attention to be given to it by the management if they are to realize full organization goals. Training and development are important tools employed today's organization to achieve their inward organizational objectives for growth and achievement. It leads to emergence of new career opportunities.</p> <p>The behaviour and attitude of employee's must be change positively to achieve an acceptable result. Employees want to use to a change for the better in their plc of work, they want to be skillful and have a wider knowledge of techniques which may be required in the' future to meet: anticipated future needs of the organization.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Statement of the Problems</strong></p> <p>According to Craven (1997), there is some link between training and good performance but the direction is difficult to identify. Nonetheless, what is known for sure is that the training and development of staff is relevant in better performing companies. The difficulty in identifying the correlation between training as well as performance is attributed to the determination of changes in performance. Measuring knowledge acquired is easy to determine. But to measure skills and attitude development is a different aspect to consider (Craven, 1997). This evaluation needs to be done over a long time period and needs to be carried out by those working with the candidate, to evaluate how the delegate performed before and then after the training process.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>          Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>Primarily, the target of the study is to serve the effectiveness of training and development on employee's performance; the other objectives are given below:-</p> <p>i.            to examine if training and development really boost the performance of employee;</p> <p>ii.         To examine the relationship between training and development of employees and organization productivity; and</p> <p>iii.      To investigate if training and development of employees enhance their effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>1.4    Research Questions</strong></p> <p>(a)   what is the correlation between training and development and employees performance?</p> <p>(b)   Does training and development improve productivity of the organization?</p> <p>(c)    Does training and development of employees enhance their effectiveness?</p> <p><strong>1.5    Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>(a)   Training and development have a significant relationship on employees performance.</p> <p>(b) Training and development Improve productivity of the organization.</p> <p>(c) Training and development of employees enhance their effectiveness?</p> <p><strong>1.6    Significant of the Study</strong></p> <p>This topic is a very broad topic and very much important in any organization. Every organization admits that employees are the main assets so their top priority is to train the employees to achieve their goals. The main object of a manager is to discover a problem in an organization and after that he decides which type of training is required for which employer. In general training and development helps increasing productivity of the employees, team spirit, organizational culture, organizational climate, quality and health and safety.</p> <p>Hence the study on training and development will have good impact on individual organizations and society as a whole subsequently, it enhance better performance through an effective training and development programme.</p> <p><strong>1.7    Scope and Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of training and development activities of an organization depend on the policy and strategy of the organization. There are many organizations in the commercial field that carry out the minimum of staff training and development because, as a matter of policy, they prefer to recruit staff who are already arrived or professionally qualified. These organizations are prepare to pay he top mark rate for is skill staff and put into recruitment.</p> <p>For the fact that training and development is wider in scope, the researchers limit his work to First Bank Nigeria P1c, despite the considerable number of Banks in the industry: data information to the topic shall be gathered from among cultured staff of the bank for appreciable generalization of result.</p> <p>Therefore, in adequacy in financial are constrained tie distance an time to meet and discuss with the employees, these will entails a good foundation for further work on training and development for natural and business organization.</p> <p><strong>1.8    Historical Background</strong></p> <p>First Bank of Nigeria P1c remains one of the Africa's most diversified financial solution providers.

The objective of this study is to examine whether better working condition has effect on labour turnover reduction in the manufacturing sector. The study follows some logical step to generalize the findings of the study. The survey research design was employed in this study and the questionnaire was the major research instrument used to collect information from the respondents in the manufacturing sector. Various statistical tools were employed in this study. Tools such as simple percentage analysis and chi-square test were used to provide answers to the research problems, research questions and the research hypothesis. \"Thus, conclusion was drawn from the result of' the analysis. The result of the statistical inference revealed that employees were very pleased with this system which has not only improved productivity but also encouraged employees to stay on the job and it was recommended that Training and re­training of' staff should be encouraged and practiced to meet the modern techniques production and service of goods and also in personnel management. This will help to curtain labour turnover because staff feels happier when they are learning new thing to improve their knowledge and skills. The recognition of the above recommendation at all times will help the management to pursue its goals and objectives in the. most effective and efficient.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1    <strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Labour turnover can be defined as the flow of manpower into and out of an organization. In this definition, one could deduce the flow of manpower to mean (replacement and new hire) while outflow to mean (separation, lay off, discharge, quits, retirement, leave, absence or death etc.). This inflow and outflow will continue to attract the attention of human resource practitioners on finding the cause: and possible solution for an organization. Since personnel/human resource managers are the custodians of the entire workforce in any organization. The role they perform determine to a great extent the inflow and outflow of workers in an organization.</p> <p>According to Tadeyi (1999), labour turnover occurs when an employee: leaves the service of an organization. Therefore, the resultant effect of the movement of workers/labour from one place to another in search of comfort is tagged \"labour turnover\". Thus, the fund of human resource management is one of the most dynamic and challenging areas for managers across the globe in the turbulent business climate, caused by increased global price competitiveness, changing technologic, changing employment legislation, and changing workforce composition is challenging managers to utilize their employees more effective to gain competitive; advantage. In recent years there has been significant practical development with increasing numbers of private and public sector organizations adopting Human Resource management in order to retain the best hands in their organization, thus reducing labour turnover. Therefore, there is a need for a study of this nature.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The management of human resource is crucial to the survival, growth and development of any organization, particularly, in the contemporary period of 21st, century where there is unhealthy rivalry in the global market, and competitiveness. The reasons for this are many, but the most important ones are that:</p> <p>v    Organizations are practically run by men.</p> <p>v    Human resource is the most difficult resource to manage, in the sense that they have facilities of reasoning and the ability to respond or resist to stimuli, and</p> <p>v    Human beings are dynamic, complex and unpredictable.</p> <p>With the foregoing, effective managers of human resource; is fundamental to the survival of any organization. Therefore, it. is very important for any organization that desires to survive, to put in place, policies, programmes, and practices that can ensure optimal acquisition, utilization and reduction of labour turnover in business enterprises.</p> <p>Labour turnover today in the manufacturing sector in Nigeria has led to a greater extent brain drain and this has lead to many economic crisis in which the nation find her self. Therefore, a high rate of labour turnover is costly, not only in terms of recruitment, advertising, selection, training of new employees, waste, reduced production and loss of sales, but frequently has serious effects on general efficiency and staff morale and on the organization image at large.</p> <p>With the aforementioned, labour are very important in the manufacturing sector in order to identify reasons for incencant change of jobs by personnel. 'thus, there is a need for a study of this nature.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to examine the effect of' labour turnover on organizational performance.</p> <p>Hence in order to achieve the objective stated above, the following specific objectives shall be our guide:</p> <p>v    To examine whether labour turnover have effect on organization efficiency.</p> <p>v    To examine whether labour turnover have effect on organizational efficiency.</p> <p>v    To examine the effect of labour turnover on organization image.</p> <p>v    To examine whether labour turnover help to lay off unproductive workers.</p> <p>v    To examine whether better working condition has effect on labour turnover reduction in the manufacturing sector</p> <p>1.4    <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In order to achieve the objectives of the study identify above, the following are the research questions of this study.</p> <p>v    Does labour turnover have effect on organizational effectiveness in the manufacturing industry?</p> <p>v    Does labour turnover have effect on organization efficiency?</p> <p>v    Does labour turnover have effect on organization image?</p> <p>v    Does a better working condition have effect on labour turnover reduction in the manufacturing sector?</p> <p>v    Does labour turnover have positive effect on lay off unproductive workers?</p> <p>1.5    <strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>   Labour turnover does not have effect on organizational efficiency in the manufacturing industry.</p> <p><strong>Hi:</strong>    Labour turnover has effect on organizational efficiency in the manufacturing industry.</p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>   Better working conditions do not have effect on labour turnover reduction in the manufacturing; sector</p> <p><strong>Hi:</strong>    Better working conditions have effect on labour turnover reduction in the manufacturing sector.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study provides a basis for closer scrutiny of the causes of labour turnover in the manufacturing industry. hence, the study will provide answers to issue; regarding contemporary application of labour turnover, and it relative importance with respect to employee's productivity.</p> <p>This study will be useful to all organizations in different industries, (public or private) and entrepreneurs who are looking for the way to retain and attract the best hands in their organization to achieve fundamental goals. Also, government organizations and individuals concerned with labour issue will benefits from this study.</p> <p>Finally, this study is expected to stimulate research interests in other aspects of manufacturing. industry in general and human resources management.</p> <p>1.7    <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The basic premise on which the study is based is the effect of' labour turnover on organizational performance in the manufacturing industry. This study concentrates on the staffs of UNILEVER and PZ Plc. Hence, staff of this institution was sampled and data relating to labour turnover was collected from them.</p> <p>1.8    <strong>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The level of accuracy of this study depends on the amount of' data or information supplied by the respondents.

The study employed secondary time series data, sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin 2014. A four variable model was developed comprising GDP as dependent variable and Trade Openness, Foreign Direct Investment and Exchange rate as independent variables and the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation technique of Multiple regression analysis was adopted. The findings of the research work includes: Trade Openness has a negative impact on Economic growth, Economic growth causes Trade Openness. Based on the findings, the study amongst others recommends that The Government should analyse Export promotion policy and import substitution policy should also be examined, so that country can take benefit from trade. The fiscal authorities should boost exports, encourage domestic products by dropping Excise duties and tariffs so as to boost home industries to trade their goods and services, That structural trade oriented policy should be adopted to enhance economic growth in Nigeria via high exports flows in order to accumulate more foreign proceeds to boost output growth rate in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>The global economy is in a state of transition from a set of strong national economies to a set of interlinked trading groups. This transition has accelerated over the past few years with the collapse of communism and the blending of the world trading nations into a single market (Gillespie, Jeannet and Hennessey ,( 2004) in Adelowokan and Maku(2013)). One of the most important paths driving global development into the twenty-first century is the advanced economic integration and investment. Never before have so many economies been open to global trade and finance flow than now, after the liberalization of the former communist economies (Adelowokan and Maku 2013). The relationship between trade and productivity has not been established theoretically even though some researchers have indeed found some, if not complete, support for the view that increasing openness has a positive impact on productivity (Osei,Cephas, and Shaik2012)</p> <p>The role of international trade is very crucial to the development of any economy and it is assumed that trade liberalization works as an engine for the growth of the economy.</p>\n\nIMPACT OF TRADE OPENNESS ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF TRADE OPENNESS ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF NIGERIA", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research work set out to investigate industrial sector growth and economic performance in Nigeria. The study employed multiple regression models and Granger causality model using secondary data from 1981 to 2015. Results show that the coefficient of crude petroleum and natural gas, solid mineral variables and manufacturing sub-sector growth are positive and statistically significant. From the Granger causality result, bidirectional causality does not exist between economic growth and industrial sector performance in Nigeria. However, there is a unidirectional causal relationship between industrial sector performance and economic growth at lag 4 and lag 6. However, there is no significant structural break in economic growth especially between military and democratic rules in Nigeria. Also, the Engle-Granger cointegration suggests that there is a long-run relationship. Also, the ECM result suggests that about 15% of the short-run disequilibrium in the model would be corrected in the next period. The study concludes that industrial sector growth is a significant factor affecting economic growth in Nigeria and recommends that industrial sector growth should be boosted by appropriate package of incentive to induce entrepreneurs and investors to undertake profitable investment particularly for export oriented industries.</p> <p><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The critical role of the industrial sector is predicated on the fact that it acts as an engine of growth bybroadening the productive and export base of the economy, reducing unemployment and stemming rural-urbandrift as well as helping to reduce poverty, (Umoro and Eborieme, 2013). Nigeria is an open economy. Accordingly, developments ininternational circles have profound implications on the path the country is going in terms of the development ofher industrial sector. It has been the goal of trading with countries to obtain improved and more secureaccess to markets abroad. This is intended to provide the country with the opportunity to explore economies ofscale beyond the limit of the domestic market and facilitate access to foreign exchange with which to financecritical imports needed for development (Adenikinju 2002). It is true that trade and trade policies are importantdeterminants of economic performance. International trade offers opportunities for greater specialization,increased capacity utilization and import of goods and services. Within the Nigerian context, there has been aconsiderable amount of discussion on the inter-relationship between trade policy reforms, economic performanceand industrial growth.</p> <p>In the development literature, industrialization has been accepted as the major driving force of the modern economy. In most modern economies, industrial sector serves as the vehicle for the production of goods and services, the generation of employment and the enhancement of incomes. </p>\n\nINDUSTRIAL SECTOR GROWTH AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INDUSTRIAL SECTOR GROWTH AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study tends to examine the Effects of Globalization on Industrial Relations Practice with special reference to John Holt Plc.</p> <p>To achieving this, related literature was cited on Globalization.</p> <p>Descriptive research design approach was employed for the research design and a simple random sampling technique was used in selection of respondents.</p> <p>A sample of Thirty-Five (35) respondents was selected from the population study.

Thus individual’s attitude must be checked concerning means of production as a major watch word which must be well managed, ascertaining and diagnosing their needs being pro-active in creating a favourable working conditions within and outside work place that will positively boost their morale to higher performance because the social life of an employee constitutes his or her working life. (Shabi.2002) and not limited to monetary factor alone.</p> <p>Therefore, the link and clue to job satisfaction towards higher production   is through effective and harmonious management of human behaviour in an organization. The fact that man is one of the major factor of production is a product of “nature and nurture” (Idowu.2002) i.e.</p> <p>Work environment + SUPERVISION + Job satisfaction + = HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY.</p> <p>Work environment implies what constitutes good working condition within and outside the workplace. Supervision implies continuous implementation and monitoring of management programme of needs.</p> <p>Job satisfaction implies effective harmonizing of human behaviour.</p> <p>                                                WORK ENVIROMENT</p> <p>                                                            Higher</p> <p>                                                   Productivity</p> <p>               Supervision                                                         Job Satisfaction</p> <p>Dr. Dauda 2005. </p> <p>The key to job satisfaction is in an individual attitude, for many of us, the idea of having a job that is truly satisfying i.e. the kind of environment in which work doesn’t feel like work anymore is pure fantasy. Professional athletes, ski patrollers and golf pros may have found a way of doing what they love and getting paid for it. However, job satisfaction describes how content an individual is with his/her job. Job satisfaction is not the same as motivation or aptitude. Although it is clearly linked. Job design aims at enhancing job satisfaction and performance by increasing productivity in a conducive environment.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>In the past, environmental conditions in the workplace. Illuminations, ventilation, humility, temperature, sitting arrangement, office structure and a host of other environmental variables have all been seen from the angle of the engineering,. Although the technical problem of achieving desired result is simple aside the psychological problem of what condition suits the employees.</p> <p><strong>1.3      AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study would like to look at the contribution of the physical work environment and supervisory style on job satisfaction. The physical work environment must be defined as the setting of the workplace. Also, the study would also look at how supervision and management create a healthy work environment.</p> <p>The purpose of the study are in these folds:-</p> <p><strong>1.</strong>To see the extent to which the physical work environment especially open-office structure that are now taking over from the conventional private office ,the amount of privacy offered by this kind of office structure, noise, amount of social interaction permitted by the structure and the contribution of these and other factors to job satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong>To examine supervisory style and its impact on employees job satisfaction and the extent to which freedom of action and job execution facilitates or influence employee’s job satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong>To analyse the combined effects of these two factors above on Job satisfaction and recommend ways of improving those factors so as to make employees more satisfied with their job with their job probably increasing their job performance.</p> <p><strong>1.4      RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The following are the research questions that would be asked during research process.</p> <p>1).     How can an employee be satisfied with his job?</p> <p>2).     what are the necessary factors for job satisfaction?­­</p> <p>3).     Under what condition will an employee be satisfied with his job?</p> <p>4.)     Can motivation and productivity enhance the level at which employees in an organization can attain job satisfaction?</p> <p><strong>1.5      STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses are tentatively stated and will be tested for the purpose of this research.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong>      Workers in private office do not experience more job satisfaction than those in open offices</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:</strong>      Workers in private office experience more job satisfaction than those in open offices</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong>      Private office is not a status symbol</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:</strong>      Private office is a status symbol</p> <p><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Organizational behaviour could either bring about job satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The motivation- hygiene theory offer explanations to what motivates and satisfies individual as well as what dissatisfies or does not motivate them Bankole (2003). Some variables are considered to be dependent on job satisfaction, which are:-</p> <p>1. Job satisfaction and job performance.</p> <p>2. Job satisfaction and staff turnover.</p> <p>3. Job satisfaction and absence.</p> <p>The relationship between Job satisfaction and performance is the main aim of the organisation. The predictive nature of these studies gives a conclusion that dissatisfaction is a factor that leads to employee’s turnover. For an individual organization, the consequences of job satisfaction are extremely important by discovering the attitudes of workers on factors that are job related. An organization can benefit materially if it knows what factors contribute to satisfaction instead of wasting money on incentives that are not appreciated by workers. After finding out to what extent the physical work environment and supervisory style contributes to employees job satisfaction, this study proceeds to find means of increasing this contributions. Finally, this study could be useful to other student and managers who are interested in the study of job satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>1.7      SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study focuses on the managerial operation and marketing staff of ACCION MICROFINANCE BANK LIMITED LAGOS. This organization was chosen because of the peculiarity of its office structures. The offices in this organization are partitioned with plain glass, workers sits side by side with their supervisor or in offices where the supervisor can see them from his office. The respondents that were chosen have different jobs, functions and status ranging from minor to major ones. They also work in varied environment which includes private offices to non- private offices occupied by an average of three to five workers.</p> <p><strong>1.8      DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this study, the following terms would be defined as follows:-</p> <p>* <strong>WORK ENVIROMENT:</strong> - This can be defined or identified as the place where one work. It could be in an office building, at home from the kitchen, from the car, at a constitution site etc. But here, we are talking about “ healthy work environment”- which can point to other factors in the work environment such as co-workers, air quality, ergonomic seating management, child care, parking and noise.</p> <p>* <strong>SUPERVISION:</strong> - This can simply be described as an act or process by which a superior officer in an organization directs the work of his subordinates by giving instructions on task to be performed in the work environment.</p> <p>* <strong>JOB SATISFACTION:-</strong> This refers to the contentment experienced by individual worker when desire is attained on the job. It involves the outcome already experienced as opposed to motivation which implies a drive towards an outcome .Bankole( 2003)</p> <p>* <strong>PRIVATE OFFICE:-</strong>This is an office occupied by only one person and is partitioned by walls or any other non-transparent material.</p> <p><strong>* OPEN OFFICE:</strong> - This is an office occupied by one, two or more persons and has plain glass partitioned.</p>                                                          \n\nIMPACT OF WORK ENVIRONMENT, SUPERVISION AND JOB SATISFACTION ON EMPLOYEES PRODUTIVITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF WORK ENVIRONMENT, SUPERVISION AND JOB SATISFACTION ON EMPLOYEES PRODUTIVITY", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The need for improved productivity has become universally accepted and that it depends on efficient and effective training is not less apparent. It has further become necessary in view of advancement in modern world to invest in training and development. Thus, this study attempts to explore the roles, functions and performance of effective personnel management in a developed organization. Human resources training and development helps to ensure that staff (manpower) possess the knowledge and skills they need to perform their job effectively for organization to grow. The findings and suggestions made are therefore intended to aid in the impact of manpower training and development on organization performance Particularly in Unilever Nigeria Plc. This research work is divided into five chapters; chapter one deals with the general introduction of topic, chapter two deals with review of relevant literatures. Chapter three and four also focus of the research methodology, presentation and analysis of data while chapter five deals with the summary of findings, conclusion, recommendation, limitation of the study and suggestion for further studies.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>There are various factors that contribute to the success of any organization, these factors include; Capital, equipment, land, manpower etc. All these factors are important but the most significant factor is the human factor. For example, money may be scarce and difficult to come but once you get it, you must have good people around to manage it otherwise a huge amount can disappear into thin air and this can spell down for the organization in question. In the same vein, land may be expensive and the location may be fraught with problems. Since it is the people that will put the other resources to work, it should be viewed as such by management by giving it due attention in order to achieve its organizational goals and objectives. This implies that the employees within an organization, in order to perform their duties and make meaningful contribution to the attainment of such organizational goals need to acquire the relevant skills and knowledge.</p> <p>Manpower training is therefore aimed at ensuring that the right person is available for the right job at the right time. This involves formulating a forward looking plan to ensure that the necessary human effort to make it possible for the survival and growth of any organization, it therefore, becomes paramount to develop the employee.</p> <p>Manpower Development is a process of intellectual and emotional achievement through providing the means by which people can grow on their jobs. It relates to series of activities which an enterprise would embark upon to improve its managerial capacity.</p> <p>Manpower training and development constitute one of the major cardinal areas of personnel management which no organization can afford to toy with. It takes a well trained workforce to have high quality products, all things being equal. Of all the factors of production, man seems to be only factor that cannot be used in its crude form. It has to be refined through training to get the best out of it.</p> <p>Therefore, any organization who undermines the prominent position which training occupies in the development of a virile workforce may jeopardize its chances of surviving in the keenly competitive environment.</p> <p><strong>1.2   AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The  main objective of this study is to determine the impact of manpower training and development on organization performance of Unilever Pic. The specific objective of the study is to:</p> <p>i.      To provide for the future manpower needs of the organization quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of skills, numbers and ages.</p> <p>ii.     Estimation of the cost of human resources</p> <p>iii.    Find out whether training and development scheme have positive impact on the performance and productivity of works.</p> <p>iv.    Proffer solutions to the identified problems</p> <p>v.     To minimize imbalances due to non-availability of human resources of the right kind, right number in the right time and right place.</p> <p><strong>1.3.  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The human resources (manpower) is considered the most critical to any organizational survival with adequate supply of materials and financial resources that utilizes these available resources to bring about the desired goals.</p> <p>However, most organization plans meticulously for their investment in physical and capital resources and these plans are received with utmost attention to detail while rarely do such organizations pay attention to human investment in which without it, the capital and equipment will be in vain. Not many organizations consider the necessity for a well defined and sustained training and development for staff in order to upgrade their performance or they are not able to cope financially with training and development programmes. The very few organizations that give thought to this very important aspect of staffing function do so with lack of seriousness, all round attention and continuity. The programmes are carried out not only once in a blue moon but are also lopsided in terms of content and staff participation. As a result of this lackadaisical attitude of management towards manpower training and development had resulted to a progressive decline in the ability of manpower to cope with the challenges that attend the over unfolding new, dispensation in the organization.</p> <p>It has also been discovered that the employees lacks the right attitude to training because they considered it as hectic and stressful. And this problem could also pose a threat to labour turnover.</p> <p>It is against this background that the researcher considered the impact of manpower training and development on organisation performance, however the researcher used Unilever Nigeria. Plc as a reference.</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>This study shall address itself to the following research questions.</p> <p>i.      Does Manpower Training and Development has an effect on organizational performance?</p> <p>ii.     Does Manpower Training and Development reduce labour and organizational growth?</p> <p>iii.    Is there any relationship between manpower Development and organizational growth.</p> <p><strong>1.5.  RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The testable hypothesis of this research study shall be:</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>:   </strong>Manpower Training and Development has no significant relation with organizational performance.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:   </strong>Manpower Training and Development has a significant relationship with organizational performances.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>:   </strong>Effective Manpower Training and Development does not reduce labour turnover.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:</strong>   Effective manpower Training and Development reduce labour turnover.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In spite of all efforts geared towards improving the services of Unilever Plc, there are some doubts as to the quality of products rendered by the company to its customers in particular. It is in light of this that the researcher intend to look into the factors militating against the industry in achieving its set objectives, by this, the study will look into the manpower base and quality of staff of Unilever Nig Plc and assess their suitability with the aim of developing training programmes to enhance their performance since the progress of an organization is a function of the quality of those directing its affairs.</p> <p>The importance of this study also behooves the company to train and develop its workers for the best quality of work to be relevant in the scheme of globalization.</p> <p>It will also evaluate aspects of the recruitment, selection and training process, which bear strong relevance to corporate image, productivity efficiency and morals. For the management of Unilever Nigeria Plc, this study will serve as a benefit to the quality of 'work, life of the employees will also reciprocate with increase performances on the job.</p> <p>This study will also be relevant to the human resource development department in the. formulation of policies relating to training and development of personnel and for the government, to ensure adequate training and know-how to improve the economy as a whole.</p> <p><strong>1.7   LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is limited to Unilever Nig Plc in Lagos. Due to envisage constraint, the use of questionnaire is adopted using sizeable population of employees from the firm under study. The population size may not be true representation of employees; hence the study was also limited to the unwillingness of management to divulge strategic information in the name of confidentiality. The study was also limited to employees of the firm. Some were either too busy for interviews or cleverly avoided certain question for the fear that the information given might put their jobs in jeopardy. A lot of finance was also required in making this project a reality, thus the researcher was faced with the problem of finance and time.</p> <p>These difficulties notwithstanding, the researcher made concrete efforts to ensure that the project was comprehensively carried out to meet the desired needs.</p> <p><strong>1.8   HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF UNILEVER NIGERIA PLC</strong></p> <p>Unilever Nigeria Plc, was incorporated as Lever Brothers (West African) Ltd on 11th April 1923 by Lord Leverhulme, but the company's antecedents have to be traced back to his existing trading interests in Nigeria and West Africa generally.</p> <p>Unilever Nigeria Plc started as a soap manufacturing Company, and it today one of the oldest surviving manufacturing organizations of Nigeria.</p> <p>After series of mergers/acquisitions, the company diversified into manufacturing and marketing of foods, non-soapy</p> <p>detergents and personal care products.

In discussing this aspect of management problem, renowned authors have agreed that motivation rightly comes under activation.</p> <p>Practitioners are also fully aware that besides activating, one of the four major functions of management is the maintenance of congenial work environment of performance of individuals working together in the groups toward the accomplishment of a common objective.</p> <p>To be able to create and maintain this conducive organizational atmosphere necessary for inducing productivity geared towards achieving predetermined objective in the organizational, administrators must have a thorough knowledge and understanding of human motivation.</p> <p>Motivation in organizations has received increased attention in recent years among practicing managers and organizational researchers. Managers in all type of organizations are continually faced with the fact that vast differences exist in the performance of a group of employees, Some of them perform at high levels and need little or no supervision an appear to enjoy what they are doing while on the other hand, others perform only at a marginal level and require constant supervision and are often absent from office.</p> <p>Motivation is an important concept to behavioural scientist. Many scientist like Elton Mayor, Urwick, Gullie, Abraham Maslow, Aldefer and Frederick Taylor embarked on researches on the concept and have found out that through motivational factors or inputs, things like money-wages, bonuses and other incentives, the lot of organizations and employees can be improved and that without proper integration and direction from management, the organizational goal might not be achieved.</p> <p>There are at least three major reasons that account for emergence of motivation as a principal of interest First, the ever increasing external forces of national and international competition, economic, social, and technological and- governmental conditions have forced management to develop and acquire new techniques and mechanisms to increase or maintain levels of organizational efficiency and effectiveness. This requires the effective utilization of all the resources of the organization.</p> <p>Second and closely related to the first is the growing perspective of considering human resources in terms of an infinite labour pool in which frequent changes can occur because of the endless supply of qualified individuals. More emphasis is being placed by managers on developing, stimulating and maintaining an effective workforce at all skill levels through the use of such strategies as job design, management by objectives and skill training.</p> <p>Finally, the views of people in the work place have undergone a significant change. Motivation theorists have developed slightly different viewpoints of motivation that place emphasis on different concepts in general. The differing views about motivation leads to a number of different conclusions:</p> <p>(i)    The analysis of motivation should concentrate on factors that arouse or incite a person's activities.</p> <p>(ii)   Motivation is process oriented and concerns choice direction and goal</p> <p>(iii) Motivation IS also concerned with how behaviour is started, sustained or stopped and what kind of subjective reaction is present in the person while this is going on.</p> <p>The major theme of motivational theory began moving from philosophical to move psychological. The theories that evolved motivation attempted to explain the behaviour of individuals through an investigation of variables that focused both on the individual and the situation in which the individual interacted.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>The early managerial motivational theories have been identified as prescription models because they purported to tell the managers how to motivate employees. To understand motivation, one first must comprehend the process of human behaviour. This is done through the study of attitudes, needs and cognitive process. From the managerial perspective, we can say that motivation relates to any conscious attempts on that part of a person or group to influence the direction and the rate of behaviour towards the accomplishment of organizational goals.</p> <p>Motivation should be considered as a principal topic of interest to managers, it must be treated differently from any other named management function.</p> <p>Increasing number of internal and external forces of national and international compilation, economic, social, technological and governmental conditions have forced management to develop and acquire new techniques and mechanisms to maintain levels of organizational efficiency and effectiveness. This requires the effective utilization of all the resources of the organization including human and non-human resources.</p> <p><strong>1.2    RESEARCH AIM</strong></p> <p>The aim of this area of study (MOTIVATION) is to bring out the fact that it is necessary that managers recognize that organizational objectives are not just achieved without the participation of individuals.</p> <p>That there are motivational techniques for management to use in realization of the organization's goal. Individuals need training for efficiency and skill, they need rest, they need functioning machines and other effrontery inputs, and they also need money to be able to fend for other social and physical needs. It is also an objective of this study to highlight some of the bottlenecks in motivational techniques as regards establishments. This study will also proffer solutions to identified problems and research questions raised at the later part of this write-up. This subject is also chosen to further educate employers of labour that in any human endeavor, there is need for motivation. In actual fact, psychologists have identified man as a social being that needs to be adequately motivated to enhance his or her performance and make him/her produce at the optimal level. In view of this,the more workers are motivated, the better they will perform on their jobs. Most employers of labour have more often than not ignored this technique even in this critical period of the nation's economic development when workers should be adequately motivated in order to tum round the economy.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>In this country today, some experts contend that companies will continue to operate below capacity unless workers are motivated to break into higher levels of productivity. There is the need to advise the employers to break the barrier levels of productivity and ensure that employees put in their best.</p> <p>Furthermore, attention of the employers of labour should be drawn to the fact that almost every employee behaves like a child that is to say that if you attend to the need of a child, his/her would want to do anything to impress you. The same any employer who reconciles his workers aspiration with organizational needs to operate profitably will be running a successful team.</p> <p>This is because there exists correlation between motivation and performance of a given task. The best way to make any serious organization grow is, by way of creating humane working conditions for workers.</p> <p>Corporate organizations need to know their workers individually. Keep-up- to date record of what is happening to them and what interest in and out of the workplace, provide them with increasingly many challenging opportunities and remember to wait for signals indicating that they have reached the limits of their productivity levels.</p> <p>There is always the need to immediately recognize good performance with prompt and appropriate rewards.</p> <p>In ministries, decision makers should always remember to co-opt their workers in decision making especially when it relates to how the job can be done better. Furthermore, they should always be encouraged to bring up ideas on how to carry out the job. Above all, there should be free flow of information between management and workers. It is an established truth that organizations have a lot of benefits if they improve the lots and welfare of their workers and it will reduce the constant conflict in work places which invariably results to loss of many man-hours when workers are agitating for better pay-packages or general condition of service.</p> <p><strong>1.3   RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this research work is to bring to the knowledge of academicians, policy makers, students, government and every concerned individual that in any venture where human interests are involved, motivation is the only source through which aims and objectives of an organization can be achieved.</p> <p>This study, after completion is expected to show to the generality of the people, the would be managers and administrators as well as practicing managers that for their organizations to be successful, they must try to maintain conducive organizational atmosphere for their workers to perform from time to time.</p> <p>For these and other reasons, I intend to look into the following:</p> <p>(i)          What have been the contributions of motivation in task and job mobility in an organization and do workers perceive them?</p> <p>(ii)    What have been the responsible factors to the failure of most management despite all other managerial functions employed to the effective running of the organization?</p> <p>(iii)   The need for all managers at all levels of management in organizations to motivate their employees.</p> <p>(iv)   The cause of low productivity in most organizations.</p> <p>(v)    How can organization reduce the ever-increasing rate of strike actions, which have become the order of the day.</p> <p>It is imperative that solution to the above problems must be found at the end of this work.</p> <p><strong>1.4   SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Given the broad perspective of the subject and the need to reduce it to a manageable and meaningful proportion, the study is based on LAGOS STATE UNIVERSITY, as an institution were workers need motivation to work effectively and efficiently.</p> <p><strong>1.5   STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following statements are to be tested as hypotheses in this work:</p> <p>(i)      Employee's need satisfaction leads to high morale.</p> <p>(ii)     A low job turnover and high absenteeism is an indication of low moral.</p> <p>(iii)    Workers achieve their set goals by being motivated.</p> <p><strong>1.6   LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is lined to Lagos State University and the Lagos State Public Service represents the wider framework of the thematic study.</p> <p>To ensure the attainment of more realistic results, emphasis is directed on the administrative staff executive cadre and the junior staff.</p> <p>The envisaged and real limitation of the study is the collection of relevant data and facts for proper analytical discussion and in depth study of the topic. It is a common characteristic of Nigerian organizations to always hold back, in the provision of information, even for research purposes of this nature. An attitude borne out of the fear that such information or data might be released to the public.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Another constraint is that of time required for the study, when of course is compounded by lean resources for a compute and prompt report.</p> <p><strong>1.7   DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Motivation: </strong>This is the effort of an employer to make its employees concept real so as to increase his/her production.

The organization should be a good corporate citizen in the discharge of duties. This would go a long way to create a good cordial relationship with members of the community. Management of organizations should be strategic when it comes to corporate social responsibility. They should involve in activities that will enriched the lives of the people in the community. Organization operating in an environment should try as much as possible to give something tangible to the community for it to survive. Management of business organization should endeavour to make provision for members of the community to avoid conflicting issues from occurring.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the last twenty years, there has been a sea of change in the nature of the triangular relationship between companies, the state and the society. No longer can firms continue to act as independent entities regardless of the interest of the general public (Crane et al, 2009). The evolution of the relationship between companies and society has been one of slow transformation from a philanthropic coexistence to one where the mutual interest of all the stakeholders is gaining paramount importance (Anao, 2009).</p> <p>Companies are beginning to realize the fact that in order to gain strategic initiative and to ensure continued existence, business practices may have to be moulded from the normal practice of solely focusing on profits to factor in public goodwill and responsible business etiquettes (Oghojafor, 2001). An examination of some of the factors which have led to the development of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) would be ideal starting ground for the conceptual development of suitable corporate business practices for emerging markets.</p> <p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) also called corporate conscience, corporate citizenship, social performance, or sustainable responsible business is a form of corporate self­-regulation integrated into a business model. Corporate social responsibility policy functions as a built-in, self-regulating mechanism whereby business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards, and international norms (Blowfield and Murray, 2008).</p> <p>According to Montiel (2006), the goal of corporate social responsibility is to embrace responsibility for the company's actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities, stakeholders and all other members of the public sphere. Furthermore, corporate social responsibility-focused businesses would proactively promote the public interest by encouraging community growth and development, and voluntarily eliminating practices that harm the public sphere, regardless of legality. Corporate social responsibility is the deliberate inclusion of public interest into corporate decision-making that is the core business of the company or firm, and the honouring of a triple bottom line: people, planet, profit.</p> <p>Business organizations taking responsibility for its impact on society means first and foremost that a company must account for its actions. Social accounting, a concept describing the communication of social and environmental effects of a company's economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large, is thus an important element of CSR.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The role corporate social responsibility play in business organization growth needs not be over-emphasized. Acceptably, for business organization to achieve optimum profit and growth in the economy, the need for continuous corporate social responsibility is essential.</p> <p>However, most organizations have extreme difficulty and in most cases impossible to conveniently exercise its corporate responsibility to the society in which they operate. The minimal level of customers' satisfaction and frequent winding up of some telecommunication organizations are testimonies of this, precisely, many of these fold-ups happen because some telecommunication companies disregard corporate social responsibility.</p> <p>Some telecommunication organizations experience sales decline, slow growth and changing buying pattern. These problems are generated as a result of not embarking on corporate social responsibility. Many organizations are unable to operate effectively due to the fact that they have not being able to play their role as a corporate responsible body. This has generated the following problems:</p> <p>        i.            Low market shares resulting from low customers and employees commitment;</p> <p>      ii.            Frequent complaints from member of the society can lead to the winding up of the company;</p> <p>    iii.            Members of the community would not patronize the company products/services thereby leading to low performance and profitability levels.</p> <p>   iv.            Inability of the company to achieve sustainable competitive advantage over its rivals.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Thus, in order for telecommunication companies to be able to achieve sustainable competitive advantage, they have to embark on corporate social responsibility.</p> <p><strong>1.3      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to examine effects of corporate social responsibility on organizational performance. Other specific objectives of the study are:</p> <p>        i.            To examine involvement in Corporate Social Responsibility breeds cordial relationship between organization and members of the community.</p> <p>      ii.            To examine whether continuous corporate social responsibility promote organizational performance in the society.</p> <p>    iii.            To assess various ways management of MTN Nigeria Communications Limited carry out corporate social responsibility.</p> <p><strong>1.4      RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following research questions are generated for the study:-</p> <p>        i.            Does involvement in Corporate Social Responsibility breeds cordial relationship between organization and members of the community?</p> <p>      ii.            Does continuous corporate social responsibility improve organizational performance in the society?</p> <p>    iii.            In what ways do management of MTN Nigeria Communications Limited carried out corporate social responsibility?</p> <p><strong>1.5      RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses were formulated for the study:</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 1</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>:</strong>      Corporate Social Responsibility does not breeds cordial relationship between organization and members of the community.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>:</strong>       Corporate Social Responsibility breeds cordial relationship between organization and members of the community.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong>:      Effective Corporate Social Responsibility does not enhance organizational effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>:</strong>       Effective Corporate Social Responsibility enhances organizational effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>1.6      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research study is of great importance to individuals, firms and government. The study would be of benefit to management of communication organizations, for it would enable them to know the importance of corporate social responsibility to organizational effectiveness.</p> <p>The research study would be of relevance to management of business organizations by revealing some of the likely problems communication organizations may encounter if they do not embark on corporate social responsibility. Furthermore, it would contribute to knowledge by serving as a guide for further research work.</p> <p>Finally, the study would also aid scholars, professionals and individuals that would be researching into a similar area of study in the nearest future.</p> <p><strong>1.7      SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research study focuses on the impact of corporate social responsibility on organizational performance. The concept of corporate social responsibility, importance of corporate social responsibility, effect of corporate social responsibility on firms' performance would be reviewed. The study is narrowed to MTN Nigeria Communications Limited at Apapa area of Lagos.</p> <p><strong>1.8      PROFILE OF MTN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p>MTN Nigeria is part of the MTN Group, Africa's leading cellular telecommunications company. On May 16, 2001, MTN became the first GSM network to make a call following the globally lauded Nigerian GSM auction conducted by the Nigerian Communications Commission earlier in the year. Thereafter the company launched full commercial operations beginning with Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>MTN paid $285m for one of four GSM licenses in Nigeria in January 2001. To date, in excess of US$1.8 billion has been invested building mobile telecommunications infrastructure in Nigeria. Since launch in August 2001, MTN has steadily deployed its services across Nigeria. It now provides services in 223 cities and towns, more than 10,000 villages and communities and a growing number of highways across the country, spanning the 36 states of the Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Many of these villages and communities are being connected to the world of telecommunications for the first time ever.</p> <p>The company's digital microwave transmission backbone, the 3,400 Kilometer Y'elloBahn was commissioned by President Olusegun Obasanjo in January 2003 and is reputed to be the most extensive digital microwave transmission infrastructure in all of Africa. The Y'elloBahn has significantly helped to enhance call quality on MTN network.</p> <p>The company subsists on the core brand values of leadership, relationship, integrity, innovation and \"can-do\". It prides itself on its ability to make the impossible possible, connecting people with friends, family and opportunities. MTN is the first GSM network in Nigeria to have adopted more numbering system, having exhausted its initial subscriber numbering range - 0803. its network capacity includes numbering range with the prefixes 0806,0703,0706,0813,0816.</p> <p><strong>1.9      DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>The following concepts are used in the study:</p> <p><strong>Management</strong>: this is the process of planning, organizing, coordinating and controlling organizational resources towards the realization of set goals and objectives.</p> <p><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility</strong>: This has to do with business organization promoting the public interest by encouraging community growth and development, and voluntarily eliminating practices that harm the public sphere, regardless of legality.</p> <p><strong>Organizational Performance</strong>: This IS the ability of the organization to achieve its goals being effective and efficient in the discharge of its responsibility in the society in which it’s operate.</p> <p><br/><br/></p>                                                         \n\nTHE EFFECT OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ON ORGANISATIONAL PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ON ORGANISATIONAL PERFORMANCE", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>A major concern to the government of Lagos state is the problem of solid Waste Management within Lagos metropolis.</p> <p>To ameliorate the situation, the government put in place strategies for effective collection, disposal and management of solid waste to improve the living environment of the people.</p> <p>A new initiative was developed statewide after a pilot scheme was undertake in Surulelre, Kosofe and Shomolu Local Government Areas of the state. The pilot scheme bought to fore the need to regulate private sector participation (PSP) in domestic waste collection and disposal.</p> <p>However, in view of this, the project carried out an overview study of Lagos State Waste Management in the state. Authority to reflect its role and significance in waste management in the state. The study also carried out an analysis - of data collected from primary and secondary source. Questionnaire were administered, collected and were analyzed descriptively using inferential statistical tools. On the basis of funding, it was revealed that with adequate funding of waste management outfit, private or public and good service delivery, the residents in the state would be ready to pay for waste collection.</p> <p>Since waste collection anddisposal is one of the constitutional duties of Local Government, the government (Local and State) should fashion out a lasting strategy to ensure a clean environment for all.</p> <p><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUNG OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the sanitation of the environment, disposal of wastes has been identified as being of utmost importance. It is the first problem which must be discussed in any community for the fact that it is basically controlled for enhancement of health of the people in the environment, because the success of any other health measures introduce will depend to a large extent upon the efficiency with which it is solved. The task of maintaining a healthy environment through sanitary disposal of waste has become more difficult in recent times in West Africa and most other developing countries of which Nigeria is one. The reason been that of population explosion, migration of the people from rural to urban areas: the mobility of population as a result of style of life: the increase in outdoor recreation and industrialization.</p> <p>Health planners; therefore, as those charged with the responsibility of providing health to the people: determine what wastes are: identify the various types of wastes and highlight the relationship between wastes and public health, with a view to working out suitable ways of dealing with these wastes.</p> <p>However, the waste problem has become inter-government in scope and the local governments still retain their constitutional roles, the state and the federal government have assumed the role of the big brother in waste management the role of Local Government in waste management is imposed both by the federal constitution and the local government (Basic and transitional provision). Act 1989. Indeed waste management has been recognized as an integral part of health and environment services of local government for the state government.</p> <p>Most states in the federation haveby enabling edicts established environmental sanitation authorities, in which. we have Lagos sat waste management Authority (LAWMA) in Lagos, Ibadan solid waste management authority Oyo State etc, whose primary institution are disposal and management of solid waste.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>The need for the agencies has arisen from the expanding complexity of the waste and the inability of the rations local government councils to cope with the problem alone.</p> <p><strong>1.2   PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study IS to determine the extent to which the facility used by local government to manage waste needs to be improved upon,' to be able to cope with the mounting bills of refuse that abound in the urban center. The study will also try to determine if the participation of private initiatives will assist the government in improving the general health of the populace.</p> <p><strong>1.3   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following are the research question, which the study aims to provide answer to.</p> <p>    i.        How effective IS the use of private initiative in the control of waste disposal?</p> <p> ii.        Is there any correlation between waste disposal management and health hazards?</p> <p>iii.        What is the role of government in waste disposal management? iv. Can any economic value be derived from the salvage of material from waste?</p> <p><strong>1.4 PRELIMINARY HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses will be the main focus of the study.</p> <p>    i.        <strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong> The introduction of private initiatives does not contribute to effective waste disposal management</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>:</strong> The introduction of private initiatives will contribute to effective waste disposal management.</p> <p><br/></p> <p> ii.        <strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong>: Ineffective waste disposal management does not contribute to health hazards</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>:</strong> Ineffective waste disposal management contributes to health hazards.</p> <p>iii.        <strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong>: Government involvement is not needed for the effective management of waste disposal.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>:</strong> Government involvement is .needed for effective waste management control.</p> <p>iv.        HO: Salvaging for waste materials as a mean of employment is not a worthwhile venture. Hi. Salvaging for waste materials as a means of employment is a worthwhile venture.</p> <p><strong>1.5   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study will be limited to finding out an appropriate sanitation and cost effective system of waste management in Lagos State and mushin Local government area in particular, which will eradicate the environmental health problems, and to examine the existing methods of waste management and also to select viable ones among them for efficient management of these wastes.</p> <p>It will also try to identify the environmental health problems associated with ineffective waste management and the effects on the people in the communities under Mushin Local Government and Lagos State at large.</p> <p>\\</p> <p><strong>1.6    HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF SURULERE LOCAL GOVERNMENT</strong></p> <p>Surulere Local Government is described as the center of commerce. It is located in the heart of Lagos and has modern amenities like tap water, electricity supply, telephone network, and good road networks it is bounded in the north by Oshodi-Isolo Local Government, in the East by Shomolu Local Government and in the south by mainland Local Government.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Formerly, Surulere was part of Ikeja Native Authority in the western Region before it was carved out as a District in 1954 with its boundary extending to the present Shomolu Local Government council, initially Surulere District council started as a one room rented shop on palm Avenue, but it was later moved to Isolo road on the site presently Occupied by the Lagos State waste disposal board and the Nigeria police zone D command.</p> <p>The council moved to its present administrative secretariat in 1965 when its Isolo road secretariat was razed down during the political riot code named \"Wetie\".</p> <p>With the army suspension of political activities in 1966 and the creation of Lagos State in 1966, Mushin District council was elevated to a town council Status. The 1976 Local Government edict divided the council into two: Surulere west Local Government which covered Surulere, Agege motor Road, Isolo, Shogunle, Onigbongbo, Ejigbo, Odi-olowo; Maryland, Ilupeju, Cappa and Estate.

This research work is generally about the Benefits and Employees Job Satisfaction Public Sector.  The project has undertook the general introduction into the research work led to the review of various literature that relates to the major variables involved in the research work especially employees Job Satisfaction. Structured questionnaire was used for the collection of data and other important information for this study. The questionnaire was structured into three (3) sections. Section A is meant to obtain information on the socio demographic profile of respondents. Section B is centered on obtaining data related to the subject of the study. The information gathered through the administration of questionnaire were analyzed, Analysis in this study was carried out with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 17.0).  The findings of this study reveal that a correlation exists between perceived fringe benefits, motivation, job satisfaction, and commitment. The correlation that exists in this study among perceived workers motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment corresponds. Satisfaction might be found in \"sacrificial labour,\" otherwise referred to as labour of love. Uppermost in our minds should be the quest for self-actualization described by Maslow. In reference to the research study on fringe benefits and employees job satisfaction in the public sector, there is need for further review of different types of fringe benefits as practiced in both private and public sector, the management should also review the welfare package of the members of staffs, to increase their level of motivation and job satisfaction.The result of the study reveals that Nigerian Port Authority has performed fairly well, but it can improve on its achievements making the sky its limits if these recommendations are viewed with rapt attention. The management of Nigeria Port Authority should provide buses to convey workers from the company premises to their various homes. This will definitely reduce the degree of lateness to work, at the same time, increase their morale.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background of the study</strong></p> <p>The concept of employees’ commitment has received increased attention in the recent times. According to Becker (2000) research literatures are paying increasing attention to the concept of commitment as managers and organizational analysts are continually seeking ways of increasing employee retention and performance. Interest in organizational commitment has therefore been stimulated largely because evidence in the research literature has it that commitment reduces turnover and increases performance. A reduction in turnover could be an indication of a high level of commitment and performance. An increase in turnover on the other hand could amount to a low level of organizational commitment and performance. This is because a high level of organizational performance can be achieved only when an organization has a committed labour force.</p> <p>With the introduction of monetization and fringe benefits policy in 2005, civil servants have been paid certain percentage of their basic salary as fringe benefits which are added to the basic salary, meaning an increment in salary of workers. Although, there is much academic debate on the extent to which additional income is a direct motivator (Nwagwu, 2007).</p> <p>Job satisfaction describes how satisfied an individual is with his or her job. The happier people are within their job, the more satisfied they are said to be. Job satisfaction is not the same as motivation or aptitude, although it is clearly linked.Job design aims to enhance job satisfaction include job rotation, job enlargement, job enrichment and job re-engineering. Other influences on satisfaction include the management style and culture, employee involvement, empowerment and autonomous work position. Job satisfaction is a very important attribute which is frequently measured by organizations.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Commitment of worker has been described by Moser (2002) as the most important ingredient to an effective work output. Aside from completing tasks for the joy of doing them, it has been discovered that motivation drives people’s behaviour to attain a specific outcome. This explains why developing an effective and efficient compensation system becomes an important part of the human resource management process in advanced countries.</p> <p>The attitude of Nigerian workers in terms of output compared to the more developed countries in recent times is becoming alarming. This could be attributed to uneven reward system, poor income, and unfavourable social, economic, and political infrastructure of the country. Rewards are an ever-present and always controversial feature of organizational life in Nigeria</p> <p>The monetization policy, which was formally introduced into the Nigerian Public Service in 2005 led to monetization of those physical benefits which were added to the basic salary of workers. Despite the implementation of monetization policy in Nigeria, little has been done to clearly show the effect of the policy on the level of the performance of workers. However, their purchasing power is hardly enhanced due to the biting effects of inflation and high cost of living in the country. There is the need to know whether the addition to salary through the monetization of benefits and prompt payment of these benefits will have any effect on the workers with their disposition to their workplace.</p> <p>Government employees and their immediate families have always enjoyed these benefits at her expense. Though the running cost may not cater for all the expenditure, but the expenses incurred in the course of service are refunded, most workers get their expended money back when these funds are released for offices. Now, it is not clear whether workers would want to spend their money to buy all these physical needs under monetization regime since it is now consolidated to the salary to almost become the basic salary. It is not also clear how monetization policy will lead to improved welfare condition of the workers through the provision of all the monetized needs from their new salary scale, judging from the impact of Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) on workers.</p> <p>In essence, workers commitment to their jobs and their efforts are often not addressed properly, creating room for false claims, agitations and labour conflicts.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study examines monetization of fringe benefits and commitment of workers. The specific objectives are:</p> <p>1.       To examine the effect of fringe benefits on workers’ income.</p> <p>2.       To find out how the fringe benefits have helped in improving workers’ job satisfaction.</p> <p>3.       To investigate the effects of fringe benefits on employees job satisfaction.</p> <p>4.       To find out the management attitude to the welfare of the workers.</p> <p>5.       To examine the impact of employees’ participation in decision making in an organization.</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>Three questions are posed in order to explore the problem:</p> <p>1.                 Is there any relationship between fringe benefits and employees’ job satisfaction?</p> <p>2.                 Do fringe benefits and rewards have a strong influence on workers performance?</p> <p>3.                 Does participation of employees’ in decision making in an organization motivate an employee?</p> <p>4.                 Does fringe benefits helps achieve or accomplish an organization’s goals or otherwise? </p> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>1.                             Ho:   Fringe benefits and reward do not have any strong influence on employee job performance.</p> <p>H1:    Fringe benefits and reward have strong influence on employee’s job performance.</p> <p>2.                             Ho:   Fringe benefits and reward does not contribute to increase job satisfaction.</p> <p>H1:    Fringe benefits and reward contribute to increase job satisfaction.</p> <p>3.                             Ho:   The participation of an employee in decision making in an organization does not motivate the employee to work hard.</p> <p>H1:    The participation of employee in decision-making in an organization motivates the employees to work hard.</p> <p><strong>1.6     SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study therefore, focuses on the impact of fringe benefits on workers and how the exercise has increased the morale/performance of workers in their workplaces.</p> <p>The scope of this study is restricted to Nigerian Port Authority.  The study will see workers performance on employee’s job satisfaction: while carrying out this research, the researcher was constrained by some factors.  The time schedule for the study was not enough to really study the impact of performance management on employee’s productivity.  Also, the available materials and financial resources were limited to carry out the research.  Also, the distribution of questionnaire and collection, coupled, with the energy it required also served as constrained to this study.</p> <p>It is believed that these limitations will not, in any way, reduce the quality of the study but will, however, provide an impetus for further research.</p> <p><strong>1.7     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of this study is channeled toward realizing the effects of fringe benefits on employees’ job satisfaction. Fringe benefits are significant and positive determinants of job satisfaction. It is equally important in assisting organizations to examine the various determinants on job satisfaction. Also, it assists the management to have positive attitude to the welfare of other workers.</p> <p>The study will also help to appreciate employees in Nigerian Port Authority who are doing better in their work.</p> <p><strong>1.8     DEFINITIONS OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Job satisfaction</strong> describes how content an individual is with his or her job. It is a measure of how the conditions of service of a company meet or surpass employees’ expectation.</p> <p><strong>Motivation: </strong>This is the willingness to extent high levels of effort to reach organizational goals, conditioned by the efforts ability to satisfy some individual needs.</p> <p><strong>Productivity: </strong>Productivity represents the output of goods and services, which can be obtained from a given input of employee. It is the rate at which a company produces goods or services in relation to the amount of materials and number of employees available.</p> <p><strong>Development</strong>: This is the process of according learning to an employee in order to enable him/her acquire more skills on the job.</p> <p><strong>Employee</strong>: Individuals or persons who are into a paid employment or job. They are the human factors of production. They are agents of employers engaged by same for the purpose of attaining employers/organizational goals.</p> <p><strong>1.9     ORGANIZATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Chapter one is the introductory part of this project work. Chapter two contains Literature Review. Chapter Three - research methodology deals with data collection, the type of sampling techniques.  Also, it reveals if data to be collected are primary or secondary or both which are useful in the study.  For the research, it is both primary and secondary sources of data.

The purpose of this research work is to know the impact of wages and salaries administration on the staff of Sona Breweries Nigeria Plc. The aim of wages and salaries administration program of Sona Breweries is to improve the quality of productivity and to prepare employee for greater organisation productivity, for without wages and salaries administration personnel, an organization will find it difficult, to achieve its objectives or organizational goals. This is because of the immense role played by manpower and its plausible impact on the efficiency of the organization.</p> <p>Three research working hypothesis were formulated by the study researcher in order to avoid deviation from the study. These are centered on the impact of wages and salaries administration on employee productivity in private organization. The use of questionnaire and personal interview are analyzed on different table, using percentage where appropriate. The data collected were analyzed and the hypothesis tested. The finding summary, recommendation including conclusion is based upon the study that were made.    </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Wages and salaries administration is part of the total compensation packages of any organization (Public or Private Sector)</p> <p>Wages and salaries are to attract, hold and motivate employee to put in their best. To ensure the cooperation of employees on a continuing basis. To make sure the right type of employees are attracted to the organization, to help employees maintain a reasonable standard of living. It helps reduce employee turnover.</p> <p>Incentive scheme involve paying an employee a bridge that reflects his productivity on contribution to the organization. Equity demands that what ‘A’ get in relation to ‘B” must be justifiable in terms of the productivity of ‘B’ to the same organization.</p> <p>The ultimate purpose of incentive payment system is to enhance productivity, thus each incentive payment system used must be justifiable in terms of motivating employee to higher productivity.</p> <p>In the private sector i.e SONA Breweries Nigeria Plc review of wages and salaries are done at regular interval through negotiation between the management and the employees representatives. Also, salaries are promptly paid to employees. Again, the payment of double increment and productivity bonus. Other wise known as the 13th month pay is also a common practice in the private sector.</p> <p>If the total productivity of a country is very high, the tendency is that wages and salaries will be high also. And it continues to be adjusted in accordance with the trend of the productivity, for example the Udoji Commission awarded increased wages to workers, in 1974 became through the commission’s study of the Nigeria economy, it saw an increase in productivity level. During job evaluation, jobs are graded according to relative amount of skills, effort, mental alertness, education, purposes. An engineer in a company is paid more than the technicians. There should be equal pay for equal work.</p> <p>Intrinsic rewards are contained in the attributes of the job itself in terms of the task, duties, and characteristic of the job as contained generally in the job description. Extrinsic rewards refers to the financial compensation, i.e monetary attached to the job.</p> <p>Infact, wages and salaries administration determines, or influences productivity in any organization. What is wages and salaries administration? What roles does wages and salaries administration play in productivity? Why should employees/workers be motivated? Are there incentives in a private sector like SONA Breweries Nigeria Plc. These are some of the relevant issues addressed in this study.</p> <p><strong>1.1   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM  </strong></p> <p>Wages and Salaries administration aspect, which is the most vital in achieving productivity of the organization. This is the major problem facing most organization and which has consequently deprived them of achieving efficient and effective wages and salaries administration, this cannot be over emphasized because it will help to improve employee productivity, the efficiency and morals of the firms their-by leading to the organization effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY   </strong></p> <p>1.        To identify the organization policies, objectives and procedures of wages and salaries.</p> <p>2.        To evaluate the impact of wages and salaries administration as a tool for attaining organization productivity.</p> <p>3.        To determine the effect of wages and salaries administration in the private sector administration in the private sector and the employee performance with particular reference.</p> <p>4.        To ascertain the effectiveness of wages and salaries administration.</p> <p>5.        To evaluate the impact of wages and salaries administration as a tools for motivating, promoting, training, and staff development in order to enhance employee productivity.</p> <p>6.        To find out how wages and salaries can contributes to improve employee productivity in their organization.</p> <p><strong>1.3   RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>From the problem identified, the following hypothetical statements are</p> <p>formed, and will be tested to ascertain the level of correlation between the hypothetical statement and research findings.</p> <p>1.          Ho: There is no significant difference between the hypothetical statement and research findings.</p> <p>2.          Hi:    There is significant difference between hypothetical statement and research findings.</p> <p>3.          Ho:   There are no significant differences between salaries and wages administration and employees productivity.</p> <p>4.          Hi:    There are significant differences between salaries and wages administration and employees productivity.</p> <p>5.          Ho:   There is no significant difference between staff training, development and employee productivity.</p> <p>6.          Hi:    There is significant difference between staff training, development and employee productivity.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>A.  To what extent is the motivation influence on employee productivity?   </p> <p>B.  Is there and significant difference between wages and salaries administration and employee productivity?</p> <p>C.  Does training and staff development have any correlation Impact on employee Productivity?</p> <p>D. To what extent has wages and salaries and other incentives have impact on organization efficiency?</p> <p><strong>1.4   METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The method of collecting data in this work is through accessible textbook in libraries, SONA Breweries Nigeria Plc, House Journals Newspapers, Magazines, a questionnaire which was administered directly on the staff of the SONA Breweries Nigeria Plc department, Direct Personal Interviews, Indirect Oral Interviews, Mailed Questionnaire Method, e.t.c. The method of data collection adopted by the researcher is satisfied random sampling technique. The reason is that it is applicable where we have hiterogenous population (i.e population with distinct characteristics).</p> <p><strong>1.5   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the study, effort shall be made to identify the remote and immediate causes of administration of wages and salaries on employee productivity in a private organization. In order words, the study shall be limited to the issues in objectives of the study then to examine the wages by which private sectors administers wages and salaries being paid to employees in their organization or establishment.</p> <p><strong>1.5   LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research study focuses on the impact of wages and salaries administration on employee productivity with a case study of SONA Breweries Nigeria Plc, Km 38, Lagos Abeokuta Expressway, Sango-Ota, Ogun State. The researcher was faced with some problems in the course of carrying out the study.</p> <p>The first problem encounter was financial problem and secondly, time factor, the research, was carried out along side with academic works and other day-to-day activities. Thirdly, there was no enough co-operation from the respondent as some of then felt reluctantion answering most of the questions being asked by them.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of this study therefore, is that it explores ways in which maximum productivity or efficiency through adequate, motivation of workers can be assured within an organization, say a private sector like the SONA Breweries Nigeria Plc. Within all organizations the utilization of labour towards the accomplishment of organizational goals is emphasized. Thus in bureaucratic organizations, the enhancement of wages and salaries is vital to the employees effectiveness and efficiency.</p> <p>The research project affords an opportunity of going into an in-depth knowledge as to how the human and technical element can be managed towards improved or higher wages and salaries.</p> <p>The study is also significant in the sense that it suggest ways, if necessary on how to enhances, improved wages and salaries. In the SONA Breweries Nigeria Plc.    </p> <p><strong>1.7   CHAPTERIZATION</strong></p> <p>The researcher highlights the needs to ensure efficiency in everything, doing the right thing at the right time. The reason of the research work is, in order for employee or workers to perform better or to inspired good administration of wages and salaries must be used to enhance organizational productivity.  </p> <p>Good administration of wages and salaries are very important in any establishment for the achievement of overall organization aims and objectives within a very short period of time, so it is very difficult to divorce it.</p> <p><strong>1.8   DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>WAGES: </strong>It can be described as compensation being paid to employee on hourly basis.</p> <p><strong>SALARIES:</strong> This is referred to as compensation being paid to employee on monthly basis.</p> <p><strong>ADMINISTRATION: </strong>It may be though as planning, organizing and controlling of the activities of a company in relation to the direct and indirect  payment being paid to employees for the work they performs or the services they render.</p> <p>Adams (1913) defines administration as the capability to co-ordinate many, and often conflicting, social energies in a single organization in an orderly manner such that they can operate in Unity.</p> <p><strong>EMPLOYEE: </strong>This is referred to as a person who works in a company in return for a wages and salaries.</p> <p><strong>PRODUCTIVITY: </strong>This rate at which works in a company or country produces goods and the amount produced with how much time work or money is needed to produce them.</p> <p>According to Peter Drunker Productivity can be defined as that balance between all factors of production that would give a great output using the smallest or least effect.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>Ogundele, O.J.K (2004): Comparative Management and Administrative.</p> <p>Akanji, R.

The study revealed that interaction in workplace boost performance. The organisation's welfare system should be highly improved. Workers appreciate the welfare package they get from their employers. Management should pay attention to the basic needs of their employees.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Labour in general, could be defined as the human efforts of any kind, manual or mental, skilled or unskilled, scientific or artistic. It is the human knowledge transformed into activity that gives utilities or values to all commodities.</p> <p>It is a man who cultivates land whether he uses hoe or tractor. It is the same man who sows, weed, harvest, process, stores and sell. Every single endeavour here on earth has man's finger print. All these human efforts which are vital to production are called LABOUR. The productivity of a worker would be a function of the amount of effort a man can put forward in a given period of time and skill. When we talk of productivity, we mean the increased efficiency and the rate of which goods are produced, while labour is the bodily and mental work.</p> <p>Welfare services are so enormous and numerous. This can be defined as the added advantage or support given to the workers by the employer or the company at large. This can be described as the Canteen Services, Financial Support, Educational Financial Support, Transport Facilities, Medical Facilities, Maternity Benefits, Gratuity Scheme, Employment Provident Fund, Compensation Scheme, Recreational Benefits, etc.</p> <p>The Coinage of the term Industrial Relation is originally traceable to the historical circumstances of British industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe. It should be remembered that the industrial revolution was accompanied by a breakdown of the manorial system and serfdom, i.e. person client relationship that was tied to the tradition land ownership in the form of the employment contract between the workers and the employer. Workers exploitation through a regime of oppressive or horrifying wages: poor organization climate, poor quality of working life. The inherent profit motivation of capitalist, employers of their surrogates (e.g. manager) on the other hand and primary reward and job satisfaction interest if ranks and file employees.</p> <p>Industrial relation is the study of employment relationship that is between workers and management or employer. Here are some of their definitions by different authors:-</p> <p><strong>Beatrice Webb (1890): </strong>defines industrial relation as whole web of human interaction at work which is predicted upon and arise out of employment contact.</p> <p><strong>UBEKU (1982): </strong>defines industrial relation as a resolution of industrial conflicts.</p> <p><strong>HYMAN (1975): </strong>opines that industrial relation as a process of control over work relation and among their process, those involving works organization and of a particular concern.</p> <p>When we talk of economic depression, it means a situation whereby the employment phase falls, economic meltdown, but the rate of fall gradually decreases until the circle through is reached. Economic depression of a country is the devaluation of currency. High level of unemployment rate in any economy is a state or period of economic depression.</p> <p>The value of labour to an employer varies with the marginal productivity of the worker. This is the additional contribution which the last worker makes to the employer's output. Marginal productivity of labour must be equal to the wages rate if the product rises, all other things being equal and employer of labour will be able to employ more labour. The marginal productivity of labour will be affected by the following factors:-</p> <p>a)                 The natural ability of labourer's efficiency and training.</p> <p>b)              The equipment with which the worker works will also be determined by the marginal productivity of labour, where modern and suitable equipment are used, labour is likely to have a high marginal productivity</p> <p>c)               The conditions of demand for the product which labour produces will also affect marginal productivity of labour. If the demand for the product increases, the employer will employ more labour force adding more to earnings and loss of production. This will affect the overall demand for labour and its marginal productivity.</p> <p>When we talk of economic depression, it means a situation whereby the employment phase fall, but the rates of fall gradually decrease until the circle through is reached. Unemployment in a country is a situation whereby the mentally and physically fit men and women can't get a job to do. Any responsible government must combat the problem seriously. Another main cause of economic depression of a country is the devaluation of the currency. By this we mean exchange value of the country currency is reduced to a lower rate.</p> <p>By Yesufu (1984); who view industrial relation (R) as the total sum of labour relation (LR) and personnel relations (PR), illustrating with arithmetic model of IR = LR + PR developed by Seward authors. In more details, labour relation (LR) defines the relationship between labour or (trade union organisation) and management and individual employees. Also, Yesufu located the various concepts of \"employee relations, labour relation and industrial relation\". Even when used interchangeably within the central theme of employment.</p> <p>J.T DUNLOP (1958) defines industrial relations as \"web rules\" that actors in the sphere of employment working together Industrial relations as an academic in Nigeria is relatively young and developing. This has been reflected in the status of organized literature on the subjects' matter, which has been expanding but relatively scarce in respect of the key area including the labour economics aspect.</p> <p>The whole idea of this research bothers on the concept of \"Welfare Scheme of the Industrial Labour Force\" which is conceptualized as the right of every workforce for freedom to some rights of social amenities, health and safety outfits and other facilities in an industrial sociological factory or company.</p> <p>The system concept of industrial relations is credited to john Dunlop who explains that a system of industrial relations is comprised of four main attributes. These are: major actors, web of rules, contexts and ideology. The Major actors in a typical system of industrial relations are recognized as: workers and their organizations. (E.g. trade unions), managers or employers and their association, government and their agencies. The \"web of rules\" is essentially referenced to the semblance of work rules that are formulated and applied for the moderation of inter­actor behaviour in line with the demands of conformity and harmony in the workplace. The \"context\" refers to the various situation and environments of employment that may often produce different patterns of systems that influence the mode of operation of a specific work organisation and bind together a system of industrial relations</p> <p>The welfare services includes: canteen services, housing facilities ,educational financial support, death benefits, recreational benefits, transport facilities, provision of creches, bonus benefits, medical facilities, gratuity scheme, maternity benefit, employee provident fund and compensation scheme.</p> <p>I am introducing GREIF NIGERIA PLC. As my case study. A leading manufacturing company in metal drums and plastic containers. The company is also into marketing of metal drums and plastic containers.</p> <p>The company's overseas branches are at Brazil and South Africa.</p> <p><strong>Mission Statement-</strong> To provide the packaging that gives the ultimate value to our customers and to the best packaging company in the world, working in true partnership with our customers, our suppliers and among ourselves.</p> <p>GRIEF NIGERIA PLC. Is building upon its rich history as a special place to work. They operate between a culture of integrity, character and respect.

This is due to the fact that social interaction and better labour welfare increases productivity and high level of performance at work. This continuity on the long run brings better result to the organization and this boosts the economy. Absence of the labour welfare and industrial relations would reduce performance of the worker and its effect is widely felt in the economy. This could bring about corruption, theft, fraud and the widely feared in the economy \"Armed Robbers\"</p> <p><strong>1.4      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study seeks:</p> <p>(a)              To show the importance of labour welfare and industrial relations.</p> <p>(b)             To show that lack of this benefits and social interaction could lead to dissatisfaction and decreased productivity.</p> <p>(c)              To examine the impact of labour welfare and industrial relations on the performance of the workers in GRIEF NIGERIA PlC.</p> <p>(d)             To highlight some labour welfare for workers in organisations.</p> <p>(e)              To highlight alternative industrial relations in organisations.</p> <p>(f)               To make recommendation as appropriate.</p> <p><strong>1.5      SCOPES AND LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is focused on GRIEF NIGERIA PLC. and is limited to the staff of the organisation.</p> <p>Our choice of GRIEF NIGERIA PLC.

The research adopted survey research design. Data were gathered through primary source with the aid of a well-structured questionnaire. Simple random sampling technique was adopted in the selection of sample, this was used to eliminate biasness in the selection process of the respondents.</p> <p>Data garnered were presented on table using percentage and the formulated hypotheses were analysed with the used of Chi-square statistical method. The result of the analysis shows that there is significant relationship between deadlines and stress. Also, there is significant relationship between working conditions and productivity of employees. And there is significant relationship between job insecurity and stress.</p> <p>Based on the conclusion of the analysis recommendations were proffered to the staff and management of Neimenth International Pharmaceuticals Plc.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Productivity refers to the measure of efficiency of a given input in producing a given output. Productivity improvement in the large society or organization has of recent generated much attention and concern. The success of failure of failure of an organization largely depend on its level of productivity which may be high or low depending on several factor (Irukwu, 2001).</p> <p>Schular (1981), defined stress as  “ dynamic condition in which an individual is confronted with an opportunity, constraint or  demand related to what he or she desires and for which the outcome is perceived to be both certain and important.</p> <p>The inter-relationship between the mind and the body is well known as well as the link between stress and the human health. It is pertinent to know that not all stress can be both negative and positive and have both effects is bad. Stress can be both negative and positive and have both effects respectively. Infact stress is essential for human survival. A minimum amount of stress does not discriminate by sex, age or class. It affects everyone in all classes of the society.</p> <p>People in organizations experience a lot of demand and pressure. These demand and pressure are often conflicting. Pressure emerges everyday in the course of work which causes a lot of stress on people. It is therefore necessary to understand the nature of stress, how people respond to it, its consequences and how control or manage it.</p> <p>According to Oharei and Odejide, 1991 Stress can be seen as “the biological response to events that threatens to overwhelm the individual capacity to cope satisfactorily in the environment.  It can also be seen that there is a potential for stress when an environment is perceived as presenting a demand that threatens to exceed the person’s capabilities and resources for meeting it under conditions here he expected a substantial differential in the regards and cost from meeting the demand versus not meeting it.  This is to say that the causes of stress can be found not only within the environment but also within the individual.  In the addition, the interaction of both can cause stress. </p> <p>Green etal, (1990), defined psychological stress as a “particular relationship between a person and the environment that is appraised or perceived by the person as taking exceeding his or her resources and endangering his or her well-being.  The perception of stress is the part to whether the person or individual experiences stress or not.  This is the treason why what an individual considers as stress may not be stress to the other person.</p> <p>Cooper and Marshal (1976), defined occupational stress as negative environmental factors or stress associated with a particular job.  Stress is very common in the workplace than in other aspect of life.  However, it is pertinent to know that the work environment can pose as a danger to the health and well being or workers.  Satter et al, 1990 stated that “the work environment is a threat or risk factor with regards to the physical health and safety of workers.   Occupational stress may result due to lack of co-operation or harmony between a worker and his work environment.  The work environment an individual is exposed to have a relative effect on his health, social and psychological needs and also to enhance the quality of life of such a person.</p> <p>The adverse effects of occupational stress can lead to either Behavioural, Psychological or even semantic problems.  Responses to such behaviour could be insomnia, dizziness, fatigue, headache, frustration, anger, fear, aggression, hyperactivity etc.  Other possible response of long term stress could be arthritis, ulcer, and constipation, susceptibility to disease or infection, backaches, heart problems, appetite loss, indigestion, increased blood pressure.  These physical disorders would culminate in some familiar emotional problems such as marital strife, sexual problems, excessive drinking, and eating junk food instead of meals.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier the anxiety on the part of workers to meet up with expectations or target put them under so much pressure which will eventually lead to stress and consequently inadequate performance.  Several other factors causes occupational stress such as work overload, Role conflict Deadlines, Poor working conditions, it is however important for individuals to know about personal stress control or management and also 5the organization to put in place mechanism for organizational stress management.</p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>This research work is necessary now than every considering the rate of environmental hazards that employees are exposed to daily, the condition of work, the quality of food people consume, due to longer hours at work which over expose them to junk foods.</p> <p>Hence, the study will focus on occupational stress can be controlled and managed in Neimeth Pharmaceuticals Plc.  As it is recorded to be a determinant of occupational performance in productivity thereby causing disturbances at work. </p> <p>Furthermore, problems such as failure of companies in providing health Insurance scheme for their workforce, high rate of job insecurity, the setting of unrealistic deadlines, improper working conditions and absence of counseling department in organizations. </p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will give explanation to the impact of occupational stress on workers performance and how it can be managed.  The objectives of the study will be the following:</p> <p>·        The study will reveal the causes of occupational stress and its impact on workers performance.</p> <p>·        Investigate if there is provision for medical insurance policy for every worker.</p> <p>·        Ascertain whether realistic deadlines are being set and if targets are met.</p> <p>·        Find out if there is proper working condition available to workers and if counseling is readily available to them</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this research work, these are the questions:</p> <p>·        Do you think deadlines can be linked to stress?</p> <p>·        Does working conditions have a role to play in stress?</p> <p>·        Do you think job insecurity is not one of the factors that cause stress?</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>RESEARCH

manpower development for the successful operation and maintenance of civil aviation system is a fast paced, competitive industry cannot be over-emphasized.</p> <p>Training has an important role to play in achieving the aim and objectives of any organization. It brings about changes in knowledge, skills and attitude.  It ensures that skilled managers are available to plan effectively this delivery of high quality service.</p> <p>Organizations that neither train nor develop their staff are likely to face the problems of loss of competitiveness as well as the danger of extinction in this millennium. The dynamism and changes in the environments in which organizations operate today have become irrelevant discontinuous, spasmodic nature and sheer growth of knowledge especially in information technology make the continuous upgrading of the critical skills and capabilities of employees a major imperative for human resources management.</p> <p>Training is concerned with the acquisition of a body of knowledge and skills which can be applied to reading, writing and aptitude verbal and quantitative. Patrick (2000).</p> <p>The importance of training is a means of productivity cannot be over stressed due to rapid changes in technology the pattern of training has been concerned as a continuous exercise throughout one’s working life. It is necessary that from time to time, training needs of a job or group of jobs be identified so as to determine the best way such needs can be met.</p> <p>Simbo (2002) define training as “an organized procedure by which people learn knowledge or skills for a definite purpose”.  It is a process for equipping the employees with specific skills e.g. technical skills like plumbing, electrical wiring, repairing artistic skills, clerical performances and overall efficiency.  Training refers to the organized activity aimed at imparting information or instructions to improve the recipients performance or to help him attain a repaired level of knowledge or skill.  Training is developed as learning that is provided in order to improve performance on the present job performance is improved by helping the learners to master a new or established technology.  The technology may be a piece of heavy machinery, computer a procedure for creating a product.  Training according to Oxford Advanced Learner Dictionary is the process of preparing somebody or being prepared for a job.  Training is the action of teaching a personal skill.  Training defined by Merriam Webster Dictionary is the act, process or method of one that trains. Training refers to the acquisition of knowledge skills and competencies as a result of the teaching of vocational on practical skills and knowledge that relate to specific useful competencies. It forms the core of apprenticeship and provide the backbone of contents at institutes of technology also known as technical colleges or polytechnics. In addition to the basic training required for a trade, occupation or profession, observers of the labour market who recognized as of 2008 the need is continue training beyond initial qualifications to maintain, upgrade land update skills throughout.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of training:</strong> The quality of employees and their development through training and education are major factors in determining long-term profitability of a small business.  If you line and keep good employees, it is a good policy to invest in the development of their skills, so they can increase their productivity. Training for most organization is considered for new employees help them adjust to rapidly changing jobs requirements. Purpose of training which helps to emphasize the growth and development of personnel include creating a pool of reading materials and making available adequate replacements for personnel who learn or move up in the organizations enhancing the company’s ability to adapt and use advances in technology because of a sufficiently knowledge staff.  Building a more efficient, effective and highly motivated team which enhances the company’s competitive position and improves employee morals.  Ensuring adequate human resources for expansion into new programmes is another purpose of training.  Research has shown specific benefit that a small business receives from training and developing its workers.  These include increased productivity educated employee turnover, increased efficiency resulting in financial gains and increased need for supervision sense of self worth, dignity and well being as they become more valuable to the firm and society.  Generally, they will receive greater share of the material gains that result from their increased productivity.  These factors give them a sense of satisfaction through achievements of personnel and company goals.  </p> <p>Impact of technology in training: Impact of technology in training to grasp the impact that technology is creating in training society most consider how technology has revolutionized the aviation industry in barely five years, electronic technology has dramatically penetrate into the aviation industry. The entire society can reflected on how some aspect of the new information age is changing their job in the air industry.  As the nation enters into the new millennium the most fundamental shift will reflect redefinition of training itself. To maintain a key talent, remain competitive and ensure long-term profitability organizations are making dramatic changes in the way. They develop the knowledge and skills of their workforce.  Training as something provided for employees will be replaced by learning that employees initiate themselves.  New skills and knowledge are required in training.  There is greater efficiency and greater productivity in training; we live in a competitive economy where new services required.  In Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria that training is becoming ultimate FAAN is not committed. Training and retraining is viral in order to give maximum comfort to air commuters.</p> <p>Types of courses and benefits of Training: There are variety of courses for the workers of the aviation industry some courses take place in Nigeria while others take place oversees. Women in Aviation training (USA)</p> <p>AC side training (FAAN)</p> <p>Revalidation training</p> <p>Pilot training (NCAT)</p> <p>The benefits are</p> <p>a.    Training keep employees motivated</p> <p>b.   Training prevent boredom with new skills and knowledge</p> <p>c.    It demonstrates to the employee that they are valuable enough for the employer to invest in their development.</p> <p>d.   Training creates positive attitudes through clarifying the behaviours and attitudes that are expected from the employee.</p> <p>e.    Training some organization money, if it helps the employee to become efficient.</p> <p>The above stated, perhaps explains why the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) recognized that it has to build rapidly the human capacity of managing it operations effectively and efficiency.</p> <p>Consequently, manpower development through training was accorded high priority when the training department of the authority was established as a separate entity from the personnel department as early is 1979 about a year after the take off of the authority. Though training has been on, it had not been without problems (Odugbem 2002).</p> <p><strong>Factors that Influences Training</strong>: When a business chooses to train their workers, there are many factors that affect the training process. Top management needs to have a “buy-in” and commitment to the training and development. Training needs to be part of the corporate culture.  If employees feel they are not supported by their management while training, they may not give the attention and commitment that the training deserves.  Training needs to be tied to business strategy and objectives and needs to be tied to business strategy and objectives and needs to be linked to bottom line results. Workers want their organization to do well.  Employees that contribute to the bottom line especially are less likely off during tough times.  Organizational environments are “feed back” they stress continuous improvement promote risk taking and afford opportunities to learn from success and failures of decisions.  Without this freedom of allowing changes to the status quo workers are not able to use the training that they have acquired. Training is more than classroom time and it can be influenced by (a) intrinsic motivator (b) extrinsic motivator.</p> <p>Purkey and Stanley (1991) described intrinsic motivation as a motivation to engage in activities that enhance or maintain a person’s self concept. Fredrick (1923-2000) posits that some factors relate to one’s job satisfaction: that certain factors lead to job satisfaction while others lead to dissatisfaction. These factors that include work itself, responsibility and advancement. This factors give rise to satisfaction motivator i.e with its intrinsic challenge it concentrated on satisfaction at work intrinsic is what one enjoy doing.</p> <p><strong>Extrinsic Motivation:</strong> An extrinsically motivated person will work on a task even when they have little interest in it because of the anticipated satisfaction they will get from some reward. The reward can be something as minor as smiley face to something major like frame or future. </p> <p>Douglas McGregor (1906-1964) posits that the average person dislike work and will avoid it.  the average person prefers to be directed tries to avoid responsibility and wants security. Most people must be forced with the threat of punishment to work towards organisatonal objectives. The Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) is a transport industry founded in 1935 with its headquarters at the Muritala Mohammed International Airport Ikeja, Lagos State is a service organization statutorily changes to manage all commercial airports in Nigeria and provide service to both passengers and airlines. FAAN is a parastatal of government which is under the auspices of the Federal Ministry of Aviation. Her vision and mission are: to be amongst the best airport groups in the world and to develop profitably manage customer centric airports facilities for safe secure and efficient carriage of passengers and goods of world class standards.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The primary aim of this study is to establish whether effective employee training can enhance productivity, specifically the study will try it.</p> <p>a.      Ascertain the importance which the management of FAAN attaches to training and development as a means of improving knowledge, skills and behaviour of its staff.</p> <p>b.     Find out whether such training programmes actually assisted staff productivity.</p> <p>c.      Find out whether courses undertaken are geared towards improving service delivery by FAAN manpower.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.     What kind of training and development programmes is available to employee in FAAN?</p> <p>2.     How effective are the training programme from both the employee and management perspective?</p> <p>3.     What is the relationship between training availability, training relevant and productivity in FAAN?</p> <p>4.     What extent have proper and effective training programmes minimize aviation problems?</p> <p>5.     Is it inadequacy of training that is responsible for employee poor performance in FAAN?</p> <p><strong>Research Hypothesis   </strong></p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 1</strong></p> <p>Effective training of employees cannot lead to increased performance and productivity.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2</strong></p> <p>Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria does not provide adequate training and development for its staff</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 3</strong></p> <p>Proper and effective training programme cannot minimize productivity problems. </p> <p><strong>Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>The research was carried out at the headquarters of Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) in Lagos Muritala Mohammed International Airport Lagos.  The researcher also will administer middle staff, supervisors and clerical officers. Finally, the research will also be extended to Human Resource and FAAN Training Department to collect relevant information.</p> <p><strong>Justification of the study</strong></p> <p>This study is very significantly in that it will throw more light on how effective employee training can be used to increase the productivity level in the organization.</p> <p><strong>Limitation of the study</strong></p> <p>The findings of this study will have limited application in view of the fact that the research is not going to cover all the airports and other formations of FAAN.  Since one major source of information is questionnaire, the resources may be blow out of proportion and may affect the reliability of such information.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Training is an essential ingredient in the productivity of an organization and when it concerns the aviation industry that is geared towards the safety of human lives and goods. The importance of training cannot be overemphasized provision of quality services to customers is paramount therefore training and retraining of employees need to be a subject of great concern to researchers and the generality of the populace.</p> <p>It is against this that this research work is set to investigate if proper and adequate training programem are undertaken to make employees to be on top of providing quality service to the people.</p> <p>The responsibilities of FAAN are:</p> <p>a.    Development and maintenance of airports with the Nigeria territory.</p> <p>b.   Provide safe environment under which passenger and goods would be carried by air.</p> <p>c.    Provide accommodation and other facilities for effective handling of passengers and freight.</p> <p>d.   Development and provision of facilities for surface transport at Airports.</p> <p>An organization saddled with the above responsibilities cannot but train her employees to provide efficient and effective services to customers.  The authority established a training centre for the training development of her staff nationwide.  It is therefore not out of place to look at the training programme offered to employees to improve their skills, knowledge, behaviour in order to increase their productivity.</p> <p><strong>Operational definition of Term</strong></p> <p><strong>Employee:</strong> Employee is a person who is hired to provide services to a company on a regular basis in exchange for compensation and who does not provide these services as part of an independent business.  An employee is a person working for another person or a business firm for pay.</p> <p>An employee is a person employed for wages or salary especially at non executive level.</p> <p>An employee is a person who laws hired by an employer to do a specific job.</p> <p><strong>Training:</strong> Training is an acquisition of knowledge, skill and competencies as a result of the teaching of vocational or practical skills and knowledge that relate to specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one’s capability, capability and performance. it forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology.</p> <p>In addition to the basic training require for a trade, occupation or profession, observers of the labour market who recognize as of 2008 the need to continue training beyond initial qualifications to maintain upgrade and update skills throughout working life people within many professions and occupation may refer to this sort of training as professional development. Training is also the action of teaching a person or animal a particular skill or type of behaviour. Training is an educational process.  </p> <p><strong>Productivity:</strong> Productivity is a measure of the efficiency of production. Productivity is a ratio of production output to what is required to produce it (input) the measure of productivity is defined as a total output per one unit of total output.  Productivity is the state of quality of producing something.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>Ajakare, J.B.

It deals with people at work and their relationship within the working environment. This study, the effect of human resource management strategy on organisation performance (a case study of Nestle Nigeria Plc). The purpose of this study is to set out the impact of a human resource management strategy on the individual performance, organisation commitment and job satisfaction level of human resources professional, when human resources function is vertically aligned with the mission and objective of the organisation and horizontally integrated with other organizational function. The humans’ resources approach further deals with the employee’s entire contractual relationship with it. It is also involved with values and aims not only to obtain employees’ consent to work, but their commitment to management goals. Organisations are increasingly looking at human resources as a unique asset that can provide sustained competitive advantage. The change in the business environment with increasing globalization, changing demographics of the work force increased focus on profitability through growth technical change. A total population of sixty (60) potential respondents was considered in the admin department of Nestle Nigeria Plc. out of which a sample of fifty (50) were chosen and 50 questionnaires were administered. All the fifty (50) were returned fully filled by the respondent. This represent a 100% response rate by the respondent sequel to the data analysis, the researcher was able to find out that human resources is the best resources an organisation can have to improved organizational performance.   </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1    <strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Strategy was first used in England in (1956) derive from the Greek word strategies which derives from two word; stratus (Army) and Agein (Ancient Greek for leading). Strategies referred to a military commander during the age of Athenian Democracy.</p> <p>A strategy is a long term plan of action designed to achieve a particular goal. Strategy is also basically concerned with the long term direction and scope of an organization; it is also crucially concerned with how the organization positions itself with regards to the environment and to the competitors in particular. It’s concerned with establishing competitive advantage, ideally sustainable overtime, not by technical maneuvering, but by taking an overall long term perspective.</p> <p>Strategy management is the ongoing process of specifying the organization objective, developing plan to achieve these objective and allocating resources to implement the policies and plan to achieve the organizations objective.</p> <p>Human resource management refers to a set of people oriented functions or activities that involve the effective acquisition, use and the maintenance of human resources within an organization.</p> <p>However, strategic human resource management (SHRM) is a strategic approach to manage human resources of an organization compared with the traditional human resource management. Practices strategic human resource management is considered a relatively \"new concept\" despite its continuous development over the past two decades. Although there is still no consensus on an exact definition of based and broad agreement reached on its basic function which involves designing and implementing a set of internally consistent policies and practices that ensure that the human capital of a firm contributes to the achievement of its business objectives. Faulkner and Johnson (1992).</p> <p>Human resources management is concerned with the effective use of an organization’s human resources, it deals with people at work and their relationship within the working environment.</p> <p>The human resource approach further deal with the employers entire working life in the company, and not just their contractual relationship with it. It is also involved with value and aims not only to obtain employee’s consent to work, but their commitment to management goals.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>STATEMENTS OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Although, it is known that firms can gain sustainable competitive advantage through the strategic management of human resources, however, it remains unclear about the conditions under which a firm employs strategic human resource management so as to enhanced performance in the organization. More so, inspire of providing an initial explanation on the antecedent of human resources at the process by which these have impact on the organization is yet to be clear.</p> <p>In addition, possible interactions among these factors that may have impact on the performance of a firm will be examined. Most organizations do not have an effective human resources management practices and the design of a human resource system compatible with the firm strategy, which is imperative for successful implementation of business strategies. Also, most firm do not practice strategies human resources, do not respond to the external environment through a better employment of human resources, and since the strategy of firms is a reflection of its response to the competitive external changes, a human capital pool with a broad way of skills that are compatible with the corporate strategy is a catalyst for fulfilling the strategic goals through promoting behavoural utility among employees. However, the studies become pertinent to fill the gaps, mentioned and in order the mechanism to enhance organizational performance.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objectives of this study are to determine or investigate the impact of strategic human resources on Nestle Plc.</p> <p><em>The objectives of this research work will include the following:</em></p> <p>i.             To investigate the impact of strategic human resource management on organizational performance in Nigeria private sector such as Nestle Plc.</p> <p>ii.           To examine the types of strategy that is adopted in Nestle Plc.</p> <p>iii.          To assess the rationale behind strategic human resource management practices in Nestle Plc.</p> <p>iv.          To identify the problems and make possible suggestions of human resource strategic practices in the organization.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The research aimed at finding answers and explanation for the following pertinent questions:</p> <p>i.             What is the impact of strategic human resource management on organizational performance?</p> <p>ii.           How would strategic human resource management affect the performance and productivity of the organization?</p> <p>iii.          What are the rationales behind strategic human resource management practice in the Nestle Nigeria Plc?</p> <p>iv.          What are the major functional areas of strategic human resource practices?</p> <p>1.5    <strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>Hypothesis implies a conjectural statement or preposition about the relationship that exist between two variables in Nestle Nigeria Plc.</p> <p>Ho:     Denotes the null hypotheses while Hi: Denotes the alternative hypotheses.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis I</strong></p> <p>HO:    There is no significant relationship between strategic human resource management and organizational performance.</p> <p>Hi:     There is a significant relationship between strategic human resource management and organizational performance.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis II</strong></p> <p>HO:    Top management policies do not have a relationship on productivity of the organization.</p> <p>Hi:     Top management policies have a relationship on productivity of the organization.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis III</strong></p> <p>HO:    There is no significant relationship between strategic human resource management and achievement of competitive advantage.</p> <p>Hi:     There is a significant relationship between strategic human resources management and achievement of competitive advantage.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The findings of this study will no doubt raise the level of awareness of management concerned towards the implementation of proper strategic human resource management policies and programmed in Nestle Plc as well as the legitimate role of strategy in the world of business.</p> <p>1.7    <strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research will cover the impact of strategic human resource management on organizational performance; the research will focus on Nestle Plc at Agbara.

Every organization is human oriented, a factor without which the organization id reduced to nothing. Organization have their mission of being in existence and therefore could achieve these mission through the effort of “People” in the organization. Meanwhile, the extent to which human resource are properly managed determines the success of the organization. People are animated and have feelings. So management should manage and encourage them so that they will be committed and dedicated to the organization. It is based on this that study is aimed at finding out the relationship between good human resource management practice and the success of an organization. The study was conducted in Owerri using. Nigerian bottling company plants as a case study. Questionnaires were distributed to the staff of the company which helps the researchers in their analysis. The researchers applied of the data, the study concluded that people are life wire of the organization and the success depends on the quality of employees in the organization. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction    <br/>1.1    Background of the study    -<br/>1.2    Statement of the General Problem     <br/>1.3    Objective of the study    <br/>1.4    Significance of the study    <br/>1.5    Research Question    <br/>1.6    Scope of the study    -<br/>1.7    Limitation of the study    <br/>CHAPTER TWO- Literature Review<br/>2.0    Introduction    <br/>2.1    Definition of human resources management    <br/>2.1.1Differences between human resource management<br/> and manpower management    <br/>2.2    Significance of human resource management    -<br/>2.3    Aims of human resource management    <br/>2.4    process of human resource management    <br/>2.4.1 Resourcing strategy <br/>2.4.2 Scenario Management    <br/>2.4.3Estimating future human resource requirement<br/> management and business management<br/>2.4.4 Analysis demand and supply forecast    <br/>2.5    The relationship between human resource management and business management<br/>2.6    Methods and techniques of human <br/>resource management<br/>2.7    Pitfalls to avoid in human resource management    30<br/>2.8    The impact of human resource management <br/>on productivity in business organization     <br/>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1    Introduction    <br/>3.2    Research Design    <br/>3.3    Area of the study    <br/>3.4    Population of the study    <br/>3.5    Sample size and Sampling techniques    <br/>3.6    Instrument  for data collection    <br/>3.7    Validation of the instrument <br/>3.8    Reliability of the instrument<br/>3.9    methods of data collection<br/>3.10    methods of data analysis    -<br/>CHAPTER FOUR:    DATA PRESENTATION<br/>4.0    Introduction<br/>4.1    Characteristic of respondent    <br/>4.2    Presentations of data and analysis    <br/>4.3    Summary of findings    <br/>4.4    Discussion of findings    <br/>CHAPTER FIVE - Summary Of Findings,<br/> Conclusion Recommendation<br/>5.1    Summary <br/>5.2    Conclusion    <br/>5.3    Recommendation    <br/>    References    <br/>    Appendices<br/>  CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Human resources management is concerned with people oriented management. Organization do not exist in a vacuum, therefore they must need people acquiring their services, developing their skills, motivating them to high level of performance and ensuring that the key continue to maintain their commitment to the organization. This is a white fact business, education, health, social organization, it is pertinent to note that seeking, getting and keeping good people in the organization to the right position at the right time are indispensable to the success of every organization whether profit or non profit, public or private organization.<br/>These organization that are able to acquire, develop, stimulate and keep outstanding workers will be both effective and efficient. Those that are ineffective and efficient face the risk of stagnation or decline.<br/>        According to Graham and Bernett (1992:3) human resources management is concerned with the human side of the management of enterprises and employees relation with their firms. Its aim is to ensure that the employees of the company that is, its human resources are used in such a way that the employers obtains the greatest possible benefit from their abilities and the employees obtain both material and psychological reward from the organization. That is to say that there is a symbolic relationship between the employee and the organization. While the employee help the organization achieve it goals, the organization in other hand helps the employee to accomplish their needs and aspiration that made them to join the organization.<br/>        Robbins (1982:74) highlights that the survival of an organization requires competent manager and workers coordinating their efforts towards an ultimate end. Organization that are unsuccessful in getting such coordination of managers and workers will ultimately fail. Also for an organization to achieve its goals, it needs inputs as men, money, machines and material (the 4m). These inputs will lie idle if they are not coordinated by men. They could only yield effective result if they are handled in the right proportion by people.<br/>        Whether or not there will be a good return from a corporate investment if an operating division is largely determined by the quality of the human resources who are assigned to achieve the high rate of return. Therefore people represent one of the most valuable asset of the organization. If an organization is to develop its full potentials, the top managerial, commercial and technical skills must be termed as assets.<br/>        To examine effective human resources management more critically, Robbins (1982. 74) says that it is a process consisting of four functions.<br/>        The acquisition, development, motivation and maintenance of human resources.<br/>1.1   STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>        In this report, the effective human resources management as a key to the accomplishment of the organizational goals is to be investigated. The investigation/survey on the effective human resources management shows that organization is human oriented a factor without which an organization is reduced to nothing. It also enables it to complete its ascertainment on the likely problem that will occur on the process.<br/>        Employers are likely to encounter difficulties when dealing with staff in organization where some are undergraduate. In other to avoid this, organization should embark on efficient human resource management, job orientation exercise, good motivation techniques, training and development of staff, recruitment and selection method of employees should be free and fair so that appropriate employees will be employed and place in the right position which will lead to higher performance of employees.<br/>        There is also persistence problem of low productivity as a result of ineffective human resources management.   Organization have tired to upgrade their system of communication with staff so as to reduce this frequent problem. However, in spite of all these, the problem still persist.<br/>1.2   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>alarm they say does not blow without cause, since organizations are people oriented, hence the purpose of acquiring human services, developing their skills, motivating them and ensuring their commitments to their organization becomes an important instrument in achieving organization becomes an important in achieving organizational goals however, the objectives of the research are as follows:<br/>1)          To find out the relationship between good human resources management practices and the success (viability) of a firm.<br/>2)          To find out how the acquisition of human resources is carried out in Nigeria bottling company Owerri plant.<br/>3)          To access the extent to which human resources are developed in the organization.<br/>1.3   RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1)     What are the relationship between good human resources management practices and the success. Viability of a firm<br/>2)     How is the acquisitions of human resources carried out in Nigeria bottling company Owerri Plant. <br/>3)     How far has human resources developed in the organization.<br/>1.4   RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>        Some hypothesis will be tested to prove the validity of the relationship between the problems envisaged and the data to be collected. The null hypothesis is accompanied by the alternative hypothesis which is represented with III.<br/>1)          HO: Effective human resources management practice does not lead to the success or the achievement of organizational goals.<br/>HI: Effective human resources management practices leads to the success or the achievement of organizational goals.<br/>2)          HO: Effective human resources management practices do not lead to the increase in productivity of the organization.<br/>HI: Effective human resources management practice leads to the increase in productivity of the organization.<br/>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work is aimed at exposing the absolute effects or impact of effective human resources management to the accomplishment of organizational goals. Moreover, the workwill fulfill a number of significant roles while creating awareness to the society at large why human resources should be recognized as organizations most values assets.<br/>        Meanwhile this will be of importance to the management of any organization with human resource department in a view of finding the cause of employees low productivity and inefficient and solution or remedies to these problems. This work will be extremely useful to management when every employee’s welfare is called to mind with a view to finding appropriate welfare programs for them. Again, any organization that wants to set up it personnel department may lay hand on this project work so as to know the task of such department.<br/>        Student will appreciate this study because, this project will serve potential researchers as secondary source of data, idea or information useful to any work they wish to carry out.<br/>1.6   SCOPE/LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>This project encompasses the general human resources management of Nigeria bottling company, Owerri plant. The individuals used as respondents were mainly the company’s managers, supervisors and employees.<br/>        In the process of carrying out the study the researchers encountered, some constraints. These constraints includes:<br/>TIME: The researchers encountered the problem of time. The researchers combined both his academic work and his research work together. This problem of dual role within a limited time militated against the researcher’s zeal for through investigation into the problem under study.<br/>FINANCE: The researchers encountered some financial problems. This therefore hindered the researchers from utilization all the whole source of data available toward this work. <br/>        Due to these scarce resources. The cost of materials, transportation fares and postage were reduced to the financial capacity of the researchers.<br/>INFORMATION CONSTRAINTS: The move to collect the necessary information for this work was not an easy one. In the organization, disclosing information about their internal operation had always been a difficult task in the course of this research work. It was really a problem.<br/>1.7DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>In every discipline, there are words associated with it. Meanwhile, the researcher knows that everybody is not acquainted with certain management  terminologies employed by the researcher in this study. The research therefore defines the following words as they are used here.<br/>COMMUNICATION: This is the transfer of information from one person to another with the information being understood by the receiver.<br/>EFFECTIVENESS: This is the power of producing the intended.

In order to achieve this aim, the study aims at assessing the level of human resource management practice among quantity surveying firms, determining the relationship between human resource management practice and organizational performance of quantity surveying firms and identify which of the human resource management practice mostly influence organizational performance. Extensive welfare reviews was carried out to review what past researcher has done on the topic and the relevance of their work to the present research. A descriptive survey method was adopted in the study where structural questionnaire was sent to the respondents of the study which were selected using purposive sampling technique. Data collected was analyzed using spss tools of frequency, percentages, mean and ranking index.  The results of the study from this research shows that the most adopted of all HRM practices in the construction consulting firms is Job Evaluation which is determination of the worth of a job to an organization. According to this research work also, Job Evaluation is the most important and most influential of all HRM practices which is commonly practiced by the HR departments of respective consulting firms. The study is concluded by recommending  measures that should be enforced from the year establishment is the increase in number of employees in the Construction consulting firm which implies the more the number of employees in an organization the more the increase in performance. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 BACKGROUND TO STUDY</strong></p> <p>The Nigerian Construction industry is deemed to operate by diversified workforce, hence managing human resource issue deems to be a challenging task. However, as the role of Human factors in the process of business and productive activities, Human Resource Management is the key factor which has the immediate impact to the organizational structure, especially in the Construction Industry, so Human Resources are the most valuable source of Capital, (Phan, 2012)</p> <p>According to Wikipedia (2001), HRM is a function in organizations designed to maximize employee performance in service of their employer’s strategic objectives. HRM is primarily concerned with how people are managed within organizations, focusing on policies and systems. HRM departments and units in organizations are typically responsible for a number of activities, including employee recruitment, training and development, performance appraisal, and rewarding (e.g., managing pay and benefit systems). HRM is also concerned with industrial relations, that is, the balancing of organizational practices with regulations arising from collective bargaining and governmental laws. HRM is the process of managing people in a company/firm as well as managing the existing interpersonal relationships. These two processes are key in the success and growth of a business. Human resource management is the management process of an organization's workforce, or human resources. It is responsible for the attraction, selection, training, assessment, and rewarding of employees, while also overseeing organizational leadership and culture and ensuring compliance with employment and labour laws (Anthony and Kothai, 2014)</p> <p>HRM is a product of the human relations movement of the early 20th century, when researchers began documenting ways of creating business value through the strategic management of the workforce, (Wikipedia 2004). HRM is concerned with managing people within the employer-employee relationship. Specifically, it involves the performance of people in achieving the organization's objectives and the satisfaction of personal employee needs. HRM can be a major contributor to the success of the enterprise. HRM has been regarded in various industries as one of the most critical elements of business success. The successful implementation ofHRM functions are elements for improving personal, team and organizational performance, Dainty, Belout and Gauvreau, (2004). A number of authors state that the basic functions of HRM include planning, job design devising position descriptions, employee selection/recruitment, employee training, performance appraisal systems, reward systems, employee relationships and employee's health and safety according to Druker,  Maloney, Bratton Gold, Koch, Loosemore and Ramlall (2003). HRM substantially influences the output of business, for example, on quality, technology, competitive strategy and development. Furthermore,HRM should include practices, which provide training and development opportunities for all employees to improve individual skills and flexibility of roles (Mullins, 1999).</p> <p>Human resource management has a significant influence in the QS firms. Although construction technologies and management techniques have advanced rapidly, project managers still need to pay more attention to people management. Human resources still account for the majority of costs in most construction projects (Loosemore <em>et al., 2003). </em>International construction projects normally require a longer time span and more parties are involved (Chan and Tse, 2003). HR issues have positive and adverse implications for construction industries in all countries (Ofori, 2003). HRM is also a significant aspect of the whole planning and project management  process in construction projects, in particular international construction projects that involve foreign firms as collaborators or competitors (Bon and Crosthwaite, 2000; Mawhinney, 2001).</p> <p>The complex international construction climate, caused by increased global price competitiveness, development of technologies, changing industry and employment legislation, and changing workforce composition has prompted project managers to utilise their employees more effectively to gain competitive advantage and project success. In recent years there has been a widespread realisation that improvement ofHRM performance is a critical element to achieving improvement in efficiency, productivity and cost effectiveness in the construction industry. Howes and Tah (2003) describe how the situational model of HRM, the staff performance model of HRM and the socio-technical model of HRM are being implemented in the construction industry.</p> <p>In view of this research, the aim of looking at the relationship between HRM and performance of contractors’ organisation in the Nigerian construction industry is based on the review of the research questions. This will aid us to know level at which HRM practices has improved the performance level of the contractors’ organisation in the Nigerian construction industry as well as its contribution to the Economy.</p> <p><strong>  1.1 STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Construction companies experience many challenges in human resource management and development because of the high number of temporary staff, Alvin (2011). This he says is mainly due to the fluctuation in the demand of the industry not to mention the subjective reasons (i.e. specific procedure in production, material and technology) that limit the workers decision making process.</p> <p>According to Adeagbo and Oyemogum (2012), human resource development is not regularly practiced in most construction firms in Nigeria. Majority of the firms are small and medium sized with more semi-skilled and unskilled work force than skilled work force.</p> <p>Lack of timely project delivery of construction projects are influenced by lack of full commitment by workers due to the company’s reward system which causes them job dissatisfaction.</p> <p> Great expenditures of time, money and resources, both human and material, are wasted each year because of inefficient quality management procedures.</p> <p>A serious limitation that recent reviews of the literature points out is that the link between HRM and organizational performance is considered like a ‘<em>black box</em>’, i.e., lack of clarity regarding ‘what exactly leads to what’ (Gerhart, 2005).</p> <p><strong>1.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.      What is the level of HRM practices amongst consultants in the Nigerian construction industry?</p> <p>2.      What are the HRM practice factors that influence the consultant’s organisation performance?</p> <p>3.      What is the relationship between organisation performance (in terms of growth) and HRM best practice?</p> <p><strong>1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of the study is to determine the effect of HRM practices in the improvement of organisation performance of the consultants in the Nigerian construction industry.</p> <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p> <p>1.      To determine the level of HRM practices amongst consultants in the Nigerian construction industry</p> <p>2.      To identify the HRM practices that influence performance of consultant’s organisation</p> <p>3.      To determine the relationship between HRM  practices and organisation performance measured in terms of growth</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>   <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will show the importance of HRM in Quantity Surveying organizations and as well as its influence on employees in Quantity Surveying firms in the Nigerian construction industry</p> <p> The result of the study will also show the importance and the impact of HRM practices in the development of construction projects in the Nigeria construction industry. The study will also show the relationship level between HRM and contractors and its contribution to the Nigerian economy.</p> <p>An assessment of the study would provide valuable information on the Influence of Human resource management on organization performance of contractor’s in the Nigerian construction industry.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this research is limited to the influence of Human resource management basic practices on organization performance of QS firms in the Nigerian construction industry.</p> <p>The study is limited to Respondents construction organizations within Lagos Metropolitan because Lagos has larger number of organizations practicing and they also have their headquarters in Lagos which will lead to easy access of information by the researcher.</p> <p>Target respondents for this study are professionals in the contractor’s organization and Lagos metropolitan is to be studied for this research work.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong> <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>a.       HUMAN RESOURCES: This is the part of the management process that specializes in the management of people in work organizations</p> <p>b.      MANAGEMENT: Management may be seen as a science or as an art.

The results achieved by these companies demonstrate that there are effective, affordable ways to protect industry employees from injury while maintaining or, in many cases increasing productivity, quality and employee morale. Lost-time work injuries caused by cumulative and acute trauma of the musculoskeletal system such as carpal tunnel syndrome and back injuries are some of the most costly workers’ compensation claims in industry today.</p> <p>In its 1998 national figures, Liberty Mutual Group estimates that these injuries totaled more than 41 percent of all reported injuries with an estimated $15.7 billion dollars in direct workers’ compensation costs (Liberty, 2001).</p> <p>Ergonomics specification is an effective approach to reducing the number and severity of these work-related injuries. Ergonomics specification is the practice of designing equipment, work tasks and work environments to conform to the capability of the worker … to create more efficient work places and prevent injuries to employees.</p> <p>Ergonomics, also known as human engineering or human factors engineering, the science of designing machines, products, and systems to maximize the safety, comfort, and efficiency of the people who use them. Ergonomists draw on the principles of industrial engineering, psychology, anthropometry (the science of human measurement), and biomechanics (the study of muscular activity) to adapt the design of products and workplaces to people’s sizes and shapes and their physical strengths and limitations. Ergonomists also consider the speed with which humans react and how they process information, and their capacities for dealing with psychological factors, such as stress or isolation. Armed with this complete picture of how humans interact with their environment, ergonomists develop the best possible design for products and systems, ranging from the handle of a toothbrush to the flight deck of the space shuttle.</p> <p>Ergonomists view people and the objects they use as one unit, and ergonomic design blends the best abilities of people and machines. Humans are not as strong as machines, nor can they calculate as quickly and accurately as computers. Unlike machines, humans need to sleep, and they are subject to illness, accidents, or making mistakes when working without adequate rest. But machines are also limited—cars cannot repair themselves, computers do not speak or hear as well as people do, and machines cannot adapt to unexpected situations as well as humans. An ergonomically designed system provides optimum performance</p> <p><strong>1.1     THE BACKGROUND OF CASE STUDY</strong></p><p> Adapalm has two oil palm plantations namely, then Ohaji plantation and Umogu plantation. The Ohaji plantation has been given its pride of place ever since the year 2005. Thus as at February 15 2010, the Ohaji plantation has no motorable access roads. Its palms were not pruned and about 65% of it was “colonized” by thick forest. There was zero replanting activity to sustain the plantation future and fortunes. At Umuogu Plantation, the Story was the same. WORK &amp; SERVICES/EQUIPMENTS As at February 2010 Adapalm had 29 vehicles consisting of light duty, heavy duty and earth moving equipments/vehicles. Out of this number 22 were bad while 7 are good. The building section had only 1 shovel and 1 head pan. There were no working tools etc. Similarly only 6 out of 14 Company Computers were in working condition while again only 4 out of 9 Adapalm printers were functional. FINANCE At the inception of the Interim Management Committee on the 15th February 2010, Adapalm had only the sum of N2,950.00k to hand  over as cash at hand to the Interim Management Committee. All bank balances were also sadly in red. ADMINISTRATIONS/SECURITY The Staff strength of Adapalm as at December 2009 stood at 792 workers. Out of this number 85 were of Senior category, 666 were of junior category while 41 were casual workers. However as at February 2010 over 35% of these workers withdrew their services due to deprived work conditions. The 154 Security workers at Adapalm for instance had only about 36 and this led to increased insecurity and brazen looting of the company properties. Stealing and robbery became a daily affair. Your Excellency I have gone this memory lane so that you will appreciate the efficiency of my coming argument that the Interim Management Committee headed by Deacon Kerian Onwuzuruike is indeed a rescue team that Adapalm requires for now. Within the short period of the Interim Management Committee at Adapalm between 15th of February 2010 and 6th June 2011 when your Excellency disbanded it, the following can be said to be their performance and achievements. And these achievements are subjects to verifications. ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE OF INTERIM MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE.

Finding shows that effectiveness crisis management helps to boost morale and general productivity. It was also discovered that some reason for crisis management team failure include member non-cohesion, absence of shared common purpose, social loafing and unwillingness to cooperate with another.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The most critical incident any organization can face at any point in time is crisis. Crisis does not discriminate based on a company’s size or notoriety, and they can surface when a company least expect it. They come in many form: strikes, layoffs, product recalls or allegation of misconduct, but while some of these may seem small, every crisis has the potential to damage the reputation of a company.</p> <p>Crisis management is the process used to manage the response and recovery from critical incidents or business interruptions that cannot be adequately handled within the normal scope of business operations crisis management is a relative new field to management, operationally crisis management activities include forecasting potential crisis and planning how to deal with it. Organization should invest time and resources in order to identify potential crisis before they occur; this include identifying the real nature of crisis if any, intervening to minimize damage and also strategy to recover from the crisis. Crisis management often includes strong focus on public image and assure stakeholders that recovery is underway.</p> <p>Crisis management, in the security field as elsewhere, presents many different aspects depending upon the nature and dimension of the event involved. It always rests upon a philosophical basis, which has to be transformed into a guiding policy. The impact of a crisis is always susceptible of being affected in some way by preparations undertaken to meet and deal with the event, these preparations translates into practical operational terms constitute what is called crisis management.</p> <p>Fundamentally, crisis management is concerned with minimizing harm and restoring order through the intelligent employment of the appropriate, available resources.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</strong></p> <p>The major issues of interest in this study is to look at the benefit an organization will derive from effective crisis management for enhancing safety for staff and customers and also increasing confidence and moral within the organization.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Basically, the study has it’s special aim of examining the effect of crisis management in organization efficiency and effectiveness.

Whereas previous studies have examined either establishment characteristics or a single firm’s personnel records, this study merges information from a detailed survey of Danish private sector firms with linked employer-employee panel data, allowing firm characteristics, work force characteristics, and firms’ human resource management practices to be included as explanatory variables. The results reject the employee motivation hypothesis, but support the employee learning and, especially, the employer learning hypotheses. Firms allocating more resources to training were more likely to rotate workers; rotation schemes were more common in less hierarchical firms and in firms with shorter average employee tenure; and both firm growth rates and firms’ use of nation-wide recruitment were positively associated with rotation schemes.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Over the years reward and compensation have been a bone of contention both in the private and public organization on employees. This has generated a lot of argument, discussion and interest to an extent that it has became a highly sensitive topic.</p> <p>            It is very obvious that employees can only put in their best at work when such employee is provided with a conducive working atmosphere conditions and job rotational activities which serve as stimulus to stir them (employees) to achieve organization set target goals and objective efficiently and effectively.</p> <p>            The essence of effect of job rotation is to provide a good platform for equity and fairness. They provide a challenging environment and increase employee and employee performance. Extrinsic needs of workers at all levels are the effect of job rotation which ensures that both the intrinsic are adequately provided for. This is because it develops organizations integrated policy, procedure and practice. Thus, it is an important signal of organization culture and valve so it’s important to the successful recruitment and retention of high caliber work force with adequate knowledge, skill and ability that supports the organization strategic goals and rotation employees in accordance to their contributions skills, competence and market worth.</p> <p>Based on the definition of employees performance which cannot clearly be defined without going or under standing what reward and compensation do on an employee. when an employee’s reward or compensations which could come in farm of incautious like assurance etc with all these put in place, the employees would be motivated to work and put in all their best there by meeting the goals and targets of the organization. Therefore the success of an organization is based on good effect of job rotation in other to increase organization, productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.2      HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF CONSOLIDATED BREWERIES PLC AWO-NMAMMA</strong></p> <p>Consolidated Breweries Plc, Nigeria’s third largest brewery and the producers of the quality brands “33” Export Lager Beer, Turbo King Dark Ale, Hi-Malt Non Alcoholic Malt Drink and Maltex Non Alcoholic Malt Drink. These brands have a wide distribution foot print and have a great consumer following across Nigeria. Heineken International became the majority shareholder in 2005.</p> <p>In 2000 Consolidated Breweries entered into a Technical Services Agreement with Heineken International and Heineken acquired minority shareholding. In 2005 Heineken International became the majority shareholder. In 2009 Consolidated Breweries Plc. acquired a majority shareholding in DIL/Maltex Nigeria Plc, makers of the famous Maltex brand.</p> <p>We are currently operating at four different locations. Our Head Office is located at Iddo House, Iddo, Lagos, our breweries are located in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State and Awo-Omamma in Imo State and we have a factory in Agbara, Ogun State, and on August 1st, 2011, Consolidated Breweries plc acquired majority shareholding in Benue Brewery Limited following the formal approval given by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Furthermore we have many depots spread across the country.</p> <p><strong>1.3      STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>The subject matter for this work was chosen in order that the great attention being accorded to the issue of efficiency vis – a -vis   productivity may be brought   to the fore for an enhanced understanding.</p> <p>- The administration of consolidated Breweries PLC Awo-Nmanma requires a knowledge of the performance of their workers in order to be able to measure operational efficiency. Some common areas of problems noted during the research include:</p> <p>- Non-challant attitude towards work employees are know to exhibit an “I don’t care” approach in the discharge of their duties. This is much so where they feel they have nothing in stake. There fore this affects their out-put and has a negative impact on the organization.</p> <p>- The employees are faced with a lot of operational hazards and this affects mostly the junior workers and when they feel or they find no fulfillment or joy in the work, they tend to back out which increases labour turnover.</p> <p>-The employees tend to compare their  job rotation packages with other organization and when they feel theirs is little, they tend to put up a lazy attitude towards work.</p> <p>However, in any organization the availability of adequate effect of job rotation would increase the performance of employees, which would reduce labour turnover in the organization.    </p> <p><strong>1.4      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aims and objectives of this study included to ascertain the possible effect of effect of job rotation on the performance of employees In an organisation and critically examine it’s impact on employees performance.</p> <p><strong>Reducing Monotony of the Job:</strong> The first and foremost objective of job rotation is to reduce the monotony and repetitiveness involved in a job. It allows employees to experience different type of jobs and motivates them to perform well at each stage of job replacement.</p> <p><strong>Succession Planning:</strong> The concept of succession planning is ‘Who will replace whom’. Its main function of job rotation is to develop a pool of employees who can be placed at a senior level when someone gets retired or leaves the organization. The idea is to create an immediate replacement of a high-worth employee from within the organization.</p> <p><strong>Creating Right-Employee Job Fit:</strong> The success of an organization depends on the on-job productivity of its employees. If they’re rightly placed, they will be able to give the maximum output. In case, they are not assigned the job that they are good at, it creates a real big problem for both employee as well as organization. Therefore, fitting a right person in right vacancy is one of the main objectives of job rotation.</p> <p> <strong>Exposing Workers to All Verticals of the Company:</strong> Another main function of job rotation process is to exposing workers to all verticals or operations of the organization in order to make them aware how company operates and how tasks are performed. It gives them a chance to understand the working of the organization and different issues that crop up while working.</p> <p><strong>Testing Employee Skills and Competencies:</strong> Testing and analyzing employee skills and competencies and then assigning them the work that they excel at is one of the major functions of job rotation process. It is done by moving them to different jobs and assignments and determining their proficiency and aptitude. Placing them what they are best at increases their on-job productivity.</p> <p><strong>Developing a Wider Range of Work Experience:</strong> Employees, usually don’t want to change their area of operations. Once they start performing a specific task, they don’t want to shift from their comfort zone. Through job rotation, managers prepare them in advance to have a wider range of work experience and develop different skills and competencies. It is necessary for an overall development of an individual. Along with this, they understand the problems of various departments and try to adjust or adapt accordingly.</p> <p><strong>1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>To enable the consolidated Breweries PLC Awo-Nmanma understand the impact of effect of job rotation on employees.</p> <p>It will assist the government to develop requisite policies for rewarding employees and to increase employees performance</p> <p>It will  integrate the Plight and interest of employees with organizational policy therefore ensuring that their welfare is concerned thereby making them more efficient and effective in their duties.</p> <p>It will provide analysis and would also serve as a data bank for future researchers who will make further research into this topic.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>Job rotation has a significant relationship with employee motivation.</p> <p> <strong>H2: </strong>Job rotation has a significant relationship with employee commitment.</p> <p><strong>H3: </strong>Job rotation has a significant relationship with job involvement</p> <p><strong>1.6      RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>   The basic research question for this work are:</p> <p>How do employees and workers perceive effect of job rotation in the organization?</p> <p>What factors influences employees performance?</p> <p>What roles and functions have the management played in putting up a good effect of job rotation in the organization?</p> <p>Does organization effect of job rotation have positive impact on employee performance?</p> <p>Do you think poor  job rotation packages would lead to labour turnover in the organization?  </p> <p><strong>1.7      DELIMITATIONS (SCOPE) OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is centered on the on employee performance and it is limited to consolidated Breweries PLC Awo-Nmanma headquarters. This research work  is also confronted with similar problems because no establishment or organization can stand out today and say it never encountered any pitfalls. Pitfalls in an establishment or in an organization would give the management a tore bight on how to handle any problem that comes by.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATIONS (CONSTRAINTS) OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Firstly, due to limited time, the availability of required data or information from the organization was not an easy task due to the fact that it’s a big establishment and due procedures has to be followed the researcher finds it difficult to access meaningful data as regards to current organisation rotation policy, but had no choice than to use the limited information available. More over, the researcher had a limited time frame, combined with other academic activities to carry out the research.</p> <p>Finally, though it is quite interesting and necessary to have a comprehensive research on the topic: (the impact of reward system and compensation on employee performance).the researcher may not be able to treat the topic absolutely due to time constraint, finance constrain, stress on the part of the researcher and lack of adequate data.</p> <p><strong>1.8      DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>REWARD: Reward can be defined as the care facet in employment. It constitutes an economic exchange or relationship or the comprehensive organizational compensation and incentive package plus indirect benefits and incentives.</p> <p>ORGANIZATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY: Organisational productivity refers to the output by the discharge of duties by the employees. It can also be  referred to as the effectiveness and efficiency of an employee.</p> <p>REWARD STRATEGY: This is the intention of an organisation on how it’s reward policies and process should be developed to meet business requirement.  </p> <p>MANAGEMENT: Management is the creation of enabling environment whereby people working together can achieve group goals and objectives.</p> <p>ORGANISATION: Organisation can be described as a legal entity deliberately constructed and re-constructed in order to achieve organizational objective.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE EFFECT OF JOB ROTATION ON EMPLOYEES PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF JOB ROTATION ON EMPLOYEES PERFORMANCE", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project aims at examining importance of difference in wages rate at different level of workers in an organisation.</p> <p>It will also look into how salaries will motivate to put in their best, to get the best outcome in an organisation.</p> <p>This project will make use of questionnaires as instruments to get information that will be useful for analysis as well as interpretation.

In other words, for any company/organisation to achieve maximum services or even survive, it has to motivate members of its work force through wage rate. Accordingly, it is important that employers do these things, which they hope will satisfy the derives and desire of the employees in other to ultimately induce them to work harder for maximum services.</p> <p>The Nigerian economy has passed through hard times lately as Neboh A. E (1996:1) wrote “the national economy has been battered by adverse balance of payment” problem, dividing oil revenue, unemployment, inflation and the depreciation of the value of the naira. This has led to a drastic decline in the fortunes of the companies.</p> <p>Employees have also had a ‑grapple with low standard of living, increased taxation, and dividing purchasing power. This had forced them to perpetually seek new and better employment or look beyond their income, so we will find some of them selling various items ranging from textiles, jewelleries, whose, wires, etc. The both of them are fellow workers and visitors in the office.</p> <p>Significantly the employees have learnt to battle with retrenchments, lay‑offs, non‑payment of salaries and benefit lack of promotion and difference in wage rate base on their qualification etc. This situation has made it difficult to harmonize the goals of the employers with these of the employees, since the success of the organisation can ensure that the employees achieves his goals of satisfying his needs. This is known to affect stage motivation and moral negatively.</p> <p>Workers are always anxious to take jobs whereas they will be well paid and satisfied. The most prominent factors for job satisfaction is money and this is paid as wage rate.</p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Wages are regular amount of money that is earned usually every work, for work or services ‑ Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary (6th edition). In a nutshell, it is the reward for labour.</p> <p>Differential wage rate is related to differences and the likes given to workers as a result of certain factors that influence a person’s perception of what his reward level should be include skills’ abilities, training and performance. A person who believes his job make a great demand of him expects more. Thus, people with high job inputs must receive more rewards than people with low job inputs or they’ll be dissatisfied C.C. Nwankwo. However, job satisfaction may mean different things to different workers. Some are satisfied with the job environment because it is very conducive; others are satisfied with the type of management and their techniques. Some others are satisfied with the nature of the job they do.</p> <p>The basic requirement for job satisfaction may include comparatively higher pay, an equitable payment system, real opportunities for promotion, considerate and participative management – Michael Armstrong 2001 a satisfied worker is not necessarily a high producer and a high producer is no necessarily a satisfied worker. Money in the form of pay or some other sort of remuneration is the obvious extrinsic reward. Money cannot provide most people’s wants.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Virtually speaking, the human resources in any human organisations have been considered as the most valuable assets which ultimately account for the overall organisational success and effectiveness that is why every organisation Will always strive to ensure a well packaged and highly motivated incentives including both extrinsic and intrinsic modes of motivation to constantly facilitate the desired work behaviour from their employees.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the means to motivate workers to elicit the expected improved work behaviour have not been fully utilised. Although, most to ensure constant employee satisfaction, however the application of managers of various organisation have tried quite a number of methods to ensure constant employee satisfaction, however the application of these methods such as wage rate have raised so many questions, which consequently, open room for further research on their impact on worker’s attitude.</p> <p>Thus, the wage rate that is satisfactory to one worker may not be satisfactory to another. So the use of differential wage rate, according to experts have been considered on the account of certain factors which include differences in skills, abilities, training and performance on the workers. Nonetheless, it is observed that workers take up jobs for various needs and which the use of differential remuneration may not be able to actualize them all. Hence, there is need to research into why workers still remain unsatisfied in spite of high wages or remuneration packages, and why do some members of the organisations feel they are still marginalized or not well remunerated, despite their high input into organisational success and goal achievement so the need for us to investigate the impact of differential wage rate on workers, most especially as applied to banking institutions has called for this research project with a view to explaining or providing possible answers to various questions regarding the subject matter.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Specifically, the study shall seek to find out:</p> <p>i.        If there are differences in wage of workers (bankers precisely) in Somolu Local Government Area.</p> <p>ii.       If they are satisfied generally with the wage rate and other working conditions.</p> <p>iii.      If they are satisfied specifically because of the wage rate.</p> <p>iv.      If they are satisfied specifically because of other working conditions</p> <p>v.       If they perform effectively and efficiently because of the wage rate only.</p> <p>vi.      If they perform effectively and efficiently because of the wage rate alongside other factors.</p> <p>vii.     To proffer suggestions or recommendations based on the outcomes of the research findings.</p> <p>viii.    To stimulate further research in this area.</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>i.        Do bankers derive job satisfaction from only the wage rate system being operated in banks?</p> <p>ii.       Can there be adjustments to the wage rate systems operational in the banks?</p> <p>iii.      Do bankers derive job satisfaction from the wage rate system alongside other factors e.g. nature of job, management, work environment and so on.</p> <p>iv.      Do job satisfaction really result in better performances?</p> <p>v.       Are bankers with better skills, training and abilities better paid than others?</p> <p>vi.      Are bankers who are productive given incentives such as promotions, cash, and gift items?</p> <p><strong>1.5   STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>:</strong>    Bankers do not derive satisfaction from the wage rate system operational in the bank only.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>:</strong>     Bankers derive job satisfaction from wage rate system operational in the banks only.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>:</strong>    The wage rate system operational in the banks cannot be adjusted.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:</strong>    The wage rate system operational in the banks can be adjusted.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The quest for satisfaction has been the motive of every worker because he/she will need to satisfy housing needs, clothing needs, health care, feeding needs, esteem and so on. The study was inspired by the need to inquire and understand the intricate relationship between wage rate and job satisfaction.</p> <p>Findings thrown up by study will in no doubt provide useful information for the workers to enjoy incentives and promotions for instance acquiring skills and training for better performance. This will provide some extent satisfaction.</p> <p>This is also significant to the Nigerian economy because when workers are satisfied, they will be in sound minds and this will affect their social life, moral life, economic life etc. positively.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Whether we hold the view that performance causes satisfaction (Porter and Lawler) or satisfaction causes performance (Schwab and Cummins) it is an underivable fact that the reward causes satisfaction and satisfaction in turn tends to good performance. It will therefore inform management on how best to satisfy their workers with both wage rate and other working conditions.</p> <p><strong>1.7   DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will be limited to banks in Somolu, Lagos both junior and senior staff shall be randomly selected. The junior and senior staff shall be taken in equal proportion to give their opinion on the impact of differential wage rate on job satisfaction. Has it really satisfied workers or are there other factors necessary to satisfy workers.</p> <p>It is strongly hoped that the area to be covered will have no address effect on the study, as efforts would be made to explain the contents of the questionnaire in the simplest form possible. On the long run, desired information shall be obtained from the respondents of the study.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.8   METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>This research work methodology will make use of descriptive research design, which will be used as follows: Population Instrument Sample and sampling procedure Analysis of the data</p> <p><strong>Population: </strong>The target population would consist of about one hundred and twenty people of the total workers of some selected banks in Somolu Local Government.</p> <p><strong>Instrument: </strong>The questionnaire would constitute the major instrument of data collection and the questionnaire consists of both ended and close ended questions.</p> <p><strong>Data Collective and Ad ministration/ Sample and Sampling:</strong></p> <p><strong>Procedure: </strong>In cognisance of the relatively extensive nature of the banks and its activities a cluster sampling technique would be used.</p> <p><strong>Analysis of the Data: </strong>The data collected through questionnaire would be statistically analysed using simple percentage, frequency distribution.</p> <p><strong>1.9   STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>This research work is structured with different topics and sub topics regarding the impact of differential wage rate on job satisfaction for easy understanding.</p> <p>Chapter      1       ‑ Introduction</p> <p>2       ‑ Literature Review</p> <p>3       ‑ Methodology</p> <p>4       ‑ Data Analysis</p> <p>5 ‑ Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations</p> <p><strong>1.10  OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>In the course of writing this research work certain unfamiliar terminologies are used and for clarity, they are thus defined.</p> <p><strong>Wage Rate: </strong>It is the number of occasions within a given period of time when something happens or is done or when reward in monetary terms giving to workers after the successful completion of a specified task or job.</p> <p><strong>Job Satisfaction: </strong>When someone has pleasure or he/she is content with what ever he/she is doing for a living.</p> <p><strong>Incentive: </strong>These are things or tools used by management to increase the efficiency of work performance of an employee or employees in an organization.</p> <p><strong>Workers/Bankers: </strong>Used as an encompassing terms for all workers, earners, and management staff.</p> <p><strong>Performance: </strong>Doing something very well.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE IMPACT OF DIFFERENTIAL WAGE RATES ON JOB SATISFACTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENTIAL WAGE RATES ON JOB SATISFACTION", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>In the early 1900’s, conflict was seen as an indicator of poor organizational management which needed to be avoided, in the mid 1950’s, it was accepted passively and perceived as normal and expected; manager focused on resolving conflict, while in the 1970’s, conflict was viewed necessary as not good or bad but could be used to promote growth, in the 1990’s, managers needed to confront and manage conflict appropriately (Algert and Watson, 2002). Organisational conflict has historically been viewed as unpleasant, undesirable, something to be avoided by all and sundry (Oseremen and Osemeke, 2015).</p> <p>Perceptions about conflict changed with the emergence of social systems and open system theory. According to the social system theories, conflict is one of the central forms of interaction. Conflict is normal and positive as well as negative. This view was supported by Emile Durkheim that conflict is normal and functional because it brings about positive changes in an organization. Conflict, however, becomes negative if it is not managed and allows reaching a dysfunctional stage (Ajike, Akinlabi and Magaji, 2015).</p> <p>When people work and interact together, things do not always turn the way people want it to be. There are always misunderstandings and things do not always go smoothly. Indeed, conflict is an inevitable element of relationships in organizations. Conflict is a natural occurrence in all businesses, may it be a small organization or a big corporation. What makes them only different is how management views and addresses conflicts in their respective organizations (Garcia, 2013).</p> <p>The role of conflict management in the life of an organization cannot be overemphasized. The establishment and continuous existence of organisation through the realization of its set goals and objectives requires the continuous and effective functioning of its material input with the human element being indispensable. However, the human elements required to facilitate goals attainment often engage in disagreement and variance over factors such as interest, views, style of management among others. The reactionary effect is due to the perceived incompatibilities resulting typically from some form of interference or opposition is term conflict (Obasan, 2011;Mughal and  Khan, 2013).</p> <p>Conflict in organization is a state of friction caused by the actual or perceived opposition of needs, values and interests between people working together. Conflict takes many forms in organizations. There is the foreseeable clash between formal authority and power and those individuals and groups affected. There are disputes over how revenues should be divided, how the work should be done and how long and hard people should work. There are jurisdictional disagreements among individuals,departments, and between unions and management (Oseremen and Osemeke, 2015).</p> <p>For people to progress at work and other aspect of life, there must be cooperation which is essential to ensure task attainment and stability in life. However, it would be wrong to reach the conclusion that cooperation is good while conflict is bad, this is because both concepts are pervasive and co-exist in our social life. Industrial conflict is inevitable given the wide range of goals for the different stakeholder in the organization and its absence signifies management emphasizes conformity and stifles innovation (Obasan, 2011).</p> <p>Esquivel (1997) argued that conflict is unpleasant, undesirable, something to be avoided. On the contrary, Azamosa (2004) countered that conflicts can help strengthened the organisation and enable the organisation to improve its performance. Moreover, Olu and Dupe (2008) submitted that there is growing recognition of the importance of conflict in an organization. Whether in fact conflict is negative or positive to organizational performance is an issue that remained opened to empirical studies.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Conflict emerges in an organization when an individual perceives that his goals are threatened or hindered by the activities of another person. Most conflicts in Nigeria Bottling Company arises from the inability of the company to fulfill its collective agreement with its employees resulting in employees embarking on industrial action which may be work-to-rule or total strike. Employees’ industrial action usually results in loss of man-hours, machine-hours, output, skilled personnel, employees’ morale, blackmailing of organizational reputation and retardation of corporate performance.</p> <p>Though, Nigeria Bottling Company has not been experiencing incessant labour unrest of lately, it becomes pertinent to examine its conflict management strategies and employees performance from the perception of the managerial and non-managerial employees of the company.</p> <p>There are other factors that can contribute to the creation of conflict in organizations like task interdependence, scarce resources, goal incompatibility, communication failures, individual differences and poorly designed reward system (Mgbekem, 2004).</p> <p>Many of the studies on the impact of conflict management on organizational performance were done outside Nigeria. These studies particularly focus on educational institutions. Research on conflict management and process organizational performance are very few. In Nigeria, most of the available studies about conflict management such as Adebile and Ojo (2012), Osisioma, Osisioma and Chukwuemeka (2012), Bankole and Lawal (2012), Fatile and Adejuwon (2011) investigated causes of conflicts across various organizational settings. These researches were also theoretical studies whose findings were subjectively based on researchers’ personal opinions. It is noted that the past studies did not give attention to the impact of conflict management on organizational performance, as well as highlighting effective conflict management strategy that can stimulate better organization performance. Hence, the undertaking of this research work will fill in the gap by critically exploringthe effect of conflict management on organizational performance with a special reference to Nigeria Bottling Company.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The major objective of this study will be to investigate the effects of industrial conflict on organizational performance. While other specific objectives of the study include:</p> <p><strong>i.</strong>To investigate if there is any significant relationship between industrial conflict and organizational performance.</p> <p><strong>ii.</strong>To determine the effect of labour unrest on organizational productivity.</p> <p><strong>iii.</strong>To find out if conflict management has any significant effect on employee performance.</p> <p><strong>iv.</strong>To examine the effect of industrial conflict on organizational growth and survival.</p> <p><strong>v.</strong>To find out if labour unrest and agitation has effect on organizational reputation.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>This study will be guided be the following research questions:</p> <p><strong>i.</strong>Is there any significant relationship between industrial conflict and organizational performance?</p> <p><strong>ii.</strong>What is the impact of labour unrest on organizational productivity?</p> <p><strong>iii.</strong>Is there any significant relationship between conflict management and  employee performance?</p> <p><strong>iv.</strong>What are the plausible recommendation for improving organizational performance?</p> <p><strong>1.5     Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The researcher intends to test the following hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance:</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:   </strong>There is no significant relationship between industrial conflict and            organizational performance.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>:</strong>There is a significant relationship between industrial conflict and            organizational performance.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2:</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:     </strong>Labour unrest does not have any significant effect on organizational      productivity.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>:    </strong>labour unrest has a significant effect on organizational         productivity.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 3:</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:     </strong>There is no significant relationship between conflict management and    employee performance.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>:  </strong>There is a significant relationship between conflict management and      employee performance.</p>                                                          \n\nEFFECTS OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Whether public or private, the organization’s survival is based on its ability to bring on board and sustain high quality workforce over a period of time. Many organisations are currently facing mounting pressures to ensure their sustainability, flexibility, and responsiveness to the increasing uncertainty and limitations in the economic world. Ultimately, increased turbulence in the employment environment, characterized by organizational restructuring, funding uncertainties and increasing program complexities have substantial effects on the ways organisations respond to workforce replacement (Odhiambo, 2014).</p> <p>At a global level, succession planning in the recent past has received more attention not only as a concern for the management of human resources, but also as institutional strategic management component for ensuring performance and growth. In a survey by Rothwell (2010), top corporate companies revealed that the main reasons for having succession planning programmes are attributed to the challenge to maintain a pool of potential successors.</p> <p>The rate of employee turnover in the changing and highly competitive business environment is on the increase in most organizations in the world today (Sullivancited in Stephen et al., 2013). This phenomenon has led to changes in workforce demographics, global competition, mergers, acquisition volumes, and technology that call for the act of developing a pool of talent to take up leadership responsibilities and push the businesses to the next level. Although some managers feel that the problem of high attrition rate is insignificant because of the high rate of unemployment, it is however threatening to add another impediment to the growth and survival of many firms (Pattanayak, 2005).</p> <p>In Nigeria firms that undergo shrinking or close up do so because of lack of competent managers that are able to motivate employees to stay longer (Adewale, 2011). On the contrary, employee turnover can be quite expensive. Beside recruitment and selection expenses, the cost associated with creating new employee records in the human resource department, establishing payroll records in the accounting section and the provision of safety equipment are costs incurred when employees leave hence the need to manage succession planning properly (Woods, 1997).</p> <p>Succession planning represents a deliberate and systematic effort to ensure leadership continuity in key positions, retain and develop intellectual and knowledge capital within key employees for the future, encourage individual advancement, ensure the stability or “bench strength” of key personnel, provide an overarching approach to continue effective performance of the organization, and organize concerted programmes for the development, replacement, and leveraging of key people to ensure a deep talent pipeline (Schoonover, 2011).</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Every organization needs a process of anticipating and making provisions for the movement of people into, within and out of the organization. Organizations constantly face challenges which are not only associated with the perpetual evolving social, political and economic environment, but also with respect to rapid changing demographics of their workforce. </p> <p>Today’s environments are changing rapidly that organizations are facing serious unpredictability and uncertainty, which sometimes causes instability in the business operations. In this unstable environment, organizations need to rely on the most important assets: their people. Organizations need to strategize on how to motivate and connect their employees in order to create competitive advantage that would ultimately lead to higher productivity. Organizations may consider methods like succession planning and management to promote their employees’knowledge, skills, talents, and capabilities to tackle problems created by the challenging environments.</p> <p>In today’s dynamic world where competition is high, work is fluid, environment is unpredictable, organizations are flatter, and the organizational configuration frequently changes, the old view of succession planning by defining specific people for the specific job does not work. Nowadays, organizations need a group of high potential people at all levels of their organizations. Developing general competencies, creating flexibility and creating the leadership potential at all organizational levels is a wisely action in today’s organizations.</p> <p>It has been usually agreed that the purpose of researching is to identify a problem and provide adequate solution to such particular problem confronting the organization. This research therefore is expected to probe the likely problem associated with succession planning and organizational performance with a special reference to Flour Mills Nigeria Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study will be conducted with the following objectives;</p> <p>a.      To investigate the effect of succession planning on organisational performance.</p> <p>b.      To explore the relationship between corporate leadership planning and organizational growth.</p> <p>c.      To examine if succession planning allows an organization to prepare for the absence of an individual.</p> <p>d.     To highlight the current challenges hindering corporate succession planning in Flour Mills Nigeria Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The undertaking of this study will be guided by the following research questions:</p> <p>1.   Is succession planning a significant predictor of organisational performance?</p> <p>2.   What is the relationship between corporate leadership planning and organizational growth?</p> <p>3.   Does succession planning allow an organization to prepare for the absence of an individual?</p> <p>4.   What are the current challenges hindering corporate succession planning in Flour Mills Nigeria Plc? </p> <p><strong>1.5       Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses will be tested in the course of this study:</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:       </strong>Succession planning is not a significant predictor of organisational      performance.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>:</strong>Succession planning is a significant predictor of organisational             performance.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2:</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:      </strong>There is no significant relationship betweencorporate leadership planning and organizational growth</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>:</strong>There is a significant relationship betweencorporate leadership planning and organizational growth</p>                                                          \n\nEFFECTS OF SUCCESSION PLANNING ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF SUCCESSION PLANNING ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE", "id": 24}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The world is suddenly faced with the need to make a sharp break from old habits and deliberately learn new ways of doing things. Technologies that were startling innovations yesterday, such as personal computers and phone-fax answering machines, are rapidly becoming low-margin commodities. As a result, productive and human know-how are becoming the competitive advantage a business has over its rivals. In the unfolding epoch, successful organizations will be those that hinge on the ability to attract, develop, retain, motivate, and lead a diverse array of appropriately skilled and talented workforce in an organization. The human factor drives everything (Imparato et al cited in Wurin, 2012).</p> <p>The need for talent management at the place of work in today’s turbulent and dynamic business environment cannot be swept under the carpet. Talent management is seen as the conscious, deliberate approach undertaken to attract, develop and retain people with the aptitude and abilities to meet current and future organizational needs. Talent management is concerned with the recruitment, selection, identification, retention, management, and development of personnel considered having the potential for high performance (Stockley, 2007).</p> <p>In recent years, however, observers have cited a decided trend toward fundamental assessments of human resources structures and positions. Obviously, no organization can achieve its fundamental objective without the concerted effort of sound talent management. In the views of Wheelock (2010) the present economic situation of the world has increased the importance of talent management and retention. She further adds that intellectual capital is always asset for any organization; therefore organizations like to invest in this asset.</p> <p>Talent management in organizations is not just limited to attracting the best work force for the industry but it is a continuous process that involves sourcing, hiring, developing, retaining and promoting them while meeting the organization’ s objective simultaneously. Only hiring talented labour-force does not solve the problem but getting the things done from him is the main task. Therefore, it can be said that talent management is a full-fledged process that not only controls the entry of an employee but also his or her exit. Successful organizations evaluate the worth of every investment and talent management is no exception (Venkateswaran, 2012).</p> <p>According to Ashton and Morton (2005) talent management is a function or responsibility of every manager or supervisor who has people (employees) under him, all of whom are working towards the achievement of desired goals.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The current global business environment has become dynamic and there is a vital need for flexible, innovative and rational approach to the management of human capital, particularly with regard to the high talent professional employees. The assumption underpinning the practice of talent management in organizational theories is that people are the organization’s key resource, and organizational performance and productivity largely depends on them. If therefore, an appropriate range of talent management processes and policies are planned, developed and implemented effectively, employees’ productivity will make a substantial impact on firm performance. The realization of a productive human capital in both public and private organizations to a greater or lesser extent depends on how a diverse array of appropriately skilled people are attracted, developed, retained, motivated and led in the organization.</p> <p>Even with the knowledge of the importance of talent management to organizational outcomes, many organisaions today in Nigeria hardly have their managerial tactical tools built around employees talent.</p> <p>Despite the importance of providing adequate talent management in improving the performance of employee for effective organizational performance, most managers and executives do not understand how to effectively manage talent. Some others that engage in talent management do not undertake it appropriately. This study provides various methods for the understanding, management and utilization of employee talent for improved organizational growth and performance.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major objective of this study is to examine the effect of talent management on organizational performance.

Today, the matter of work-force health and safety at work is receiving worldwide attention, this is the major reasons why most successful organization take care of his employee health and safety. However, many organization often record high rate of industrial accidents, large-scale absenteeism occasioned by ill health as a result of the neglect of health and safety. This project provides various types of employee health and safety and how it could be implemented for improved organizational performance taken Unilever Nigeria Plc as a case study. Three (3) null hypotheses were postulated to find out if there is no significant relationship between Industrial Safety Management and workers performance; between occupational health and employee’s performance; between health and safety management and protection of company equipments and property. Questions were formulated based on the three hypotheses. A total number of ninety seven (97) copies of closed-ended questionnaire were administered to respondents during the study. Descriptive survey design was adopted in the study. Inferential statistical method of chi-square (X</em><em>2</em><em>) was used to test the stated hypotheses with the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 20.0). Data analysis was carried out at five percent 0.05 (5%) level of significance. Findings revealed that there is significant relationship between industrial health and safety management and workers’ productivity. The study recommends continuous training/ retraining of health and employees should be committed to safety culture safety personnel and the entire workforce on safe work procedures. Top management and employees should be commitment to safety culture. Monthly safety incentive schemes for all the employees in Unilever Nigeria PLC should be put in place. The study thus concluded that employees’ health and safety is important in promoting employee and organizational safety and improved performance of the company.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>Industrialisation has been the engine of growth for most developing countries like Nigeria and because of that many successive governments strive to find ways and means for developing their industrial sector. The influence of an enduring employee’s safety on organisational productivity and loss control in the Nigerian construction industry cannot be over emphasized, especially in the areas of setting minimum safety management standards, safe work procedures and environmental management standards (Lourandos, 2008).</p> <p>It is assumed that an organization’s employees safety measures have a direct relationship with employees’ productivity in view of the fact that assigned tasks can only be safely accomplished when the work environment is safe and conducive for the execution of the assigned duties, be it construction, manufacturing or servicing, thus, any phenomenon that affects human production capacity will invariably affect organizational productivity hence improving workers wellbeing offers a company the opportunity of enhancing its performance (Galliker, 2000).</p> <p>Apart from the need to reduce or eliminate accidents, construction companies should inculcate safety measure in their workforce in order to satisfy legal, social, and moral obligations of the host community. Dorman (2000) argues that for companies to provide effective improvement of health, safety and environment conditions, the costs of ill-health/accidents must be economic, internal, variable and visible. Court (2003), in his contribution to corporate employees safety management sees the subject of safety as needed in every industry, he further argues that creating better work environment and preventing harm from work are the key means of improving productivity. Today, the matter of work-force safety at work is receiving worldwide attention. And Nigeria cannot be left out.</p> <p>There is a high rate of industrial accidents and large-scale absenteeism occasioned by ill health (Kohn and Mark 1996). Some jobs are very hazardous and the common law requires every employer of labour to ensure that the work-force is safe and that employees doing hazardous work are protected adequately. In that case, safety at work must be pursued as a means of enhancing efficiency and quality of performance (Eze, 2006).</p> <p>Hence, providing working conditions that promote the safety of employees is therefore becoming a major management concern. Barriers are introduced in the form of guards, clothing, protected areas and the like. Perhaps, equally important, reducing the accident potential of a work environment tends to increase the feelings of security and reducing anxiety levels. This in itself makes people less likely to have accidents because they are no longer distracted by their anxieties. Companies also use publicity campaigns, involving various personnel communication media and contests to promote safety (Cole, 1993). Contests typically provide financial reward to members of groups with low accident rates. The focus of these contests and the measures employed can vary considerably, but the essential ingredient is the idea that it pays to be safe. The influence of an enduring employee’s safety management on organisational productivity and loss control in the Nigerian industrial clime cannot be over emphasized. Hence, this research study investigated the impact of industrial health and safety management on workers’ productivity with special reference to Unilever Nig. PLC.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:</strong></p> <p>In today’s workplace, whether it is on a plantation,in an office, factory, institutions, etc. everyworker across the globe is faced with a multitudeof health hazards such as dusts, gases,noise, vibration and extreme temperatures. Thisinvariably results to absenteeismtriggered by ill-health. Unfortunatelysome employers assume little responsibility forthe protection of workers’ health and safety.</p> <p>It is noteworthy that the right to life is fundamental and most be considered sacrosanct. Yet every year 2.2 million men and women are deprived of that right by occupational accidents and work related diseases (ILO, 2011). By conservative estimates workers suffer 270 million occupational accidents and 160 million occupational diseases each year (ILO, 2011). This is perhaps just the tip of the iceberg, as data for estimating nonfatal illness and injury are not available in most developing countries. Occupational injuries alone account for more than 10 million Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost, or healthy years of life lost whether to disability or premature death, and 8% of unintentional injuries worldwide (ILO, 2011).</p> <p>The consequences of construction incidents (accidents, ill-health and environmental pollution) on workers’ productivity are so grave that construction companies should be legally, morally and socially compelled to inculcate safety measures in their workforce. Construction incidents especially</p> <p>those involving lost time injuries (LTI) and lost workdays (LWD) usually lead to shop closure for incident investigation and reporting. This situation results in loss of man-hours, output, reputation and low workers morale. It is on this backdrop that this study was carried to investigate the impact of industrial health and safety management on worker’s productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The major objective of this study is to examine The Impact of Industrial Health and Safety Management on Workers Productivity.

It helps them to solve internal organizational problems. Culture is said to be a set of assumption that is developed over a time period to cope with organizational problems that is why cultural knowledge should be delivered to the new employees. Every organization forms a bond between the employee and organizational culture. These forms of bond related to culture differentiate one organization from another and ultimately leads to a guaranteed success.</p> <p>According to Black (2003) organizational culture is a specific collection of values and norms that are shared by people and groups in an organization and that control the way they interact with each other and with stakeholders outside the organization. Organizational values are beliefs and ideas about what kind of goals members of an organization should pursue and ideas about the appropriate kind or standards of behaviour an organizational members should use to achieve these goals.</p> <p>An organization’s culture embraces all the life experiences each employee brings to the organization. Culture is especially influenced by the organization’s founder, executives and other managerial staff because of their role in decision making and strategic direction. Organizational culture according to Donovan (2006) is represented in a group such as language, decision making, symbols, stories, legends, and daily work practices. A company’s bulletin board content, the company’s newsletter, the interaction of employees in meetings and the way in which people collaborate, speak volumes about an organization’s culture.</p> <p>The type of organizational culture put in place will surely affect the performance of the organization. As stated by Schein (2005), culture is the most difficult organizational attributes to change, outlasting organizational products, services, founders, and leadership and all other physical attributes of the organization. This organization culture will definitely affect the performance of the firm.</p> <p>Performance according to Davis &amp; Olison (1985), it is usually the past that can realistically be expected rather than what is desired. Thus target performance is the desired , or in the other way the expected. There are however, situations where, in practice target may not have been expressly set but only a vogue notion is held as to what is expedient. Actual performance, on the other hand is the outcome of the firms won effort during a specified period Osaze &amp; Annao (1990) or what is realized or against what actual accomplishment would enable one to adjudge performance as being either satisfactory or unsatisfactory. According to Osaze &amp; Annao (1990), performance in business setting means the extent of which an objective has being or is being met.</p> <p>In this highly competitive world many businesses are unable to survive due to rapid changes in the business environment (Tripathi, Kapoor, &amp; Tripathi, 2000). In order to sustain in this competitive corporate world, organizations focus to change their culture, management style and relationship with their employees and try to change their internal environment in order to survive.  It is important therefore, to note that, it is organizational culture that makes an organization tops among its competitors (Gibson, Ivancevich, Donelly &amp; Konopaske, 2005).</p> <p>Organizational culture is the basic pattern of shared assumptions, values and beliefs considered to be the correct way of thinking about and acting on problems and opportunities facing the organization. It is what is important and unimportant in the organization. It is often thought of as organization’ DNA- i.e. invisible to the naked eye, yet a powerful template that shapes what happens in the workplace. Hence, Schneider &amp; Smith (2004) argues that culture begins with leadership and passed on to the organizational members; it is seen as a set of forces that shape and determine human behavior. It is against this backdrop that this study intends to explore the link between Organizational Culture and Employee’s Performance with a special reference to Unilever Nigeria Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem:</strong></p> <p>The issue of maintaining an organizational culture could be challenging considering the diverse socio-cultural background of the workers that constitute an organization workforce in Nigeria. Their differences can interfere with the maintenance of corporate culture and values, when such values conflict with their personal values.</p> <p>A lot of research in organizational management has focused on developed countries; 95 percent and whereas only 5 percent of the studies testing organizational theories are found to be done in developing countries (Farashahi, Hafso, &amp; Molz, 2005) in spite of the highly dynamic environment. A number of scholars have questioned the applicability of western management practices in developing countries and since long time it has also been recognized that culture is a main source of difference in performance management practices. Thus, many researchers (Denison, Haaland, &amp; Goelzer in Yilmaz, 2008) have called to investigate the phenomenon of organizational culture in different cultural context particularly in non-western nations like Nigeria.</p> <p>The question then hinges on, what does organizational culture have on corporate performance? The answer to this question becomes the problem this study is set to investigate. Hence, the need to investigate the effect of organizational culture on the Nigerian business front is timely and should be considered as sacrosanct.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Objectives of the Study:</strong></p> <p> The major objective of this study is to determine the effect of Organizational Culture on Employee’s Performance. Other specific objectives are:</p> <p><strong>i.</strong>To examine the effect of organisational culture on organizational productivity.</p> <p><strong>ii.</strong>To investigate the effect of corporate identity on organizational efficiency.</p> <p><strong>iii.</strong>To assess the relationship between corporate culture and sales boom.</p> <p><strong>iv.</strong>Examine the contribution of corporate philosophy on employee job satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>v.</strong>To find out the effect of corporate norms and standard on employee job satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Research Questions:</strong></p> <p>In other to achieve the objectives of this research study, the study was guided by the following research question.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong>What is the impact of organisational culture on organizational productivity?</p> <p><strong>2.</strong>To what extent does corporate identity affect organizational efficiency?</p> <p><strong>3.</strong>What are the impacts of corporate value on sales boom?</p> <p><strong>4.</strong>Does organisation philosophy have any impact on employee job satisfaction?</p> <p><strong>1.5   Research Hypotheses:</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses will be tested at 0.05 level of significance.

A total number of three hundred and twenty (320) copies of questionnaire were administered to the respondents during the study: While three hundred and three (303) copies were properly filled and returned for the analysis. Data collected were analyzed using the statistical tools of frequency counts, simple percentage for the demographic data while the inferential statistics of Chi Square (X2) test was used to test all the stated hypotheses at 0.05 (5%) level of significance. The findings of the study showed that performance management is significantly related to organisational performance. The study recommends that there should be meaningful dialogue between superiors and subordinates about performance and improvement. Managers and supervisors should dialogue on regular basis about performance and improvement with their subordinate at Nigeria Flour Mills PLC.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    Background to the study</strong></p> <p> Organizations are run and steered by people. It is through people that goals are set and objectives are accomplished. The performance of an organization is thus dependent upon the sum total of performance of its members. The success of an organization will therefore depend on its ability to measure accurately the performance of its members and use it objectively to optimize them as a vital resource (Biswajeet, 2009).</p> <p>In the present highly competitive environment, organizations have to ensure peak performance of their employees continuously in order to compete and survive at the market place effectively (Prasad, 2005). Performance of an individual can be defined as the record of outcomes produced as specified job functions or activities during a specified time period (Bernardin, 2007). It can also be seen as a set of outcomes achieved during a certain period of time and does not refer to the traits, personal characteristics, or competencies of the performer.</p> <p>Performance management on the other hand can be defined as a systematic process for improving organizational performance by developing the performance of individuals and teams (Armstrong, 2012). According to Briscoe and Claus (2008) performance management is the system through which organizations set work goals, determine performance standards, assign and evaluate work, provide performance feedback, determine training and development needs and distribute rewards. Performance management is a process involving performance planning, performance managing, performance appraisal, performance rewarding and performance development (Deb, 2009). Performance appraisal can be defined as the formal assessment and rating of individuals by their managers (Armstrong, 2012).</p> <p>Performance appraisal as an element of performance management is often carried out to reveal individual employee’s contribution to the overall organizational objectives. To drive this notion home Biswajeet (2009) asserted that people do not learn unless they are given feedback on the results of their actions. For corrective actions to take place feedback must be provided regularly and it should register both successes and failures.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the study</strong></p> <p>The process of managing the performance of employees in an organization is often vague, the areas of performance for which an individual is responsible are often unclear and evaluations are often not based on actual performance but on the perceptions and judgment of an employee’s immediate boss.  Therefore, an ill-conceived and ill-considered performance management system could create tensions in the organization.</p> <p>The process of measuring and subsequently actively managing organizational and employee performance in order to improve organizational effectiveness is currently seen as critical to the onward survival and development of organizations (Inyang, 2008). It may be positively dangerous simply to copy schemes used in other organizations, and worse still to copy methods simply because it is the managerial fashion (Agarwal, Angst and Magni, 2009). It is on this background that this research seeks to examine the effect of performance management on employee performance with a special reference to Nigeria Flour Mills PLC.</p> <p><strong>1.3      Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The primary aim of the study is to examine the effect of performance management on employee performance. Other specific objectives shall include:</p> <p>(i)    To examine the relationship between performance management and employees’ attitude to work.</p> <p>(ii)  To explore the nexus between performance management and organizational performance.</p> <p>(iii)To examine whether performance appraisal reveals employees’ actual strengths and weaknesses in the organization</p> <p>(iv)                        To examine the methods adopted in the organization to measure        employee performance.</p> <p>(v)    To suggest ways by which performance management could be used to        enhance employee performance.</p> <p><strong>1.4        Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The research project beam a searchlight on the following research questions:</p> <p><strong>a.</strong>What is the relationship between performance management and employees’ attitude to work?</p> <p><strong>b.</strong>How does performance management affect organizational performance?</p> <p><strong>c.</strong>Does performance appraisal reveal employees’ actual strengths and weaknesses in the organization?</p> <p><strong>d.</strong>What are the methods adopted in the organization to measure employee performance?</p> <p><strong>1.5     Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The researcher intends to test the following hypotheses;</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>     There is no significant relationship between performance management and employees’ attitude to work.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:</strong>      There is a significant relationship between performance management and employees’ attitude to work.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>     Performance management is not a significant predictor of organizational performance.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong>:      Performance management is a significant predictor of organizational performance.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 3:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>     Performance appraisal does not reveal employees’ actual strengths and weaknesses in the organization.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:</strong>      Performance appraisal reveals employees’ actual strengths and weaknesses in the organization.</p>                                                          \n\nEFFECT OF PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT ON EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT ON EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Reward being seen as a vital instrument in employee performance. A well rewarded employee feels that he/she is being valued by the company that he/she is working for. They are also encouraged to work harder and better if they are aware that their well-being is taken seriously by their employers, and that their career and self development are also being honed and taken care of by their company. Employees are the engine of organization vehicles while reward is the fuel. In the modern time management, no organization can achieve its stated objectives without commiserate rewards and fringe benefits for its employees (Martocchio, 2011).</p> <p>The role of reward system in shaping the live of an organization cannot be overemphasized. Reward system has been described as the development, implementation, maintenance, communication and evaluation of compensation processes (Galanou, Georgakopolous, Sotiropoulous and Dimitris, 2010). Ordinarily, the management of people at work is an integral part of the management process, put differently managers need to understand the critical importance of people in their organizations so as to recognize that the human element and the organization are synonymous (Popoola and Ayeni, 2007). Therefore, it is imperative and morally worthwhile to have a sound reward system and fringe benefits in place.</p> <p>Fringe benefit is defined as any form of compensation provided by the organization other than wages or salaries that is paid for in whole or in part by the employer. Employee benefits are also essential for the development of corporate industrial relations. Examples include retirement plans, child care, elder care, hospitalization programs, social security, vacation and paid holidays (Christoph, cited in Ju, Kong and Hussin, 2008).</p> <p>Cascio (2003) asserted that because of the importance that rewards holds on people's lifestyle and self esteem, individuals are very concerned about what they are paid. While on the other hands organizations are concerned with what they pay because it motivates important decisions of employees about job satisfaction and overall corporate performance.</p> <p>The happier people are with their jobs, the more satisfied they are said to be (Odunlade, 2012). The perception of being paid what one is worth predicts job satisfaction. Job satisfaction is perceived as an individual’s attitude and behavior towards aspects of his own job. Personal job satisfaction is an affective or emotional response toward various facets and outcomes of one’s job; meaning that personal satisfaction in relation to a job is not unitary, as a person may be satisfied with one aspect of his or her job and may be dissatisfied with the rest (Bozeman and Gaughan, 2011).</p> <p>Employees will demonstrate pleasurable positive attitudes when they are satisfied with the corporate reward system and fringe benefits which the job brings. Thus, good reward system and fringe benefits will increase the employees’ job satisfaction which will invariably affect corporate productivity and performance (Millan et al, 2011). But, whether reward system and fringe benefits negatively or positively determines workers job satisfaction in Nigeria remains open to empirical studies. Hence, this study will investigate the impact of reward system and fringe benefits on job satisfaction with a special reference to Ensure Insurance Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Owing to the high level of unemployment that has plagued the labour market in Nigeria, many employers of labour have taken advantage of this menace by unilaterally fixing salaries and wages without the participation of their employees. Empirical researches also indicate that labour is largely underpriced since the numbers of job seekers are more than the number of available jobs. According to the National Manpower Board, (2009) the Nigeria labour market can barely absorb 10% of the over 3.8 million graduates turned out by the Nigeria educational system on a yearly basis.</p> <p>Sometimes, employers prove very difficult to negotiate with. While the employee wants the highest and the best package, the employer would like to minimize cost as much as possible for profit maximization. Bad and depressed economic condition in Nigeria makes it the more difficult to fully implement a good reward and fringe benefits system.</p> <p>Many of the studies on the dynamics of reward system, fringe benefits and job satisfactionwere done outside Nigeria. These studies particularly focus on workers in the banking industry. In Nigeria, most of the available studies such as Odunlade (2012) and Aninkan (2014) were too brief and lacking depths. Moreover, these researches were also theoretical studies whose findings were subjectively based on researchers’ personal opinions. It is noted that the past studies did not give adequate attention to reward system and fringe benefits, as well as highlighting plausible strategy that can stimulate employee job satisfaction in Nigeria. It is against this backdrop that this study seeks to fill in the gap in knowledge by critically examining the impact of reward system and fringe benefits on job satisfaction with a special reference to Ensure Insurance Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.3    Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The major aim of this research is to investigate the impact of reward system and fringe benefits on job satisfaction.
