Since ancient times and well before the past millennium, people have sought ways of dealing with water (their main commodity and primary source of drinking, sanitation, irrigation, cultivation, transportation and communication). Two major water supplies are surface water and ground water and are the water resources for readily available water for human consumption. Surface water includes pounds, streams, rivers, oceans and lakes. Pure water rarely occur in nature due to water capacity to dissolve and absorb surrounding materials. Surface water is the most readily available, yet the most polluted as a result of anthropogenic, but happily, controllable activities (David, 2006). In Nigeria, surface water pollution is being associated with surface runoff, industrial effluent, cold-room effluent, domestic waste and abattoir effluent. In this study, emphasis is placed on effluent generated from abattoir processes.</p> <p>The abattoir industry is an important component of the livestock industry providing domestic meat supply to over 150 million people and employment opportunities for teaming population in Nigeria (Nafarnda <em>et al</em>; 2012). However, majority of the activities going on in most of the abattoir present in Nigeria are never monitored for regulation purposes. Majority of the abattoir in Nigeria are not developed and facilities for the treatment of abattoir effluents are lacking. Potential health risks from waterborne pathogens can exist in water polluted by abattoir effluents, runoff from feedlots, dairy farms, grazed pastures, fallow and sod amended with poultry litter, grassland treated with dairy manure, and sewage sludge treated land. Such contamination of water bodies from abattoir wastes could constitute significant environmental and public health hazards (Nafarnda <em>et al</em>, 2012).In Southwestern Nigeria several pathogenic species of bacteria in abattoir effluent have been identified. These species among others include Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., in harsh environmental condition depicting the unfriendly nature of untreated abattoir effluent to the surrounding environment and human health (Coker <em>et al</em>., 2001). The main wastes originate from killing, hide removal or de-hairing, paunch handling, rendering, trimming, processing and clean up operations. The wastes generated from slaughter house usually constitute blood, grease, inorganic and organic solids, salts and chemical added during processing operations (Raheem <em>et al</em>). On the average, majority of the abattoir in Nigeria are sited near a stream, natural pond or river, like the one present in Agbarho, Ugheli north, Delta state.</p> <p>Environmental issues resulting from improper management practices responsible for the pollution of the aquatic environment with various forms of contaminant has increased in geometric proportion over the last four decades with concomitant increase in water borne diseases especially typhoid, diarrhea and dysentery. Abattoirs are generally known all over the world to pollute the environment either directly or indirectly from their various processes. It is observed that in Nigeria, many abattoirs dispose their effluents directly into streams and rivers without any form of pre-treatment and the slaughtered meat is washed by the same water (Adelegan, 2002).</p> <p>The Agbarho abattoir on daily basis produces several gallons of blood, and intestinal contents and tissues introducing them into the environment including the Agbarho River. On a visit to the Agbarho abattoir, during a quick survey around the abattoir, neither holding tank nor waste treatment system/facility was observed which is obviously an indication that effluent and other solid wastes generated from the abattoir are been dumped/discharged indiscriminately into the surrounding. The abattoir was said to have been existence for years now, which implies that the water body has been receiving abattoir effluent for years.</p> <p>Note: to avoid ambiguity, abattoir may be used interchangeably with slaughter house, also wastewater may also be used instead of effluent.</p> <p>1.2.    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Abattoirs are generally known all over the world to pollute the environment either directly or indirectly from their various processes hence  water quality assessment is essential to the Agbarho River so as to ascertain the level of impact of the abattoir effluent periodically discharged to it. As it receives discharged waste water from the Agbarho abattoir. considering implicated certain bacteria species in abattoir effluent pollution, not ignoring other processes involved in meet and hide processing, the analysis will deal with certain physiochemical and biological parameter of the river water.</p> <p>Cases of water borne diseases especially typhoid, diarrhea and dysentery has resulted as a result of contact with polluted water. It is therefore expedient to carry out such analysis on the river for awareness purpose, as the users of the river exploit it for economic and recreational purpose without the full knowledge of the danger it may pose to human health.</p> <p>Until now in Nigeria, many abattoirs (Agbarho Slaughterhouse included) dispose their effluents indiscriminately into streams and river body and without any form of treatment and mismanage various their waste. Assumption is being made that publications on effect of abattoir on water quality would pilot the awakening of effective and sound regulation on wastewater treatment and abattoir waste management.</p> <p>In overview, water quality usually degenerate as a result of indiscriminate and uncontrolled effluent discharge from abattoirs, accompanied with water borne diseases with no sign of governmental mitigation plan. However there has not been any study on the relevance of the abattoir activities on Agbarho River.</p> <p>1.3.    PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>The study seeks to ascertain the effect of Agbarho slaughterhouse effluent on the Agbarho river water with specific objectives which include:</p> <p>1.     a)      To check the effect of the abattoir effluent/waste on the River water quality (if it influences any change in the BOD, DO, COD, pH, Turbidity, Alkalinity, Total solids and some other physiochemical and biological properties of the  river water).</p> <p>2.     b)      To check for the level of impact if there is any.</p> <p>3.     c)      To establish that there is a significant relationship between abattoir effluent and river water quality.</p> <p>4.     d)     To create awareness on various adverse impacts that may result from the discharge of untreated abattoir effluent.</p> <p>Aligning with the objectives stated above the below questions are made:</p> <p>1.     What possible effect does abattoir effluent has on water quality?</p> <p>2.     To what extent has the release of the abattoir effluent into the Agbarho River impacted it?</p> <p>       III.      What relationship does the effluent has with the water quality?</p> <p>1.     What information is needed in the discharge of effluent?</p> <p>1.4.         SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.     The study will be of great benefit to a number of groups in Nigeria. Government agencies especially the Delta State Environmental Protection Agency, rank amongst the top beneficiary of this study</p> <p>2.     Another set of interest group that will benefit from the findings of this research will be the community and society where the abattoir is located, as the study stands to keep them informed.</p> <p>3.     The last set of beneficiary of this study is the international community, particularly in the area of urgent significance in the uniformity and standardization of the reporting formats for entities involved in regulation of abattoir industries or the likes.</p> <p>1.5.         SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS.</p> <p>The area of this study covers a section of the Agbarho River around the effluent discharge point. The study is specifically focused on analysis of water quality around the discharge point as defined by some physiochemical and biological parameters.</p> <p>The research is not without limitation as there are bound to be variation in water quality over time due to the continuous flow of the river and other activities.</p> <p>1.6   STUDY AREA</p> <p>The Agbarho river serves as the case study with respect to the abattoir effluent. Agbarho is one of the major town in Delta State in Southern Nigeria. It lies between latitude N5o 35’ 00’’ and longitude E5o 52’ 00’’. Agbarho is one of the populated towns in Delta state with an estimated value of 145,000 people.</p> <p> Agbarho River is an important economic river in Delta state as various socio-economic activities including vehicle washing and fishing are possible through the river. The river also serve for the purpose of sand resources as it accommodates several dredging activities at various points. People living within the vicinity draw water from the river and even swim in it. The river originates from Orho a hinterland in Warri and stretches down westward to Uvwie Local Government Area of the state where it empties with its creeks into the Atlantic Ocean. The river receives wastes from municipal dumps and from   abattoir sited along its course. Although, there are more than one abattoirs in Agbarho, Oghara abattoir is implicated in this study due to its strategic location right by the course of the Agbarho River and also because it is the major abattoir which supplies about 65% of the meat for the town residence and other nearby communities.</p> <p>1.7 OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERM</p> <p>Abattoir/slaughterhouse is usually used to refer to meat packing industry, large industry involving the slaughtering, processing, and distribution of cattle, sheep, and hogs. Abattoir operations are meant to recover the edible portions of slaughtered animals for human consumption (Fearon <em>et al</em>., 2014).It also refers to places where animals are killed for their meet. It is one of the most important industries in Nigeria as it serves as meet resources and also supplies certain raw materials to several manufacturing industries. These industries usually generate waste in form of solid or water (i.e. effluent/wastewater, water that has been used, as for washing, flushing, or in manufacturing processes). that may eventually contaminate water system if not well taken care of. The aftermath effect of the contamination is usually deterioration in the water quality. Water quality refers to the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water. It is a measure of the condition of water relative to the requirements of one or more biotic species and or to any human need or purposes. Such parameters as the one categorized below define water quality.</p> <p>1.7.1    WATER QUALITY PHYSIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS</p> <p>Temperature: If the overall water body temperature of an aquatic system is altered, an aquatic community shift can be expected. </p> <p>pH value: pH is an indicator of the existence of biological life as most of them thrive in a quite narrow and critical pH range.</p> <p>Color: is measured in (ptco)/(Lu). It is the characteristics spectrum band of a given water body. Color is vital as most water users, be it domestic or industrial, usually prefer colorless water.  Determination of color can help in estimated costs related to discoloration of the water.</p> <p>Turbidity: is expressed as the amount of suspended matter in Mg/L or parts per million (PPM).</p> <p>Specific Conductivity: specific conductivity can be defined as the total amount of dissolved salts present in water.</p> <p>Dissolved Oxygen (DO): DO is the concentrated amount of oxygen (O2) in dissolved form. It is measured in Mg/L or (PPM). DO is essential for aquatic life. A low DO (less than 2 Mg/L) would indicate poor water quality and thus would have difficulty in sustaining many sensitive aquatic lives.</p> <p>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): in water consist of inorganic salts and dissolved materials. In ambient conditions, these compounds are present in proportions that create a balanced solution. If there are additional inputs of dissolved solids to the system, the balance is altered and detrimental effects may be seen. Inputs include both natural and anthropogenic source.</p> <p>Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD): BOD is a measure of organic pollution to both waste and surface water. High BOD is an indication of poor water quality. For this tree plantation project, any discharge of waste into the waterways would affect the water quality and thus users downstream.</p> <p>Nitrate nitrogen: The growth of  macrophytes and phytoplankton is stimulated principally by nutrients such as nitrates. Many bodies of freshwater are currently experiencing influxes of nitrogen and phosphorus from outside sources. The increasing concentration of available phosphorus allows plants to assimilate more nitrogen before the phosphorus is depleted. Thus, if sufficient phosphorus is available, high concentrations of nitrates will lead to phytoplankton (algae) and  macrophyte (aquatic plant) production.   This is mostly due to the usage of fertilizers.</p> <p>Oil &amp; Grease: To check if there is any indiscriminate dumping of waste oil or poor management of oily waste within the site.</p> <p>1.7.2 SOME MICROBIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS</p> <p>Total Coliform Count and Faecal Coliform Count: These tests use coliform bacteria as indicator organisms.  The presence of these indicative organisms is evidence that the water has been polluted with faeces of humans or other warm-blooded animals.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF AGBARHO SLAUGHTERHOUSE EFFLUENT ON THE AGBARHO RIVER WATER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF AGBARHO SLAUGHTERHOUSE EFFLUENT ON THE AGBARHO RIVER WATER", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Deforestation causes, effects and control strtegies </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/><strong>Background of the studies</strong></p> <p><br/>Nigeria is naturally endowed with vast expanse of forest land, the swamp forests in the extreme Southern part of the country, the tropical rainforest in the South- western axis and the wooded savannah in the middle belt. Nigeria ranks among the countries of the world with abundant forest resources. Mfon, et al (2014) said forests in Nigeria occupied about 110, 890km2 of the country total land mass of about 910,770km2 in other words, forests is about 012.18% of vegetation cover of the country. Park (1992), has stated that at least 60 percent of all known species of plant, about 90 percent of all the world’s non-human primates such as monkeys, about 40 percent of all the birds of prey and about 80 percent of all the insects live in the tropical rainforests of the world. In other words forest provides us a wide variety of ecosystem services, including provisioning regulating, cultural, and supportive services. These ecosystem services not only deliver the basic material needs for survival, but also underlie other aspects of well being, including health, security good social relations and freedom of choice. In the past, timber production was regarded as the dominant function of forests. However, in recent years this perception has shifted to a more multifunctional and balanced view. Today, it is understood that forest biodiversity underpins a wide ranges of goods and services for human well being. Ecologically intact forests stores and purify drinking water, they can mitigate natural disasters such as drought and floods, they help store carbon and regulate the climate, they provide food and produce rainfall, and they provide a vast array of goods for medicinal cultural and spiritual purposes (CBD, 2009). Similarly, most Nigerians have always depended on the forest for their survival, economic development, as well as environmental amelioration. The level of community nutrition is sometimes linked to fuel wood availability and cost, others depended directly on forest for their livelihood; among them are a high number of forest and wood worker ( Aliyu et al, 2014) This is a part from contributing substantially to the National Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In spite of its importance, the natural forest has continued to diminish rapidly in the world especially in Africa continent and particularly in Nigeria. According to EFC, (2010), the world continues to lose some 15 million hectares of forests every year. Deforestation over the period 1980 to 1990 reached 8.2% of total forest area in Asia, 6.1% in Latin America and 4.8% in African. Most modern deforestation takes place in developing countries, particularly in tropical areas. Deforestation and forest degradation directly threaten as many as 400million people including 50million forest indigenous people who depend on forest for subsistence in sub-Sahara Africa (EFC, 2010). Deforestation estimates for some. African countries have been given by Lanly (1983). For example, the of forest depletion in Cote divoire and Nigeria is estimated as high as 5 to 6% per year while Ochanda and Epp (1982) stated that in Kenya the indigenous forest now covers only 1.9% of the land area and remote sensing have shown that about 16% of the forest is being lost in each ten year period. In Nigeria, the scenarios is not different, regional breakdown of deforestation from 1979 to 1995 shows that total forest declined by 48% in the North-central 7% in the North East, 60% in the North West, 53% in the south East, 13% in the South-South and 12% in the South West (FORMECU 1996). In 2000 the forest cover was estimated at 13.5 million hectares compared to 17.5 million hectares in 1990 (FAO, 2001), indicating a forest cover loss of close to 400 thousand ha per annum, or a decline of about 2.6%. Forest/woodlands now stand at only 13% of the total land area (FAO, 2001). With global outcry on the consequences of continuous unsustainable forest destruction topping major intellectual discourses the needs to examine the current deforestation situation in Nigeria requires a work of this nature.</p> <p><br/>The year 2011 is ‘The International Year of Forests’. This designation has generated momentum bringing greater attention to the forests worldwide. Forests cover almost a third of the earth’s land surface providing many environmental benefits including a major role in the hydrologic cycle, soil conservation, prevention of climate change and preservation of biodiversity (Sheram, 1993). Forest resources can provide long-term national economic benefits. For example, at least 145 countries of the world are currently involved in wood production (Anon., 1994a). Sufficient evidence is available that the whole world is facing an environmental crisis on account of heavy deforestation. For years remorseless destruction of forests has been going on and we have not been able to comprehend the dimension until recently. Nobody knows exactly how much of the world’s rainforests have already been destroyed and continue to be razed each year. Data is often imprecise and subject to differing interpretations. However, it is obvious that the area of tropical rainforest is diminishing and the rate of tropical rain forest destruction is escalating worldwide, despite increased environmental activism and awareness. Deforestation is the conversion of forest to an alternative permanent non-forested land use such as agriculture, grazing or urban development (van Kooten and Bulte, 2000). Deforestation is primarily a concern for the developing countries of the tropics (Myers, 1994) as it is shrinking areas of the tropical forests (Barraclough and Ghimire, 2000) causing loss of biodiversity and enhancing the greenhouse effect (Angelsen et al., 1999). FAO considers a plantation of trees established primarily for timber production to be forest and therefore does not classify natural forest conversion to plantation as deforestation (but still records it as a loss of natural forests). However, FAO does not consider tree plantations that provide non-timber products to be forest although they do classify rubber plantations as forest. Forest degradation occurs when the ecosystem functions of the forest are degraded but where the area remains forested rather cleared (Anon., 2010). Thirty per cent of the earth’s land area or about 3.9 billion hectares is covered by forests. It was estimated that the original forest cover was approximately six billion hectares (Bryant et www.intechopen.com 4 Global Perspectives on Sustainable Forest Management al., 1997). The Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America and China were the most forest rich countries accounting to 53 per cent of the total forest area of the globe. Another 64 countries having a combined population of two billions was reported to have forest on less than ten per cent of their total land area and unfortunately ten of these countries have no forest at all. Among these countries 16 are such which had relatively substantial forest areas of more than one million hectares each and three of these countries namely Chad, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Mongolia each had more than ten million hectares of forest. The forest area remained fairly stable in North and Central America while it expanded in Europe during the past decade. Asian continent especially in India and China due to their large scale afforestation programme in the last decade registered a net gain in forest area. Conversely the South America, Africa and Oceania had registered the net annual loss of forest area (Anon., 2010; 2011).</p> <p><br/>ined by densely-tall woody and non-woody vegetations as well as other communities of flora and fauna in symbiotic relationships. Forest is an intricate system made up of plants and trees that protect biodiversity, providing home to terrestrial biodiversity and improving the quality of life forms on earth (Popoola, 2014). Onyeanusi and Otegbeye (2012) defined forests as large areas of land covered with trees and brush that grow thick but forest according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Forest Resources Assessment (2002) is an area where trees cover ten percent or more of the land. Forest was originally used to mean a vast expanse of land covered by trees usually associated with game hunting. Forest has been variously used to define any tall densely packed area of vegetation, even underwater vegetation such as kelp forests, or non-vegetation such as fungi and bacteria but a typical forest is composed of the overstory (canopy or upper tree layer) and the understory which includes shrub layer, herb layer, and moss layer, and also soil microbes. Forests are found in all regions capable of sustaining tree growth at altitudes up to the tree line, except where natural fire frequency or other disturbances is too high or where the environment has been impaired by anthropogenic activities. Forests are naturally endowed with numerous resources that are valuable to mankind (FAO, 2003). Forest functions depend on the daily needs of livelihood of people living close to it. For instance, rural populations depend most fundamentally on forests in terms of subsistence, health, income and culture (Van et al., 1997; Adebisi, 2008). The forest is a source of resources that are of environmental, economic, socio-cultural and aesthetic benefit.<br/>Types of Forest Forests vary considerably in composition, structure and geographic distribution. It can be classified into different types based on the following criteria:<br/>a. Based on spontaneity: natural and artificial forest<br/>b. Based on indications of human activity: primary/frontier and secondary forest<br/>c. Based on leaf longevity: evergreen and deciduous forest<br/>d. Based on leaf broadness: broadleaf tree, coniferous trees or mixed forest<br/>e. Based on geographic zone: temperate forest, sub-tropical and tropical moist forest, sub-tropical and tropical dry forest<br/>f. Based on physiognomy: old growth and second growth<br/>g. Based on dominant species<br/>Functions of the forest: Forest are important to sustainability of the earth and hence the existence of man. Broadly, functions of the forest can be categorized as follows:</p> <p><br/>a. Environmental function Biodiversity protection and conservation<br/>• Moderation of weather elements e.g. rainfall,<br/>• temperature etc. Carbon sequestration<br/>• Soil management<br/>• b. Socio-cultural function and economic function Food security<br/>• Provision of medicinal products<br/>• Source of fuel wood<br/>• Source of employment and income<br/>• Source of raw materials for industries<br/>• Source of national revenue and exchange<br/>• income earnings Provision of religious and cultural sites<br/>• Aesthetic and sporting<br/>Concept Of Deforestation, Forest Degradation And Fragmentation Deforestation: Deforestation is basically the conversion of forested areas to non-forested land for several purposes basically agricultural, industrial and urbanization. Deforestation is a process whereby trees are felled for several purposes but without replanting to replace the ones felled (Aina and Salau, 1992). It is the large scale removal of forests resulting to nonforest areas for urbanization, agriculture and for some other reasons without corresponding re-afforestation of the area (Fiset, 2011). According to FAO (2005), deforestation is the conversion of forest to another land use or the long term-term reduction of tree canopy cover below the 10% threshold. On a broad sense, deforestation can apart from conversion of forest areas to non-forest ones, include reduction of forest quality in terms of its density, structure of the trees, the ecological and other essential services supplied, biota biomass and species diversity as well as the genetic diversity of the composing biota. Deforestation is a major problem in many parts of the world, and the idea underlying the phenomenon can be a diminution of vegetal covers from thick forest to light forest, from heavy or light forest to open area under development. It can also be from heavy or light forest to savannah or grassland and or from savannah to open or isolated land (Okorie, 2012). In spite of the multi-various usefulness of the forest resources, rapid population growth and changes in land uses have put the forest resources under pressure. For instance, majority of logging operations in tropical countries are considered unsuitable and damaging. The widespread failure of forest governance – characterized by illegal logging, associated illegal trade, and corruption-directly undermines sustainable economic growth, equitable development, and environmental conservation. It puts at risk poor and forest-dependent populations, which rely on timber and non-timber forest products; undermines responsible forest enterprises by distorting timber and reducing profitability; and results in a loss of government revenue that could be invested in sustainable forest management or general economic development (World Bank, 2006).<br/>Forest degradation Forest: degradation is a process leading to a temporary or permanent deterioration in the density or structure of vegetation cover or its species composition (FAO, 2007). It results from disturbances that cause changes in the forest attributes that leads to a reduced productive capacity of the forest. For the purpose of having a harmonized set of forest and forest change definitions, that also is measurable with conventional techniques, forest degradation is assumed to be indicated by the reduction of canopy cover and/or stocking of the forest through logging</p> <p>.<br/><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>Deforestation is a major problem in our environment today, this is because the effect of deforestation is felt not only by the animals who loss their natural habitat, the indigenous people who also loss their homes, and the climate which has change drastically which has led to global warming.

Fragmentation is a complex phenomenon resulting from dynamic interactions between the natural landscape and society’s ever-increasing demands on the land, creating a mosaic of natural and human modified environments (FAO, 2007). Forest fragmentation is basically the conversion of large areas of contiguous native forest to other types of vegetation and /or land use leaving remnant patches of forest that varies in size and isolation.Deforestation</p> <p><strong>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDIES</strong><br/>The research is organized in five chapters for easy understanding as follows: chapter one is concern with the introduction which consist of over view of the studies, statement of problem, objective of the studies, significance of the study, and definition of terms, chapter two is concern with review of related literature, chapter three is concern with research methodology, chapter four is concern with data collection, analysis and presentation of findings.

Population increases and deviations from the energy ladder model suggest that charcoal demand for heating and cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to increase through the year 2030 and beyond.

Deforestation occurs for many reasons: trees are cut down to be used or sold as fuel (sometimes in the form of charcoal) or timber, while cleared land is used as pasture for livestock, plantations of commodities and settlements. The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in damage to habitat, biodiversity loss and aridity. It has adverse impacts on biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Subsistence farming is responsible for 48% of deforestation; commercial agriculture is responsible for 32% of deforestation; logging is responsible for 14% of deforestation and fuel wood removals make up 5% of deforestation.</p> <p>Other causes of contemporary deforestation may include corruption of government institutions, the inequitable distribution of wealth and power, population growth and overpopulation, and urbanization. Globalization is often viewed as another root cause of deforestation, though there are cases in which the impacts of globalization (new ﬂows of labor, capital, commodities, and ideas) have promoted localized forest recovery.</p> <p>Deforestation is a contributor to global warming, and is often cited as one of the major causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect. Tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions. In deforested areas, the land heats up faster and reaches a higher temperature, leading to localized upward motions that enhance the formation of clouds and ultimately produce more rainfall.</p> <p>The water cycle is also affected by deforestation. Trees extract groundwater through their roots and release it into the atmosphere. When part of a forest is removed, the trees no longer transpire this water, resulting in a much drier climate. Deforestation reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture. The dry soil leads to lower water intake for the trees to extract. Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that erosion, flooding and landslides ensue.</p><p> 1.1.         BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY </p> <p>Forests cover almost a third of the earth’s land surface providing many environmental benefits including a major role in the hydrologic cycle, soil conservation, prevention of climate change and preservation of biodiversity (Sheram, 1993). Forest resources can provide long-term national economic benefits. For example, at least 145 countries of the world are currently involved in wood production (Anon., 1994). Sufficient evidence is available that the whole world is facing an environmental crisis on account of heavy deforestation. For years remorseless destruction of forests has been going on and we have not been able to comprehend the dimension until recently. Nobody knows exactly how much of the world’s rainforests have already been destroyed and continue to be razed each year. Data is often imprecise and subject to differing interpretations. However, it is obvious that the area of tropical rainforest is diminishing as observed in the case of Odighi forest in Odighi Local government area of Edo State and the rate of tropical rain forest destruction is escalating worldwide, despiteincreased environmental activism and awareness. Deforestation is the conversion of forest to an alternative permanent non-forested land use such as agriculture, grazing or urban development (van Kooten et al, 2000).</p> <p>Deforestation is primarily a concern for the developing countries of the tropics (Myers, 1994) as it is shrinking areas of the tropical forests (Barraclough et al, 2000) causing loss of biodiversity and enhancing the greenhouse effect (Angelsen et al., 1999). FAO considers a plantation of trees established primarily for timber production to be forest and therefore does not classify natural forest conversion to plantation as deforestation (but still records it as a loss of natural forests). However, FAO does not consider tree plantations that provide non-timber products to be forest although they do classify rubber plantations as forest.</p> <p>Forest degradation occurs when the ecosystem functions of the forest are degraded but where the area remains forested rather cleared (Anon., 2010).</p> <p>Thirty per cent of the earth’s land area or about 3.9 billion hectares is covered by forests.

For several years, there has been remorseless of destruction which must be put under control to avoid some bad consequences associated with deforestation.

The Federal Government has enacted plethora of laws and regulations in combating the menace of crude oil theft. This study frown at the efficacy of the Nigeria laws and regulations, the challenges of crude oil theft, the endemic consequences of oil spillage in the Niger Delta environment, the economic effect of crude oil theft and the lack of sincerity of purposes of the Nigeria government in tackling crude oil theft. This study recommends appropriate measures such as adequate enforcement of the existing laws and further concludes that crude oil theft is an act of terrorism against the Nigerian economy </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>In an attempt to understand the meaning of the phrase environmental integrity, this study, shall attempt to separate the phrase to enable it arrive at a definition. While the phrase environmental concerns with the environment; connected with the natural conditions in which people, animals and plant lives. The term integrity connotes uprightness, honesty, purity entireness, wholeness; the unimpaired state of anything.   Given the above meanings to the phrase, it follows that environmental integrity is the retainment of the pure state, the unimpaired state of the natural conditions in which people, animals and plant live in all human endeavors.<br/> Environmental integrity has also been defined as the sustenance of important biophysical processes which support plant and animal life and which must be allowed to continue without significant change.The objective is to assure the continued health of essential life support systems of nature, including air, water, and soil by protecting the resistance, diversity and purity of natural communities (ecosystems) within the environment.<br/> Strict sense, environmental integrity paints a picture of an environment void of all forms of pollution from all polluting sources, which are basically the making of human activities in its quest for survival ranging from pollution from industries, homes, etc. This means that human survival and development cannot exist without pollution and because this state is unattainable, i.e. (humans cannot just still and await death) the concept of environmental integrity will now mean an effort by humans to maintain a sustainability of environmental resources of the environment in all aspects of its activities through its conducts, applicability of its working tools and through regulations applied in such a way as to improve all the components of the environment and not to degrade same. Flowing from the above definition of what environmental integrity connotes, the question that arises is what is the state of environment in Nigeria?  How Environmental integrity maintained in Nigeria?   In the quest for economic development, Nigeria veered in industrialization at independence.<br/> The first decade (1960 - 1970) of Nigeria’s independence witnessed government plan to promote growth of industries in order to contribute directly to economic growth and national development. In the 1970’s two of the most applauded goals of the national development plans were:</p> <p>Increase in self-reliance in the supply of industrial products and factor inputs, Develop and support small and medium scale industries and their contribution to manufacturing.</p> <p>In the new millennium, the thrust is privatization and commercialization, employment generation and poverty eradication.<br/> Overall, government pursues national economic development through growth of industries through continuous research in science and technology, development of new product, high quality standard in industrial goods and services, ability to produce building capacity to successfully face challenges of competition and increase in taste.<br/> As successive Nigerian governments also established and invested in industries, so industrial economic development also assaulted and degraded the Nigerian environment.<br/> The government focused on maximum exploitation of natural resources for rapid economic development with scant regard for resource conservation and sustainability.  Environmental and social consequences of envisaged projects were ignored.  Industrial activities, usually carried out in Nigeria with weak legal framework and regulation infrastructure, led to pollution of water resources, destruction of fauna and flora, health hazards and deterioration of health quality, air and noise pollution, as well as destruction of traditional economic infrastructures within communities tasking some of these high powered investments.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>Since the discovery of oil in Oloibiri a village in the Niger Delta by the Shell British Petroleum in 1956, the Nigerian economy has not only boosted financially but also have suffered the negative impact of oil activities going on in the territory. The Niger Delta region is blessed with 606 oil fields of which 360 are on shore and 246 off shore.  The oil industry in Nigeria contributes a good percentage of Nigeria’s economy earnings; however it has also become a source of loss in the Nigerian economy budget.  This is associated with the oil spills from the oil exploitation, and a more reoccurring and disturbing issue, is the activities of the oil thieves. It is against this backdrop that the researcher intend to investigate the effect of environmental integrity and crude oil theft in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to investigate the impact of environmental integrity in Nigeria and the challenge of crude oil theft, but to aid the completion of the study, the researcher intends to achieve the following specific objectives:</p> <p>i)             To investigate the impact of environmental degradation on the growth of Nigeria economy</p> <p>ii)           To investigate the effect of oil theft on the growth of Nigerian economy</p> <p>iii)          To ascertain if there is any relationship between environmental degradation and crude oil theft in Nigeria</p> <p>iv)         To ascertain if there is any relationship between crude oil theft and economic growth in Nigeria </p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses was formulated by the researcher to aid the completion of the study</p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>environmental degradation has no impact on the growth of Nigerian economy</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>environmental degradation has impact on the growth of Nigerian economy</p> <p><strong>H02: </strong>there is no significant relationship between environmental degradation and crude oil theft in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H2: </strong>there is a significant relationship between environmental degradation and crude oil theft in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of great importance to the federal ministry of environment and their respective state counterpart as the study seek to enumerate the dangers of environmental degradation and oil theft in Nigeria, the study will also be of importance to the respective oil exploration company, as the findings will point them to a direction of cutting their loss through effective corporate social responsibility to their host community. The study will also be of great importance to researchers who intends to embark on similar study as the study will serve as a reference point for further studies. The findings will also be useful to researcher, academia’s and the general public as the findings will add to the pool of literature already available on the subject matter</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study covers environmental integrity in Nigeria and challenges of crude oil theft.

Present day environmental planning practices are the result of continuous refinement and expansion of the scope of such decision making processes. Some of the main elements of present day environmental planning are:</p> <ul><li>Social &amp; economic development</li> <li>Urban development</li> <li>Regional development</li> <li>Natural resource management&amp; integrated land use</li> <li>Infrastructure systems</li> <li>Governance frameworks</li> </ul> <p>The environmental planning assessments encompass areas such as landuse, socioeconomics, transportation, economic and housing characteristics, air pollution, noise pollution, the wetlands, habitat of the endangered species, flood zones susceptibility, coastal zones erosion, and visual studies among others, and is referred to as an Integrated environmental planning assessment. It is the ability to analyze environmental issues that will facilitate critical decision making.</p> <p>Traditionally, environmental planning has been based predominantly on the interdisciplinary study of environmental systems, based mainly in the sciences and economics. The underlying value system has essentially been an economic market model. Some researchers believe that this approach does not capture the wide range of societal values and concerns about the environment and are suggesting a more multi-disciplinary approach that emphasizes long-term resource management and sustainability.</p> <p>New approaches are emerging that combine interdisciplinary science, ecological economics, and social sciences.  Most importantly though are the collaborative processes which aim to integrate a wide range of values and perspectives in environmental management. The ecosystem approach focuses on a new scientific framework from which to examine environmental problems, it focuses on an expanded definition of ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>1.2. Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Rural areas in Nigeria, over the years, have been observed to have suffered from utter neglect (Olatubosun 1975, Mabogunje, 1968 ) and exhibit what has been aptly described as 3Ds namely: depression, degradation and deprivation (Igiebor Nosa et. Al (1986a) The colonial administrators consistently adopted a nonchalant, yet exploitative attitude towards rural development through neglect, through meager budget allocation to rural sector and through failure to provide rural amenities and facilities (Olatubosun 1978 cited by Falade 1990). Viewed against the background of the fact that rural areas in Nigeria provides jobs for over 70% of the population and accounted for 84% of the Nation’s GDP at independence and about 60% as at 1965, the neglect suffered by the rural areas is pathetic and inexcusable.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>Rural development need to be looked into closely with relevant environmental objectives and targets if they are to effectively progress towards environmental planning.

Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Nigeria flares more natural gas associated with oil extraction than any other country, with estimates suggesting that of the 3.5 billion cubic feet (100,000,000 m³) of associated gas produced annually, 2.5 billion cubic feet (70,000,000 m³), or about 70%, is wasted by flaring. This equals about 25% of the UK’s total natural gas consumption and is the equivalent to 40% of Africa’s gas consumption in 2001. Statistical data associated with gas flaring are notoriously unreliable, but Nigeria may waste US$2 billion per year by flaring associated gas.</p> <p>Flaring is done as it is costly to separate commercially viable associated gas from the oil. Companies operating in Nigeria also harvest natural gas for commercial purposes but prefer to extract it from deposits where it is found in isolation as non-associated gas. Thus associated gas is burned off to decrease costs.</p> <p>Gas flaring is generally discouraged as it releases toxic components into the atmosphere and contributes to climate change. In Western Europe 99% of associated gas is used or re-injected into the ground. Gas flaring in Nigeria began simultaneously with oil extraction in the 1960s by Shell. Alternatives to flaring are gas re-injection or to store it for use as an energy source. If properly stored, the gas could be used for community projects.</p> <p>Gas flaring releases of large amount of methane, which has a high global warming potential. The methane is accompanied by the other major greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, of which Nigeria was estimated to have emitted more than 34.38 million metric tons in 2002, accounting for about 50% of all industrial emissions in the country and 30% of the total CO2 emissions. While flaring in the west has been minimized, in Nigeria it has grown proportionally with oil production.</p> <p>The international community, the Nigerian government, and the oil corporations seem in agreement that gas flaring needs to be curtailed. Efforts to do so, however, have been limited although flaring has been declared illegal since 1984 under section 3 of the “Associated Gas Reinjection Act” of Nigeria.</p> <p>While OPEC and Shell, the biggest flares of natural gas in Nigeria, alike claim that only 50% of all associated gas is burnt off via flaring, these data are contested. The World Bank reported in 2004 that, “Nigeria currently flares 75% of the gas it produces”.</p> <p>Gas flares have potentially harmful effects on the health and livelihood of nearby communities, as they release poisonous chemicals including nitrogen dioxides, sulphurdioxide,volatile organic compounds like benzene, toluene, xylene and hydrogen sulfide, as well as carcinogens like benzapyrene and dioxins. Humans exposed to such substances can suffer from respiratory problems. These chemicals can aggravate asthma, cause breathing difficulties and pain, as well as chronic bronchitis. Benzene, known to be emitted from gas flares in undocumented quantities, is well recognized as a cause for leukemia and other blood-related diseases. A study done by Climate Justice estimates that exposure to benzene would result in eight new cases of cancer yearly in Bayelsa State alone.</p> <p>Gas flares are often close to communities and regularly lack fencing or protection for villagers who risk working near their heat. Many communities claim that nearby flares causeacid rain which corrodes their homes and other structures, many of which have zinc-based roofing. Some people resort to using asbestos-based material, which is stronger in repelling acid rain deterioration. Unfortunately, this contributes to their declining health and the health of their environment. Asbestos exposure increases the risk of forminglung cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and asbestosis.</p> <p>Whether or not flares contribute to acid rain is debatable, as some independent studies conducted have found that the sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide content of most flares was insufficient to establish a link between flaring and acid rain. Other studies from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report that gas flaring is “a major contributor to air pollution and acid rain.”</p> <p>Older flares are rarely relocated away from villages and are known to coat the land and communities with soot and to damage adjacent vegetation. Almost no vegetation can grow in the area directly surrounding the flares due to their heat.</p> <p>In November 2005 a judgment by the Federal High Court of Nigeria ordered that gas flaring must stop in a Niger Delta community as it violates guaranteed constitutional rights to life and dignity. In a case brought against the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (Shell), Justice C. V. Nwokorie ruled in Benin City that “the damaging and wasteful practice of flaring cannot lawfully continue.” As of May 2011, Shell had not ceased gas flaring in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2. Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>The Nigerian government has not enforced environmental regulations effectively because of the overlapping and conflicting jurisdiction of separate governmental agencies governing petroleum and the environment as well as because of non-transparent governance mechanisms. Neither the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) nor the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has implemented anti-flaring policies for natural gas waste from oil production, nor have they monitored the emissions to ensure compliance. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) has had the authority to issue standards for water, air and land pollution and has had the authority to make regulations for oil industry. However, in some cases their regulations conflict with the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR)’s regulations started in 1991 for oil exploration.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The overall aim of this project is to quantify the effect of gas flaring on the community of living organisms in the Niger Delta, interpret findings, analyze implications, and convey high level results and implications to national decision-makers for sustainable and improved environment of the community of the Niger Deltas. This information should provide essential guidance for future control ofgas flares and its effect on the community been affected.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>This study was undertaken majorly to assess the effect of gas flaring in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.</p> <p>Specific objectives of the study are:</p> <ol><li>To examine the effect of gas flaring on the community of living organisms in the Niger Delta of Nigeria.</li> <li>To ascertain whether there is any significant impact of gas flaring in the Niger Delta of Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5   Research questions</strong></p> <p>During the course of the study, the researcher seeks to provide suitable answers to the problem following the questions below:</p> <ol><li>Does gas flaring affect the community of living organisms in the Niger Delta?</li> <li>What is the impact of gas flaring on the Niger Deltas of Nigeria?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.6   Research hypotheses</strong></p> <ul><li>: Gas flaring in the Niger Delta does not affect the community of living organisms in the environment.</li> <li>: Gas flaring in the Niger Delta affects the community of living organisms in the environment.</li> <li>: There is no significant impact of gas flaring the Niger Deltas of Nigeria.</li> <li>: There is significant impact of gas flaring the Niger Deltas of Nigeria.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.7   Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p>The study was carried out to investigate the effect of gas flaring in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The study is limited to the refineries in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.

Also included are by- products of process lines or materials that may be required by law to be disposed of (Okecha 2000). Solid waste can be classified in a number of ways, on the basis of sources, environmental risks, utility and physical property. On the basis of source, solid wastes are again classified as: Municipal Solid Wastes, Industrial Solid Wastes and Agricultural Solid Wastes. Nigeria’s major urban centers are today fighting to clear mounting heaps of solid waste from their environments. These strategic centers of beauty, peace and security are being over taken by the messy nature of over flowing dumps unattended heaps of solid wastes emanating from household or domestic or kitchen sources, markets, shopping and business centres. City officials appear unable to combat unlawful and haphazard dumping of hazardous commercial and industrial wastes which are a clear violation of the clean Air and Health Edicts in our environmental sanitation laws, rules and regulation.</strong></p> <p><strong>Refuse generation and its likely effects on the health, quality of environment and the urban landscape have become burning national issues in Nigeria today. All stakeholders concern with the safety and the beautification of our environment have come to realize the negative consequences of nucleated solid human wastes</strong></p> <p><strong>Found in residential neighborhoods, markets, schools, and central business districts in our cities. These solid wastes have become recurring features in our urban environment. It is no longer in doubt that Nigerian cities are inundated with the challenges of un cleared solid wastes. As a result, urban residents are often confronted with the hazardous impact to their collective health and safety.</strong></p> <p><strong>A United Nations Report (August 2004)noted with regret that while developing countries are improving access to clean drinking water they are falling behind on sanitation goals. At one of its summit in 2000 (Uwaegbelun 2004)revealed that The World Health Organization-(WHO 2004) and United Nations International Children Education Fund- (UNICEF 2004) joint report in August 2004 that: “about 2.4 billion people will likely face the risk of needless disease and death by the target of 2016 because of bad sanitation”. The report also noted that bad sanitation – decaying or non-existent sewage system and toilets- fuels the spread of diseases like cholera and basic illness like diarrhea, which kills a child every 21 seconds.</strong></p> <p><strong>The hardest hit by bad sanitation is rural poor and residents of slum areas in fast-growing cities, mostly in Africa and Asia. In 1992, the “Earth Summit” succeeded in alerting the conscience of the world to the urgency of achieving environmentally sustainable development. The Summit asserted that ifwe know enough to act today, then we must also find answers to many tough conceptual and technical questions that have remained unsolved over time. It affirms that rapid urbanization in developing world if ignored can be a threat to health, the environment and urban productivity.</strong></p> <p><strong>Cities are the engines of economic growth, but the environmental implications of such growth need to be assessed and managed better. The critical and most immediate problems facing developing countries and their cities are the health impact of urban pollution that are derived fromine adequate water services, poor urban and industrial waste management, as well as air pollution, especially from particulates which constitutes part of solid waste.</strong></p> <p><strong>Among the pressing environmental and public health issues in Nigeria today is the problem of solid waste generation and disposal. The problem of solid waste management is a historical one because man’s existence is inextricably linked to the generation of waste. The problem is becoming intractable as many cities in developing countries cannot keep pace with urbanization, pollution, and the increasingly concomitant generation of garbage due to changing life styles and consumption patterns.</strong></p> <p><strong>The mountainous heaps of solid wastes that  deface Nigerian cities and the continuous discharge of industrial contaminants into streams and rivers without treatment motivated the federal   government of Nigeria to promulgate Decree58 for the establishment of Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) on 30 December1988 (Federal Military Government 1988).</strong></p> <p><strong>A national policy on the environment was formed and the goals of the policy include: to secure for all Nigerians a quality of environment adequate for their health and well being; to raise publicawareness and promote understanding of the essential linkages between the environment and development; and to encourage individual and community participation in environmental protection and improvement efforts (FEPA 1989). As regards the solid waste sector, the specific actions desired include collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally safe manner ;setting up and enforcement of laws, regulations ,and standards; encouragement of public participation ;environment monitoring and imposition of penalties on defaulters to encourage compliance(FEPA 1989; FRN 1991).</strong></p> <p><strong>In spite of the formational environmental policy, the environment has not been adequately protected. Interest is mainly on aesthetics, which is rarely achieved (Agunwanba 1998). Wastes collection is irregular and restricted to the major cities. Improper lysited open dumps deface several cities, thereby endangering public health by encouraging the spread of odors and diseases, uncontrolled recycling of contaminated goods and pollution of water sources (Adegoke 1989, Singh1998).</strong></p> <p><strong>Sadly, there seems a resignation to the unremitting solid wastes build up by the relevant authorities ,where such bodies exist at all. However, in reactions to the inescapable environmental impact of delay in solid wastes removal, the federal government for example, introduced the monthly environmental sanitation in the early seventies. There from the States and Local Governments were expected to take a cue and evolve their own solid wastes management (SWM) strategies based on the peculiarities of their environment.</strong></p> <p><strong>Each state had in the process of mitigating urban solid wastes, set up Wastes Management  Boards (WMB) in attempts to tackle the occurrence of wastes and their hazards to societ as whole. While the unhealthy aspects of abandon ed solid wastes can be contained, the more avoidable features of blocked drains, traffic impedance and floods have yet to be fully tackled</strong></p> <p><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>One resonant feature common in the wastes build-up and emanating environmental degradation scenarios is the high cost or capital intensive nature of its amelioration as well as tackling the solid wastes menace. It requires a lot of financial and human capital to minimize and attempt to eradicate the adverse effects of exposed and untreated solid wastes in our urban centers.</strong></p> <p><strong>It is expected that government would in due course arrive at the means to combat solid wastes and reduce their negative impact on area residents and the perception of our cities as being dirty, chaotic, and full of traces of rotting or fermenting garbage that emit odours harmful to the human body. Obviously, the timely removal of accumulated solid wastes require much more than our governments at all levels are present lyeng aged in. Further plans, policies and programs would need to be put on a more permanent basis in order to combat the dastardly effects of environmental degradation. Understandably, it would require effective mobilization of resources such as involving all stakeholders in regular counter measure to suppress uncontrolled solid wastes generation and irregular disposal out side city confines altogether.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>1.4       </p> <p><strong>As a result of increased urbanization and infrequent environmental sanitation exercises, urban residents dump solid wastes carelessly or haphazardly – anywhere they deem fit. Such controversial tendencies and attributes would seem incomprehensible; if we desire to live in beauteous environments. Some of the lagoon front in the country has been turned into a dump for human and all sorts of solid waste. Trucks fully loaded with feces queue up in large numbers to discharge the contents into the lagoon (Njoku 2006).Environmental experts are of the view that the implication of this practice is very grave. The failure of relevant agencies to stem the tide of reckless waste dumping and littering of Nigerian cities’ infrastructure (streets and roads) and surrounding bushes indicate a clear pattern of non-enforcement or non-implementation of existing environmental sanitation laws.</strong></p> <p><strong>Irregular and unplanned dumping of solid wastes, especially at night, which are often in gross violation of relevant rules and regulation continue to hinder plan preparations and effective land use delineation which were expected to usher in a beautiful, clean and orderly environment. Consequently, there remains a huge gap between policy formulation, execution and implementation which exacerbate the problem of solid waste management in Nigerian cities which necessitate the need to evaluate the problems of solid waste management in Nigeria by the researcher.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>The following are the objective of this study:</strong></p> <p><strong>To evaluate the problems of solid waste management in Nigeria.</strong></p> <p><strong>To examine the consequences of poor solid waste management in Nigeria.</strong></p> <p><strong>To identify the strategies than has been adopted in solid waste management in Nigeria.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p><strong>What are the problems of solid waste management in Nigeria?</strong></p> <p><strong>What are the consequences of poor solid waste management in Nigeria?</strong></p> <p><strong>What are the strategies than has been adopted in solid waste management in Nigeria?</strong></p> <p><strong>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>HO: Solid waste management has not been effective in Nigeria.</strong></p> <p><strong>HA: Solid waste management has been effective in Nigeria.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>The following are the significance of this study:</strong></p> <p><strong>This study will educate the general public, stakeholders in environmental management, students, government and policy makers on the problems of solid waste management focusing on Nigeria with a view of identifying management strategies to combat the menace associated with poor solid waste management.</strong></p> <p><strong>This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>This study on the evaluation of problems of solid waste management in Nigeria will cover all issues related to solid waste management system in Nigeria.

This is because a sizeable majority of the population lives therein therefore; the future of the country depends largely on it.<br/> The American Bureau of Census classifies a group of people living in a community having a population of not more than 2,500 people as rural, whereas in Nigeria, the Federal Office of Statistics defines a community with less than 20,000 people as rural. According to Afolayan (1995), rural areas can be easily identified by various criteria, apart from population. Such criteria include the level of infrastructural development i.e. road networks, educational institutions, water supply, electricity, health facilities, communication, etc. Other criteria used include Occupation, Housing, Extent of community planning etc.<br/> Typically, rural dwellers are less vocal, characterized by a culture of poverty, as most people live barely above subsistence level (Laah et al, 2013). Rural areas in developing countries are usually deprived of the basic needs of life such as housing, medical care, postal communication, education, transport etc.<br/> Specifically, rural areas refer to geographical areas that lie outside the densely built-up environment of towns, cities and the sub-urban villages and whose inhabitants are engaged primarily in agriculture as well as the most basic of rudimentary form of secondary and tertiary activities (Ezeah, 2005). Rural area, which is the opposite of an urban area, refers to the country side whose population engages mainly in primary production activities like agriculture, fishing, and rearing of livestock (Ele, 2006). About 90 percent of the rural labour workforce engages directly or indirectly in agriculture (Nyagba, 2009).<br/> The rural sector of Nigeria is, very vital to the socio-economic development of the nation. According to Nyagba (2009), the most important sector of the Nigerian population is the rural areas. This is because the rural sector is the major source of capital formation for the country and a principal market for domestic and raw materials for industrial processes (Ugwuanyi and Emma, 2013). Rural area dwellers have been found to engage in primary economic activities that form the foundation for the country’s economic development (Abah, 2010).<br/> Given the contributions of the rural sector to the national economy, enhancing the development of the sector should be central to government and public administration. This is necessary as such would further enhance the ability of the sector for increased contribution to the overall national growth and development. In most countries, development is most desirous in the rural areas where bulk of the population resides. The development of rural areas signals to a greater extent the level of national development and the situation of the nations in the development ladder.<br/> Rural development has therefore been described in different ways by different authors, depending on the discipline or line of thought. This is because the approach to rural development is multidisciplinary. According to Aslam (1981) rural development is a process aimed at developing the rural poor, their economy and institutions from a state of stagnation or low productivity equilibrium into dynamic process leading to higher levels of living and better quality of life. Similarly, Schumacher (1983) defined rural development as developing the skill of the masses to make them self-reliant through instructions which supply appropriate and relevant knowledge on the methods of self-help. Rural development is a strategy which is designed to improve the economic and social life of a specific group of people, the rural poor.<br/> It involves extending the developmental strides and benefits people who seek a livelihood in the rural areas such as small-scale farmers, tenants etc in order to improve their means of livelihood and mitigate the massive rural urban migration (Aliy, 1999). Rural-urban migration occurs at varying levels in every country. However, the challenges and prospects of rural development in Nigeria have been of great concern to the different tiers of government due to the rate of rural-urban migration.<br/> Different motives account for rural urban migration amongst rural dwellers such as socio-cultural issues where people are forced to migrate to avoid numerous social problems at their place of origin (Agyemang, 2013), poor infrastructural development and lack of basic amenities, search for better economic opportunities such as jobs etc. Accessibility and ease of transportation and communication has also been noted to facilitate rural urban migration, this view is based on the extension of road networks from major towns to peripheral-urban and rural areas that resulted in the decrease in transportation cost and improved communication systems.<br/> 1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/> Given the contributions of the rural sector to the national economy, enhancing the development of the sector should be priority to government and relevant stakeholders. This is necessary as such would further enhance the ability of the sector for increased contribution to the overall national growth and development. Unfortunately, over the years, the development strategies and efforts in Nigeria has been more urban based resulting in the relative neglect of rural areas as evidenced by the dearth of basic infrastructure in the rural areas such as good roads, well equipped and functional hospitals, electricity, pipe borne water etc (Abah, 2010).<br/> Abonyi and Nnamani (2011) also noted that rural poverty persists in Nigeria despite the prosperity created by the country’s oil wealth as evidenced by the difficulty experienced in getting basic daily needs such as food, water and shelter. Lack of these basic life needs in the rural areas has made a number of rural dwellers migrate to urban centres with high hopes of improving their standard of living. According to Abah (2010), the deplorable condition of the Nigerian rural sector is emphatic and more worrisome is that even the few policies and programs put in place and implemented by government over the years have not resulted in significant improvement in the development of the rural areas in Nigeria (Ezeah, 2005).<br/> Incessant and excessive rural urban migration has brought about a lot of socio-economic difficulties both in the rural and urban areas. McCarthy (2004), opined that ‘excessive urbanization leads to high rate of urban congestion, crime and poor infrastructure such as proper sewage disposal system, safe and portable drinking water, electricity and other amenities, chronic unemployment with the attendant creation of large slums and Shanty towns’. Many developing countries including Nigeria have made several attempts to resolve these problems of rural underdevelopment and desertion. In Nigeria, from the Colonial period till date, successive administrations have tried to reform the rural areas where over 75% of Nigerians live in for the sake of attaining balanced growth and development, and discourage rural-urban migration, to no avail (Omonigho, 2013).

This is because a sizeable majority of the population lives therein therefore; the future of the country depends largely on it.<br/> The American Bureau of Census classifies a group of people living in a community having a population of not more than 2,500 people as rural, whereas in Nigeria, the Federal Office of Statistics defines a community with less than 20,000 people as rural. According to Afolayan (1995), rural areas can be easily identified by various criteria, apart from population. Such criteria include the level of infrastructural development i.e. road networks, educational institutions, water supply, electricity, health facilities, communication, etc. Other criteria used include Occupation, Housing, Extent of community planning etc.<br/> Typically, rural dwellers are less vocal, characterized by a culture of poverty, as most people live barely above subsistence level (Laah et al, 2013). Rural areas in developing countries are usually deprived of the basic needs of life such as housing, medical care, postal communication, education, transport etc.<br/> Specifically, rural areas refer to geographical areas that lie outside the densely built-up environment of towns, cities and the sub-urban villages and whose inhabitants are engaged primarily in agriculture as well as the most basic of rudimentary form of secondary and tertiary activities (Ezeah, 2005). Rural area, which is the opposite of an urban area, refers to the country side whose population engages mainly in primary production activities like agriculture, fishing, and rearing of livestock (Ele, 2006). About 90 percent of the rural labour workforce engages directly or indirectly in agriculture (Nyagba, 2009).<br/> The rural sector of Nigeria is, very vital to the socio-economic development of the nation. According to Nyagba (2009), the most important sector of the Nigerian population is the rural areas. This is because the rural sector is the major source of capital formation for the country and a principal market for domestic and raw materials for industrial processes (Ugwuanyi and Emma, 2013). Rural area dwellers have been found to engage in primary economic activities that form the foundation for the country’s economic development (Abah, 2010).<br/> Given the contributions of the rural sector to the national economy, enhancing the development of the sector should be central to government and public administration. This is necessary as such would further enhance the ability of the sector for increased contribution to the overall national growth and development. In most countries, development is most desirous in the rural areas where bulk of the population resides. The development of rural areas signals to a greater extent the level of national development and the situation of the nations in the development ladder.<br/> Rural development has therefore been described in different ways by different authors, depending on the discipline or line of thought. This is because the approach to rural development is multidisciplinary. According to Aslam (1981) rural development is a process aimed at developing the rural poor, their economy and institutions from a state of stagnation or low productivity equilibrium into dynamic process leading to higher levels of living and better quality of life. Similarly, Schumacher (1983) defined rural development as developing the skill of the masses to make them self-reliant through instructions which supply appropriate and relevant knowledge on the methods of self-help. Rural development is a strategy which is designed to improve the economic and social life of a specific group of people, the rural poor.<br/> It involves extending the developmental strides and benefits people who seek a livelihood in the rural areas such as small-scale farmers, tenants etc in order to improve their means of livelihood and mitigate the massive rural urban migration (Aliy, 1999). Rural-urban migration occurs at varying levels in every country. However, the challenges and prospects of rural development in Nigeria have been of great concern to the different tiers of government due to the rate of rural-urban migration.<br/> Different motives account for rural urban migration amongst rural dwellers such as socio-cultural issues where people are forced to migrate to avoid numerous social problems at their place of origin (Agyemang, 2013), poor infrastructural development and lack of basic amenities, search for better economic opportunities such as jobs etc. Accessibility and ease of transportation and communication has also been noted to facilitate rural urban migration, this view is based on the extension of road networks from major towns to peripheral-urban and rural areas that resulted in the decrease in transportation cost and improved communication systems.<br/> 1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/> Given the contributions of the rural sector to the national economy, enhancing the development of the sector should be priority to government and relevant stakeholders. This is necessary as such would further enhance the ability of the sector for increased contribution to the overall national growth and development. Unfortunately, over the years, the development strategies and efforts in Nigeria has been more urban based resulting in the relative neglect of rural areas as evidenced by the dearth of basic infrastructure in the rural areas such as good roads, well equipped and functional hospitals, electricity, pipe borne water etc (Abah, 2010).<br/> Abonyi and Nnamani (2011) also noted that rural poverty persists in Nigeria despite the prosperity created by the country’s oil wealth as evidenced by the difficulty experienced in getting basic daily needs such as food, water and shelter. Lack of these basic life needs in the rural areas has made a number of rural dwellers migrate to urban centres with high hopes of improving their standard of living. According to Abah (2010), the deplorable condition of the Nigerian rural sector is emphatic and more worrisome is that even the few policies and programs put in place and implemented by government over the years have not resulted in significant improvement in the development of the rural areas in Nigeria (Ezeah, 2005).<br/> Incessant and excessive rural urban migration has brought about a lot of socio-economic difficulties both in the rural and urban areas. McCarthy (2004), opined that ‘excessive urbanization leads to high rate of urban congestion, crime and poor infrastructure such as proper sewage disposal system, safe and portable drinking water, electricity and other amenities, chronic unemployment with the attendant creation of large slums and Shanty towns’. Many developing countries including Nigeria have made several attempts to resolve these problems of rural underdevelopment and desertion. In Nigeria, from the Colonial period till date, successive administrations have tried to reform the rural areas where over 75% of Nigerians live in for the sake of attaining balanced growth and development, and discourage rural-urban migration, to no avail (Omonigho, 2013).

In recent time the Nigeria government has shown strong commitment to growth in higher education sector by the establishment of more institutions especially polytechnics and the liberalization of its ownership. While this is the focus of the government little or no attention is given to the provision of accommodation in the polytechnic to meet the rising student population. As a result of this majority of the student population take solace in the rental market for alternative accommodation. The demand has resulted in the establishment of niche market because student’s market especially appears to be robust. Hence, Peacocke (1999) opined that the major characteristics of students demand is that it monopolizes the market thereby reducing supply to other tenant groups. For instance, close to 80% of students’ populations of the Rufus Giwa polytechnic, Owo, Ondo State are living in privately rented accommodation. The result of this is a sharp increase in rent since the available housing accommodation even in the rental market are not enough to meet the demand. In the past, houses were completed by landlords or property investors, but today, students struggle to make payment even when such accommodation are yet to be completed.<br/>The landlords and investors exploit this situation and rents are arbitrary fixed and outrageous. Therefore, this study aims at investigating the impact of student population on the rental values around the polytechnic neighborhood.<br/>Polytechnic as a social institution is seen as a great system concerned with imparting knowledge and skills, which help an individual to participate in the society (Ramon-Yusuf, 2003). Babalola and Okediran (1997) views Polytechnic education as that which facilitates creation of knowledge and innovation for the overall socio-economic empowerment of the individual and community development. Historically in Nigeria, majority of the Polytechnics were located at the community outskirts so as to create conducive environment for learning; less difficulty in getting required land size and the minimum financial implication attached. However, these polytechnics including the Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo have enjoyed circumferential expansion in their neighborhoods primarily because of the functions they perform.<br/>A polytechnic may generate different sort of impacts in a neighborhood. The presence of a polytechnic in a derelict area may initiate the transformation of the entire neighbourhood through the action of development, regenerating houses in order to attract students, staff, and those providing support services to live nearby (Perry and Wiewel, 2005). More also, polytechnic can also function completely apart from the surrounding neighborhoods, ignoring social problems (Anamaria and Melchior, 2007).<br/>Anamaria and Melchior (2007) used two concepts to analyze the impacts produced by the presence of a tertiary institution in an area: to include magnets and enclave. The first concept used to describe the impacts of large land owners such as the polytechnic is the “magnet”. In urban terms, magnet represents a concept or metaphor which describes a territory in the metropolitan area which attracts people and economic activity towards it. Polytechnics can be qualified as magnets since they have the power of attracting many students, schools/faculties and staff as well as business and institutional activities to a specified region in a town. Polytechnics, when acting as a magnet, besides attracting uses that promote urban and economic growth, attracts activities regarded as damaging by particular groups in the society (Anamaria and Melchior, 2007). The second concept used to describe the impact of large land owners such as the polytechnics is the “enclave”. A new enclave represents a self contained place or region of the city, with uses or morphology different from the one of the surrounding neighborhood (Anamaria and Melchior, 2007).</p> <p>According to Perry and Wiewel (2005), a polytechnic has traditionally seen itself as an enclave, “removed enough from the immediacy and demands of modern life to produce the knowledge and information with which to better understand the society”. Depending on the externality, the role of polytechnics as magnets most times overcomes their features as enclaves. Therefore, the concepts of magnets and enclaves represent an important methodological tool in the analysis of the impacts and externalities by the polytechnics on their neighborhoods (Anamaria and Melchior, 2007). Polytechnics and colleges primarily acquire land and structures that support their core mission or immediate growth demands, it is however not uncommon for surrounding communities to criticize polytechnics for their unresponsive development policies or lack of a plan to mitigate negative spillover effects (Sungu-Erylimaz, 2009). For neighbourhood residents, some of the major concerns relate to quality of life issues, such as conversion of houses and other buildings to student occupancy; upward pressure on rents; adaptation of shops and facilities to student markets; and increase in traffic, noise, and parking problems (Harasta, 2008)<br/><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Ankali (2007) carried out a study on the impact of tertiary institutions on residential property values in the Federal Polytechnic, Ede and found out that the establishment of the polytechnic led to the influx of people into the town, thereby, making the residential property market subsector experience a moderate increase in rental values between 1994 and 1997. Another slight increase was also experienced between 1998 and 1999 and the highest rental increment was observed between 2001 and 2005. However, tenement properties close to the Polytechnic experienced the highest rental growth rate. The researcher is examining in this study the impact of student population on rental value around the Rufus Giwa Polytechnic neighborhood.<br/><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>To examine the impact of student population on rental value around Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo.<br/>To examine the relationship between student population and rental value.<br/>To examine the impact of distance from Rufus Giwa Polytechnic Owo on the residential rental value.<br/><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>What is the impact of student population on rental value around Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo?<br/>What is the relationship between student population and rental value?<br/>What is the impact of distance from Rufus Giwa Polytechnic Owo on the residential rental value?<br/>1.5 HYPOTHESIS<br/>HO: There is no significant relationship between student population and rental value around Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo.<br/>HA: There is significant relationship between student population and rental value around Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo.<br/><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>The outcome of this study will educate the general public especially the higher institutions neighborhood communities on the impact of student population on the rental value.<br/>This research will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of the effect of personality trait on student’s academic performance, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.<br/><strong>1.7 SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study will cover the relationship between student population and rental value around Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo.<br/><strong>LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong><br/>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<br/>Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

An individual can satisfy this need by either occupying his own (owner’s occupier) property or renting another persons property. In our traditional society, the need for shelter is mainly met through the first alternative, that is owner occupation. With the emergency of urban centres, the situation has changed. Many people are no longer about to own property because of the difficulty in the acquisition of land and the high cost of building construction. Therefore, they are left with the alternative of renting other people’s properties in order to satisfy their need for shelter. Consequently two classes of urban resident have emerged, the landlord and the tenant under this arrangement the tenant pays to the landlord a certain amount of money in consideration for his use of the landlord’s house. This amount is popularly known as rent</p> <p>.<br/>During the civil war the Nigeria that is 1966 to 1970 many landed properties in the urban areas of the former Eastern Region of Nigeria, including Port-Harcourt , were destroyed. Consequently, there was a sharp decline in the supply of landed properties after the war. Furthermore, the post – civil war period witnessed an unprecedented number of the rural population trooping into the urban centres due to the conspicuous prosperity brought about in the urban area by the oil boom. This resulted to high demand for the existing limited supply of landed properties. Consequent upon these, rent for landed properties increased considerably.<br/>This trend has continued with the effect that “the average worker is paying between 30% to 40% of his salary as rent ” (Oshadiya, 1985). Thus the increase in rents on the properties has led to the variation of rent on properties.<br/>In urban area due to location advantage (for example prime location) which some properties offer above others for commercial and residential uses, rent tend to very on account of the type of use which a property can offer. </p> <p><br/><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong><br/>Location of economic properties has been a difficult concept to understand. Although the primary objective of commercial properties is the derivation of financial gains, while that of residential properties is for habitation, shelter and comfort, the demand for land is a refection of the profitability or utility derivable from it use. The greater the benefit to be obtained from a particular use, the higher the rent that the user will be willing to pay for it.<br/>There appear to be wide ranging differences in the levels of rent passing on residential and commercial properties in Port-Harcourt  and Nigeria generally.<br/>This research is seeking among other things to find out the causes of rental variation in commercial and residential properties in Nigeria, Ogui New Layout as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.3  PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The main purpose of this research is to examine the reasons for rental variation in commercial and residential properties with a view to provide tool to be used in catching issues related to rent on these properties in Port-Harcourt  and Nigeria generally.<br/>In order to achieve the standard goals, the following objective are to be undertaken;</p> <ol><li>To identify the current level of rents for commercial and residential properties in the study area.</li> <li>To ascertain and examine the factors influencing the rents being commanded by these properties.</li> <li>To specify the implications of rental variation on decisions to acquire those properties.</li> <li>To determine the trend in rental values for residential and commercial properties in the study area.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The finding of this study will be of benefit to the following;<br/>Firstly, tenants who are charged rents based on different reasons, especially when the properties are of the same nature (physically). This will again enable the investors not only to understand how occupier thinks, but also why and the things they consider before acquiring properties for certain uses. For example residential and commercial use.<br/>Secondly, the generality of the public can now understand the reason why the rents being commanded by these properties have to differ.<br/>Lastly, this research work will help to determine the factors influencing, commercial and residential properties which is an essential pre-requisite to successful development as well as stimulating interest in the students to carryout out further research on the topic.</p> <p><strong>1.5  SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The study covers a period of three years (2002 to 2004) and it is restricted to selected properties (Residential and commercial) comprising blocks of flat and tenements in Ogui New Layout, Port-Harcourt .</p> <p><br/><strong>1.6  LIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>Expectedly, this work met with some hindrances during the stage of data collection. The issue of rent passing on a property (residential or commercial) is usually regarded as classified information, which is not easily disclosed to people particularly researchers. This was largely suspected to be the reason why some Estate surveyors, property owners, tenants, Estate firms, property companies and even Estate agents who where approached through oral interviews, discussions and visitations found it rather difficult to reveal essential information despite every explanation that the exercise is strictly for academic purposes, a good number of them, still nursed the fear that it may be for property rating and taxation purposes. There was also the problem of logistics occasioned by the society. The researcher worked with a very light  budget throughout the period of study as the frequent and repeated visits to relevant persons and offices entailed quite some money. Moreover, also recall that some of the interview respondents were not co-operative as they kept on playing to the gallery as a means of avoiding supplying the required information. On a general not however, the researcher ensured that these bottle – necks never affected the findings of this study since the success far outweighed the hindrances as enumerated.</p> <p><br/><strong>1.7</strong>           <strong>DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS</strong><br/>In a study of this magnitude, it is necessary to define the various terms to distinguish between operational definitions and constitutive definitions to avoid ambiguity. Constitutive definition involves substituting the concept or construct being defined with other concepts or constructs. Operational definition requires that the concept or construct be assigned a type of meaning which one wants it to carry throughout the study (Asika, 1999).</p> <p><strong>Facilities Management</strong>, as applied to the hospitality sector, is defined as the proactive management of constructed facilities and organizational assets to improve their efficiency and add value to their performance and services (Okoroh, Jones and IIozor, 2003). This is in tandem with Alexander’s (1996: 1) definition as ‘the process by which an organization delivers and sustains support services in a quality environment to meet strategic needs’. This study borrows from these two definitions and proposes that facilities management, as applied to the property  business, is the proactive management of facilities, support services and organizational assets to improve their efficiency and add value to the core accommodation they provide for their customers to meet organizational strategic objectives. Facilities, in the context of property s, include buildings, industrial kitchen equipment, restaurant, halls of all categories, central air-conditioning system, fans, elevators, lifts, electrical installations, escalators, bakery equipment, recreational facilities including golf courses. This essentially tallies with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ Facilities Management Skill Panel’s (1993) [Cited in Owen, 1993] assertion that FM consists of the management of support services; the management of property and the management of information technology. This research adopts this definition totally and as an exploratory study focuses on the three (support services, property and information technology) as they apply to property  organizations. rental variation<br/><strong>Property  Effectiveness</strong></p> <p><br/>Effective property  combines resources and activities to generate the property  environment vital to the success of the organization. At corporate level, it contributes to the delivery of strategic and tactical objectives. On a day-to-day level, effective property  provides a safe and efficient working environment which is essential to the performance of the establishment and give the customer what he wants and needs at a price he is prepared to pay while the property  sells itself. rental variation</p> <p><br/><strong>Property  Stakeholders</strong><br/>Property  stakeholders are the people who are involved in property  organizations either as investors, general managers, and property  workers of all categories including line staff and facilities managers and property  users or customers. commercial properties</p> <p><br/><strong>Management Style</strong><br/>This refers to property asset sustenance method that is being applied in the running of the property  and it could be maintenance management, property management or facilities management<br/><strong>Operational Excellence:</strong> This according to Torkildsen (1992) is anything or everything being done to satisfy customers’ requirements and meet the organizational goals and objectives in a sustainable way. This study adopts this definition for its operation.<br/><strong>Support Services:</strong> These are functions that are accessories or adjunct to the core services in many organizations. For property  businesses some are rendered as revenue yielding activities while some are part of the total package. They include mail services, fleet cars, catering, reception, housekeeping, and office administration; refuse disposal, reprographics, car park management, horticulture and porterage. This is in agreement with the schedule of support services as identified by (Owen, 1995).</p> <p><br/><strong>Strategic Estate Management</strong><br/>Aakers (1984:6) defined strategy as “the development of a sustainable competitive advantage with which to compete in a chosen product/market”. However, in line with Thorncroft’s (1965) view and for this research, strategic estate management means property assets’ management decisions that determine the overall direction of business and its ultimate viability in the light of the predictable, the unpredictable and the known and unknown changes that may occur in its most immediate surrounding environments which are considered sustainable. Such decisions may include adoption of facilities management, sales and lease back and change of use of strategic properties.</p> <p><br/><strong>1.8</strong>        <strong>THE STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS</strong><br/>The thesis consists of seven chapters, organized in a logical manner in order to enable the readers to appreciate the thoughts of the author in achieving the objectives of the study.

It is a hotbed for political fermentation, such that generates centripetal attraction from all corners of the country, perhaps nowhere has the need for judicious use and preservation of exhaustive land resources become imperative in Nigeria today than the Federal Capital City. From the outcome of the panel set up by the Federal Government led by Justice T.A Aguda to relocate the Federal Capital Territory from Lagos to Abuja, an 8,000km2 land was carved out of the central region of the country to serve as the Federal Capital Territory for the Nation. There was a misconception that the original inhabitants’ population to be resettled was only between 25,000 and 50,000. However, a later survey in 1984 revealed that their actual population was about 150,000. More than 30 years later, this population has multiplied many times as a result of natural increase and migration.<br/>It is pertinent to understand that the 8,000km2 as the size of the FCT, was not recommended by the International Planning Associates (IPA), the planning firm that produced the Abuja Master Plan, but by the FCT Location Committee, and has been defined in the 1976 FCT Decree even before the IPA was commissioned in June 1977 to plan the city, with the size as one of the terms of reference. Thus, the Abuja master plan has originally been designed with the concept that the whole area has already been evacuated. It was later discovered that the number of the original inhabitants was grossly underestimated. The resettlement cost was astronomical, to the extent of being higher than the money needed for the city development (Elleh, 2012). It therefore became necessary to change the resettlement policy from total evacuation to phases, depending on the actual area needed for the city development.<br/>In ideal situation what should precede plot allocation are land availability, layout design and provision of infrastructure. In order to avoid waste, plots sizes are supposed to be determined relative to the needs of the allotees. If ones need could be contained in 500m2, then any excess portion beside that is a colossal waste of the land resources. Many others that need it could not get because somebody already has the title. In April 2012, the FCT Minister made a revelation at a stakeholders forum, that 90% of allocated plots in the FCT are not developed, which he attributed to lack of infrastructure. Because aggregate provision of infrastructure in the FCT since existence is not more than 25%. However, it is interesting to note that, till date there are many plots in Phase I that were provided with the infrastructure for almost 30 years, but without meaningful development or are fenced only. Recently, there is another very disturbing revelation. It is plot no 2 cadastral zone E13 Gude District sized 465Ha. The outrageous allocation was made to an Accenture Associates Ltd, with address as no. 3104 Mpape, Kaduna Abuja Expressway. The allocation was made dated just only 2 months to the end of the administration. It is now in the property market, being speculated for billions of naira. Still there are large hectare allocations of the Ebele and Obasanjo farms (Jerremy, 2014).<br/>Land Use and Allocation Committee (LUAC) is to make recommendation for lands allocations, but allocations are at times made before reverting to the LUAC.<br/>The model is a misnomer of Financing Urban Infrastructure with Land Value, Never feasible for affordable housing, Distortion of the sharing formula, Not only providing the infrastructure but also saddling the responsibility of resettlement on the developer</p> <p>.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Abuja officially became Nigeria’s capital on 12 December 1991, replacing Lagos, though the latter remains the country’s most populous city. At the 2006 census, the city of Abuja had a population of 776,298, making it one of the ten most populous cities in Nigeria. Abuja has witnessed a huge influx of people into the city; the growth has led to the emergence of satellite towns such as Karu Urban Area, Suleja, Gwagwalada, Lugbe, Kuje and smaller settlements to which the planned city is sprawling. This growth has affected land availability thereby creating a lot of challenges, a situation whereby whoever needs a land cannot get it easily. However, the researcher is examining Abuja land availability, the challenges and mismanagement involved with a view of proffering solution.</p> <p><br/>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the objectives of this study:<br/>1.

The outcome of this study will enlighten the Nigeria public on the land related issues in Abuja. It will educate on the challenges and issues of Abuja land availability with a view of identifying the solutions.<br/>2. This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic</p> <p><br/>1.7 SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>This study on Abuja Land availability, challenges and mismanagement will cover all the issues related to land availability, mismanagement in Abuja</p> <p>.<br/>LIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<br/>Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

This performance is as a result of the process used in the drying of the wood species. Wood can be dried through natural and artificial drying method but natural method required little skills and cost in obtaining desirable result.

Once an environment is free of indecent waste, its impact is usually seen in all aspects of life of individuals having contact with that environment. The focus of this study was to assess the effect of waste disposal practices in Yenagoa metropolis of Bayelsa State. The need for effective management of solid waste is an issue that has required public health attention in various parts of the globe. It is of utmost importance to ensure that solid waste products are properly managed in order to prevent the occurrence of attendant problems associated with poor waste management including water contamination, air contamination, increased prevalence of vector-borne diseases, infection spread etc. Improper waste management methods have been shown to contribute to the decrease in the quality of health of a population as a result of environmental health nuisances that have arisen as a result of these poor waste management methods (Oyebode, 2013; Igbinomwanhia et al., 2014; Awajiogak, 2013). These waste products broadly called Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), includes effluents arising from agricultural, industrial, construction, mining and exploration or commercial activities which could be gaseous, solid, semi-solid or liquid in nature; garbage disposed at refuse dumps, abandoned non-functional cars/equipments and all other materials which are regarded as no longer useful. These waste products are however at certain times are not properly disposed or managed which in turn leads to the occurrence of environmental of environmental and public health challenges (Onwughara et al., 2010; Schübeler et al., 1996; Karija et al., 2013). Municipal solid waste management however remains a major environmental health challenge in Nigeria which has been attributed to indiscriminate roadside refuse disposal, open dumping of waste products, a massive unplanned urbanization trend and growth of the population, absence of actionable guidelines as regards refuse dumping and refuse dumpsites, inadequacy in funding, laxity in the practice of effective waste management as well as absence of organized waste management systems etc (Igbinomwanhia et al., 2014; Abah and Ohimain, 2010; Agwu, 2012). An assessment of the urban waste problem in Nigeria has revealed that Nigerian cities were among the dirtiest cities in the world and that over 80% of Nigerians use waste disposal methods that are not in line with World Health Organization standards (Federal Ministry of Environment, 2002). It is noteworthy to state that the government of Nigeria on its own part has played significant roles in ensuring that this menace is curbed through the enactment of regulations and legislations that ensure the practice of adequate waste management. This is however not enough on its own as the populace must also be educated on how best they can adhere to these laws as non-adherence not just only leads to facing penalties from environmental health agencies but can also lead to deterioration in health as well as deaths. This is an issue that must be addressed round the clock despite the many challenges being faced by the relevant waste management authorities. Environmental health education should be put into play, strict adherence and enforcement of environmental health laws and regulations, provision of adequate waste disposal methods for the populace, timely and proper waste management by relevant authorities, recycling of waste materials etc are some ways by which the prevailing occurrence of poor waste management can be tackled and thus providing a more healthy environment for labour and productivity (Onwughara et al., 2010; Karija et al., 2013; Owoeye and Okojie, 2013; Kafando et al., 2013). Seeing that effective and proper waste management practice is a problem that impacts on the health of individuals in Nigeria, it was necessary to carry this study to assess the waste disposal practices in Yenagoa metropolis of Bayelsa State as it provided a framework for evaluation of waste management efforts and provided areas that needed further attention in order to ensure achievement of effective waste disposal and management in Bayelsa State.The management of solid waste, perhaps, stands as the most visible environmental problem facing the capital and communities of Bayelsa State. The problem is growing daily as a result of increasing urbanization. The solid waste problem is visible in most parts of the communities within the Yenagoa metropolis, on the roads, within the neighbourhoods and around residential buildings. The environment of man lies at the mercy of both natural disaster and negligence on the part of man in the course of controlling the gifts of nature. The later takes the form of dumping solid waste in an uncompromising pattern, that can cause; desert encroachment, erosion, depletion of ozone layer, depletion of natural resources, pollution of land, rivers, the air and generally the environment (Aguwanba,1998). According to Egunlobi (2004), in the early times (pre- colonial days) up till 1970s, the disposal of refuse and other waste did not pose any significant problem. The population was small and enough land was available for assimilation of waste. Solid waste problem started with urban growth, resulted partly from nationalincrease in population and more importantly from immigration. Ndakara (2011) also states that the quantity of such waste depends mainly on location, activity and number of people in the household. However, it was not until the mid- 19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating cholera outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged. Thus the social reformer, Sir, Edwin Chadwick’s 1842 report on “The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population, became influential in securing the passage of the first legislation of waste clearance and disposal, in which he argues for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city’s population. (Barbalace, 2003). Early garbage removal trucks were simply open bodied dump trucks pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first closed body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain. These were soon equipped with “hopper mechanisms” where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The Garwood Load Packer was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor (Herbert, 2007). Mba (2003), noted that no town in Nigeria especially the urban and semi- urban centres of high population density can boast of having found a lasting solution to the problem of filth and huge piles of solid waste, rather the problem continues to assume monstrous dimensions. To urban and city dwellers, public hygiene starts and ends within their immediate surrounding and indeed the city would, take care of itself. The situation has so deteriorated that today the problem of solid waste management has become one of the nation’s most serious environmental problem (Okpala, 2002). Ineffective waste management could rubbish all the resources and efforts put in beautifying the environment. Every year, the government of Nigeria, Bayelsa state inclusive spends billions of naira to roll back malaria, without focusing on some environmental factors such as poor waste management that makes malaria to thrive. Blocked drains provide stagnant water which facilitates the breeding of mosquitoes and other sickness causing germs (Ogadimma, 2011).</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problem of ineffective and inadequate Waste management is a major problem to our society and the world at large, this is because improper waste management has led to the outspread of various diseases and health and environmental hazard.</p> <ol><li>Generation of toxic air and water pollutants, along with mountains of solid andhazardous wastes, which is becoming an overwhelming problem in YenagoaMetropolis.</li> <li>Strong possibility of a situation where failure to decide where to put waste or how todispose them safely will lead to the close down of some industries and result in wastebeing spread everywhere</li> </ol> <ul><li>The health effects of pollution, toxic waste and other environmental ills of modernsociety becomes a greater threat to man than diseases.</li> </ul> <p>1.3 <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of waste management as a panacea to disease prevention and healthy environment in Bayelsa state. Specifically it seeks to:</p> <ol><li>Examine the effectiveness of waste management in Bayelsa state.</li> <li>Examine how proper waste management can prevent disease and sustain healthy environment.</li> <li>To ascertain how effectively managed waste disposal in Bayelsa state</li> <li>To evaluate the consequences of improper waste management in Bayelsa state.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The following questions shall be answered in the course of this essay.</p> <ol><li>What are the implications of an improper waste disposal system?</li> <li>What is the present state of waste disposal in Bayelsa state?</li> </ol> <ul><li>What are the modern technologies involved in waste management and their long term benefits?</li> </ul> <ol><li>What method can be used to effectively managed waste in Bayelsa state?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>When Bayelsa State was created in 1996 from the still existing Rivers State, itbecame obvious from inception that the fledgling state will face great challengeson its path to attaining the growth and development that autonomy had bestowedon her.The challenges of waste disposal being experienced in the State Capital City(Yenagoa) is on the increase and at a very fast rate, upon this ills this researchfinds its significance.As Nigeria aims to be amongst the top 20 economies in the world by 2020, it isimperative that issues of waste management be tackled from the state level, andaddressed from city to city.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study covers the effect of refused disposal on human health in Bayelsa state. However the study has some limitation which ranges from:</p> <p><strong>Finance:</strong> finance is a major limitation to the study as resources allocated to the study is limited</p> <p><strong>Time: </strong>time is a major constrain to the research as time allocated to the study is very limited</p> <p><strong>Research material: </strong>availability of research material is a major set back to the scope of the study</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINATION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Waste and wastes are unwanted or unusable materials. Waste is any substance which is discarded after primary use, or it is worthless, defective and of no use.Examples include municipal solid waste (household trash/refuse), hazardous waste, wastewater (such as sewage, which contains bodily wastes (feces and urine) and surface runoff), radioactive waste, and others. human health</p> <p><strong>WASTE MANAGEMENT: </strong>The collection, transportation, and disposal of garbage, sewage, and other waste products. Waste management encompasses management of all processes and resources for proper handling of waste materials, from maintenance of waste transport trucks and dumping facilities to compliance with health codes and environmental regulations.</p> <p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT</strong>: This is the combination of all actions taken to reduce the impact of human activities on theenvironment; such actions are specifically geared towards sustainable development.Sustainable development can be describes as a form of development that is able to meet theneeds of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations tomeet their own needs. human health</p> <p><strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong>: The word “environment” is of French origin “environner”, meaning to encircle or surround.(Webster, 2015) defined the environment as the conditions that surround someone or something: the conditions and influences that affect the growth, health, progress, etc., of someone or something.These are the very things we depend upon on a daily basis e.g. water, food, market, industries,air, plants, and animals etc, the environment is a complexly interwoven system of ecology where a simple or drastic change in one aspect can emphatically or continually affect other aspects. human health</p> <p><strong>BAYELSA YENAGOA METROPOLIS</strong>: Yenagoa is the capital city of Bayelsa state, located in the southern part of Nigeria.

Ten communities were randomly selected in the coastal region of Ondo State. In the two local government areas that were selected, two sets of structured questionnaires were administered to ten randomly selected respondents in each of the communities visited. The result of the study shows that 60% of the respondent in both communities has no formal education. In Okitipupa, 50% of the respondents earn₦ 80,000-₦100,000 while 44% of the respondents in Ese-odo community earn between ₦60,000-₦80,000 per annum. This study also showed that 38% and 36% of the respondents in Ese-odo and Okitipupa community respectively have transportation problems. The Lorenz curve in the study show the cumulative income share against the percentage of forest dwellers indicates that there is inequality in the income of the respondents. Government should help provide good roads and health centers in the rural areas of the study area. This will help to solve transportation problem faced by many of the forest dwellers of the study area. By providing health centers, many of the respondents that are faced with ill-health problems will have access to better health services.  forest dwellers</p>\n\nANALYSIS OF POVERTY STATUS OF FOREST DWELLERS IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN ONDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF POVERTY STATUS OF FOREST DWELLERS IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN ONDO STATE", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <div>   <div> THE EFFECTS OF CONSTRUCTION DELAYS ON PROJECTS DELIVERY IN NIGERIA <strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong><br/>Cover Page – – – – – – – – – –<br/>Title Page – – – – – – – – – –<br/>Certification – – – – – – – – – –<br/>Dedication – – – – – – – – – –<br/>Acknowledgement – – – – – – – – –<br/>Abstract – – – – – – – – – –<br/>Table of Content – – – – – – – – –<br/><strong>Chapter One: Introduction</strong><br/>Background of the Study – – – – – –<br/>Statement of the Problem – – – – – –<br/>Objectives of the Study – – – – – – –<br/>Research Questions – – – – – – –<br/>Research Hypotheses – – – – – – –<br/>Significance of the Study – – – – – – –<br/>Scope/ Limitation of the Study – – – – – –<br/>Definition of Terms – – – – – – –<br/><strong>Chapter Two: Review of Related Literature</strong><br/>2.1 Introduction – – – – – – – – –<br/>2.2 Conceptual Framework – – – – – – –<br/>2.3 Theoretical Framework – – – – – – –<br/>2.4 Empirical Review – – – – – – – – <strong>Chapter Three: Research Methodology</strong><br/>3.1 Introduction – – – – – – – –<br/>3.1 Research Design – – – – – – – –<br/>3.3 Area of the Study – – – – – – – –<br/>3.4 Population of the Study – – – – – – –<br/>3.5 Sample Size and Sampling Techniques – – – –<br/>3.6 Instrumentation – – – – – – – –<br/>3.7 Validation of the Instrument – – – – – –<br/>3.8 Administration of the Instrument – – – – –<br/>3.9 Method of Data Analysis – – – – – – – <strong>Chapter Four: Presentation, Analysis and Interpretation of Data</strong><br/>4.1 Introduction – – – – – – – – –<br/>4.2 Presentation and Analysis of Data – – – – –<br/>4.3 Testing of Hypotheses – – – – – – –<br/>4.4 Discussion of Findings – – – – – – –<br/><strong>Chapter Five: Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations</strong><br/>5.1 Introduction – – – – – – – – –<br/>5.2 Summary – – – – – – – – –<br/>5.3 Conclusion – – – – – – – – –       Abstract<br/>Construction delay has become endemic in Nigeria. It is imperative to create awareness of the extent to which delays can adversely affect project delivery. This paper identifies, by questionnaire evaluates and through empirical method assesses the effects of construction delays. The findings showed that time and cost overruns were frequent effects of delay. Delay had significant effect on completion cost and time of 61 building projects studied. Client-related delay is significant in Nigeria. Acceleration of site activities coupled with improved clients’ project management procedure and inclusion of appropriate contingency allowance in precontract estimate should assuage the adverse effect of construction delays. </div> </div>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF CONSTRUCTION DELAYS ON PROJECTS DELIVERY IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF CONSTRUCTION DELAYS ON PROJECTS DELIVERY IN NIGERIA", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHALLENGES OF POOR DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND FLOODS  CONTROL IN LAGOS METROPOLIS, NIGERIA</strong></p> <p>Flooding is persistent in Lagos Metropolis.

Floods are as wide as 500m and above on each side of the channels and as high as 2.00m at some times and localities. There are some advantages associated with it. Living habits of the inhabitants have to change. Physical planning efforts have to be drastic, radical and deterministic towards sustainable drainage and erosion<br/>channels. There must be massive investment in dredging and re-dredging of the existing drainage network and channelization of the new suburbs.

Although more frequent floods are recorded in Niger, Adamawa, Oyo, Kano and Jigawa states possibly due to the influence of rivers Niger, Benue, Ogun and Hadeja, Lagos state seems to have experienced most of the floods in the country. With rapid population growth and urbanization in the country the risk of flooding to human lives and properties assumes critical dimensions.Critically, poor awareness of the hazard is a major impasse towards its management. This creates a significant gap in the knowledge of how to improve on the current efforts towards addressing the challenges of flooding in Nigeria. Since attempts to tackle the hazard appear to be limited, the present study is driven by the need to identify those limitations in the flood management efforts in Nigeria. Possible way-forward are suggested based on a critical review of flooding and its management in Nigeria, allied with globally acknowledged ‘best practices’ in flood risk reduction and lessons learned from other countries’ experiences of flooding.</p>\n\nFLOOD HAZARD MAPPING AND RISK MANAGEMENT IN PARTS OF LAGOS STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FLOOD HAZARD MAPPING AND RISK MANAGEMENT IN PARTS OF LAGOS STATE", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION AND RURAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</p> <p>The movement of human beings from areas of origin to area of final destination is a natural phenomenon among human societies.

Purposive sampling was used to select research participants, both key informants and focus group participants’ from the entire population. Research participants revealed that the people of Kpongu perceived development as provision of social infrastructure as well as improve standard of living which is a motivating factor for migration. To most of the respondents, migration was positive and brings about improved standard of living. It was revealed that some of the causes of rural-urban migration in Kpongu include lack of economic opportunities, inadequate social amenities among others.

This is because a sizeable majority of the population lives therein therefore; the future of the country depends largely on it. community mobilization<br/>The American Bureau of Census classifies a group of people living in a community having a population of not more than 2,500 people as rural, whereas in Nigeria, the Federal Office of Statistics defines a community with less than 20,000 people as rural. According to Afolayan (1995), rural areas can be easily identified by various criteria, apart from population. Such criteria include the level of infrastructural development i.e. road networks, educational institutions, water supply, electricity, health facilities, communication, etc. Other criteria used include Occupation, Housing, Extent of community planning etc.<br/>Typically, rural dwellers are less vocal, characterized by a culture of poverty, as most people live barely above subsistence level (Laah et al, 2013). Rural areas in developing countries are usually deprived of the basic needs of life such as housing, medical care, postal communication, education, transport etc.<br/>Specifically, rural areas refer to geographical areas that lie outside the densely built-up environment of towns, cities and the sub-urban villages and whose inhabitants are engaged primarily in agriculture as well as the most basic of rudimentary form of secondary and tertiary activities (Ezeah, 2005). Rural area, which is the opposite of an urban area, refers to the country side whose population engages mainly in primary production activities like agriculture, fishing, and rearing of livestock (Ele, 2006). About 90 percent of the rural labour workforce engages directly or indirectly in agriculture (Nyagba, 2009).<br/>The rural sector of Nigeria is, very vital to the socio-economic development of the nation. According to Nyagba (2009), the most important sector of the Nigerian population is the rural areas. This is because the rural sector is the major source of capital formation for the country and a principal market for domestic and raw materials for industrial processes (Ugwuanyi and Emma, 2013). Rural area dwellers have been found to engage in primary economic activities that form the foundation for the country’s economic development (Abah, 2010).<br/>Given the contributions of the rural sector to the national economy, enhancing the development of the sector should be central to government and public administration. This is necessary as such would further enhance the ability of the sector for increased contribution to the overall national growth and development. In most countries, development is most desirous in the rural areas where bulk of the population resides. The development of rural areas signals to a greater extent the level of national development and the situation of the nations in the development ladder.<br/>Rural development has therefore been described in different ways by different authors, depending on the discipline or line of thought. This is because the approach to rural development is multidisciplinary. According to Aslam (1981) rural development is a process aimed at developing the rural poor, their economy and institutions from a state of stagnation or low productivity equilibrium into dynamic process leading to higher levels of living and better quality of life. Similarly, Schumacher (1983) defined rural development as developing the skill of the masses to make them self-reliant through instructions which supply appropriate and relevant knowledge on the methods of self-help. Rural development is a strategy which is designed to improve the economic and social life of a specific group of people, the rural poor.<br/>It involves extending the developmental strides and benefits people who seek a livelihood in the rural areas such as small-scale farmers, tenants etc in order to improve their means of livelihood and mitigate the massive rural urban migration (Aliy, 1999). Rural-urban migration occurs at varying levels in every country. However, the challenges and prospects of rural development in Nigeria have been of great concern to the different tiers of government due to the rate of rural-urban migration.<br/>Different motives account for rural urban migration amongst rural dwellers such as socio-cultural issues where people are forced to migrate to avoid numerous social problems at their place of origin (Agyemang, 2013), poor infrastructural development and lack of basic amenities, search for better economic opportunities such as jobs etc. Accessibility and ease of transportation and communication has also been noted to facilitate rural urban migration, this view is based on the extension of road networks from major towns to peripheral-urban and rural areas that resulted in the decrease in transportation cost and improved communication systems.</p> <p><br/><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Given the contributions of the rural sector to the national economy, enhancing the development of the sector should be priority to government and relevant stakeholders. This is necessary as such would further enhance the ability of the sector for increased contribution to the overall national growth and development. Unfortunately, over the years, the development strategies and efforts in Nigeria has been more urban based resulting in the relative neglect of rural areas as evidenced by the dearth of basic infrastructure in the rural areas such as good roads, well equipped and functional hospitals, electricity, pipe borne water etc (Abah, 2010).<br/>Abonyi and Nnamani (2011) also noted that rural poverty persists in Nigeria despite the prosperity created by the country’s oil wealth as evidenced by the difficulty experienced in getting basic daily needs such as food, water and shelter. Lack of these basic life needs in the rural areas has made a number of rural dwellers migrate to urban centres with high hopes of improving their standard of living. According to Abah (2010), the deplorable condition of the Nigerian rural sector is emphatic and more worrisome is that even the few policies and programs put in place and implemented by government over the years have not resulted in significant improvement in the development of the rural areas in Nigeria (Ezeah, 2005).<br/>Incessant and excessive rural urban migration has brought about a lot of socio-economic difficulties both in the rural and urban areas. McCarthy (2004), opined that ‘excessive urbanization leads to high rate of urban congestion, crime and poor infrastructure such as proper sewage disposal system, safe and portable drinking water, electricity and other amenities, chronic unemployment with the attendant creation of large slums and Shanty towns’. Many developing countries including Nigeria have made several attempts to resolve these problems of rural underdevelopment and desertion. In Nigeria, from the Colonial period till date, successive administrations have tried to reform the rural areas where over 75% of Nigerians live in for the sake of attaining balanced growth and development, and discourage rural-urban migration, to no avail (Omonigho, 2013). According to Nwakeze (2004), the Nigerian population is growing at an annual rate of 2.8 percent that of the urban population is growing at 5.5 percent, it is pertinent to note that this rate is among the highest in the world today. This therefore calls for urgent measures to be taken towards fast tracking rural development to reduce urban population explosion.</p> <p><br/><strong>1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br/>The general objective of this study is to determine the effect of rural development on rural urban migration. The specific objectives are;<br/>1. To determine whether rural development can serve as a panacea for rural urban migration<br/>2. To find out the socio-economic causes of rural urban  migration<br/>3. To determine the implications of rural urban migration on rural development<br/>4. To identify measures put in place for rural development by government</p> <p><br/><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>1. Can rural development serve as a panacea to rural urban migration?<br/>2. What are the socio-economic causes of rural urban migration?<br/>3. What are the consequences of rural urban migration on rural development?<br/>4. What measures are put in place by government to develop the rural areas?</p> <p><br/><strong>1.5 HYPOTHESES</strong><br/>In order to enable the researcher assess the effect of rural development in combating rural urban migration in Nigeria, the following hypotheses will be tested:<br/>1. Ho: Rural development does not have any influence on rural urban migration in Nigeria.<br/>HA: Rural development has an influence on rural urban migration in Nigeria</p> <p><br/><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study will help beam the searchlight on rural development and its substantive effect in combating rural urban migration in Nigeria. The study seeks to find out the socio-economic and cultural causes of rural-urban migration in the study area and its implications on rural development with respect to the study area; this will help in highlighting strategies adopted by the community members to cope with the situation and what can be done to curb the situation.<br/>This research study will also help reveal the extent of the problem to relevant stakeholders so that they can rise to the occasion and put in measures to develop the rural areas in order to reduce rural urban migration. Finally, this research work will add to the existing body of knowledge on the importance of rural development in combating rural urban migration in Nigeria</p> <p>.<br/>1.7 SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>This study will cover rural development and its impact on combating rural urban migration in Nigeria with special reference to the actual influence it has on the socio-economic activities and lives of rural dwellers, causes of rural-urban migration and measures put in place by relevant stakeholders to combat the menace of rural urban migration in the study area. The study will also cover all the rural areas and incidence of rural urban migration in Nigeria.</p> <p><br/>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Rural area: a geographical area located outside cities and towns with a relatively low population density and small settlements.<br/>Migration: movement of people across a specified boundary for the purpose of establishing a new or semi-permanent residence.<br/>Rural development: the process of improving the quality of life and economic well being of people living in relatively isolated and<br/>Rural urban migration: is a process of population shift from rural areas to urban areas with attendant increase in proportion of people living in urban areas.<br/>Infrastructure: basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>THE IMPACT ON MANAGEMENT OF ABANDONED PROJECT IN NIGERIA</p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><br/> The unceasing abandonment of residential buildings and development projects is so shocking in the developing countries such that Nigerian has remained one of the countries in such difficulty (Ayodele and Alabi, 2011; Kotangora, 1993; Osemenan, 1987). Therefore, the significance that the incessant abandonment of residential buildings and projects would bring several effects on real properties and its values and the economy cannot be overemphasized since some of the abandoned buildings and development projects provide the basic services that should enhance the real properties developed.</p> <p><br/> Abandoned residential building is a building whose occupant has moved out basically due to poor maintenance and infrastructure, security, dilapidation, natural disaster which has made the building not to be habitable. The abandonment of residential properties and development projects is the act of isolating the building or discontinuing any activities or maintenance works on such development project within a time frame of the contract agreement and with no intention of returning back to the development (Spelman, 1993). Similarly, O’Flaherty (1993) while reflecting on property development projects suggest that it is when an owner or developer is ceasing to provide the required maintenance management to a developed property. abandoned project.</p> <p><br/> However, real property development and maintenance being a capital intensive undertaking should be critically analyzed to ascertain its feasibility and viability before embarking on it. But, on several occasions and as it had been observed, governments, contractors and agencies have abandoned old buildings and development projects mid-way into construction and completion.</p> <p><br/> The causes and effects of these residential building abandonments are not just peculiar to a particular reason rather cut across several reasons (Ayodele and Alabi, 2011), and as well as creating a total dwindling effects on the values of developed properties located close and within the vicinity. Most of this abandoned residential building usually turned into hideout for criminals. abandoned project<br/> Although, the location of the abandoned property and demand is equally important but accessibility and the availabilities of the infrastructures in the real property location and in the surrounding built environment should be of much more significant determinants in this study context. Values in itself are not intrinsic (Schram, 2012) rather depends on the benefits derivable from that property.</p> <p><br/> While this remained the case for real properties, it is essential for any real property to have sustained improved values, and this is assumed to be influenced by the availability of the earlier mentioned infrastructures in the real property location. So, if the needed infrastructures are imperious in determining the property values. Benin City is the State Capital of Edo State, Nigeria is characterized with lots of abandoned residential building due to urbanization, poor infrastructures and roads. Residents of Benin City living in erosion prone areas have to pack out of their houses because of flooding and fear of reptiles. Some school buildings have been abandoned due to neglect by successive government which has turned into hideout for criminals and cultists. abandoned project.</p> <p>·          </p>\n\nTHE IMPACT ON MANAGEMENT OF ABANDONED PROJECT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT ON MANAGEMENT OF ABANDONED PROJECT IN NIGERIA", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>AN ASSESSMENT OF HOUSING CONDITION AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC LIFE STYLES OF SLUM DWELLERS IN AKURE,</p> <p> NIGERIA</p> <p>This paper examines the importance of housing to man as an essential need and a prerequisite for the survival of man after food.

Such efforts will help cities to reduce the financial burden on city authorities for waste management, as well as reduce the pressure on landfill requirements.

This gives a clear message to cities and municipalities that they should not try to do everything by themselves. Rather, the key to success is to do what they are good at, and collaborate with other sectors in the society, such as private sector, communities and in some cases with the informal sector, in the interest of expanding waste management services and improving efficiency and effectiveness.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT  OF REUSE, RECYCLING OF PLASTICS AND ESSENTIAL TO WASTE MANAGEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT  OF REUSE, RECYCLING OF PLASTICS AND ESSENTIAL TO WASTE MANAGEMENT", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>RECYCLING AND REUSE: ALTERNATIVES TO WASTE MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIA</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Cities are at the nexus of a further threat to the environment, namely the production of an increasing quantity and complexity of wastes.

Rather, the key to success is to do what they are good at, and collaborate with other sectors in the society, such as private sector, communities and in some cases with the informal sector, in the interest of expanding waste management services and improving efficiency and effectiveness.</p>\n\nRECYCLING AND REUSE: ALTERNATIVES TO WASTE MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RECYCLING AND REUSE: ALTERNATIVES TO WASTE MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 26}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE IMPACT OF SOLID WASTE LANDFILLS IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Solid wastes comprise all the wastes arising from human and animal activities that are normally solid, discarded as useless or unwanted. Also included are by- products of process lines or materials that may be required by law to be disposed of (Okecha 2000). Solid waste can be classified in a number of ways, on the basis of sources, environmental risks, utility and physical property.</p> <p>On the basis of source, solid wastes are again classified as: Municipal Solid Wastes, Industrial Solid Wastes and Agricultural Solid Wastes. Nigeria’s major urban centres are today fighting to clear mounting heaps of solid waste from their environments.</p> <p>These strategic centres of beauty, peace and security are being overtaken by the messy nature of over flowing dumps unattended heaps of solid wastes emanating from household or domestic or kitchen sources, markets, shopping and business centres. Solid Waste Landfills.</p> <p>City officials appear unable to combat unlawful and haphazard dumping of hazardous commercial and industrial wastes which are a clear violation of the clean Air and Health Edicts in our environmental sanitation laws, rules and regulation. Refuse generation and its likely effects on the health, quality of environment and the urban landscape have become burning national issues in Nigeria today. All stakeholders concern with the safety and the beautification of our environment have come to realise the negative consequences of uncleared solid human wastes found in residential neighbourhoods, markets, schools, and central business districts in our cities.</p> <p>These solid wastes have become recurring features in our urban environment. It is no longer in doubt that our cities are inundated with the challenges of uncleared solid wastes. As a result, urban residents are often confronted with the hazardous impact to their collective health and safety. The hue and cry over the health consequences of exposed and fermenting rubbish have not been quantified, although their impact is noticeable, especially in times of epidemic in congested activity nucleicivic centres, CBDS, neigbhourhoods, etc.</p> <p>A United Nations Report (August 2004) noted with regret that while developing countries are improving access to clean drinking water they are falling behind on sanitation goals. At one of its summit in 2000 (Uwaegbelun 2004) revealed that The World Health Organization- (WHO 2004) and United Nations International Children Education Fund- (UNICEF 2004) joint report in August 2004 that: “about 2.4 billion people will likely face the risk of needless disease and death by the target of 2015 because of bad sanitation”.</p> <p>The report also noted that bad sanitation – decaying or non-existent sewage system and toilets- fuels the spread of diseases like cholera and basic illness like diarrhea, which kills a child every 21 seconds. The hardest hit by bad sanitation is rural poor and residents of slum areas in fast-growing cities, mostly in Africa and Asia . Solid Waste Landfills.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF SOLID WASTE LANDFILLS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF SOLID WASTE LANDFILLS IN NIGERIA", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AN ANALYSIS OF POLITICAL PROBLEMS ON LANDFILL TAX IN NIGERIA</strong> </p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Cities are at the nexus of a further threat to the environment, namely the production of an increasing quantity and complexity of wastes. The estimated quantity of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated worldwide is 1.7 – 1.9 billion metric tons.2 In many cases, municipal wastes are not well managed in developing countries, as cities and municipalities cannot cope with the accelerated pace of waste production.</p> <p>Waste collection rates are often lower than 70 per cent in low-income countries. More than 50 per cent of the collected waste is often disposed of through uncontrolled landfilling and about 15 per cent is processed through unsafe and informal recycling. Landfill Emissions.Traditional Landfills</p> <p><strong>Municipal Solid Waste Management</strong></p> <p>As a Mayor, you may have to face challenging waste management decisions addressing issues that require immediate attention as well as potential issues that require strategic and integrated planning and implementation.</p> <p>Establishing and improving facilities for collection, recycling, treatment and disposal for MSW management can be very costly. For example, building and operating sanitary landfills and incineration plants require huge investments and incur substantial operation and maintenance costs.</p> <p>Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable locations for waste treatment facilities due to the prevalence of the Not In My Backyard (NIMBY) attitude amongst communities. Landfill Tax</p> <p>Meanwhile, if waste is growing at 3-5 per cent a year and rural-urban migration increases a city’s population at a similar rate, then a city’s waste generation will double every 10 years.4 Urban managers are therefore encouraged to pursue the paths of Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) and Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (3Rs) that place highest priority on waste prevention, waste reduction, and waste recycling instead of just trying to cope with ever-increasing amounts of waste through treatment and disposal.</p> <p>Landfill Tax Such efforts will help cities to reduce the financial burden on city authorities for waste management, as well as reduce the pressure on landfill requirements. We live in a world of increasing scarcity. Raw materials from natural resources are limited, financial resources are often insufficient, and securing land for final disposal is getting more difficult. Landfill Tax</p> <p>Clearly, city authorities should set policy directions aiming for resource efficient, recycle-based society if they are to provide a clean, healthy and pleasant living environment to its citizens for current and future generations.</p> <p>Although waste management responsibilities primarily lie with cities and municipalities, many of the successful cases in waste management involve a wide range of stakeholders in their implementation, as can be seen in the case studies cited here.Landfill Tax This gives a clear message to cities and municipalities that they should not try to do everything by themselves.</p> <p>Rather, the key to success is to do what they are good at, and collaborate with other sectors in the society, such as private sector, communities and in some cases with the informal sector, in the interest of expanding waste management services and improving efficiency and effectiveness.Landfill Tax.</p>\n\nAN ANALYSIS OF POLITICAL PROBLEMS ON LANDFILL TAX IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ANALYSIS OF POLITICAL PROBLEMS ON LANDFILL TAX IN NIGERIA", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AIR POLLUTION A CONTINUING HEALTH THREAT IN WORLD’S CITIES</strong> <strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> </p> <p><em>27 SEPTEMBER 2016 | GENEVA –</em> A new WHO air quality model confirms that 92% of the world’s population lives in places where air quality levels exceed WHO limits*. Information is presented via interactive maps, highlighting areas within countries that exceed WHO limits.</p> <p>“The new WHO model shows countries where the air pollutioni danger spots are, and provides a baseline for monitoring progress in combatting it,” says Dr Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director General at WHO.</p> <p>It also represents the most detailed outdoor (or ambient) air pollutioni-related health data, by country, ever reported by WHO. The model is based on data derived from satellite measurements, air transport models and ground station monitors for more than 3000 locations, both rural and urban. It was developed by WHO in collaboration with the University of Bath, United Kingdom.</p> <p>Some 3 million deaths a year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollutioni. Indoor air pollution can be just as deadly. In 2012, an estimated 6.5 million deaths (11.6% of all global deaths) were associated with indoor and outdoor air pollution together.</p> <p>Nearly 90% of air-pollution-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, with nearly 2 out of 3 occurring in WHO’s South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions.</p> <p>Ninety-four per cent are due to noncommunicable diseases – notably cardiovascular diseases, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. Air pollution also increases the risks for acute respiratory infections.</p> <p>“Air pollution continues take a toll on the health of the most vulnerable populations – women, children and the older adults,” adds Dr Bustreo. “For people to be healthy, they must breathe clean air from their first breath to their last.”</p> <p>Major sources of air pollution include inefficient modes of transport, household fuel and waste burning, coal-fired power plants, and industrial activities. However, not all air pollution originates from human activity. For example, air quality can also be influenced by dust storms, particularly in regions close to deserts.</p> <p>The model has carefully calibrated data from satellite and ground stations to maximize reliability. National air pollution exposures were analysed against population and air pollution levels at a grid resolution of about 10 km x 10 km.</p> <p>“This new model is a big step forward towards even more confident estimates of the huge global burden of more than 6 million deaths – 1 in 9 of total global deaths – from exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. “More and more cities are monitoring air pollution now, satellite data is more comprehensive, and we are getting better at refining the related health estimates.”</p> <p>The interactive maps provide information on population-weighted exposure to particulate matter of an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) for all countries. The map also indicates data on monitoring stations for PM10 and PM2.5 values for about 3000 cities and towns.</p> <p>“Fast action to tackle air pollution can’t come soon enough,” adds Dr Neira. “Solutions exist with sustainable transport in cities, solid waste management, access to clean household fuels and cook-stoves, as well as renewable energies and industrial emissions reductions.”</p>\n\nAIR POLLUTION A CONTINUING HEALTH THREAT IN WORLD’S CITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AIR POLLUTION A CONTINUING HEALTH THREAT IN WORLD’S CITIES", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE IMPACT OF GRASSROOTS CHALLENGES TO TRASH INCINERATORS IN NIGERIA</strong> </p> <p>When first proposed in this country during the 1970s, waste-to-energy (WTE) incinerators appeared to be ideal solutions to the growing mounds of trash in our “throw-away” society. Promising to convert useless garbage into electricity while saving precious landfill space, trash incinerators seemed perfectly timed to respond to a national need. Within a decade, however, a grassroots anti-incineration movement emerged as a vibrant offshoot of the environmental movement. In <em>Don’t Burn It Here</em>, sociologists Edward Walsh, Rex Warland, and D. Clayton Smith examine this grassroots movement through detailed analyses of the struggles surrounding proposals to build eight municipal incinerators</p> <p>The eight case histories that form the heart of the book are comparable to hundreds of others across the U.S. The authors’ research is based on interviews, focus group discussions, extensive newspaper files, and questionnaire responses from participants on both sides of the conflicts. A final chapter examines the similarities and differences between the three successful projects and the five defeated ones. An overview of the history of the modern incinerator in the U.S. and the emergence of a major national opposition movement provides the necessary context, and throughout the book, the authors make useful comparisons to other national movements seeking legal justice for deprived collectivities such as women and ethnic groups.</p> <p>This project was supported by a grant from the Ford Foundation’s Fund for Research in Dispute Resolution. Striving to maintain a balanced treatment of both sides of the incinerator battles, the authors provide fresh theoretical and methodological perspectives on a new type of collective action. They also help to close the gap between theory and empirical data in the social sciences.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF GRASSROOTS CHALLENGES TO TRASH INCINERATORS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF GRASSROOTS CHALLENGES TO TRASH INCINERATORS IN NIGERIA", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div> <strong><br/>HEALTH IMPACT OF OUTDOOR AIR POLLUTION IN NIGERIA: CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS</strong> <p>Outdoor Air Pollution</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong><br/>Title page<br/>Certification                                                                                                i<br/>Dedication                                                                                        ii<br/>Acknowledgement                                                                            iii<br/>Abstract                                                                                           iv</p> <p><strong>Chapter One: </strong><br/>1.0        Introduction                                                                        1<br/>1.1        Background Information                                                     1<br/>1.2        Problem Statement                                                              6<br/>1.3         Research Objectives                                                             7<br/>1.4       Hypothesis                                                                          8<br/>1.5        Significance of the Study                                                     9<br/>1.6        Scope of the Study                                                             10</p> <p><strong>Chapter Two: </strong><br/>2.0        Literature Review</p> <p><strong>Chapter Three: </strong><br/>3.0     Research Methodology                                         30<br/>3.1     Description of the Study Area                             30<br/>3.2    Research Design                                                            30<br/>3.3  Method of Data Collection                                            31<br/>3.4  Data Limitation                                                             31<br/>3.5  Method of Data Analysis                                               32<br/>3.5.1                   Summative Approaches                                       32<br/>3.5.2         Simple Percentage                                                33<br/>3.5.3         Incremental Averages                                           34</p> <p>3.6            Test of Hypothesis                                               34</p> <p><strong>Chapter Four</strong><br/>4.0 Presentation of Data, Analysis of Data and Discussion of Findings        36<br/>4.1  Data Presentation                                                          37<br/>4.2  Data Analysis                                                                39<br/>4.3  Discussion of Findings                                         41<br/>4.4   Test of Hypothesis                                                         45</p> <p><strong>Chapter Five: </strong><br/>5.0  Summary    of      Findings Conclusion and<br/>Recommendation                                              47<br/>5.1  Summary of Findings                                                     47<br/>5.2  Conclusion                                                        48<br/>5.3  Recommendation                                                 48<br/>References</p> </div> </div>\n\nHEALTH IMPACT OF OUTDOOR AIR POLLUTION IN NIGERIA: CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HEALTH IMPACT OF OUTDOOR AIR POLLUTION IN NIGERIA: CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>HOUSING AS AN ASPECT OF SOCIO POLICY MAKING (A STUDY OF RIVER STATE) </p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Housing is a process which makes the act of dwelling possible. In effect, the term, housing includes the house itself and the total surrounding environment with its ancillary facilities and services. One of the processes in building a house is the Building Approval phase before a house is started. This particular phase is marked by many challenges in Nigeria and particularly in Port Harcourt in the productivity of housing. The Rivers State Government in 2009 introduced the Rivers State Geographic Information System (RIVGIS) to handle land registration issues. Also in 2012, the “One -Stop -Shop” for building plan approval was introduced. The results have been rewarding; the various processes are more transparent, the period of waiting to get building approval and Certificate of Occupancy(C of O) has been reduced, the number of structures built without permits and collapse of buildings are reduced, the practice of using quacks in the building profession is under check. Generally this has resulted in improved safety of life and property.

The study adopts the survey research and takes a critical appraisal of policy documents, theoretical models and programs of government at all levels (federal, state and local governments) and their implication for rural development. The findings of the study show that though a number of policies, programs have been initiated and executed, and theories propounded, they have tended to serve the interest of the political elite and their cronies to the chagrin of those whom the policies and programs were planned for. To a large extent, these policies and programs have made the policy makers richer and in most cases the programs abandoned and or not sustainable.

Much of her policies were concerned with changing the urban landscape and the fortunes of urban dwellers. The realization on the part of policy makers and development experts that national development cannot be true development until the vast rural areas of the country are developed and brought into the mainstream of development, then and only then can we talk of true development Right from the colonial period the rural sector constitutes the socially and economically backward areas of Nigeria. Besides, the gap between the rural areas and urban areas has continued to widen in an alarming proportion. Invariably, the peasant population who formed the bulk of rural areas and produce much of the agricultural products that the nation depend on seemed neglected by government, a situation that has resulted in the much orchestrated problems of rural-urban drift, declining agricultural production and its attendant food shortage, unemployment, urban congestion and over stretched facilities (Ottong, Ering, and Akpan, 2010 and Saheed and Okide, 2012). However, in Nigeria and in most Third World societies, there had been an increasing upsurge in the concern for problems of underdevelopment especially as they affect rural areas. The concern is the need to optimize yields from natural as well as human resources by exerting control of influence upon all parts of such resources in order to realize maximum benefit from the development efforts, Ebong (1991). According to Abasiekong (1982:9): Developing countries (including Nigeria) have now more than ever come to be convinced that in order to ensure the overall development of their countries, the rural areas must be transformed and brought into the mainstream of their countries (bracket mine). It is in realization of this fact that policies aimed at the improvement of the rural areas have been announced and pursued by governmental authorities at various levels, (federal, state and local) and communities, particularly since the 1960s. The rural population have reacted in their various ways, while the policies and the people’s reactions have also had considerable locational and spatial implications for the rural development landscape, Ajaegbu (1976). Even so, such bold attempts have not achieved much success in solving problems of poverty, unemployment and inequality in rural Nigeria. Nor have the policies and efforts of government at various levels been able to stem the tide of rural-urban drift. This paper takes a look at rural development policies in Nigeria and their implications for rural development. In other words the study takes a critical look at major strategies, approaches or theories taken so far by Nigerian governments to change the rural landscape and what has been theirpracticability in terms of social change and improving the socio-economic well-being of the rural poor. Nigeria is predominantly a rural society as the vast majority of her population dwells in the rural areas (Ele, 2006; Nwuke, 2004). Indeed, about 70 percent of Nigerians dwell in the rural areas (Aboyade, 1976). Specifically, these rural areas refer to the geographical areas that lie outside the densely built-up environment of towns, cities and the sub-urban villages and whose inhabitants are engaged primarily in agriculture as well as the most basic of rudimentary form of secondary and tertiary activities (Adebayo, 1998; Ezeah, 2005). Infact, a rural area, which is the opposite of an urban area, refers to the country side whose population engages mainly in primaryproduction activities like agriculture, fishing, and rearing of livestock (Ele, 2006). Indeed, 90 percent of the rural labourforce engage directly or indirectly in agriculture (Nyagba, 2009). The rural sector of Nigeria is, very vital in the socio-economic development equation of the nation. It is, as observed by Nyagba (2009) that the most important sector of the Nigerian population is the rural areas. For instance, the rural sector is the major source of capital formation for the country and a principal market for domestic manufactures (Olatunbosun, 1975). As a matter of fact, the rural areas engage in primary economic activities that form the foundation for the country’s economic development. (Abah, 2010). Given the contributions of the rural sector to the national economy, enhancing the development of the sector should be central to government and public administration. This is necessary as such would further enhance the ability of the sector for increased contribution to the overall national growth and development. Unfortunately, over the years, the development strategies and efforts in Nigeria has been more urban based or focused resulting to relative neglect of the rural areas as evidenced in the apparent dearth of basic infrastructural facilities in the rural areas (Abah, 2010). Indeed, as Okoli and Onah (2002) observe, the rural areas in Nigeria are characterized by inadequacies of human needs as reflected in the near absence of some basic infrastructures with its attendant features of degradation and deprivation. Ezeah (2005:3) specifically, in this respect observes thus: The Nigerian rural areas are neglected areas, even though social amenities are also not adequate in some urban areas. The situation in the rural areas is far worse and many communities lack basic amenities like good roads, markets, electricity, pipe borne water etc.In the same vein, Abonyi and Nnamani (2011: 255) note thus; “Today, rural poverty persists in Nigeria despite the prosperity created by the country’s oil wealth and this is evident in the difficulty experienced by many in satisfying their basic needs for food, water and shelter. Lack of these basic needs has held rural development in Nigeria to ransom” Indeed, Abah (2010) observed that the most evident display of Nigeria under development condition is the rural areas and that the deplorable condition of the Nigerian rural sector is emphatic. Very curious and worrisome still is that even the few policies and programs initiated and implemented by government over the years have not resulted in meaningful enhancement of the development state of the rural areas in Nigeria (Ezeah, 2005). These efforts had among others, included the institutionalization of the local government to serve as an agent for enhancing rural development, the establishment of the Directorate of Roads and Rural Infrastructure (DFRRI) to enhance infrastructure development in the rural areas, the establishment of River Basin and Rural Development Authorities, the establishment of Rural Water Scheme, the establishment of rural electrification scheme, the establishment of Better Life for Rural Women Programme, the establishment of National Directorate of Employment (NDE), the establishment of Millennium Development Project through Rural Infrastructure, the establishment of Rural Banking Programme, Community Banking (defunct) and Micro Finance Banking to enhance the availability of financial services to the poor, low income earners and the rural dwellers (Ajadi2010). Olarenwaju (1992: 14) even argues that rather than these polices enhance rural development, they tended to further have underdeveloped them as he notes thus; “The manner in which rural development has been conceived by the successive Nigerian governments and the type of rural development policies that have been implemented over time in the country have contributed substantially to the current poor state of the rural economy.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The majority of Nigerians live in the rural areas as compared to the urban centers. However, the rural-urban migration drift continues unabated because the rural areas lack the basic infrastructure for social and economic development, and poverty is prevalent in the rural areas. The rural-urban drift has constituted problems to the urban areas because of the increase in population. For instance, most of the cities are overcrowded. As a result of this, health problem is associated with overcrowded population. A case in point is the recent Ebola outbreak that has affected people in Lagos and Port Harcourt which has led to fatalities. </p> <p>According to Laah et al. (2013) “rural development demands attention if the living condition of people is to improve particularly those in the rural areas. The understanding of the rural development as a concept and its principles will afford the extension agent the opportunity to collaborate with other stakeholders in order to come up with all-encompassing development agenda for the rural people.

Researchers have studied many of the factors influencing deforestation, such as the opening of new roads (Chomitz &amp; Gray 1996; Reid 2001), land property right issues (Deacon 1999; Alston et al. 2000; Godoy et al. 2001), the spread of industrial cash cropping (McMorrow &amp; Talip 2001), and slash-and-burn agriculture, cattle ranching, and logging activities (Hecht &amp; Cockburn 1989; Palm et al. 2005).</p> <p>Researchers have found that the various factors that cause deforestation are woven together in a complex net of interactions (Angelsen &amp; Kaimowitz 1999). Furthermore, authors find that the causes of deforestation could, in turn, result from deforestation. Because of the complexity of the issue, the variability across sites, and the lack of reliable empirical information, there is little consensus on an overall mechanism to explain deforestation (Kaimowitz &amp; Angelsen 1998). But the lack of empirical information is one of the main drawbacks on research on deforestation. Kaimowitz and Angelsen (1998) reviewed 146 econometric models explaining deforestation and found that 24% were based on simulations and 23% draw on analytical models, i.e. theoretical mathematic equations including no empirical data.</p> <p>Furthermore, among the 53% of the studies based on empirical data, 38 drew on secondary, national-level data. Only nine of the models reviewed (or 6% of the total) used household-level empirical data. The authors suggest that future studies of the causes of deforestation should focus on either household or regional-level data, because studies without a strong micro-level empirical Cash cropping and deforestation base are of little value: “There is no substitute for careful, quantitative micro-level empirical research, and the volume of such studies is not impressive. Plausible theoretical mechanisms are often found to be of little empirical relevance” (Kaimowitz &amp; Angelsen 1998: p. 99).</p> <p>This study has two parts. In the first part, we draw on household data from Tsimane’ Amerindians, a horticultural and foraging society in the Bolivian Amazon, to assess how cash cropping by smallholders affects the clearance of neotropical forests. We study clearance of fallow and old-growth forest because previous research suggests that fallow forests harbor substantial biological diversity (Finegan 1996; Silver et al. 1996; Smith et al. 1999), but we pay special attention to old-growth forests.</p> <p>In the second part of the paper, we use the same data to simulate the consequences of having the rural poor cash crop their way out of poverty. We focus on the consequences for the total area of forest clearance, for household labor requirements, and for fallow duration. We pay special attention to fallow duration because previous research suggest that increased land scarcity reduces the fallow period (Coomes et al., 2000). This work contributes to the debate on the causes of deforestation in several ways.</p> <p>First, we use household-level data which, according to Kaimowitz and Angelsen (1998) is of great value and still relatively rare. Second, we document deforestation by indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples do not account for a large share of deforestation, but this share could grow as indigenous people become more integrated into the market economy (Godoy 2001) or in response to population growth (Picchi 1991). Third, we contribute to the debate on the effects of agricultural technology innovations on Cash cropping and deforestation 5 deforestation. The results of the simulations help formulate recommendations on the type of technologies needed to reconcile development and conservation of tropical forests.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF CASH CROPPING, FARM TECHNOLOGIES, AND DEFORESTATION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF CASH CROPPING, FARM TECHNOLOGIES, AND DEFORESTATION IN NIGERIA", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE IMPACT OF GRASSROOTS CHALLENGES TO TRASH INCINERATORS IN NIGERIA</strong> </p> <p>When first proposed in this country during the 1970s, waste-to-energy (WTE) incinerators appeared to be ideal solutions to the growing mounds of trash in our “throw-away” society. Promising to convert useless garbage into electricity while saving precious landfill space, trash incinerators seemed perfectly timed to respond to a national need. Within a decade, however, a grassroots anti-incineration movement emerged as a vibrant offshoot of the environmental movement. In <em>Don’t Burn It Here</em>, sociologists Edward Walsh, Rex Warland, and D. Clayton Smith examine this grassroots movement through detailed analyses of the struggles surrounding proposals to build eight municipal incinerators</p> <p>The eight case histories that form the heart of the book are comparable to hundreds of others across the U.S. The authors’ research is based on interviews, focus group discussions, extensive newspaper files, and questionnaire responses from participants on both sides of the conflicts. A final chapter examines the similarities and differences between the three successful projects and the five defeated ones. An overview of the history of the modern incinerator in the U.S. and the emergence of a major national opposition movement provides the necessary context, and throughout the book, the authors make useful comparisons to other national movements seeking legal justice for deprived collectivities such as women and ethnic groups.</p> <p>This project was supported by a grant from the Ford Foundation’s Fund for Research in Dispute Resolution. Striving to maintain a balanced treatment of both sides of the incinerator battles, the authors provide fresh theoretical and methodological perspectives on a new type of collective action.

Construction projects have long been recognized as particularly cost, time and risk-laden. Some of the time and cost factors associated with the construction process are fairly predictable or identifiable; others may be totally unforeseen. The constructed project may not perform as anticipated because the owner may have unrealistic expectations regarding the delivery time of construction forcing contractors into unrealistic gambles, corner-cutting or commitments that may not be realistic (Frimpong 2003). </p> <p>Project success can be defined as meeting goals and objectives as prescribed in the project plan. A successful project means that the project has accomplished its technical performance, maintained its schedule, and remained within budgetary costs. Project management tools and techniques play an important role in the effective management of a project. Therefore, a good project management lies in the management tools and techniques used to manage the project. Project management involves managing the resources—workers, machines, money, materials and methods used. Some projects are effectively and efficiently managed while others are mismanaged, incurring much delay and cost overruns and negatively affecting the economy (Frimpong 2003). </p> <p>Assessing construction projects’ delivery time is critical in today’s market-driven economy. </p> <p>To improve the economy and maximize long-term return on this public investment, government agencies have recently started utilizing new types of contracting methods that are designed to achieve multiple project objectives, including minimizing construction cost and duration, while maximizing its quality. </p> <p>In recent years, many departments of transportation, in various states have started to apply new highway contracting methods, including: Bidding on time i.e., to encourage competition among contractors to minimize project duration (Holt et al2000), Incentive/ disincentive contract clauses that provide financial incentives to reduce construction duration, Nighttime construction that seeks to cut service disruption and project time by requiring contractors to work during off-peak nighttime hours, Warranty contracting that attempts to improve construction quality by making contractors liable for the performance of the facility after project completion. These new and emerging contracts place an increasing pressure on decision makers in the construction industry to search for an optimal/near-optimal resource utilization plan that minimizes construction time while maximizing its quality. This creates new and pressing needs for advanced resource utilization models that are capable of optimizing the multiple and conflicting objectives of construction time, cost, and quality. </p> <p>Significant research advancements have been made in the area of optimizing construction resource utilization. This led to a number of optimization models. These models can be classified according to their optimization objectives into models that attempted to: </p> <p>• <em>Minimize project time and/or improve resource utilization</em>; </p> <p>• <em>minimize time and cost for non-repetitive construction using time-cost trade-off analysis </em></p> <p>• <em>minimize time and/or cost for repetitive construction </em></p> <p>While the above research study seeks to provide significant contributions to the area of optimizing construction resource utilization, there has been little or no reported research focusing on multi objective models for optimizing construction time, cost, and quality.</p> <p><strong>1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></p> <p>Misallocation and misperception of time factor in construction projects have resulted in the government of Nigeria paying more than necessary for many projects. Improper time assessment can also cause additional costs in the form of delays which result in poor utilization, increasing social and economic costs. Are contractors using the most appropriate resources to execute projects in Nigeria? Do they mobilize the needed resources within the approved time frame allotted to their contracts? What effects do short time periods and/ or extended time periods have on their project costs? Are there remedies to these situations? </p> <p>These are some of the situations that have prompted the researcher to go deep into the assessment of the cost and time impacts of public sector construction projects in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study had the main objective of assessing the effects of timely delivery of construction projects on the economy of Nigeria, but specifically it had the following objectives.</p> <p>1.     To establish the extent to which time factors have impacted on construction of projects in the public sector in Nigeria. </p> <p>2.     To find out the change in the perception of contractors on time effects on public sector construction in Nigeria. </p> <p>3.     To find out the relationship between timely delivery of construction projects and the economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the following research questions were used by the researcher:</p> <p>1.     What effects do time factors have on construction of projects in Nigeria? </p> <p>2.     Has the perception of contractors on time factors in projects construction changed in recent years? </p> <p>3.     What relationship exists between timely delivery of construction projects and economic development in Nigeria? </p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>Ho: There is no significant relationship between timely delivery of construction projects and economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p>Hi: There is a significant relationship between timely delivery of construction projects and economic development of Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>All construction contracts allocate time between owners and contractors. Hence the significance of this study would better inform improved project relationships and communications and enhance construction administration practices between owners and contractors. </p> <p>The findings would also enhance and broaden time of wide range of risks that could materialize during the design, and construction phases of a project which would subsequently result in better and more prudent designs specifications.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researcher will limit the study to the effects of timely delivery of construction projects on the economy of Nigeria, using responses from some selected project supervisors from Julius Berger Nigeria Plc and Marlum Nigeria Plc in Uyo, AkwaIbom State as a case study. Findings and recommendations by the researcher may not be used for general analysis as the researcher could not assess numerous construction projects due to time and financial constraints.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Construction of projects in the public sector has assumed significant functions, hence the need for assessment on the cost and time impacts of construction of projects in order to achieve overall project objectives. Historical project schedule and duration data is treated as confidential by Julius Berger Nigeria Plc hence getting data for this study was very difficult. Data collection and analysis was therefore limited to the data received from project supervisors in the field of project construction.</p> <p><strong>1.9</strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>1.     </strong><strong>Economy:</strong>An economy consists of the economic system in a certain region, comprising the production, distribution or trade, and consumption of goods and services in that region or country. An economy is the total aggregate sum of all transactions of value between two agents, such as one individual to one other individual, or between groups of individual activity, such as in organizations to other organizations, and between one nation and another nation.</p> <p><strong>2.     </strong><strong>Construction:</strong> In the fields of architecture and civil engineering, construction is a process that consists of the building or assembling of infrastructure. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking. Normally, the job is managed by a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.</p> <p><strong>3.     </strong><strong>Deliverable</strong>: Deliverable is a term used in project management to describe a tangible or intangible object produced as a result of the project that is intended to be delivered to a customer (either internal or external). A deliverable could be a report, a document, a server upgrade or any other building block of an overall project.</p> <p><strong>4.     </strong><strong>Project management:</strong>this is the discipline of planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. A project is a temporary endeavour with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or deliverables),undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value. </p> <p><strong>5.     </strong><strong>Time: </strong>This is a dimension in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future,and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p><strong>1.     </strong>Frimpong, Y.

Waste, both from domestic and commercial sources has grown significantly in Nigeria over the past decade. Every time a householder shops at the store, and open market he contributes to the mountain of waste. It is possible to quote figures which show that the production of waste amounts to millions of tons. The percent of Nigeria’s population living in cities and urban areas has more than doubled in the last 15 years. The cities and urban areas experience continuous growth which contributes to enormous in generation of solid and liquid waste. The management of waste is a matter of national and international concern. The volume of waste does not actually constitute the problem but the ability or inability of governments, individuals and waste disposal firms to keep up with the task of managing waste and the environment. There is no doubt that a dirty environment affects the standard of living, aesthetic sensibilities, health of the people and thus the quality of their lives. The corollary is that improper disposal or storage of this waste can constitute hazards to the society through the pollution of air, land and especially water. In this research, our attention would be focused on domestic waste. We will highlight some of the problems which have attended the management of this category of waste in Nigeria today. It will be seen that Nigeria has not done well in the direction of tackling the menace of domestic waste. This is even in the face advanced management strategies existing today for domestic waste management which have been adopted in many places. We will proffer suggestions that may assist in addressing this issue that seems to be aborting most efforts of International organizations, the federal government, city authorities, states and professionals alike.</p> <p>Recycling depends on waste materials which cannot be reused directly but can be converted to new product or raw material through the processes of transformation. For instance, used paper is recycled into files, envelops and cards. Energy is recovered through recycling through: pyrolysis (combustion of waste in the absence of oxygen to create gases, liquids and solid compounds), incineration (combustion in the presence of oxygen to produce oxidized compounds), anaerobic digestion, gasification and pelletization; as well as composting (biological and chemical degradation of organic waste in either large centralized, small enterprise, backyard or household basis). Together, the ‘3Rs’ aimed at achieving sustainable solid waste management; and, also relates to other global environmental challenges, particularly, climate change mitigation, specifically, the emission of greenhouse gases that could create sustainable development co-benefits and reduction in the emissions of methane (CH4), biogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) from landfills. Technologies required to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gases emission, sustainable though, include composting of organic waste, high-tech incineration and expanded sanitation coverage, industrial co-combustion for waste-to-energy, landfill gas recovery as well as thermal processes for waste-to-energy. For example, in Europe landfill receives 66% of waste, incinerated (18%), composted (6%) and recycled (10%); in Eastern Europe, landfill takes 90% and recycled (10%). In the USA, recycling, for instance, takes care of cans, bottles, shipping cardboard, unsold food and scrap. In dealing with the cost of sustainable solid waste management, different principles have been developed: extended product responsibility in which waste disposal cost is inputted in the market price of the product and the polluter pays principle. Success story of sustainable solid waste management is reported in; a case study in Nepal with European Union funding; involving activities such as expansion of house-to-house waste collection, employment generation for community members for street sweeping, and, addition of 58 new dumpsters; installation of organic waste compost machine at Bhaktapur; creation of landfill at Katuwu Khola which replaces dumping of municipal waste at the river bank; and, public private partnership in waste management in Biratnagar with success in only one of the three companies.  Expanding recycling programmes can help reduce solid waste pollution but the key to solving severe solid waste problems lies in reducing the amount of waste generated. It was noticed that only the landfill system of waste disposal is being generally adopted in Lagos State. Whereas in other places for example, there are several methods of waste disposal used to ameliorate and mitigate the issue of population effect on waste management Main benefits include sale of compost from recycled waste and employment sourced from the three waste management companies. In Hetauda, success is augmented by the involvement of CBOs and NGOs.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Wastes pose serious environmental and health problems, promote insect vectors like mosquitoes and flies (Cairncross and Feachem 1993), rats and mice, cause fire hazards, flooding of streams, development of aquatic weeds, odor problems, nuisance, and so on. According to Pichtel (2005), the environmental impacts can be clustered into six categories which include: global warming, photochemical oxidant creation, abiotic resource depletion, acidification, and eutrophication. Some of these problems are related to their major constituents. It is on these premises that the researcher intends to investigate the impact of recycling in preserving the environments.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to ascertain the impact of recycling in preserving the environment; but for the purpose of the study, the researcher intends to achieve the following objective:</p> <p>i)             To ascertain the impact of recycling in preserving the environment</p> <p>ii)           To ascertain the impact of solid waste management practice in Nigeria </p> <p>iii)          To evaluate the role of government in waste management in Nigeria</p> <p>iv)         To investigate the environmental effect of solid waste management in Nigeria.</p> <p>v)           To evaluate the relationship between solid waste management and environmental pollution.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>For the successful completion of the study; the following research hypotheses were formulated;</p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>waste recycling does not have a significant impact in preserving the environment.</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong> waste recycling has a significant impact on environmental preservation.</p> <p><strong>H02: </strong>there is no relationship between solid waste management and environmental pollution </p> <p><strong>H2: </strong>there is a relationship between solid waste management and environmental pollution</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of great importance to the federal ministry of environment, in addressing the challenges of recycling as a means of managing solid waste in the country, the findings will also be of great importance to the environmental management agency as the findings will aid them in developing a model to check and control solid waste management through the recycling process. The study will also be of importance to researchers who intend to embark on studies in similar area. Finally the study will be of great importance to academia’s as the study will add to the body of knowledge</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study covers the impact of recycling in preserving the environment. However in the course of the study, the researcher encounters some constrain which limited the scope of the study. Some of these constrain are:</p> <p><strong>(a) Availability of research material:</strong> The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study.       </p> <p><strong>(b) Time</strong>: The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.</p> <p><strong>(c) Finance:</strong> The finance available for the research work does not allow for wider coverage as resources are very limited as the researcher has other academic bills to cover.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Recycling</strong></p> <p>Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to \"conventional\" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions (compared to plastic production, for example). Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from land filling). Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the \"Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle\" waste hierarchy.</p> <p><strong>Waste </strong></p> <p>Waste and wastes are unwanted or unusable materials. Waste is any substance which is discarded after primary use, or it is worthless, defective and of no use.</p> <p>Examples include municipal solid waste (household trash/refuse), hazardous waste, wastewater (such as sewage, which contains bodily wastes (feces and urine) and surface runoff), radioactive waste, and others.</p> <p><strong>Solid waste</strong></p> <p>Solid waste means any garbage, refuse, sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility and other discarded materials including solid, liquid, semi-solid, or contained gaseous material, resulting from industrial, commercial, mining and agricultural operations,</p> <p><strong>Pollution</strong></p> <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF RECYCLING IN PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF RECYCLING IN PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>An Assessment Of The Socio-economic Impacts (effects) Of Agulu-nanka Gully Erosion, Anambra State, Southeastern Nigeria  </p> <p>Soil erosion is the systematic removal of soil including plant nutrients from the land surface by various agents of denudation.

Economic effects studied are loss of farmland, loss of planted crops, loss of shop/business premises and loss of economic trees. The study intends to identify the percentage of the residents according to localities that have suffered socially and economically from gully incidents. It also intend to determine the relationship between adverse social and economic effects suffered by the affected people in the various localities of the study area. The loacalities studied include, Isiakpuenu-Nanka, Engwu-Nanka, Ududo-Nanka, Madonna-Agulu and Agulu – road cut areas. Data for the study was collected from two major sources; primary source and secondary source. Primary source of data are direct observation from fieldwork and the use of questionnaire while the secondary source include topographic map and library materials.</p> <p>Descriptive statistical tools were applied to deal with the techniques of summarizing and describing data collected. Percentages, proportion and mean were applied to get other parameters such as expected frequencies and deviations from the actual. X2 (Chi-Square) was used to test the level of agreement of the results of analysis. Pearson’s co-efficient of correlation was used to analyze the relationship between the social and economic effects of gully erosion in the area. Findings are that The adverse social and economic effects of Agulu-Nanka Erosion on the residents in the erosion affected Areas differ significantly from the social and economic situation in the unaffected areas and There is no significant relationship between the social and economic effects of gully erosion in Agulu-Nanka areas.</p> <p>The solution to gully erosion impacts is to treat it as a vital component of the broad issue of environmental problem management. This will be achieved with adequate knowledge of the environment.</p> <div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Erosion is the process by which the agents of soil erosion wear away, eat into, loosen, or carry away soil material and transport it from one locality to another where it is eventually deposited (Egboka, 1991). Soil erosion is a complex process caused by wind, water and physical disturbances, encompassing detachment, transport and deposition of weathered rock. Soil erosion reduces land productivity, challenges agricultural sustainability and degrades environmental quality through contaminants attached to the sediments.</p> <p>Soil erosion is caused and complexed by a variety of factors such as natural phenomena of neotectonics and paleotectonics, soil/rock features (pedology/geology), wind/water dynamics; and human phenomena such as population density, anthropogenic activities including engihanic effects (Egboka and Nwankwor, 1985). In the execution of colossal or small scale projects of Industrial or engineering nature, the textural, coherence and plasticity characteristics of the soil are not considered. Irrigation schemes, major road network, small and large dams, urbanization,</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>13</p> <p>deforestation, sand and laterite mining are carried out without cognizance of the warnings of environmental experts and/or professionals. Similarly, sensitive drainage areas, wetlands and flood channels are encroached upon by hungry land developers. In view of these activities, sheet, rill and gully erosion are known to progressively develop over several years. All over the world man is a more important agent of environmental change than Nature (Press, 1990). Soil erosion problems are now endemic in many parts of southeastern Nigeria (Egboka, 1991). Increased awareness of erosion impacts on land, air, water quality and global climate, raises new challenges for erosion researchers. In some conditions, these impacts are so severe that they reduce the quality of life and economic well-being, and can threaten survival.</p> <p>Chemical and physical deterioration of soil have major implication on agricultural productivity and housing development. In Nigeria agricultural production is the most important source of income to the people. Soil quality has a major impact on the capacity of the rural farmers to achieve food security. Soil erosion increment results in an unsustainable development of the living standard of the people. Sustainable development is the positive socio-economic change that does not undermine the ecological and social systems</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>14</p> <p>upon which communities and social systems are dependent. Land provides services to humans and other life forms as well as providing raw materials in production process. Land provides waste assimilation services as well as other ecosystem functions. Land provides utilities for recreation, health, cultural and ecological cycles and functions.</p> <p>The quality of available land determines its production potential and real value. Land owned by families in Agulu-Nanka is mainly used for cultivation and housing development. Soil degradation resulting from gully erosion in the area, economically results in loss of its potentials (Values) for food production and housing development. This is because the eroded soil is not naturally replaced without costs. This process leads to material loss and reduction of economic base overtime and may have long term consequences on the living standard of the people affected. Agulu-Nanka erosion remain a local problem for a long time, which later gained attention on an isolated and adhoc basis from affected communities and relevant Government agencies, hence the silence on the documentation of losses sustained by the affected people: There is therefore, need for study on the social impact and economic losses sustained by affected people.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>15</p> <p><strong>1.2  Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Soil erosion is one of the most striking features on the land surface of southeastern Nigeria, especially in Anambra State. Several non-responsive human activities by both the Government and the inhabitants have culminated in the devastating gully erosion in this area. Some of these activities include, excavation of red earth (laterite) and sand in the process of sand/regolith mining, construction of roads without drainage channels, uncontrolled population growth and poor agricultural practices. Buildings are congested on top of groundwater recharge areas. The geology of the area (Nanka Sandstone) is composed of weak, friable soils which are poorly consolidated.</p> <p>At Agulu-Nanka, each rainy season is associated with nightmares, particularly for inhabitants living at the proximity of erosion sites. Each gully incidence is accompanied by landslides and slumping, leaving at the end of each event inhabitants crying and mourning for loss of agricultural lands, ancestral lands, homes and economic trees. The cumulative effect is that the affected inhabitants are left homeless and/or jobless. The threats posed by gaping and daunting large gullies to farmlands, settlements, roads and human are enormous. Most communities in Anambra State have been</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>16</p> <p>ravaged by soil erosion of different dimensions. Sheet erosion is common and it has resulted in the reduction of soil fertility. Rill erosion is also common in many communities. However, in these areas they have graduated into gully erosion. The incidence of gully erosion is a common phenomenon in Agulu-Nanka communities. The inhabitants of gully ravaged sites have suffered mishaps ranging from psychological trauma to loss of property and life. Observations show that gullies in Agulu-Nanka are allowed to advance without adequate control efforts by Government, hence, the affected people watch helplessly while their farmland and homes are destroyed.</p> <p>The incidence of gully erosion in Agulu-Nanka is not new, as it has formed a subject for research. Unfortunately, until now, most researchers are confined only to the factors causing gulling and control measures, keeping the losses sustained and other social and economic effects suffered by the affected people aside. It is of utmost importance to study and document the losses suffered by soil erosion victims in terms of social disruption, psychological effects and economic effects with a view to attracting Government, (State and Federal) to bring lasting solution to Agulu-Nanka erosion ravaged areas.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>17</p> <p><strong>1.3  Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions inform the aim and objectives of the study:</p> <p>1.           What are the adverse social effects that are consequent on Agulu-Nanka gully erosion?</p> <p>2.           What are the adverse economic effects that resulted from gully erosion in Agulu-Nanka areas?</p> <p>3.         What percentage of the residents of various localities of Agulu-Nanka have suffered as a result of gully erosion?</p> <p>4.         What is the relationship between the social and economic effects that resulted from gully erosion in Agulu-Nanka areas?</p> <p>5.         How effective are the measures to contain the menace?</p> <p><strong>1.4 Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to assess the adverse social and economic implications of gully erosion hazards in Agulu-Nanka Communities of Anambra State, Southeastern Nigeria. The specific-objectives of this study include:</p> <p>1.         To identify the adverse social effects that resulted from gully erosion in Agulu-Nanka.</p> <p>2.         To identify the adverse economic effects that is consequent o gully erosion in the Agulu-Nanka</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>18</p> <p>3.         To determine the size of residents in various localities of Agulu-Nanka that has suffered adverse social and economic effects resulting from gully erosion.</p> <p>4.         To determine the relationship between the social and economic effects of gully erosion in the area.</p> <p>5.         To  determine  the  common  adaptive  measures  and  their</p> <p>sustainability</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The research questions and objectives translate to the following research hypotheses that are applied to this study.</p> <p>1.         H0: The adverse social effects of Agulu-Nanka Erosion on the Residents in the Erosion affected areas do not differ Significantly from the social situation in the unaffected Areas.</p> <p>2.      Ho: There is no significant difference between the economic effects of gully erosion in the various erosion ravaged localities of Agulu-Nanka and the other areas.</p> <p>3.          Ho: There is no significant relationship between the social And the economic effects of gully erosion in Agulu-Nanka areas.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>19</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study is significant for two reasons. First, the study intends to identify the percentage of the residents according to localities that have suffered socially and economically from gully erosion incidence irrespective of the dimension of the gully occurrence. Adverse social effects include loss of ancestral home; loss of school building, loss of church buildings and loss of sources of water supply. On the other hand, adverse economic effects include loss of farmland, loss of crops, loss of shop/business premises, loss of economic trees; palm trees, Ukwa trees (Bread fruit tree), Udara trees (African apple tree), kola trees, etc. Secondly, this study intends to determine the relationship the social and economic effects of gully erosion in the area. The study should enable decision makers, policy makers and environmental managers to evolve sustainable procedures for managing human activities like farming, road construction practices, stone and sand quarrying and harvesting in line with the characteristics of the lithology in the gully erosion prone areas.</p> <p>Hitherto, the studies on gully erosion have established the general factors that cause gully erosion in the area. This study intends to move in another direction, it assesses the social and economic losses to the residents in Agulu-Nanka..</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>20</p> <p><strong>1.7  Scope of the study.</strong></p> <p>This section will be discussed under two categories, namely area coverage of the study and content. The coverage include erosion sites in Agulu-Nanka. Content of the research will include a study of the social and economic implications of gully erosion on the inhabitants of areas devastated by gully erosion.</p> <p>Social characteristics that will be studied include, destruction of ancestral homeland resulting to forced relocation and hence refugee in Own-Land; loss of source of water supply, experience of trauma and frightful Scenic environment. On the other hand economic characteristics that form the crux of the study will include loss of building and furniture, farmland, planted crops, economic trees and monetary contributions to gully control works.</p> <p><strong>1.8  Theoretical framework</strong></p> <p>The Davison theory is the earliest cause and effect oriented theory on soil erosion. It holds that steep slopes are faster eroded than gentle slopes and that stream or runoff velocities are solely dependent on bed slopes, which got their derivation from this axiom. This law is tantamount to an obvious conclusion by Davis (1990) that the rate of change of landforms as well as other geometric impact magnitudes are functions of local relief. It therefore implies that the</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>21</p> <p>progressive changes on the terrain by the effects (impacts) of soil erosion are accepted to be universally associated with a progressive landscape evolution where the geometry of individual landforms and the rate of their erosion changes are both subject to sequential transformation through time.</p> <p>The Ofomata’s (1987) Soil Erosion Model for humid tropics incorporates both the biophysical and human components in soil erosion cause and impact. The two major purposes that the Model addressed are firstly, the clarification of the relative importance of the numerous factors (causes) of soil erosion in southeastern Nigeria. Secondly, the advancing of a guide for uniformity of soil erosion research in all parts of the world in consonance with the second purpose. The Model explains comparative study and assessment of soil erosion in the entire humid tropical regions such that necessary variants in the major components of the Model can be introduced by specific local conditions. The model did not address the human impacts of erosion.</p> <p>The 1969 passage of the National Environmental Policy Act in USA gave birth to the Environmental Impact Assessment. It was earlier known as cost-Benefit-Analysis (CBA). Its effect on human</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>22</p> <p>being or the human component of the environment was not at the centre focus. In other words, it has no human dimension.</p> <p>Interaction Matrix Approach (IMA) has been earlier put forwards by Leopold, Clar, Hansaw and Ralsley (1971) as the first environmental impact assessment approach. It consist of ten (10) general categories of action on the abscissa or horizontal axis. This consist of about eight hundred and eighty eight (888) environmental factors or characteristic such as soil, flora and land uses. The vertical axis or ordinate has four (4) general categories with many impact characteristics. There are eight thousand eight hundred (8800) cells</p> <p>(that is 100 x 88) on a full matrix. It is denoted by (M/I) where M is</p> <p>the magnitude of interaction and I is the importance of Interaction. Burton, Kates and White (1978) Model, opines that natural</p> <p>hazards are best viewed as ecological framework. This clearly explains that natural hazards occur from conflicts between what can be referred to as the natural event system and the human use system. The human (socio-economic environment) is given a central role from this interpretation of natural hazards. In the first place, through location. Secondly, through human perception.</p> <p>Consequently, Kates (1971) concluded that hazard occurrences merely represent the extreme of natural processes and their</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>23</p> <p>distributions and in a slightly different context would often be regarded as natural resource. The study is based on this theory. Figure 1. shows the ecological framework of natural hazard.</p> </div>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS (EFFECTS) OF AGULU-NANKA GULLY EROSION, ANAMBRA STATE, SOUTHEASTERN NIGERIA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS (EFFECTS) OF AGULU-NANKA GULLY EROSION, ANAMBRA STATE, SOUTHEASTERN NIGERIA ", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>EFFECT OF BASIC MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS ON CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>The construction industry plays an important role in the development of the economy of the country. Construction industry is an area influenced by many different factors such as labor, material, equipment and construction methods etc. Among these factors, human resources come first without which, other resources would not be utilized or transformed into productive use. Any improvement in labor productivity would contribute a great deal to the improvement of the overall productivity as identified by Hashim (1995). The motivation concept is generally defined as a composition of powers and mechanisms which help to direct human behavior in a desired manner, or with a more specific context it is described as the all convincing and encouraging actions which help workers fulfill their tasks willingly and to come closer to project objectives. Motivation of the labor force is of paramount importance because the quality of human performance at the workplace depends largely upon motivation. That is, higher motivation brings higher productivity which is suggested by Kazaz et al (2008). According to most researchers there is a positive relationship between motivation and productivity. This means that when motivation increases, a rise in productivity is also expected. This reflects the belief that an increased motivation level causes an increase in productivity. Achieving the results demands that an adequate quality of inputs is provided in this first place and improved construction workforce productivity means a better input and this it will help contractors to be more competent and reliable whilst executing their jobs. The construction sector has a strategic role in all developed and developing countries. Employing more than 7 % of Nigerian’s workforce, this sector is the largest industrial employer on the country (Proverbs et al. 1999). In the US, construction industry accounts for about 14 % of the gross national product and some 8 % of total employment (Thieblot 2002). Similar to them, the sector in Turkey has a share of 4.6 % in the gross national product and 5.3 % in total employment. In addition, the employment share of construction among industrial sectors (which is a real indicator of a country’s development level) is about 27 % (SIS 2005). As can be comprehended from these macro level data, the industry possesses a strong and particular structure all over the world as compared with manufacturing industry. Variations in the construction labor productivity can naturally make a great impact on national economy and productivity, since the sector also augments production capacity of its dependent sub-sectors that are more than 200. If the subsectors procuring inputs for the industry are considered together in Nigeria, the share of construction in the gross national product rises to approximately 33 %, while it includes some 15 % in total employment (SIS 2005). However, construction workforce especially in developing countries is not seen as an important input, although project labor generally make up the most variable and the largest percentage of total project costs. Due to this high cost of labor, labor cost control is a very important function for profitability in the industry. Despite the fact that these costs change with the type of projects in a broad range, site workers typically account for up to 40 % of the direct capital cost in large construction projects.  The labor cost component of electrical and mechanical works also represents 40–60 % of their final cost. Therefore, labor-intensive industries such as construction are considered under high-risk by contractors due to the relatively high labor component, and, thus, any reduction in this wastage presents enormous potential for the increased efficiency. The present situation of the industry makes productivity improvement imperative to the sector. Industry is better characterized by traditional or manual methods and hard labor conditions, besides a low productivity. Labor-intensive technology, on the other hand, requires much more diligence and insight than equipment-intensive construction process, and, thus, labor resource becomes a more important input in the production phase. Moreover, production-related inactivity is not nearly as intuitively obvious in a labor-intensive project and the solutions of the inactivity are not easily found. It means that it is easy for a contractor to be lulled into a false sense of accomplishment, when the crews are all working. Residential and commercial construction is labor-intensive as compared to industrial and heavy constructions tendin to be capital-intensive. In the same way, renovation or retrofitting work, by its own nature, requires a higher labor/capital ratio than the new construction. As in most developing countries, a great portion of the construction labor also comes from farming in Nigeria, and they work both seasonal and contingent on the need for specific skills in a project. The productivity of this type of workers whose abilities and socio-cultural backgrounds vary in a wide spectrum is naturally affected by many factors. Poor productivity of craftsmen was quoted as one of the most daunting human resource problems in developing countries by Olomolaiye et al. (1987) and Kaming et al. (1997). Frequently construction labor efficiency was cited as poor in the US as well (Adrian 1987). According to Thieblot (2002), the reason for this situation is that the industry has rarely been able to have what would be considered normal labor relations and policies. Furthermore, managers may not always consider the factors that can affect the productivity of manpower. The productivity risk factor has also a strong impact on the project duration. Namely, poor labor productivity probably causes time overruns in construction projects (Kazaz, Ulubeyli 2004). The population of the workers compared to the whole workforce of a nation is significant. Anything done to the employees could either make or mar the quality of their work, the speed of progress, the economy of the country and the social well-being of the workers. It follows from the foregoing therefore that workers should be well motivated for high performance and for the production of good quality products. However, despite this significant role the industry plays in the Nigerian national economy, the performance has not been impressive. Eldin and Egger (1990) noted that construction productivity has been declining steadily in spite of the rising cost and large labor intensive nature of construction projects around the world. The decline in the workers’ performance causes the failure of the building industry to deliver projects timely with the obvious consequences of cost overrun. Labor productivity according to Akindele (2003) is defined as labor output per day (man-day). This is often reduced by delayed, unclear or inadequate instructions, provision of poor tools and equipment, unbalanced work gangs, use of working method, lack of incentives, and failure to delegate authority from senior to lower level supervisors (Heap 1987). The productivity of individuals, which in turn affects the productivity of a company, is a very important parameter to watch as it measures a company’s competitive power. It is an indicator of a firm’s profit margin, a measure of the firm’s survival in business, a yardstick for remuneration of employees, and a means of recognition of hard work.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Workers leave organization due to the fact that they are not motivated enough. Some are not willing to leave because they are enjoying some benefit in terms of promotion, which leads to increase in salaries and wages, bonus and some other incentives. The workers of construction firms  prefer financial incentives to non financial incentives ,more especially the junior workers ,due to the fact that such incentives are not used as a motivational technique, the company have the problem and challenges of retention of their employees. Hence low performance and productivity becomes the end result and finally work dissatisfaction. It is in view of this that the researcher intends to investigate effect of basic motivational factors on construction workforce productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is effect of basic motivational factors on construction workforce productivity.

Marine pollution is classed as point source or non-point source. Point source pollution occurs when there is a single, identifiable, and localized source of the pollution. That is, \"point source\" means any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged. An example is directly discharging sewage (i.e. water-carried waste, in solution or suspension, which is intended to be removed from a community, also known as wastewater) and industrial waste into the ocean Non-point source pollution occurs when the pollution comes from ill-defined and diffuse sources. It arises from a broad group of human activities for which the pollutants have no obvious point of entry into receiving watercourses. Obviously, non-point source pollution is much more difficult to measure, identify and control than point sources. These include agriculture tural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture, urban runoff (from roofs, streets, parking lots, etc), transportation (roads, railways, pipelines, hydro-electric corridors) etc. Industries and businesses may discharge wastes to street gutters and storm drains. Overloading and malfunction of septic systems lead to surface runoff. Effects of Marine Pollution on coastal environment cum resources such as degradation, damage to ecosystems, damage to the esoteric value of beaches, lethal and sub-lethal effects on marine fauna and flora etc. were elaborately discussed, using graphic and plate illustrations to elucidate understanding. The study is of the view that marine pollution has enormous impact on our coastal resources and is totally unavoidable due to Global population explosion and technological innovations by man. However, it was asserted that the problem could be minimized through careful management. Pragmatic recommendations were therefore put forward on how to minimize the impact of marine pollution on our coastal resources, with specific reference to Nigeria. The coastal environment generally refers to any piece of land next to, bothering or adjourning the sea shore. The extent of the coastal environment also varies immensely, depending on the object of the context within which it is being defined. Sometimes, it simply means the narrow linear corridor of shore line separating the continental shelf from the oceanic land mass. At other times it may be considered to extend both largely inwards, towards the continental shelf and outwards, farther away from the shore line towards the terrestrial land mass. For the purposes of evaluating marine pollution sources and its effects on the coastal environment, the latter description is considered more suitable. Environmental pollution is the pollution of air, land and water in many ways. There are several reasons for environmental pollution, such as from agriculture, industry, and urban sources. Environmental pollution has drastically changed the air, water and terrestrial ecosystems as a result of the industrial revolution in Europe, North America and China in the 19th century. Moreover, different types of toxic gases and different forms of carbon components were produced from factories, transport, and energy sectors has resulted in different changes in the global climate and weather patterns, and become a source of contamination of land, as well as the ocean environment where the average temperature and acidity are increasing. In addition, many other chemicals like fertilizers used in the agricultural industry also contribute to the pollution of the seas over vast areas (Committee on Energy Futures and Air Pollution, 2007) Consequently, the coastal environment can be said to transcend the shore line up to the exclusive economic zone seaward and across the estuarine and intertidal zones to the lower reaches of the fresh water tributaries, sandy beaches and sometimes even arid continental land masses landwards, where such bounds the world Seas and Oceans.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Marine pollution is classed as point source or non-point source.

This study was conducted to examine the attitude of parents towards the study of sex education in secondary schools in an enlightened community like the University of Benin, Benin City. Data was obtained through the use of questionnaire. A total of 200 questionnaires were distributed to parents in five (5) different faculties. This study utilizes the survey design employing simple random sampling technique in gathering data on the study. Statistical Product and Service Solution, SPSS 16.0 was used for the data analysis. Results were written using simple percentages and frequency tables. The respondents included 95 males and 105 females. The responses from the questionnaire shows that 92% of our parents in these faculties have a positive attitude towards the study of sex education in secondary schools, 58.5% of the respondents cultural beliefs influence their attitudes towards the study of sex education in schools and the teachers qualification in health education also has an influence on their attitude towards the study of sex education in secondary schools. This research shows that parents want their children to be informed about sex and their sexual health by educators who have the skill and qualification to do so; however they want to be informed about the programs to be delivered in their child’s school.   <strong>LIST OF TABLES</strong>TABLES 1.     Demographic data table………………………………………….. 2.     Responses on the attitude of parents……………………………... 3.     Responses on the influence of cultural beliefs…………………… 4.     Responses on the influence of teachers’ qualification……………..                 <strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong> Title page………………………………………………………….i Certification……………………………………………………….ii Dedication…………………………………………………………iii Acknowledgement…………………………………………………iv Abstract…………………………………………………………….vi List of tables……………………………………………………….vii Table of contents..…………………………………………………viii <strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong>Background to the Study…………………………………………1 Statement of Problem…………………………………………….5 Research Questions………………………………………………6 Purpose of Study………………………………………………….7 Significance of Study…………………………………………......7 Delimitation of Study…………………………………………….8 Limitation of Study…………………………..…………………..8 Definition of Terms………………………………………………9 <strong>CHAPTER TWO: REVIEW OF LITERATURE</strong> Sex Education; its meaning, objectives and content……………11 The Need for the Study of Sex Education in Secondary Schools…22 Reasons for Accepting the Study of Sex Education in Secondary Schools……………………………………………………………27 Factors Affecting the Study of Sex Education………………….29 Attitudes of Parents towards its Study…………………………33 Summary of Review of Literature………………………………35 <strong>CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY</strong>Research Design…………………………………………………..38 Population…………………………………………………………39 Sample and Sampling Technique…………………………………39 Instrumentation……………………………………………………40 Validity and Reliability…………………………………………..40-41 Data Administration and Collection…………………………….41 <strong>CHAPTER FOUR: ANALYSIS OF DATA AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS</strong> Demographic data……………………………………………….42 Research Question 1…………………………………………….49 Research Question 2……………………………………………54 Research Question 3……………………………………………58 Discussion of Findings………………………………………...63 <strong>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</strong>Summary…………………………………………………….…68 Conclusion…………………………………………………….70 Recommendation………………………………………………70 Suggestions for further study………………………………….71 REFERENCES………………………………………………..73 APPENDIX…………………………………………………….78    <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong> <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> <strong>Background to the Study</strong> There comes a time in a child’s life when he/she runs excitedly to the mother, exclaiming about the changes taking place in his body. These changes includes, the breast enlargement, appearance of pubic and armpit hairs, but to his surprise, the mother shuts him down. This can send a wrong signal to the child. This response goes a long way in shaping the child’s sexual life. The child who is in need of answers to the questions his body keeps asking cannot share his thoughts as he avoids been rejected or laughed at by his peer groups. The child then grows up with a burden on him. He gets to the school and even when such topics are mentioned, he does not want to be a part of it. For children to grow into healthy adults, they need information about their sexual health. The process or ways in which the knowledge is been transmitted to the child matters a lot. The human sexuality has biological, emotional/physical and spiritual aspects. The biological aspect of his sexuality refers to the reproductive mechanism as well as the basic biological drive (libido). The emotional/physical aspect of sexuality refers to the bond that exists between individuals. This is expressed thoroughly through profound feelings or physical manifestations’ of love, trust and care. The spiritual aspect of sexuality has to do with the individual’s connection to others. Experience has also shown that adolescents are curious about some or all aspects of their sexuality. (www.sexeducation.com). Years of research shows that children and youths who are knowledgeable about their sexual health are more resistant to sexual abuse, older when they engage in sexual activities and more likely to protect themselves from pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. (Vancouver Island Health Authority-Health Choices Program). Some International Organization such as the Planned Parenthood Federation consider that broad sex education programs have global benefits such as controlling the risk of over population and the advancement of women’s reproductive rights. Sex education enables the youth to know more about the biological development of their bodies. Common Avenue for sex education includes parents, formal school programs and public health campaigns. When sex education is taught in schools, students are able to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience. As they mature, they develop healthy and rewarding relationships. They make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. However, parents who are the primary care givers have a role to play in the incorporation of sex education in schools. They are responsible for the health and moral values of their children. As parents, it is expected to teach, guide and nurture your child through childhood and adolescence towards adulthood and also providing them with skills and knowledge to make safe life choices on matters concerning their overall wellbeing. They need to know about sex and reproduction not just that which was taught at schools but from you also. It also becomes obvious that there is no right or wrong age at which to teach the child about sex. Questions need to be answered honestly-on an “I need to know” basis. In other words, the knowledge given to the child at home aids his understanding of the concept been taught at school. Open communication channels are vital to ensure that your child has knowledge of the human reproduction. Burt (2009) defined sex education as “the study of the characteristics of being; a male or a female.” Sex education includes all the educational measures which in any way may have their center on sex. He further said that sex education stands for protection, preservation, extension, improvement and development of the family based on accepted ethical ideas. Kearney sees sex education as “involving a comprehensive course of action by the school, calculated to bring about the socially desirable attitudes, practices and personal conduct on the part of children and adults that will best protect the individual as a human and the family as a social institution.” This means that sex education may also be described as ‘sexuality education’. It encompasses education about all aspects of sexuality, including information about family planning, information about reproduction, all aspects of one’s sexuality and how to avoid them. Various aspects of sex education are to be appropriately taught in schools depending on the age of the child and what they are able to comprehend at a particular time. It can be taught as a full course which is part of the curriculum in junior secondary or senior secondary schools; other times a unit is just been taught either during biology class or health class. It should be noted that parents and guardians are a primary and important source of sexual health education for young people (King et al 1988). <strong>Statement of Problem</strong> Youths, as they develop into adulthood are faced with so many sexual challenges. While seeking to know and understand their sexual wellbeing, some become victims of sexual abuse. This has led to an increase in the rate of school dropout, unwanted pregnancies, forced marriages and sexually transmitted diseases among youths. Apparently, some parents are ignorant of the role they play in providing their children with the necessary information about/on their sexual life. This information would enable the child grow into adulthood and also helps to prevent the child from making wrong decisions in life. This study was therefore designed to examine the attitudes of parents towards the study of sex education in an enlightened community like the University of Benin, Ugbowo Campus, Benin City. <strong>Purpose of Study</strong> This study attempts to explain the need for sex education in schools. It tries to assess parents’ attitude towards the study of sex education in schools. It also shows the importance of sex education to the society at large and points out the social and educational implications of poor sexuality education for the school child. It also enlightens parents’ on the role they play in the inclusion of sex education in the curriculum of secondary schools. It also enables the curriculum planners take into consideration the multicultural nature of the society when drawing up a sex education program.   <strong>Research Questions</strong> 1.                    What are the attitudes of parents towards the study of sex education in secondary schools?2.                    Does cultural belief influence the attitude of parents towards the study of sex education in secondary schools? 3.                    Would the teachers’ qualification in a health course influence parents’ attitude towards the study of sex education? <strong>Significance of the Study</strong> This study enlightens parents in their role towards their children’s sexual development. It enables parents understand the need for their child to acquire the knowledge; skill and habit that would allow them develop into healthy adults. It enables the child build and engages in a healthy relationship with the opposite sex. This would enable the child to acquire a basic understanding on virtually every aspect of life by the time he reaches full maturity.  <strong>Delimitation of the study</strong> The researcher delimited the study to parents in the University of Benin. The parents involved in this study comprise of both Academic and Non Academic staff. This study was delimited in order to ensure/achieve validity and reliability. <strong>Limitations of the Study</strong> During the course of this study, certain obstacles were faced; as a result of this, the researcher limits her study to parents who are workers in the University of Benin. These parents were taken from five faculties namely; 1.                    Faculty of Education 2.                    School of Medicine 3.                    Faculty of law4.                    Faculty of Management Sciences 5.                    Faculty of Physical Sciences. This study is also limited to finding out parents’ attitude towards the study of sex education in secondary schools. It does not seek to know the teachers and students opinion. <strong>Definition of Terms</strong> <strong>Attitude</strong>: The way you think and feel about somebody or something. (Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, 7th edition). <strong>Sex</strong>: Refers to gender or tries to classify a ‘being’ into male or female. It also refers to the physical activity between two people in which they touch each other’s sexual organs and which may include sexual intercourse. (Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, 7th edition). <strong>Cultural belief</strong>: The way of life of a group of people and the things they engage in. <strong>Education:</strong> Total process of human learning by which knowledge is imparted, faculties are trained and skills developed. (Urevbu, 1991). <strong>Sex education</strong>: is the education that teaches the young person what he/she should know for his/her personal conduct and relationship with others. (Shyler, 1976). <strong>Sexually transmitted diseases</strong>: Infections that can be transmitted from someone to another individual during or through sexual intercourse.      </p>\n\nATTITUDE OF PARENTS TOWARDS THE STUDY OF SEX EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ATTITUDE OF PARENTS TOWARDS THE STUDY OF SEX EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This r</em><em>esearch work sets out to investigate </em><em>teachers and students perception of the teaching of sexuality education </em><em>in </em><em>some selected </em><em>secondary schools in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State.

need for sexuality education in schools has become indispensable in today’s contemporary society. While many societies and culture around the world are yet to consent to the introduction of sex education in schools, belief system, political system, religion, etc., some countries sees sex education as a gateway to deal with issues related to reproductive health and sexual preference among teenagers. Sexual health is one of the five core aspects of WHO global reproductive health strategy approved by the world health assembly in 2010. (WHO, 2010). According to WHO, sexuality is a central aspect of being human throughout life and encompasses sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction. Sexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desire, belief, values, attitude, behaviours, practices and relationships. While sexuality can include all of these dimensions, not all of them are always experienced or expressed. Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, economic, political, ethical, legal, historical, religious and spiritual factors (WHO, 2010). Collins (2010) argued that sexuality education encompasses education about all aspect of sexuality education including information about family planning, reproduction, body image, sexual orientation, values, sexual pleasure, decision making, communication, dating, relationships, sexually transmitted infections and how to avoid them and birth control methods. It is also a means of safeguarding or protecting the youths against the consequences of sexual ignorance as well as preparing them for responsible life. Perception is the ability to see, hear or understand things (Nwagugu, 2011).Peter and Donald (2011), defined perception as a process by which organism interpret and organise sensation to produce a meaningful experience of the world around them. According to Morgan, King and Schopher (2010) perception are the way one notices things especially with senses like ear, eye, nose and tongue or the ability to understand the true nature of something. They further stated that it is a process by which an individual analysis or view a situation. In the context of the present study, perception is the process of becoming aware, analyses or view a situation with clear understanding of events in respect to sexuality education. Sexuality is a fundamental aspect of human nature, yet an aspect that is still considered a taboo. This is especially true with regard to adolescents, yet its group constitutes around 20% of the world’s population, or 1.4 billion people (WHO, 2013), and research has shown time and again, that despite such taboos, a considerable number are sexually active. The shame and fear of discussing sexuality with adolescents has resulted in misinformation, a lack of knowledge and skills, and negativity-skewed attitudes towards sex. This, in turn has resulted in unsafe practices. The WHO (2014) estimates that globally, more than one million people acquire an STI every day, and that over 60% of these cases are in under 24’s. Further, these dangerous practices have contributed to a global HIV epidemic, of which sub-Saharan (SSA) is the biggest victim. A 2012 report by UNAIDS, claims that SSA accounts for 69% of infected people worldwide (UNAIDS, 2012), with young woman at particular risk. Unsafe adolescent sex can be lead to unwanted pregnancies, complications including higher proportions of still births, unsafe abortion, and a risk of school expulsion and social exclusion. WHO (20120) estimates that worldwide, 16 million adolescent girls give birth every year, and an estimated three million undergo unsafe abortions. Worldwide, unsafe abortions are estimated at an average of 21/22 per 1000 women. These figures are highest in East Africa region, standing at 36 unsafe abortions per 1000 women. The primary goal of sexuality education is promotion of sexual and reproductive health, especially in Nigeria were sex education is seen as a taboo to be talked about. Generally, adolescents are not allowed to have access to sexual health information because the society  have the perception that such exposure will corrupt the child and he or she may likely be a victim of early sexual intercourse. In 2002 when the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC) in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Education, civil societies and many other International Development partners drafted and proposed a curriculum on sexuality education for primary and secondary schools, it was received with mixed feelings and generated raging controversy especially in Northern Nigeria. Within a very short time, the discussion on its acceptability or otherwise was hijacked by religious leaders and other gate-keepers and was given different connotations and coloration. A recent study carried out in Kano state of Northern Nigeria, revealed that parents have a negative perception of sexuality education in schools probability because of their religious belief and socio-cultural norms and values. In contrast, teachers had positive attitude towards teaching sexuality education in schools (Ayyuba, 2011). Nevertheless, several studies in Nigeria have validated the introduction of sex education in schools. A cross-sectional study carried out in Kwara state, Nigeria reported that 78% of the respondents suggested that sex education should be made compulsory in schools (Akande, 2010). School is a privileged setting for formal, articulate sex education as children and adolescents spent a considerable amount of their time at school and other media agents of sex education like the internet and other media can often provide non structured education. First love experience occurs at school age, and school has human and material resources for providing education. Sex education at schools contributes to its promotion in the home environment. Sex education has been shown to delay sexual initiation or increase condom use among those who are already sexually active. A recent Portuguese study reported that nearly 90% of those surveyed said sex education at school was very important and 87% believed it should be mandatory. <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong> This study intends to close the gap in knowledge regarding sexuality education because there’s a pressing need to raise the level of information among the young people especially those who are already embarking on sexually active life. It can help to prevent physical, psychological, marital and social problems related to sex. Young people get information about sex and sexuality from a wide range of sources including each other, their parents, and teacher, through the media, magazines, books and websites. Some of these sources give accurate information while others do not. Myths and misconceptions about sex and sexuality acquired by secondary school students from wrong sources may be carried throughout life and passed on to their offspring. It is however been documented that when young people are well informed, there is a delay in the age of onset of sexual activities and increased use of preventive measures against STDs and pregnancy amongst those already sexually active. This led to an overall reduction in teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. <strong>Purpose of the Study</strong> The main purpose of this study is to investigate on teachers and students perception of the teaching of sexuality education in secondary schools. It is the aim of this study to cover these misconceptions about teaching sexuality education in secondary schools in its analytical sense. It also seeks to find out the various ways in which sex education can be taught, who to teach, importance and challenges of sexuality education. It will no doubt provide information in the school curriculum. <strong>Significance of the Study</strong> This study is imperative for adolescent boys and girls as it will aid them to have access to sexual health information, make informed decision that will guarantee them a reputable future and acquire life skills to deal with sexuality and relationships in satisfactory and responsible manner. Religious organisations, policy makers, educators, parents and community/opinion leaders will find recommendations from this study useful as it will guide them in formulating effective policies in favour of sex education in schools, intensify campaigns on the need to include sex education in school curriculums, debunk any myths and misconceptions concerning sex education in schools in African societies and facilitate equitable access to sexual and reproductive health education. Sexual and reproductive health is nowadays also highly at the global level. Three of the eight internationally accepted Millennium Development Goals (MDG 3 on gender equality, MDG 5 on maternal health and MDG6 which include HIV/AIDS) are directly related to it. Hence, this study will also serve as a panacea to the attainment of these universal development goals. Data generated from this study will be informative to the government, non-government and the public health system in planning and implantation of sustainable sexuality education programs in schools.           Finally, the study would primary serve as a baseline survey for further research on sexuality education and health. <strong>Research Questions</strong> The study on teachers and students perception of the teaching of sexuality education in secondary schools In Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State aroused the following questions: 1.     What is the influence of gender on teachers and students perception of the teaching of sexuality education? 2.     Does religion influence the teachers and students perception of the teaching of sexuality education? 3.     Does socio-cultural factor influence teachers and students perception of the teaching of sexuality education? 4.     How does the age of student affect the teachers and students perception of the teaching of sexuality education?   <strong>Delimitation/ Scope of the Study</strong> This project work is delimitated to some selected secondary schools in Ikpoba Okha local government area of Edo state. The researcher centred the study to the appropriate age given by the Federal Ministry of Education to teach sexuality education in secondary schools. <strong>Limitation of the           Study</strong> Gathering accurate information from the secondary schools posed as a difficult task as most of the schools administration officers withheld student’s personal record. A major limitation of this project work was “hallow effect” where student’s sincerity level was questionable due to the nature of the topic. This was accustomed for their level of pretence in trying to maintain their pride and “look good” before their friend and colleagues.   <strong>Definition of Terms</strong> ·        Adolescents: a young person in the process of developing from a child into an adult. ·        Misconceptions: a conclusion that’s wrong because it’s based on faulty thinking or fact that is wrong. ·        Perception: the way you think about or understand someone or something. ·        Policies: a course or principle of action adopted or proposed by an organisation or individual. ·        Secondary schools: the education teaching of children between the ages 10 to 18. ·        Taboo: an activity that is forbidden or scared based on religious belief or morals. <br/><br/><br/></p>\n\nTEACHERS AND STUDENTS PERCEPTION OF THE TEACHING OF SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TEACHERS AND STUDENTS PERCEPTION OF THE TEACHING OF SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The principal aim of this research is to ascertain the influence of the home environment on academic achievement among secondary school students. To determine this, four research questions where formulated which comprises the questionnaire that was used to solicit factual information from students in Egor local Government area in Edo State through proportionate stratified random sampling techniques. <br/><br/>The sample used consisted of hundred students. The data was analyzed by the use of percentages, the factor investigated includes performance of secondary school student in relation to parental socio economic status, parents involvement with school works and other variables in the home environment that may influence student achievement. <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONEBackground of the Study<br/><br/>The academic performance of any student cannot be separated from the home environment in which the child lives, healthy home environment offers emotional security to a child. Education has one of its basic task as to train young people to become useful members of the society. This training begins at home in the informal way. The home of the child is the first place he enters as he is born into the world by his or her parents.Children are motivated to work on activities and learn new information and skills when their environments are rich in interesting activities that arouse their curiosity and offer moderate challenges. The same can be said about home environment , unfortunately there is much variability in motivational influences in homes, some homes have many activities that stimulate children thinking as well as computer, books, puzzles and parents who may be heavily interested in their children cognitive development and spent time with them on learning. Much of the variability in the relation between family income and children’s intellectual development comes from the family provision of a stimulating home environment (Young, Linver &amp; Brooks, 2002). Children intellectual development is most strongly influenced by the home environment during infancy and early childhood. When they are under the direct influence of parents. As children mature, schools and peers also begin to play a role in their intellectual socialization. There is much evidence supporting the hypothesis that the quality of a child’s early learning in the home environment relate positively to the development of intelligent and reading skills, (Meece, 2002, Sene Chai &amp; Lefevre 2002), and parental involvement in schooling also predict achievement (Luckner, Whaley &amp; Egeland, 2004). Various homes factors have been shown to be important, mother’s responsiveness, discipline style and involvement with the child, organization of the environment, availability appropriate of learning materials, opportunities for daily stimulation. Parents, who provide a warm, responsive and supporting environment, encourage exploration, stimulate curiosity and provide play and learning materials accelerate their children’s intellectual development (Meece, 2006). Which on the long run increases academic performance? Within the home environment we must examine both the roles of mothers and fathers because differentiate parent behaviour has often been implicated as a variable affecting children’s development. Some of the potential parental behaviour that can influence children motivational beliefs are:<br/><br/>Attributions for the child’s school performance<br/><br/>Perception of the task difficulty of school work<br/><br/>Value for school work<br/><br/>Expectation and confidence in children’s abilities <br/><br/>The home environment provide the foundation for learning and is an element of the student life that can affect grades. Providing opportunities to learn outside the school help facilitate student success in the school environment, as reported by the university of Minnesota extension. According to experts the mother’s educational level had the single most important impact on a young child’s academic performance. The school cannot single handedly provide the continuation of the home environment, but the can play estimate role in laying foundation of the child in learning how to read and write however, this influence is characterized by various factors such as the parents educational attainment and cultural issues. Over the years the society recorded a persisted increase in the poor performance in the various school examination such as the senior school exam (S.S.C.E) comments from educator have shown that the blame for poor performance has been as a result of neglect and care free attitude toward academic work by students and parents. It is against this background that researcher has decided to investigate academic performance on child. There are innumerable factors that affect the child academic performance as stated above. It is obvious that a child academic performance is directly related to his or her environment as well as learning facilities and socio cultural issues. Every child is born with certain level of intellectual ability and capability but a good conducive environment with adequate learning facility will help boost intellectual and academic capability of the child. Parent from good learned environment will; always have good attitude toward education any provide learning materials such as the television, instructive videos, books and toys (creative toys) etc that facilitate the learning process if they are provided.Educated parents will always believe that it is important to help a child with his or her home work and revise the school work that the child had done but this is the opposite if a child is from a poor home environment to a large extent he or she is deprived of the opportunities and he or she struggle with the teaching and learning process. <br/><br/>Statement of Problem Good education does not happen by chance. It is a product of effective teaching and learning coupled with the effort of the teacher, the school, the students, parents and their various home environments. Often at times the blames on the poor performance of students in school are shifted to the teachers and the school authorities. Most families in our society seem not to give adequate attention to the education of their children. It appears some of the parents have erroneous notion about the performance of their children, they do not know and seem to fulfill their role of guidance and encouragement in the child’s performance in schools. Some people also have the notion that the mass failure or success in schools could be traced back to the teachers and the school authorities. While other people see socio-economic status of the family as an influence to the child’s academic performance. However, some research works have revealed that the performance of the students is a joint effort of both the school authorities and that of the parents in different home environment. This calls for further research to find out the causes of the poor performance of the students and then proffer solution to that. In Edo state for instance, some students and parents have the notion that the factors responsible for the re-occurrence massive failure of student in junior and senior West African School Certificate Examinations (WASCE) is the factor emanating from the school authorities and the teachers alone. Some students even go to special Centre’s while few enlightened parents maintained that there are some factors in student’s home environment which also contribute to that. It is on this premise that this study was set out to identify some of the home environmental factor affecting the students’ academic performances and proffer solution to that.Research QuestionsAs regard to the purpose of research the blowing research question provide the forms or the study:<br/><br/>To what extent does parental involvement influence the secondary school students academic performance? 2. To what extent does parent’s occupation affect the secondary school students academic performance? 3. Does the type of family structure and family situations influence the secondary school students’ academic performance?4. To what extent does parental educational status influences secondary school students academic performance?Purpose of The StudyThe purpose of this study is to examine the home environment and its effect on academic Performance among secondary school students of Egor local government. <br/><br/>Significant of the Study<br/><br/>This study will help contribute to the existing knowledge already on ground concerning the home environment and academic achievement in secondary school student of egor local government area. The findings of the investigation will help the various authorities as teachers, parents and caregivers in adopting method or technique in child rearing as well as teaching so as to bridge the gap of variation in academic Performance and how to organize students in such a way that they are all carried along academically no mater his or her family condition. Delimitation/Scope of The Study The study was design specifically to investigate the relationship between school environment ant and the academic achievement among secondary school students in Egor local government area Edo state. It is restricted to only ten secondary school within this community. Definition of Terms <br/><br/>Academic Achievement: Refers to the level of schooling must successfully complete. Another ability to attain success in studies. (four dictionary, 2013) for example when you receive great grades, this is an example of academic achievement, where you after college and graduate school, with a good result. It should also be the extent to which a student teacher or institution has achieves their educational goal. Curriculum: Curriculum is the total Aggregate of subject or construct, course of study organized and planning by an institution like a school that is disseminated to the students within a certain time phase in a usually formal settingFamily: Collins students dictionary defines family as a social groups consisting of parents and their children it may be broader than this in some cases and yet may also be more limited to a single parent and a child/children.Literacy: traditionally literacy has been defined as the ability to read and write. However in the past twenty years or so, this conventional definition of literacy has been challenged and broadened to include a wide range of complex and multiple dimensional processes and skills.Family literature: the term family literacy was coin by Taylor (2003) in her study of the ways in which the parents impart assist the literacy of their children. This concept of family literacy should be distinguished from family literacy programs (e.g.Hannon and Bird, 2004;Was and Hermann,2004)Family Structure: the composition and membership of the family and the organization and patterning of relationships among individual family members.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n\nINFLUENCE OF HOME ENVIRONMENT ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFLUENCE OF HOME ENVIRONMENT ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Breast self examination is a monthly examination a woman can perform by herself to check for breast cancer, breast self examination is cheap and not painful, however it is dependent on the knowledge and attitude of women and young girls towards it. This study was carried out to assess the knowledge of breast self examination among fresh female students in the University of Benin.<br/><br/>A sample size of two hundred students was drawn from the population of study. A questionnaire was developed and used for collection of data. The data was analysed using frequency counts and percentages.<br/><br/>The findings revealed that there is a high level of awareness of breast cancer and breast self examination among the fresh students , the knowledge of BSE is inadequate among the students and the knowledge of the symptoms of breast cancer to watch out for during BSE is also inadequate. It was recommended among other things that curriculum planners should include the teaching of breast self examination in senior secondary school health education curriculum and workshops and training should be organized for teachers to enable them give adequate information to the students.<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/><br/>Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancer in the world among women. It is considered as the world's leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Today studies have shown that one in every eight women is likely to develop breast cancer at some point in their life (Isara and Ojedokun, 2011). Although breast cancer usually develops in after the age of 45, the age range has rapidly decreased and younger women in their early 20s are beginning to develop the disease. Cancer in younger women are generally more aggressive and can result in low survival rates making early detection to be very important.<br/><br/>Most of the deaths from breast cancer are accounted for in developing countries due to lack of early detection programs, lack of adequate diagnosis and treatment facilities. This deficiency has led to many women presenting the disease in the late stages which provides very few chances of survival.<br/><br/>The two components of early detection of breast cancer are health education to promote early diagnosis and screening (Isara and Ojedokun, 2011). Early diagnosis makes women to have more treatment options and a chance of long term survival. This can be done with the use of breast self examination (BSE), clinical breast self examination (CBE) and mammogram. In developing countries, BSE is seen to be a simple inexpensive, non-invasive and non-hazardous intervention that also encourage women to take responsibility for their health (Narimah 1999).<br/><br/>The practice of breast self examination has been suggested as part of the health promotion strategies that can help women and young girls to be familiar with there breast, its structure and how their normal breast should feel like, thereby increasing their sensitivity to detect any abnormalities in their breast. Breast self examination is cheap and not painful, however it is dependent on the knowledge and attitude of women and young girls towards it. <br/><br/>Adolescence is a transition period between childhood and adulthood and during this period significant changes occur in the body. Studies in Nigeria have shown that women and young girls have poor knowledge of breast cancer and its risk factors (Salaudeen, Akande and Musa, 2009). The adolescence period is a time that provides teaching opportunities for shaping health behaviors into adulthood. Most of the fresh undergraduate students are adolescents that need to be taught the importance of breast self examination and how to practice it in order to encourage positive behaviors towards BSE and seeking professional help when needed. <br/><br/>The need to assess the knowledge of breast self examination among fresh female students is to promote breast cancer awareness, self-care (an attitude that is fostered early in life) and change the behavior if students towards breast self examination through health education.<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/><br/>Breast cancer which is an increasing cause of death amongst women around the world can be detected early enough through regular breast self examination. Despite the measures put in place to detect the disease at the early stage, the prevalence and late detection of breast cancer is still on the increase. Breast self examination can only be practice regularly if the people are aware of the disease, the importance of breast self examination and how to perform it.<br/><br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/><br/>Are the undergraduate students aware of breast cancer and breast self examination?<br/><br/>Are the fresh students knowledgeable about how and when to examine their breast breast for breast cancer lump? <br/><br/>What is the level of their knowledge if the symptoms of breast cancer? <br/><br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>The purpose of the study therefore is to assess the level of knowledge of breast self examination among fresh female students of the University of Benin.<br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>It will enable curriculum planners to know what should be in the secondary school health education curriculum.<br/><br/>It would help health education teachers to device health education materials and manuals that would improve the the teaching strategies for breast self examination.<br/><br/>DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>This study was limited to the fresh female undergraduate students of the University of Benin, Benin City. Where the researcher is familiar with the environment and is likely to gain access to the population to be studied. <br/><br/>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>It was difficult to make generalization from the findings of the study because of the sample size, as the researcher was not able to utilize all members of the population of study.<br/><br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/><br/>Breast self examination: This refers to a monthly examination a woman can do by herself to check for a lump or signs of breast cancer. It involves manual palpitation of the breast while standing ir lying down.<br/><br/>Breast cancer: It is an uncontrolled growth of breast cells that forms a tumor in the breast.</p>\n\nACKNOWLEDGE OF BREAST SELF EXAMINATION AMONG FRESH FEMALE STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ACKNOWLEDGE OF BREAST SELF EXAMINATION AMONG FRESH FEMALE STUDENTS", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The aim and purpose of this research work is to look into student’s behavior and sexual activities which expose them to contracting sexually transmitted infections, level of awareness of students towards sexually transmitted infections, factors that combine to determine the risk factors of contracting sexually transmitted infections.<br/><br/>A survey research design was adopted for this study using a structured questionnaire; the population of the study was basically students in Ekosodin community, a simple random sampling technique, data and information collected were analyzed using frequency counts and percentages.<br/><br/>The result shows that the students have a high level of awareness concerning sexually transmitted infections showing that awareness level is not a risk factor of contracting sexually transmitted infections, students disputed the fact that pre – marital sex is a factor responsible for sexually transmitted infections which is not in accordance with WHO ( 2005 &amp; 2008) global estimates on the incidence and prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among youths from 15 – 49 years but due to the sensitive nature of this topic might have influenced the students response which deemed to perpetuate denial tendency. The response on the attitude of students towards the use of contraceptive revealed that it is not a factor responsible for sexually transmitted infections and to a large extent the reasons why students engage in sexual activities.

There are many new cases of sexually transmitted infection occurrences among all ages and works of life. The need for the study of sexually transmitted infections among students has become indispensable in today’s contemporary society. While many individuals, societies and cultures around the world are yet to consent that sexually transmitted infections leads to various complications later in life, mostly because of their religion, socio cultural background and their belief system etc. In 2011, 11,000 cases of sexually transmitted infections were notified in Ireland. While young age is a risk factor, it is important to know that STIs are not only confined to young people. Health care professionals do not often discuss risky sexual behavior and STI prevention with middle age and older adults. According to Ravi and Nair (2011), viral and bacterial STIs are estimated over 250million cases yearly. In fact, 356,000 new cases occur daily. Controlling the spread of STIs is an important consideration with the high incidence of acute infections and complications, its socio – economic impact and its role in the transmission of HIV. STIs have reached epidemic levels and the number of new infections reported annually shows pattern of steady increase. Although population in developing countries is heterogeneous, it is young and the incidence and prevalence of STIs is likely to increase among persons aged 20 – 40years.<br/><br/>The factors that contribute directly and indirectly to high incidence of STIs include urbanization, unemployment, poverty, antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria and large numbers of people in the sexually active age group. Infection rates are similar in both women and men but women bear the major burden of complications. STIs are troublesome because they are difficult to identify, treat and control. They are dynamic than any other diseases prevailing in the community. Its epidemiological profile varies from country to country and region to region depending on the ethnographic, demographic, socio – economic and health factors. World health organization (2008) presented a report on global and regional estimates of the incidence and prevalence of four curable sexually transmitted infections which are chlamydia, trichomonas, vaginalis, which is common in adults between 15 and 49 years of age. These estimates were generated using the same approach as used to generate the 2005 global estimates. The 2008 estimates of the number of new cases for the four infections combined is 11% higher than the estimate for 2005. Worldwide sexually transmitted infections continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Although, the figure given is likely to be doubled at present. Sexually transmitted infections tools and interventions have been available for years because serious health problems are prevented if these infections are diagnosed and treated early. Viral infections such as herpes .genital warts and HIV aremuch more difficult to treat and in some cases no cure exists. More than one million people were been infected daily, about 60% of those infection occur in young people of 25years of age and 30% of the age group of 25years of age and 30% of the age group of 20years. Sexually transmitted infections occur frequently in girls more than the boys by ratio of nearly 2: 1. This is due to some environmental factors, natural phenomenon.<br/><br/>According to a source on immunization and infectious diseases: an informed parents’ guide (copyright @2006 American academy of pediatrics), sexually transmitted infections are spread through direct sexual contact. Teenagers and young adults have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections than any other age group and one of the main reasons is that they frequently have unprotected sex. They are also biologically more likely to develop an infection and theymay be likely to use health care services that could give them information on how to protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections. Others factors that give rise to the spread of sexually transmitted infections are population explosive. Marked increase in the number of young people, rural to urban migration and increasing educational opportunities. They also include social disruption like war, terrorism, civil unrest, international travel, broken homes, disharmony etc. It is worthy to note that these predisposing factors to STIs emanate from the environment one may find may find him or himself. Experience and education give rise to knowledge, attitude and practice towards health related issues.<br/><br/>World health organization (2007) global estimates suggest that more than 340million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis occur throughout the world up to 10% of the women who were not treated or inadequately treated for gonococcal and chlamydial infections may become infertile as a consequence. Reuters 2014 also discussed the issue of sexually transmitted infections and it aims to keep practitioners, trainees and researchers up to date in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. Sexually transmitted infections cut – across gender, age, cultural, social and economic background. In spite of these facts, sexually transmitted infection has been observed to be very common among undergraduate students which make them prone. Environment and man are inseparable and complementary; these actually affect the way a man live and do things. Environmental factors can put pressure on man especially adolescents and youths to engage in sexual activities which may pose negative effects on their health.Moreoften than not a good number of adolescents drop out of school due to diseases and sickness which maybe as a result of sexually transmitted infections.This therefore calls for an urgent need for an investigation which informed the choice of this topic and I feel there is need for evaluation of risk factors of contracting sexually transmitted infections among students in Ekosodin community with a view to curb the tide and menace caused by sexually transmitted infections.<br/><br/>Statement of the Problem<br/><br/>It is assumed that a large number of university undergraduate students have heard about sexually transmitted infections and its consequences. Majority have pre – knowledge about the risk of contracting the infection. However, a number of undergraduate students who are emotionally and sexually active often ignore several warnings to engage in indiscriminate and unsafe sexual activities which them vulnerable to the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections and sexual behavior.<br/><br/>The study will investigate the level of sexually transmitted infections using hostels in Ekosodin community. Knowledge of sexually transmitted infections among undergraduates, the general risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, steps to follow to avoid being a victim of sexually transmitted infections and methods of educating and disseminating information to control the contractionofsexually transmitted infections among undergraduate students in Ekosodin community.<br/><br/>Purpose of the Study<br/><br/>The purpose of this research study is to examine the various factors that combine to determine the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections among students in Ekosodin community. The level to which students in Ekosodin are knowledgeable about sexually transmitted infections, the intending inventory to provide an estimate of the risk factors and ways in which one can prevent the contraction of sexually transmitted infections. The study would also look into student’s behavior and sexual activities which expose them to contracting sexually transmitted infections.<br/><br/>Significance of the Study<br/><br/>The research project may be considered significant for several reasons. It is hoped that this study will enlighten students in Ekosodin community and the society at large concerning the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections. Since sexually transmitted infections affect both male and female students, this study will reduce gender behaviors that would make them prone to sexually transmitted infections. This study to a large extent will consider the major factors responsible for sexually transmitted infections among students in Ekosodin community.<br/><br/>Finally, the result of the study will pave –way for better understanding of sexually transmitted infections in terms of causes types, effects, prevention, curative effort on sexually transmitted infections, management on students in Ekosodin community and Nigeria at large.<br/><br/>Research Questions<br/><br/>1. What is the awareness level of students towards sexually transmitted Infections?<br/><br/>2. Does pre – marital sex contribute to sexually transmitted infections?<br/><br/>3. What is the attitude of students towards the use of contraceptive? <br/><br/>E.g. condom <br/><br/>4. What are the reasons why students engage in sexual activities?<br/><br/>Scope / Delimitation of the Study <br/><br/>The study is delimited to undergraduate students in Ekosodin community and to assess specifically the risk factors of contracting sexually transmitted infections and its prevalence.<br/><br/>Limitation<br/><br/>In conducting a study like this, there are obvious limitation as to ways society perceive and regard people affected with sexually transmitted infections. Students in the community will be reluctant in giving out private information regarding the signs and symptoms they have in relation to sexually transmitted infections and other previous experiences.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n\nRISK FACTORS OF CONTRACTING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AMONG STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RISK FACTORS OF CONTRACTING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AMONG STUDENTS", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Background of the Study<br/><br/>Most large Nigeria cities are overcrowded, due to urban attraction and developments such as universities, job opportunities, security and so on. Little controlled urban growth leads to poor management of solid and liquid wastes produced by cities. This leads to many problems of sanitation. The sanitation in these cities is generally dominated by self purification works. They often repress wastewater that trickles down in living quarter streets emitting strong foul odours (Strauss, Downing, Rondon, 1994).<br/><br/>Disease related to poor sanitation and water availability cause many people to die of sickness like cholera, diarrhea, typhoid which damages the body tissues. Children are most vulnerable to health hazards and consequently are affected the most. In 1998, 2.2 million people died because of poor sanitation, which the vast majority were children (WHO, 2004).<br/><br/>There has been considerable awareness of water supply in off-campus hostels, but the problems of excreta and waste disposal have received less attention. In some of these hostels, every where is littered with pure water polythene, pieces of paper and so on, without proper disposal (Erijakpor, 2006). In order to focus attention to these to these problems, sanitation exercises should be done daily to keep the environment clean by employing labourers that will keep the hostels clean(Anyaka, 2004). Some of the students in these hostels have poor sanitary and hygienic practices that can cause diseases. Environments should be fumigated in order to kill dangerous animals and rodents like snakes, rats, scorpions etc.<br/><br/>Inadequate sanitation is a major cause of disease world-wide and improving sanitation is known to have a significant beneficial impact on health both in households, school hostels (on campus or off-campus) and across communities (Guiterez, 1992). The word “sanitation” also refers to the maintenance of hygienic conditions, through services such as garbage collection and wastewater disposal. <br/><br/>Sanitation includes all four of these engineering infrastructure items (even though often only the first one is strongly associated with the term “sanitation”):<br/><br/>Excreta management systems<br/><br/>Wastewater management systems<br/><br/>Solid waste management systems <br/><br/>Drainage systems for rainwater.(Strauss, 2000).<br/><br/>The term sanitation has been connected to several descriptors so that the terms sustainable sanitation, improved sanitation, unimproved sanitation, ecological sanitation, environmental sanitation, on-site sanitation, dry sanitation are all in use today (Obode, 1989).<br/><br/>Hygiene is very important to healthy living and survival of humanity especially to students in these off-campus hostels where little or no care is given to the sanitary conditions. Hygiene is the practice of keeping one-self and one's surroundings clean so as to prevent illness or the spread of preventable diseases (Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation and Ministry of Education, 2009).<br/><br/>It is often referred to as the behaviours and measures which are adopted so as to break the chain of transmission of infections both at home and in school. While lack of safe water, sanitation and prevalence of poor hygiene behaviours is the major cause of death among students in developing countries, a contaminated environment and poor hygiene practices account for over 6% of the total burden of disease among students in these countries (UNICEF &amp; WHO, 2009).<br/><br/>In some of these off-campuses, there are problems of over crowding and these affects the health of the students in these hostels. More than 50 students share 3 toilets. Mostly girls in hostels have inadequate sanitation facilities, with this premise , the researcher seek to find out the implication of sanitation practices on students health in off-campus hostels in Ugbowo. Inadequate sanitation and water in these hostels jeopardise students health to a large extent (Nouhei, 1991).<br/><br/>Statement of the Problem<br/><br/>Good sanitary practices (cleanliness) they say is next to Godliness. Even with this unique adage, people still take sanitation with levity. This nonchalant attitude has caused the control of pests and waste disposal to be difficult because of poor sanitation practices. Diseases related to poor sanitation and water availability causes many people to die of sickness like cholera, diarrhea, malaria, typhoid which damages the body tissues.<br/><br/>Much is not known of the part the owners of these hostels have contributed in curbing poor sanitary practices, but the fact still remains that he students themselves should put in their best effort to practice good sanitation. In order to effectively tackle this problem, this study will attempt to answer the following questions:<br/><br/>Research Questions<br/><br/>What are the causes of poor sanitation practices of these off-campus students?<br/><br/>What are the dangers of poor sanitation practices on the health of these students?<br/><br/>What are the strategies that could be employed to improve sanitation in these off-campus locations?<br/><br/>Do the students have a roll to play in these sanitary practices?<br/><br/>What are the efforts of the managers or owners of these off-campus sites/locations to improve good sanitation practices or curb poor sanitary practices?<br/><br/>Purpose of the Study<br/><br/>The purpose of this study is to find out the implications of sanitation practices on off-campus students health in Ugbowo, Benin City.<br/><br/>Specifically this study was to:<br/><br/>Identify the causes of poor sanitation practices on these students health in Ugbowo vicinity.<br/><br/>Determine the extent to which the managers/owners of these off-campus sites/locations have contributed in providing facilities that will enhance sanitation practices and efforts of the students in improving sanitation practices.<br/><br/>Find out the strategies that could be employed to curb dirtiness in these places.<br/><br/>Significance of the Study<br/><br/>The findings of this study will enable the students in these off-campuses to better understand and cultivate a clean environment because cleanliness is next o Godliness. The findings will help the students to know the need of hygiene or health practices and also enable them to have a sound health. If sanitation is practiced by the students, sickness and diseases will be reduced.<br/><br/>The findings will also help the managers to provide adequate facilities that enable the users(students) of these places keep their environment clean and tidy. If this is done, it will also help them to improve on he practices.<br/><br/>Delimitation of the Study<br/><br/>The study delimited itself to sanitation practices and its implication on students health on off-campus hostels in Ugbowo, Benin City.<br/><br/>Limitations of the Study<br/><br/>The limitations encountered by the researcher include- non-cooperation from the students, landlords and care-takers of these hostels.<br/><br/>Definition of Terms<br/><br/>Sanitation: It is the process of keeping places free from dirt, infection, diseases by removing wastes, trash and garbage by cleaning streets, schools and homes.<br/><br/>Hygiene: Conditions or practices conducive to maintaining health and preventing diseases, especially through cleanliness.<br/><br/>Waste Disposal: Proper disposition of an discarded material in accordance with local environmental guidelines or laws.<br/><br/>Garbage: Wasted or spoiled foods or materials from or other refuse as from a kitchen or household that one is willing to pay to get rid of.<br/><br/>Sewage: This is a water-carried waste in solution or suspension, that is intended to be removed from a community.<br/><br/>Environmental Sanitation: These are activities aimed at improving or maintaining the standard of basic environmental conditions affecting the well-being of people.<br/><br/>On-site Sanitation: This is a collection and treatment of waste which is deposited where it is done. Examples are he uses of pit latrines and septic tanks.<br/><br/>Dry Sanitation: It is an on-site disposal method that requires the separation of urine and feces.<br/><br/>Diseases: A disorder of structure or function in a human, animal or plant, especially one that produces specific signs and symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury.<br/><br/>Sickness: A general term used to refer to physical illness or disease, the feeling of being affected with nausea or vomiting.</p>\n\nSANITARY PRACTICES AND IMPLICATIONS ON OFF-CAMPUS STUDENTS HEALTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SANITARY PRACTICES AND IMPLICATIONS ON OFF-CAMPUS STUDENTS HEALTH", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Abandonment of development projects (ACP) is considered one of the most common and serious problems plaguing the Abuja development industry given the number and the value of the projects involved.

The total value of development projects awarded in ABUJA in 2012 amounted to RM 112.5 billion (CIDB ABUJA 2013) and has created a lot of job opportunities to help boost the country‟s economy. The number of employed persons in the development industry in ABUJA in 2011 is 1.134 million, which constitutes 9.2% of the total 12.284 million employed persons (Department of Statistics 2011).

It is also not uncommon for development projects to be delayed, or in the worst scenario even abandoned due to various reasons.</p> <p>A project may be abandoned at any stage of the lifecycle and incur significant amount of loss. For a housing project, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government considers that it has been abandoned if 1) there has been no substantial activity on site for six consecutive months, or 2) it is involved in a winding-up petition registered at the High Court under Section 218 of the Companies Act, or 3) it is under receivership, or 4) the developer has informed the Housing Controller in writing of his inability to complete the project, or 5) the project has been certified to be abandoned by the Minister under Section 11 (1) (c) of Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 (i.e. Act 118) (MHLG 2011).

However, in ABUJA this problem has been plaguing long enough at a scale that deserves more attention. In 2000, there were 514 abandoned housing projects in Abuja with an estimated value of RM 7.5 billion (see Table 1.1). Even though the number has been gradually decreasing, it is reported that in September 2012 there are still a total of 95 abandoned housing projects involving 37,316 units of houses and 26,170 house buyers (MHLG 2012). On top of the figure, there are also other non-housing projects being abandoned throughout the years. For instance, the Plaza Rakyat, a RM 1.5 billion mix use project, remains abandoned even though it was scheduled to be completed in 1998 (Jayaraj, 2009).

The paying customer sees only the “front of the complex” and this must be all he desires- a wish fulfillment, an ago blinder, a status symbol and the promise of great delight.</p> <p>The “back of the hotel complex “is all that makes things happen. These include the kitchens, stores, service, etc. this area must be laid out with two paramount objectives: control and efficiency. Control is important because pilfering is a real danger while inefficiency results in time wastage and reduction in productivity.</p> <p>When a guest enters the hotel lobby, he should be over whelmed by a feeling of serenity or enchantment or revulsion,- but never confusion. The registration desk for instance and the elevators should be immediately apparent. The main administrative area usually backs up to the desk. The restaurants, bars and other such spaces should be either visible from or well indicated in the lobby area.,</p> <p>I .the exploitation of the site configuration and characteristics in the location of facilities</p> <ol><li>Circulation (vertical and horizontal), Ie. The problem created by the different directional movements.</li> </ol> <p>iii. The architecture of the proposed hotel complex must be attractive. The design elements must inspire and evoke feelings among the guests.</p> <ol><li>The proper grouping and organization of functions in the whole site to arsid intrusive noise.</li> </ol> <ol><li>Provision of adequate parking facilities for both the staff and other users.</li> </ol> <p>1.2 THE PROJECT AIMS</p> <p>The aim of this project is to produce a design proposal for a five-star hotel development at Emene, Enugu state. Also to attract foreign and local investors to establish part of their business in the state capital (Enugu) and Nigeria as a whole</p> <p>THE PROJECT OBJECTIVE</p> <p>The research will pursue the following objective:</p> <p>Assessing the development of the hotel industry in Enugu state in particular and Nigeria in general.</p> <p>Determining the socio- economic implications of hotel development in Enugu state</p> <p>Designing a hotel capable of catering for national and international guests in their diversity of needs, food, lodging, services, recreation, etc.</p> <p>It should be capable of housing meetings, exhibitions, seminars, connections or business transactions and should meet the internationally accepted standard for five star hotels as much as possible.</p> <p>It should strive to project the rich cultural heritage of Enugu state in particular and the Nigeria in general</p> <p>It should solve inadequacy of accommodation supply, since newly created state capitals and increasingly short of accommodation in hotel services.</p> <p>It should be able to accommodate those people on small or big business trips with informed taste, who do not like the hustle and bustle of the city center, but rather prefer the reserved atmosphere of a hotel and more freedom from the congested city environment, for instance those on relaxing weekend which may also need a relaxing atmosphere like a hotel.</p> <p>It should not only help to make the  economy of the state grow but also will add as a tourist attraction  to the capital city of Enugu and many other factors that cannot be exhausted in this synopsis .</p> <p>THE PROJECT MOTIVATION</p> <p>This project topic has it genesis in my desire to do an intensive, demanding, but rewarding topic for the thesis project.</p> <p>The emergence of Governor Sullivan Chime as the executive governor of the state from 2007 has brought a face-lift for the state as well as an attendant influx of personnel for both business and state affairs mere catalyst for this project. Such projects will thus solve this problem of inadequate hotel accommodation, boost potentials for the state and provide an international business convection centre for both local and foreign businessmen. It is expected that the commercial cities of Enugu and neighboring Abia will boost its patronage since there is no existing five star hotel in Enugu.</p> <p>THE PROJECT SCOPE</p> <p>This thesis report looks at the universal principles of hotel design and uses this as a foundation for the design of a five-star hotel for Enugu state. The study and analysis of local and international hotels were made and these helped me see the effect of theoretical design principles of life projects.</p> <p>The project shall be a five- star hotel of international standard. The hotel shall have about 250-300 bedrooms with a high proportion of double bedded guest rooms together with interconnecting suites. The hotel shall be capable of catering for international and national guests in their diversity of needs.</p> <p>Limitations encountered in the course of the study of this research include:</p> <p>Paucity of material on the chosen thesis topic.</p> <p>The problem of procuring the government station layout plan at Enugu the capital</p> <p>Transportation and the fee to procure the plan from the plan office.</p> <p>The unco-operative attitude of some of the hotel management visited in taking of interior and exterior photographs of their hotel facilities.</p> <p>Bad weather conditions an some certain days of visit which did not make for a very good photograph.</p> <p>Time factor was also a serious obstacle. The time limit set for the research and preparation of such a complex text not enough for all that needed to be done.</p> <p>However, diligent use has been made of the available information and collected data. Not minding the time constraint, the researcher was able to complete this work.</p> <p>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The research procedure in this thesis project is mainly deduction analysis- ie, it involved collection of data from the various sources, that are deemed relevant to give me the information needed in this thesis project. Some of these procedures are as follows.</p> <p>Site \\field visits and observation were used directly in matters concerning the analysis of the project site. Photographs were taken in this aspect so as to obtain documented site information that was needed.</p> <p>The use of semi-standardized interview surveys as was adopted, whereby schedules of questions were presented to respondents. This was used particularly to determine guest profile characteristics and references. Oral interviews we applied also, to obtain necessary information on an informal basis.</p> <p>Literature review: this involved mostly using the library in getting other information that will be of relevance to the thesis project. Some published and unpublished work was consulted so as to get the necessary data needed for this work.</p> <p>In order to produce a befitting and sustainable design for the five star hotel, researches were conducted by the use of questionnaires, face-to-face interview.

Development of a Country or State depends on its ability to manage and deal with challenges that come with development, such as over-population, pressure on facilities (roads, electricity), accommodation problems, environmental pollutions and other implications. In conducting this study, the researcher elicited relevant data from both the primary and secondary sources. Questionnaire was the main instrument for data collection. Three hundred and ninety- nine (399) copies of questionnaire were administered to the respondents of the three local government areas. Subsequently, the collected data were analyzed with simple percentage, and presented in frequency tables for easy comprehension. The hypotheses were also tested through chi-square ( From  the data presentation and analysis, and discussion of results therein, the researcher arrived at the following findings: The housing estate are mostly owned by individuals or private companies and are very expensive; the transformers provided are not consummate with the population increase; the state lacks available lands for agriculture as most of the lands are affected by erosion, floods and landslides. The researcher recommends the following: Government should be in partnership with some of these individuals and companies so as eliminate accommodations problems, government should be stain that materials used for transformers are adequate while making sure that the agricultural extension programmes are well financed in real terms as this will help manage the problems of rural-urban migration and bring about development.</p> <p>INTRODUTION</p> <p>1.1      BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>The burden of rural-urban migration in Anambra State is multifaceted and intertwining. As such, an analysis of one decompose component or consequence, such as unbearable population density, impinges on other issues within the identifiable cycle of burdens. For instance, in examining the management of rural- urban migration and its effect on economic development, has it result to increase in population in the urban areas   while the rural areas lack development or at the extreme its explosion. Various other subsequent effects are expected to be considered.</p> <p>Population explosion activates the housing challenge both at micro (family) and macro (society) levels. Congestion in households and communities has implications for both the health and psychology of victims. Nigerian cities such as Lagos, Port-Harcourt, Kano, and Onitsha among others are characterized by human traffic, vehicular congestions, environmental pollution, consistent in-migration and spurious expansion of territories to accommodate human additions.</p> <p>Nigeria is a country with over 150,000,000 million people (Censes 2006)</p> <p>and the giant of Africa. Most international organizations and foreign investors find</p> <p>a good market in Nigeria. The oil-boom in the 1970s has deeply affected the economic development of the  country and  continues to  do  so  as  government focuses on oil sector and neglects the agricultural sector which was the prime of the economy and economic development before the oil-boom. Government insensitivity to the plight of the rural communities whose major source of livelihood is agriculture has lead to migration of the rural dwellers to urban area for a good standard of living.</p> <p>Nigeria, at independence in 1960, was largely a producer and net exporter of primary products. The six major agricultural products then were cocoa, rubber, palm oil, groundnut, cotton and palm kernel (Idode, 1989).  Although there existed mining and quarrying activities, these were of negligible percentage and never counted for the economy as a whole (Olaloku, 1979). In other words, agricultural produce  and  raw   materials  constituted  the  main  income  for  the  country. Specifically, the Nigerian state as an exporter of agricultural goods had 69.4% of its total GDP for the year 1963/64 comprising the six aforementioned agricultural commodities (Olaloku, 1979:8).</p> <p>Rural-Urban migration has led to uneven development of the country.  The urban areas are over-populated while the rural areas are densely-populated, as young men and women leave the rural areas due to lack of infrastructures, social amenities, employment and economic development of the rural areas. According to</p> <p>Nyagba (2009), rural communities are the most important sectors of the Nigerian economy, indeed the West African regional population. There are several reasons to support this position.</p> <p>Agriculture and rural development are crucial for the structural transformation and economic development of West Africa region. Agriculture contributes 20 per cent of GDP in northern Africa and 30 per cent of GDP in sub – Saharan Africa (Nyagba, 2009). The rural population represents an average of over</p> <p>60 percent of the total population on the continent; about 90 per cent of the rural labor force engages directly or indirectly in agricultural activities. For the continent‟s rural people,  accelerated agricultural and rural development would contribute to greater efficiency, increased household income, improved standards of living, and poverty reduction.</p> <p>According to Onah (2010), agriculture had been the main foreign earnings in Nigeria before the advent of oil and accounted for major contribution to her GDP. Agriculture is a major source of employment for over 80% of Nigerians before oil dominated the economy. The poor technology, environmental hazards, high cost of implements due to neglect of agriculture has forced the rural farmer and young people in search of white collar jobs and high rate of rural-urban drift to survive. According to Peil (1981), people who migrate are mainly motivated by the desire to  improve  their  standard  of  living  above  what  is  earlier  obtained  at  home.</p> <p>Migration is also caused by the desire of people to go to school and acquire knowledge to develop themselves and their environment</p> <p>Migration from the rural area to the urban area has become almost accepted as a normal phenomenon in Anambra state as many rural dwellers migrate to major urban areas in the state like Awka, Onitsha, Nnewi etc. as a result of economic development in these urban area. Most of the youths who want to enroll into tertiary  institutions  come  to  Awka,  where  federal  universities,  College  of Education and other private universities are located. Those who want to engage in business and entrepreneurship find themselves in Onitsha. Onitsha is one of the largest commercial centers in West Africa, while others go to Nnewi to establish industries where household materials are produced and various auto parts are assembled. Therefore, most of the youth and adult men and women of working age (18-60) have left the rural area which has contributed negatively to economic development of Anambra state. The elderly men and women are left to provide for themselves with their little farm lands since most lands are used to build large mansions which nobody lives rather some people are paid to keep watch over their properties.</p> <p>However, some of the migrants come back to these rural areas with experiences from the urban area, having made use of all forms of techniques to survive as a result of high competition in those urban areas. Some may set up</p> <p>patent medicine store, motor mechanics workshops, vulcanizing, hair salon, supermarket, restaurants, etc. while others may terrorize the rural dwellers, through robbery, kidnapping and criminal activities. Likewise the urban areas suffer from overpopulation,  unemployment,  crime,  social  vices,  over  utilization  of infrastructure and poor management of social amenities. If the rural communities are able to develop the local technology, thereby give way for further development, it will attract government, international bodies, non government organizations and other agencies to support development of such area.</p> <p>Policies and project such as rural electrification, self-help projects, DFRRI, ADP, NOA, ANIDS, NEEDS and SEEDS were some of the programmes setup by the federal, state or local government to manage the rural urban migration through some of these rural development policies or integrated rural development to see to its success. However management of rural-urban migration in the state seems to have some difficulty. In managing some of the programmes the state or local government, have put in place some agencies to address these problems and its adverse effects on economic development of the state. These agencies will be analyzed effectively to see how adequate they are in carrying out their duties.</p> <p>Rural-urban migration has affected food production in the state. Most of the basic food stuffs are imported from the northern part of the country even t hough we  have  a  better  climate  condition  in  the  eastern  region.  The  inadequate</p> <p>infrastructure and social amenities has also hampered development as most of the programmes and projects are located in the urban areas while the primary beneficiaries do not benefit from the project. In Nigeria most of the developmental plans are in favour of the urban areas.   Business and commercial activities are successful where the market is. The rural areas do not have that market and factors of production are inadequate for economic development in Anambra state. It is on the strength of this situation and occurrences, that the researcher decided to study the”Management of Rural-Urban Migration and Economic Development, with emphasis on Anambra State.</p>\n\nMANAGEMENT OF RURAL URBAN MIGRATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MANAGEMENT OF RURAL URBAN MIGRATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABTRASCT</p> <p>The advent and advances made in computer technology in the twenty-first century has generally increased the speed and the capacity of various geoinformation and map-making processes.

The research solely focuses on Makoko community and the assessment of its flooding problems. The research revealed that 44(55.0) of the respondent were below 25 years, 20 of the respondent were between 25 – 35, 12 of the respondent were between 36 – 35, 4 of the respondent were above 46 years. The majority of the respondents were under 25 year. The characteristics of the drainage channel in this research work revealed that most of the drainage were open drainage while few were closed.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong> BACKGROUND OF  STUDY</strong></p> <p>.A flood is an overflow of an expanse of water that submerges land  Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters in the world, claiming more lives and causing more property damage than any other natural phenomena. In Lagos metropolis, though not leading in terms of claiming lives, flood affects and displaces more people than any other disaster it also causes more damage to properties. At least 20 per cent of the population is at risk from one form of flooding or another (Etuonovbe, 2011).</p> <p>Iwena (2005) described flooding to be the accumulation of an abnormal large volume of water in an area which has refused to percolate or flow away, it usually occurs when there is heavy rainfall in an area and all the water refuses to sink into the soil but flows on the earth`s surface as floods. When such floods occur in the cities it is referred to as Urban Flooding.</p> <p>Etuonovbe (2011) stated that flooding may occur when water in the river overflows its banks, or sometimes results from a torrential rainfall due to climate change. It happens without warning but with a surprise package that always delivers to unprepared community like the ones in the Lagos metropolis i.e Makoko, Ikorodu, Victoria Island, Ajegunle, Bariga and so on. In Makoko, flood disaster has been perilous to people and communities. Recently and other parts of lagos state have been affected by flooding, chasing the inhabitants away and retarding commercial activities. It has shattered both the built-environment and underdeveloped areas. It has claimed  lives, and thousands of properties got lost or destroyed due to its occurrences. One prominent feature about it is that flooding does not discriminate, but marginalizes whosoever refuses to prepare for its occurrence (UNHabitat, 2008).There are factors of flooding depending on locality</p> <p>McGranahan et al. (2007) noted that while economic activity and urban Development often increase the environmental pressures that lead to flooding, it is the low Income settlements and poor groups within all settlements that tend to be the most vulnerable. Coastal towns are by far the most developed of Africa’s urban areas and by implication, have a high concentration of residential, industrial, commercial, educational and military facilities which are vulnerable to this environmental hazard (UNHabitat, 2008).</p> <p>Whereas flooding itself is a situation that results when land that is usually dry is covered with water of a river overflowing or heavy rain, flooding occurs naturally on the flood plains which are prone to disaster.</p> <p>Generally, Flood is caused by two major factors which involves the human and man-made factors, these factors obviously are responsible for the generation and continuous occurrence of flooding in the environment, and at any point negatively effects the environment at large.</p> <p> The impact of flooding may be a worldwide phenomenon, but the effects are more devastating in African cities stated (Niasse, 2004). Also Makoko in Lagos state is not an exception given their prevailing socio-economic problems in the area of housing in the urban areas. Urban areas will be faced with increases in the frequency and intensity of heavy rainstorms, ocean surges and other extreme weather events. The urban centers that will be more at risk are those where these events are already widespread.</p> <p>Floods of 2010 have created huge problems for the people of affected areas of the country. The World Bank estimated some 17.6 million have been affected by this disaster (Independent Evaluation Group, 2010). Damage of crops, roads, housings and other infrastructure is estimated more than $6.5 billion. Health problems including the spread of water-borne diseases have made the life challenge for the people of affected areas.</p> <p>Floods and storms may have considerable adverse impacts depending on location, intensity and duration. In 2003, floods accounted for 3,723 fatalities around the world, exceeded only by heat waves (about 22,000 due to the very extreme summer heat wave in Southern Europe) and earthquakes (about 48,000, mostly due to the Bam Iran disaster) (Munich Re 2003). The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reports that weather-related disasters from a global perspective have been on the rise since 1996 and increasing from an annual average of 200 (1993–97) to 331 (1998–2002) (International Federation 2001 and 2003). The number of disasters attributed to floods is on the rise, while on average the number of people killed due to floods remains steady (Munich Re 2003). The economic costs of flood disasters have been increasing globally. Pielke et al. (2002) found that flood losses were falling to a proportion of GDP although the gross loss is on the rise. The increase in flood disasters is possibly due to more heavy rainfall events, increased economic activity, and efficiency of the use of a catchment (Green 1999; Mirza et al. 2001).</p> <p>Defra (2004) evaluated health impacts on flood affected people of England and Wales and found the existence of stress and other psychological difficulties among them. Floods can affect health directly, for example, by causing injuries and deaths due to drowning. These can occur during or in the aftermath of a flood disaster when the residents return to their dwellings to clean up the damage and debris. Floodwaters also can affect health indirectly, through changes in other systems (for example, waterborne infections, acute or chronic effects of exposure to chemical pollutants released into floodwaters, vector borne diseases, food shortage, and others). Floods also can increase the risk of cholera, diarrhoea, schistosomiasis, dengue, yellow fever, malaria, Hantavirus, and other diseases.</p> <p>Oni (2003) stated that Floods make an enormous impact on the environment and society. Floods destroy drainage systems in cities, causing raw sewage to spill out into bodies of water. Also, in cases of severe floods, buildings can be significantly damaged and even destroyed. This can lead to catastrophic effects on the environment as many toxic materials such as paint, pesticide and gasoline can be released into the Drainage channels like: rivers, lakes, bays, and ocean, killing maritime life (library.thinkquest.org).</p> <p>Floods may also cause millions worth of damage to a city, both evicting people from their homes and ruining businesses. Floods cause significant amounts of erosion to coasts, leading to more frequent flooding if not repaired.  The attendant loss of life and properties leaves a bitter taste in the mouth of its victims and no one is left out. Extreme climatic events have significant economic and social impacts, especially where infrastructure is damaged – for example domestic and commercial buildings, transport, energy and water supply to trade, transport and services. Irrespective of whether urban floods are part of larger riverine floods or result from inadequate drainage capacities, the damage potential of floods in cities is extraordinarily high. Given the high spatial concentration of people and values in cities, even small scale floods may lead to considerable damages. In extreme cases urban floods can result in disasters that set back urban development by years or even decades. Recent statistics clearly indicate that economic damages caused by urban floods are rising (MunichRe, 2005). On one hand, the continuing urbanization process in combination with an over-proportional growth of values in cities is responsible for this trend, while on the other hand floods are indeed increasing, both in terms of frequency and magnitude.</p> <p>Therefore, from the above observation, the vulnerability of Lagos Metropolis to this threats from Flooding are very extensive and numerous, the fact that Lagos is an urban metropolis, in fact the Largest urban agglomeration in Africa and Africa’s most populated city with 18 million people and a Population growth rate of 6% per annum Projected at 25million people by 2015 (Odjogu,  2008). Lagos being the industrial and commercial nerve of Nigeria and the most populous nation in Africa contributes to the phenomena which makes it pertinent for all the stakeholders to bring to the fore the issue of Flooding and various mitigating and adaptive measures to cushion its effects on socio-economic activities in the Lagos Metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>  STATEMENT OF RESEARCH  PROBLEM</strong></p> <p> The assessment of  flooding problems in the Makoko area of Lagos as earlier observed   initiates devastating consequences for the economy of the state and consequently housing and infrastructural developments. Flooding has had adverse effect on the economy of the metropolis, creating large scale underdevelopment in some very economic vital areas, hence, increasing population density in less vulnerable communities and towns in the metropolis which leads to overpopulation and congestion. Sea-level rise will have significant impacts on coastal areas of Africa, especially on its coastal megacities; because of the concentration of poor populations in potentially hazardous areas those are more vulnerable to such changes (Klein <em>et al</em>., 2002; Nicholls, 2004).</p> <p>Traditionally, studies have shown that flooding occur naturally through excessive rainfall etc. Also this flooding could be as a result of human activities such as blockage of drainage, excessive pavement of land, deforestation due to overconsumption and felling of forest trees, neglect of nature and the environment which leads humans to build and construct infrastructures on any available land not regarding its characteristics etc.</p> <p>Adebajo (2010) noted that the water level in Lagos is high and it is to a large extent, surrounded by water and that the topography of the city is relatively flat and flat terrains do not give much room for the design and construction of proper functional self cleaning drains in terms of minimum allowable slopes etc. Nigerians are permanently accustomed to dirt.  This Evidence of this can be seen every day by way of indiscriminate discharge of garbage into drains and at times on the highway. In urban areas, Nigerian cities have been described as some of the dirtiest, most unsanitary and the least aesthetically pleasing in the world (Mabogunje 1996).Waste disposal habit of the people, Ignorance coupled with poverty may be adduced to the habit of most people in Lagos metropolis especially in the densely populated states. It beats one hollow to see a man defecating in broad daylight on the side of the high way or a woman with her wrapper pulled up urinating on the sidewalk or gutter in full glare of the public. Or where a man parks his/her car and throws waste on the street, then one begins to wonder the reason or reasons for those dirty habits of our people.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong> RESEARCH  QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>To access flooding problems in makoko area ofLagos state and proffer sustainable solution</p> <ol><li>What are the causes of flooding in makoko community</li> <li>What are the effects of flooding in the makoko community</li> <li>What are the appropriate ways to reduce flooding and better the drainage channels in the area.</li> <li>Are those effects caused by natural or man made factors.</li> </ol> <p><strong> 1.4AIM AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>  To accessflooding problems in Makoko area of Lagos state and proffer sustainable solution</p> <p>          i.            Identify and evaluate the drainage channels in the study area</p> <p>        ii.            Examine the effects of flooding in the study area</p> <p>      iii.            To examine the causes of flooding in the study area</p> <p>      iv.            Examine past efforts of curbing the problem.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>STUDY AREA</strong></p> <p> According to Squattercity (2007), Makoko settlement is primarily known as a fishing community whose inhabitant have lived and fished and lived on the local waters of Lagos lagoon for almost a hundred years with an estimated population of 85,165  the settlement is based partly on the lagoon and party on land bordering the lagoon. Some of the inhabitants of Makoko are notably immigrant fishermen. Inhabitants on the lagoon are said to be mainly the Ijaw and Egun people in Nigeria and from other neighbouring countries like Benin Republic, Cameroun, Ghana and Togo.There is a network of wooden planks that connects the settlement to the main land, which is also used by canoe makers and allows access to the outside world to buy the canoes.</p> <p>The inhabitants on land are said to be mainly Nigerians from different parts of the</p> <p>country. The community based on the land regularly suffers from heavy flooding that is knee deep. The average monthly income is said to be between 10,773 Naira (US $92) and 15,000 Naira (US$ 127) monthly. There are various occupations found in Makoko, but the major occupation found in the settlement are fishing and trading   (LMDP Report 2002)</p> <p><strong> Maps of Research Location</strong></p> <p><strong>Figure 1.1: Map of Nigeria</strong></p> <p>Fig 1.2: Map of Lagos state</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>Fig 1.3: Aerial Map Of Makoko</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6 JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The project research is pertinent as it attempts to asses the flooding problems in Makoko area of Lagos state.

Literature review covered relevant texts and documents on the research topic. The researcher adopted the descriptive survey research design. A sample of 100 teachers was taken from Education District (IV) of Lagos state which was the area of the research. The researcher used questionnaires for the selected respondents for data collection. Descriptive statistics of percentage and inferential statistics of chi-square were used to test the hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. The results of the study showed that school location will influence the effective teaching of physical education and sports in secondary schools; school facilities will influence the effective teaching of physical education and sports in secondary schools and modern management techniques will influence the effective teaching of physical education and sports in secondary schools.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Background to the study</strong></p> <p>There is no gainsaying the fact that education is very vital to the pace of social, political and economic development of any nation. This is why most nations of the world strive to devote a sizeable proportion of their Gross National Income to develop the educational sector. In Nigeria, between 7.6% and 9.9% of our annual expenditure is devoted to education (Durosaro, 2003). The proportion earmarked in the approved national budget is meant to finance capital and recurrent expenditure of schools. The physical structures which is capital intensive takes the larger part of the cost since the physical environment of a school adds a lot of value to the school (Obong, 2007).</p> <p>Egim (2003) observed in her study that the physical environment contributes either negatively or positively to the effectiveness of teaching and learning in the school. The school physical environment includes the buildings, classrooms, furniture, equipment, instructional materials, laboratories, libraries, play grounds, and so on. Others are walls, machinery, decorative objects, play fields, skating rinks, swimming pools, audio-visual equipment (Mckay, 1964 in Egim, 2003). Egim (2003) maintained that in a bid to expand the educational enterprise, educational planners are more interested in issues such as the number of schools, teachers, students’ infrastructural facilities like classrooms and school buildings. Little attention is paid to the quality of the environment (Obong. 2010).</p> <p>Maintaining a sound and healthy environment has always been a challenge to man (Akintola, 2008). For example, the different inputs from anthropogenic activities include energy generating heat, uncontrolled sound turning into noise, and other land-using agencies that causes degradation of the physical environment. Various human activities that require planning and coordination demands comprehensive and deliberate efforts to keep the physical environment fit for the total man to function well. Hence, the management of built environment is determinant to the quality of man at any given time. Where this is undermined, there is bound to be poor physical conditions and the consequence is poor human output. Of particular interest to this study is the school environment.</p> <p>The physical outlook of the school environment is very important in contributing to a healthy academic exercise. It forms the fulcrum on which other activities revolve. This is because it creates an atmosphere through the mind for studies(Akinsolu,2004). The duties of teaching and learning, if effectiveness is the goal, is a great one; one of such is the school location. Where a school is located can determine to a large extent the stability of the student’s mind for academic readiness.</p> <p>A school located along air-traffic route, roadside (especially without a fence), in the neighbourhood of industrial activities, markets, and so on will be academically encumbered because such environments will interfere with the students’ learning process. It will generate noise enough to badly affect the study adventure. As indicated by the National Teachers’ Institute (NTI, 2008; Mckay, 1964 in Egim, 2003), these are capable of affecting the quality of learning environment. Equally crucial is the greening of the school environment. Sanitation Connection (2001/2002) maintains that a school management that provides sanitation and planting of flowers, trees and maintaining lawns, well cleared grasses, etc. improves quality of life and study environment. Aesthetics of a school environment is another aspect of managing a school environment. Regular painting and maintaining the quality of buildings, channelling of sewage, well-planned landscape and trimming of flowers, clearing of grasses, proper disposal of refuse, sweeping and removing cub webs among others, provides a relaxed atmosphere for   the moulding of minds. All the issues above constitute school environmental management strategies that could make a school a place to live and not to leave.</p> <p>In spite of this all-important top burner matter, very little have been done in managing school environments for fruitful academic venture. It becomes necessary to conduct a study on the environmental factors that affect effective teaching and learning</p> <p>How a school environment is managed in aesthetics, recreation, waste, drainage pattern, and other physical outlook of the environment has a telling effect on the quality of learning. It is opined that regular grass clearing, sweeping of the school compound and painting, landscaping and planting of flowers, good drainage, refuse disposal, provision of fields, playgrounds and sporting facilities are strategies adopted to ensure effective teaching and learning(Akinsolu, 2004). In this study however, the focus is on the effective teaching of Physical Education and Sports at the secondary school level. </p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Over the years, the researcher had noticed that there has been a public outcry on the poor quality of education and continual decline in the standards of education in the country especially at the secondary school level.A careful examination of the environmental factor revealed some of the problems bedeviling the system, and which have been hindering effective administration of any school in Nigeria (Ogunbiyi, 2004; Nwakpa,2008).</p> <p>Education stakeholders have blamed the quality assurance agents (school supervisors and inspectors of education) for the falling standard due to dilapidated school buildings and structures. The complaint is that infrastructures and facilities are fast decaying and depreciated and that the quality of inspection is below expectation. A lot of problems have been identified to be affecting the state of education, mostly at the secondary school level. The rate at which the standard of education deteriorate cannot be overemphasized. Some of these problems could be traced to inadequate finance that is required to provide for basic school facilities, school plant planning, buildings and structures, libraries building and other social amenities, sports and training facilities(Emeratom,2004).</p> <p>Good quality education as well as having standardized school in place depends heavily on the provision of adequate educational facilities. This was why Emeratom (2004) insisted that educational curriculum cannot be sound and well operated with poor and badly managed school facilities. By school facilities, he meant a physical resource that pushes up effective teaching and learning. These include blocks of classrooms, laboratories, workshops, libraries, equipment, consumables, electricity, water, visual and audio-visual aids, tables, chairs, playground, storage space and toilets.

The case study area for this research has been Lagos state with special attention paid to the following local government areas in the state, namely: Lagos-Island local government, Apapa local government, Mushin Local Government, and Ikeja local government.</p> <p>A total of 80 questionnaires were administered with 20 being given to each local government and a total of 65 questionnaires were retrieved. The procedure for simple random selection goes thus: A list of 80 potential respondents' in Lagos metropolis was drawn from the above four mentioned local government areas, which have the knowledge concerning land accessibility and judgemental sampling technique was used to select the final sample for the study, i.e. the division of the population of a given area in the state into four (4) major local government areas.

Because of this chronic shortage of urban land, prices have shot up incredibly, leaving most urban residents in fear that they might never be able to have their own house. Some who manage to secure urban land especially through land-owning families pay for such land twice or thrice, depending on how many floors they want to build. This has become the practice in many parts of Lagos. This shows that the demand for land in Lagos metropolis is extremely competitive. </p> <p>Since the urban land is not easily accessible in the city, land thugs are having a field day grabbing land belonging to other people. Land owners too are not immune to the temptation of selling the same land to many buyers and even invading government land. This has made buying land in Lagos a very risky endeavour especially when the buyer fails to engage the services of professionals in handling the land transaction. The failure to engage the services of professionals is probably due to lack of fund or ignorance.</p> <p>Lagos state is obviously faced with the general problems of accessibility to land. And studies shows that, one of the major problems of land accessibility is government policies and laws which emanated from enactment of the land use Act of 1978 (Umezuruike 2003). The Act nationalized all lands in the country (Iseh2003). Access to land in Nigeria is affected by the operation of land use Act. Its operation so far seems to have created more of bottleneck (Omirin 2003). The land use Act created serious problems for land management in the entire country (Mabogunje, 20003). Land speculation, racketeering, and thuggry had been on the increase (Udo, 1996).  Though researches on land accessibility under the land use Act in Lagos is limited. The aim of this study is to appraise land accessibility under the Land Use Act in Lagos.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Research Problem</strong></p> <p>An increasing proportion of the rapidly growing world population is attempting to satisfy its economic and social needs and desires in an urban context. The enormous migration of people into cities and towns has probably produced an uncontrollable urban explosion, an unprecedented increase in population, and greater demands on the urban infrastructure. The increasing population has led to a higher demand for urban land. This has made the demand for land far higher than its supply. Its physical supply is highly limited even as the demand for its use is increasing daily. As earlier stated in the background to this study, one of the problematic issues in Nigeria now is having access to urban land. Land is an important issue in every society. It affects all activities of man such as social, cultural, economic, political, religious etc.</p> <p>Due to the increase in the demand for land which has led to extreme competition for available land, this has encouraged the practice of multiple sales of the same land to different buyers by land owning families. It has also led to tremendous land speculation and a subsequent rise in the prices of land. It has also created inequality in land ownership and increasing landlessness among the poorer segments of the population.</p> <p>Before the land use Act, there was a multiplicity of land tenure systems in the country. Apart from the system in the Lagos Colony where an English freehold system had been established following its annexation in 1861, these diverse systems can be grouped broadly into two categories. The first obtained in the Northern Nigeria where the colonial administration has placed all lands under the control and subject to the disposition of the Governor. The second system that obtained in Southern Nigeria recognized that land was owned by lineages or extended families.</p> <p>Individuals have only right of use on such family land. The only land held at the governor’s disposal was that which had been expressly acquired for public purposes as crown land. The control imposed by law on the lineages and other local landholders was an obligation to seek the consent of government when rights are being conveyed to aliens.</p> <p>Faced with these contrasting land tenure systems and the considerable trouble in getting land for public purposes, especially in the southern Nigeria, the military government under General Olusegun Obasanjo sought to unify the two systems in the country through the land use decree of 1978.</p> <p>The land use decree of 1978 (now the land use Act of 1978) nationalized all lands in Nigeria. It has been three decades ago since the Land Use Act has been promulgated and access to land is still one of the most problematic issues in Nigeria. This calls for the need to appraise land accessibility under the Land Use Act (L.U.A) in Lagos.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions are relevant for this study.</p> <p>1.         How was accessibility to land in Lagos before the Land Use Act?</p> <p>2.         How is accessibility to land in Lagos under the Land Use Act?</p> <p>3.         What are the effects of the land use act on land accessibility in Lagos?</p> <p><strong> 1.4       Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to appraise land accessibility under the land use Act (L.U.A) in Lagos. In order to achieve the above stated aim the following objectives will be rigorously pursued.</p> <p>1.      Examine land accessibility in Lagos before the Land Use Act</p> <p>2.      Appraise land accessibility in Lagos under the Land Use Act</p> <p>3.      Determine the effects of the Land Use Act on land accessibility in Lagos</p> <p>4.      Analyse land accessibility in Lagos under the Act.</p> <p><strong> 1.5       Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Land, which refers to the earth’s surface extending downward to the centre of the earth and upward to infinity, including those things permanently attached by nature, such as trees and water, is an important issue in every society. This is because it affects all activities of man, be they social, cultural, economic, political religious etc.</p> <p>As stated earlier in the background to this study, one problematic issue in Nigeria now is having access to urban land, especially land for housing, commercial, industrial recreational and other urban development projects. There is chronic shortage of land and extreme competition for available land, which has led to high cost of land. The land use Act was promulgated three decades ago to address these problems. There is therefore need to appraise land accessibility under the land use Act in Lagos.      </p> <p>This study will be significant to potential real estate investors, financial institutions, real estate surveyors and valuers, estate agents, land owners, lawyers, estate management lecturers, students of tertiary institutions, and government.</p> <p><strong> 1.6       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>In scope, the study covers the accessibility of land in Lagos. Under the Land Use Act, the study is designed such that it identifies the land in Lagos, examine the Land Use Act, examine land accessibility in Lagos before the land use Act, appraise land accessibility in Lagos under the Land Use Act, analyse land accessibility in Lagos under the act through structured questionnaires and make conclusions and recommendation from the analyzed questionnaires. However, the research covers both the Island and Mainland of the state.</p> <p><strong> 1.7       Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Access to urban Land:</strong> This refers to the ability to procure and possess any developable plot within an urban area. In the content of this study, it covers the period of scouting for the land, payment, conveyance and registration, before development is expected to commence. This is the stage when your right to land is secured and unchallenged. However, such land to be accessed must be available, affordable with well secure tenure which can also be transferred easily.</p> <p><strong> Certificate of Occupancy (C of O): </strong>This is a certificate issued by the governor of a state in Nigeria certifying the previous grant of statutory rights of occupancy usually through a letter of allocation/offer. As stipulated in (section 5(1) of the LUA, 1978). Or certifying the deemed grant of statutory right of occupancy under section 9. So as to exclude the local government declared all lands in the state as urban land.</p> <p><strong>Land:</strong> land is defined as the earth’s surface extending downward to the centre of the earth and upward to infinity, including those things permanently attached by nature, such as trees, water etc.</p> <p><strong>Land Use Act (L.U.A):</strong> The Land Use Act is a law promulgated in 1978 by the military government under General Olusegun Obasanjo to unify the land tenure systems of the country. It was promulgated as Land Use Decree No. 6 of 1978 with effect from 29 March 1978.</p> <p><strong>Land Use and Advisory Committee: </strong>This is a body established for each Local Government by the Act and shall have responsibility for advising the Local Government on any matter connected with the management of land within the area of jurisdiction of which the land is situated.</p> <p><strong>Land use Allocation Committee:</strong> This is a committee set up under section 2 of the land use Act to advice the governor on any matter connected with the management of urban land within the state.</p> <p><strong>Ratification Process:</strong> This is a special form of state allocation process. It is a process whereby government condones the illegality of certain squatters on government acquired lands. Such condonement can only be granted if such developed lands are not within government’s committed scheme, under high-tension power lines, within way of public infrastructure and utilities, and where the buildings and layouts do not contravene government regulations.     </p> <p><strong> 1.8       Plan of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study is organized into five main chapters. Chapter one presented the overview of the study. Chapter two would focus on review of relevant literature to the research. Chapter three would present the research method needed to achieve the aim and objectives of the study. Chapter four would report the empirical results and discuss the findings while chapter five would conclude the study and recommend solutions to the findings.</p>                                                          \n\nAPPRAISING LAND ACCESSIBILITY UNDER LAND USE ACT (L.U.A.)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPRAISING LAND ACCESSIBILITY UNDER LAND USE ACT (L.U.A.)", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>Environmental Management System refers to management of an organization’s environmental programs in a comprehensive, systematic, planned and documented manner. It includes the organizational structure, planning and resources for developing, implementing and maintaining policy for environmental protection. It is not surprising that collectively, SMEs also have major  The increasing demands for consideration of the environmental impacts may result in SMEs being required to at least consider environmental management systems implementation based on standards such as the ISO 14001 series, developed by the International Organization for Standardization. In this situation, an EMS may be considered both a cost and a benefit to the organization. The aim and objective of this project work is to study the Environmental Management Systems in small and medium scale companies using Lagos as a case study. Five small and medium scale companies namely: Ulysses, Regency Overseas, Onward Paper mill, Techno Oil Ltd and VGC Water were used for this project research. Questionnaires were administered to the management staff and employees below the management level of the selected companies and the two selected regulators-SON and LASEPA. The findings obtained from the survey carried out on the companies indicated that these companies were not yet Environmental Management System (ISO14001) certified. This study therefore recommends that Environmental Management Systems should be implemented in SMEs because the integration of EMSs into a company process of activities will help to support environmental sustainability and also help the companies to reduce their resource consumption of water, electricity, heat energy and discharge of waste. This research work is made up of five chapters. Chapter One dealt with the introduction to the subject matter; Chapter Two examined the conceptual ad theoretical framework to the study; Chapter Three stated the methodology used in carrying out the research work; Chapter Four covered the discussion of findings and results obtained from the survey. Lastly and Chapter Five concluded on the whole research work and recommendations were drawn from the results obtained from the survey findings. </em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 DEFINITION OF ENVIRONMENT:</strong></p> <p>Environment, according to the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English means surrounding. This definition fails to mention the extent of the surrounding is made up of. The environment, in fact, includes everything living and non living: air, water, land animals and plants among others. The environment also involves the ways living and non-living objects interact as well as what result from such interactions. Birds, for example, interact with rocks either by perching on them, or the building of nests in rock crevices. The environment and humanity are inseparable; this underscores the need for the conservation of the environment and sustainable development. From the above definition of ‘Environment’, one can see clearly that environment means much, much more than one’s compound or school premises or one’s village.</p> <p>What does <strong>pollution</strong> means? Pollution is simply defined as the poisoning of the air, the land and the seas.</p> <p>Now, <strong>degradation</strong>. The degradation of the environment means the wearing down of the environment by various processes such as the action of water, wind, ice or erosion.</p> <p>By conservation of the environment we mean the preservation and protection of the environment against pollution and degradation.</p> <p>In its report “Our Common Future”, the World Commission on Environment and Development, defined economic growth as necessary for sustainable development. But commission noted that growth alone is not enough, since high levels of productivity and widespread poverty do coexist and endanger the environment. Agenda 21 recognized that the private sector plays a major role in achieving sustainable development, both by fostering economic growth and by reducing environmental impact. The challenges for business and industries is to provide environmentally sustainable growth; they must devise strategies to maximize added value while minimizing resources and energy use. The need for clean, equitable economic growth remains the biggest single difficulty within the larger challenge of sustainable development.</p> <p>Business in industrialized nations has begun to move from a pollution of limiting pollution and waste only in compliance with government regulations towards one of avoiding pollution and waste not just to be good corporate citizens but also to be more efficient and competitive. In response, the economies of the industrialized countries have grown even though the resources and energy to produce each unit of growth have declined.</p> <p>Eco efficiency requires not only challenges in technology, but also in management; such issues as changes in the objectives and assumptions that direct corporate activities, and in the day-to-day practices used to reach those objectives. Managing for the environment is not a new idea but a systematic approach to it is now being developed.</p> <p>The forthcoming ISO 14000 SERIES sets standards for corporate environmental management on an international level. These standards have been set not by some international regulatory body, but with the full participation of the private sector who will implement them. One of several advantages the standards will bring is the creation of a more environmentally sensitive industrial culture, which will result in a more efficient use of raw and waste material, reduction of emissions and increased investment in pollution control abatement and cleaner technologies.</p> <p><strong>1.2 THE NEED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (EMS)</strong></p> <p>An environmental management system (EMS) is interpreted as the organizational structure, including practices, processes, resources and responsibilities for implementing environmental management. Such a system should enable organizations to achieve and demonstrate on-going compliance with regulations. It should allow organizations to control the environmental impact of all activities, products and services taking into account the environmental impact of all activities, products and services taking into account a self-determined environment. The need for Environmental Management System are:</p> <p>a. Organisation and facilities are increasingly aware of the need to achieve and demonstrate sound environmental performance by controlling the different aspects and the significant impacts of their activities, products or services on the environment. They do so in the context of increasingly stringent legislation, the development of economic policies and other measures to foster environmental protection, and a growing of concern from interested parties about the threats of industrialization to sustainable development.</p> <p>b. Many Organisations have undertaken environmental ‘’reviews’’ or ‘’audits’’ to assess their environmental performance. On their own, however, these ‘’reviews’’ or ‘’audits’’ may not be sufficient to provide an Organisation with the assurance that its performance not only meets, but will continue to meet its legal and policy requirements. To be effective, they need to be conducted within a structured management system and integrated with overall management activity.</p> <p>c. The Environmental Performance of an Organisation is of increasing importance to internal and external interested parties. Achieving sound environmental performance requires  Organisational commitment to a systematic approach and to continual improvement of the environment.</p> <p>d. An EMS provides order and consistency through the allocation of resources, assignment of responsibilities, and continuous evaluation of practices, procedures and processes. An EMS is therefore: part of the enterprises enterprise’s overall management system. It includes the organizational structure, planning activities, practices, procedures, processes, and resources for implementing and maintaining environmental management. It includes those aspects of management that plan, develop pment, implement, achieve, review. Maintain and improve the companies environmental policy, objectives and targets.</p> <p><strong>1.3 THE OBJECTIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS</strong></p> <p>The objective of installing an EMS by organizations is mainly to ensure continual improvement through the life of a facility or facilities in the management system of the organization. Specifically, an Environmental Management System is intended to help the organisation to:</p> <p>a. Achieve its environmental policy, objectives and targets, including compliance with environmental legislation.</p> <p>b. Identify and control the environmental aspect, impacts and risks relevant to the organization.</p> <p>c. Define a basic set of principles that guide the organization to its environmental responsibilities in the future.</p> <p>d. Establish short, medium and long –term goals for environmental performance, and ensuring costs and benefits analysis, for the organization and for its various shareholders and stakeholders.</p> <p>e. Determine what resources are needed to achieve those goals, assign responsibilities for them and commit the necessary resources.</p> <p>f. Define and document specific tasks responsibilities, authorities and procedures to ensure that every employee acts in the course of their his/her work to help minimize or eliminate the organisation’s negative impact on the environment.</p> <p>g. Communicate the organisation’s environmental policies, objectives and targets and procedures to all employees and to third parties who may be affected by these policies.</p> <p>h. Measure performance against pre-agreed standards and goals, and modify the approach as necessary.</p> <p><strong>1.4 THE CORE ELEMENTS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</strong></p> <p> Environmental Management Systems will be different for different types of organizations, depending on the nature, size and complexity of activities, products and services. However, all Environmental Management Systems have a number of core elements in common. The core elements include but are not limited to the following:</p> <p>-Environmental Policy</p> <p>-Initial Environmental Review</p> <p>-Environmental Action Plan</p> <p>-Organisational Structure and Management Responsibilities</p> <p>-Documentation and Communication</p> <p>-Training</p> <p>-Management Review</p> <p><strong>a. The environmental policy</strong></p> <p>i. Environmental policy expresses the commitment of senior management to appropriate environmental management. It should not be a once –and-for-all document. The aim of the policy shall be to maintain and potentially improve environmental performance. It is to form the basis upon which objectives and target are set. It should reflects the commitment of top management to comply with relevant environmental legislative and other requirements; and for continual improvement</p> <p>ii. Fundamentally, an environmental policy shall</p> <p>·        Contain a broad statement of intent</p> <p>·        Be appropriate to production activities and products and services.</p> <p>·        Make provision for commitment to continual improvement.</p> <p>·        Make clear the procedure of preventing pollution.</p> <p>·        State commitment to comply with legislation, regulation and other regulatory requirements.</p> <p>·        Provide frame work for setting and reviewing environmental targets and objectives.</p> <p>·        Be documented, implemented and maintained.</p> <p>·        Be made available to appropriate regulatory authority and any other interested party.</p> <p>·        Be made public.</p> <p><strong>b. Initial Environmental Review (IER)</strong></p> <p>i. In order to achieve success, an early step in developing and improving an EMS involves obtaining commitment of the top management of an organization. An organization that has no EMS in place or that has not conducted an IER. The aim of such a review should be to identify all environmental aspects and/or impacts of its activities, products and services. Also, the aim of an initial review is to establish a facility’s current performance level in the Ems with the view to formulate an articulated environmental policy.</p> <p>ii. To carry out a thorough review, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the production processes or services from ‘’cradle- to-grave’’ is imperative. The LCA should examine the different aspects and possible significant impacts of all inputs at all stages of production or services to its eventual disposal.</p> <p>iii. An IER shall consider normal operating conditions, shutdown and startup condition including realistic potential significant aspects and impacts that could be associated with reasonably foreseeable or emergency situations.</p> <p>iv. The process of identifying significant environmental aspects shall where appropriate, consider any or all of the following.</p> <p>·        Human health</p> <p>·        Air and Water quality</p> <p>·        Waste Management</p> <p>·        Contamination of Land</p> <p>·        Use of raw materials and natural resources.</p> <p>v. Fundamentally, an IER shall address the following:</p> <p>·        Identification of relevant legislation’s, regulations and other regulatory requirements.</p> <p>·        Identification, evaluation and documentation of significant environmental aspects of its activities, products or services.</p> <p>·        Evaluation of existing management practices and procedures.</p> <p>·        All other elements of feedback from the investigations of previous incidents.</p> <p>vi. The IER Report shall contain the following essential elements:-</p> <p>·        Introduction/ context of review</p> <p>·        Scope of review</p> <p>·        Issues and objectives</p> <p>·        Methodology</p> <p>·        Information resources</p> <p>·        Summary of findings</p> <p>·        Identification of corrective action plan and the time-frame for its implementation</p> <p>·        Resources requirement for implementation</p> <p>·        Conclusion</p> <p>vii. ER shall be carried out at least once annually except there is a certificate of exemption from FEPA.</p> <p>viii. IER shall be carried out by one or all of the following persons or groups of persons.</p> <p>·        A competent Environmental Monitoring Team</p> <p>·        Competent and certified employee(s) in each of the production stages and/or services</p> <p>·        Accredited FEPA consultants.</p> <p><strong>c. Environmental Action Plan</strong></p> <p>i. An environmental action plan shall translate the environmental policies into objectives and targets; and identities activities to achieve them, defines employees responsibilities and commit the necessary human and financial resources for implementation. The action plan should rely on or use the assembled overview of the environmental aspects and legal regulatory requirements. The objectives and targets of an action plan shoulb be:</p> <p>·        Specific</p> <p>·        Ambitious</p> <p>·        Realistic and achievable</p> <p>·        Time-bound</p> <p>ii. The action plan shall address the following:</p> <p>·        Objectives and targets</p> <p>·        Identity activities to accomplish set objectives and targets</p> <p>·        Identity and implement steps taken to achieve set objectives and targets</p> <p>·        Define and delegates roles and responsibilities</p> <p>·        Provide material and human resources</p> <p>·        Identify relevant regulations, guidelines and other regulatory requirements relevant to operation.</p> <p><strong>d</strong>. <strong>Organisation Structures and Management Responsibilities</strong></p> <p>i. The organisational structure of a facilities shall contain the flow of authority, responsibilities and interrelationships of all those in the organization to effect the proper functioning of the EMS.</p> <p>ii. The responsibilities of the organizational management shall include but not limited to:</p> <p>·        Establishing and maintaining EMS with the commitment of the chief executive/managing director.</p> <p>·        Providing all resources needed for the implementation of the EMS. This shall include human, financial, material, technology and specialized skills.</p> <p>·        Appointing an Environmental Manager who should have at least a formal training in environmental management and technology.

The sample consisted of 110 motorcycle riders in Coker/Aguda Local Council Development Area of Lagos State. Variables studied are knowledge and awareness of the effect of air pollution on health. Knowledge and awareness of effect of air pollution on their health were assessed through a 20 item self developed questionnaire. Data was analyzed using simple percentage. Results from the findings show that the motorcycle riders in Coker/Aguda Local Council Development Area are knowledgeable and aware of the effect of air pollution on their health. The study recommended that seminar should be organized periodically to educate motorcycle riders inensuring a conducive and enabling environment for good living, law enforcement agency should encourage motorcycle riders to go for ministry of transportation test to avoid air pollution. State government should recommend nose bluff to the motorcycle riders in prevention of respiratory disorders, more research should be carried out in the area of effect of air pollution on health, the use of eye goggle should also be recommended in the prevention of itching and discomfort of the eye.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>                                                      INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>a.</strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The land can be cleaned up before we use it, and purify water before we drink it, but, except in air-conditioned rooms, we must breathe air as it comes to us. Automobiles, factories, heating furnaces, power plants, trash incinerators, each add to the problem, so control is difficult. (Microsoft Encarta 2009). Air pollution is a major environmental problem throughout the world. Most air pollution problems thus result from man’s pattern of energy use and production.</p> <p><em>Air quality is affected by economic activities which introduce pollutants into the atmosphere that pose threats to human health and other life forms on earth. It furthermore has the potential to change the climate with unpredictable, but potentially severe consequences on a local and global scale. Because large bodies of air cannot be contained, atmospheric pollution can only be controlled at its source.</em>At present there is no comprehensive information on air quality or on the levels of emissions entering the atmosphere from different sources.</p> <p><em>However, </em>air pollution is a major environmental risk to health. By reducing air pollution levels, we can help countries reduce the global burden of disease from respiratory infections, heart disease, and lung cancer. The lower the levels of air pollution in a city, the better respiratory (both long- and short-term), and cardiovascular health of the population will be.</p> <p>Apollutant is the wrong stuff in the wrong place at the wrong time, and especially in developed nations such as ours, avoiding pollution is not necessarily easy. The problem is made worse by a loss of ownership of the problem; by reality gaps between government agencies which must regulate and monitor on the broader level of pollutant averages over time and local citizens that are justifiably upset over local episodes; and by entrenchment in the comfort of our own consumptive lifestyles and by limited alternatives.</p> <p>The auto industry and its support enterprises continue to flourish, while mass transit struggles to survive. Fossil fuel-based energies overshadow wind, solar and other sources of energy. Cleaner fuels often remain a novelty. Land use decisions, or the lack of them, make it difficult for many to walk or bike to work. Numerous small mechanical devices replace muscle power. Disposable items save us even more time and work. Food is transported far from where it is grown, to a region which could supply its own food needs. All of these factors lead to increased product and energy consumption and have a vast impact on air quality.</p> <p>Environmental pollution is the unfavourable alteration of the environment due to the addition of impurities by man to constitute danger to either his/her health (ldodo-Umeh, 2010). One of the major causes of environmental pollution is air pollution. Air pollution is the additional of air borne substances such as dust, smoke, soot and sulphurdioxide found in the air that alter the composition of the atmosphere causing harm to human. Carbon monoxide is the major pollutant produced from the exhaust of automobile. Nitrogen-monoxide and Nitrogen dioxide are other gases produced from the motorcycle (ldodo-Umeh, 2010).</p> <p>Although transportation is a vital part of the economy and is essential for everyday activities, it is also a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) occur naturally in the earth’s atmosphere and help to keep the planet hospitable to life by trapping some of the sun’s natural heat. Without this “greenhouse effect,” the earth’s average surface temperature would be about 33 degrees Celsius cooler than it is currently.  The most important naturally occurring GHGs associated with this phenomenon are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).</p> <p>Human activities release GHG emissions and contribute to increasing concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere. CO2 is the predominant GHG emitted by human sources. Like most GHGs, CO2 is produced both by natural and human activities and can be removed from the atmosphere through natural processes.  However, increased production of CO2 by human sources has caused total GHG emissions exceed natural absorption rates, resulting in increased atmospheric concentrations. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have increased by nearly 30 percent, CH4 concentrations have more than doubled, and N2O concentrations have risen by approximately 15 percent (Browning,2003).</p> <p>Air pollution can affect our health in many ways with both <em>short-term </em>and <em>long-term </em>effects. Different groups of individuals are affected by air pollution in different ways. Some individuals are much more sensitive to pollutants than are others. Young children and elderly people often suffer more from the effects of air pollution. People with health problems such as asthma, heart and lung disease may also suffer more when the air is polluted. The extent to which an individual is harmed by air pollution usually depends on the<strong> total exposure</strong> to the damaging chemicals, i.e., <em>the duration of exposure and the concentration of the chemicals </em>must be taken into account. Examples of<strong> short-term effects</strong> include irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, and upper respiratory infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Other symptoms can include headaches, nausea, and allergic reactions. Short-term air pollution can aggravate the medical conditions of individuals with asthma and emphysema. <strong>Long-term health effects</strong> can include chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and even damage to the brain, nerves, liver, or kidneys. Continual exposure to air pollution affects the lungs of growing children and may aggravate or complicate medical conditions in the elderly.</p> <p>Coker/AgudaLlocal council development area, under Surulere Local Government is a very busy locality. It has three communities; Coker, Aguda and Orile. The three communities are made up of seven wards. Average men and youth in Coker/Aguda LCDA engaged in road transportation as their major occupation for the purpose of meeting their needs. Research into the health effects of air pollution is ongoing. Medical conditions arising from air pollution can be very expensive. Healthcare costs, lost productivity in the workplace, and human welfare impacts cost billions of dollars each year. Mankind has always believed in a better place where life is free of stress and toil where health and happiness abound. (Haastrup and Adeogun, 2005).The environment is at the top of the agenda for governments, civil society and citizens, and is likely to remain so for some time. Its importance in business and purchase decision-making, as well as in legislation,</p> <p>standards and regulations is increasing all the time. As a result, no business can afford to take the environment for granted. Whatever your industry or area of activity, you need to minimize your impact on the environment and protect it as much as possible</p> <p>b.      <strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Coker/Aguda local council development area is a very busy area in Surulere Local Government Area and the major occupational practice among men and youth is Okada ridding. The emission discharged from the exhausts and other air pollutants expose them and other citizens to environmental health conditions such as lung cancer, asthma, irritation of the eyes and even cataract of the eyes. These conditions are worsened with the use of poor quality engine oil which results to the release of emission of poor gases in the air. Also mixed fuel gasoline is another factor that emits carbon dioxide (C02) into the air causing air pollution in the environment .Together; these pollutants seriously affect human health and the environment if precautions are not taken.  These Okada riders may or may not be ignorant of the consequences of their action because of their determination to survive and make out a living. It is therefore important to examine the knowledge and awareness level of these Okada riders on the effects of air pollution on the health of motorcycle riders in Coker/Aguda Local Council Development Area.</p> <p><strong>c.</strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to examine the knowledge and awareness of the effects of air pollution on the health of motorcycle riders in</p> <p>Coker/Aguda Local Council Development Area<strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>d.</strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1)     Will motorcycle riders in Coker/Aguda Local Council Development Area be knowledgeable on the effects of air pollution on their health?</p> <p>2)    Will motorcycle riders in Coker/Aguda Local Council Development Area be aware of the effect of air pollution on their health?</p> <p>3)    Will age influence the knowledge of the effects of air pollution on the health of motorcycle riders in Coker/Aguda LCDA?</p> <p><strong>e.</strong><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>1)    Motorcycle riders in Coker Aguda Local Council Development Area will not be significantly knowledgeable about the effect of air pollution on their health.</p> <p>2)    Motorcycle riders in Coker Aguda Local Council Development Area will not be significantly aware of the effect of air pollution on their health.</p> <p>3)    Age will not significantly influence the knowledge of the effects of air pollution on the health of Okada riders in Coker/Aguda LCDA</p> <p><strong>f.</strong><strong>Delimitation of Study</strong></p> <p>This study is delimited to the following</p> <p><strong>1)</strong>Coker/Aguda Local Council Development Area.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong>Coker and Aguda communities of the LCDA.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong>Motorcycle riders in five major junctions of Coker/Aguda LCDA.</p> <p>a)      Adetola Junction</p> <p>b)      Casette Junction</p> <p>c)      Pako Junction</p> <p>d)     Coker Bridge Junction</p> <p>e)      Sanya Express Junction</p> <p><strong>4)</strong>A self-designed questionnaire.</p> <p><strong>g.</strong><strong>Limitation of Study</strong></p> <p>The result of this study could be limited by the fact that respondents are uncooperative in their attitude towards filling out of the questionnaire.

Four (4) Local Communities Development Area Ifeoluwa, Banjo,  Feyintola and Oduduwa The descriptive research method was used in carrying out the study. The population for the study was people within the age bracket between 18-50 and above (male and female) in Igando Local Government Area of Lagos state which constitutes a total number of 4,640. The sample size comprised 464 individuals within the age bracket between 18-50 and above who reside in four communities in Igando. Data collection was done with a 20 item validated questionnaire .Descriptive survey method was used for the study. Data analysis was done using the descriptive statistics of percentages, frequency table, mean standard deviation and pearson product moment correlation. The result shows that improper solid waste disposal techniques can lead to outbreak of diseases and other hazards, respondents with grand mean of3.1940 within the age range of 18-50years and above agreed that proper management of solid waste can promote healthy living. This statistics shows that majority of the residents of Igando Local Government Area are fully aware about the consequences of indiscrimate waste disposal. The vast majority of the respondents with grand means 2.7823 agreed that open dump method of solid waste disposal is not environmental friendly which implies that open dump can lead to Land, water, and air pollution with its negative impacts on the health of the residents. In conclusion, people attitude to waste management can be improved upon if the government, waste management agencies in the area can embark on periodic campign and other forms of sensitization programs. More also all hands must be on deck for proper waste management in the interest of members of the public.</p> <p>The recommendations are as follows;</p> <p>-          Bye-Laws should be enacted</p> <p>-          Public enlightenment program should be embark upon.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Solid waste disposal is both urban and rural problem. Every person is a potential generator of waste and this is a contributor to this problem. To generate waste is one thing, the type of waste generated is another and also the way the generated waste is managed or disposed of is quite a different issue. It has more often than not turned out that the rate at which solid waste is generated is far higher than the capacity to responsibly manage this waste. Waste is generated by, and from different sectors, domestic, commercial, industry and others and in many instances; the waste management responsibility has been left to the government or administrative authorities. There is growing consensus that the immediate stakeholders in the issue of solid waste (the generators of waste), in this case the authorities is dealing with this problem that has far-reaching environmental and human health effects.</p> <p>Solid waste refers to municipal waste from domestic, commercial, institutions and industrial sources but excluding excreta, except when it mixed with solid waste. It is however necessary to note that in developing countries many a times it becomes difficult or even impractical to put a line between excreta and solid waste. In many instances, solid waste mixed with excreta is potentially dangerous to human and animals’ health. Levine &amp; Coed (2004).</p> <p>Navarro. (2008) stated that waste generation increases not only because people multiply and hence the space available to each person becomes smaller, but also because the demand per person are continually increasing so that each person throws away more year by year. If the world’s population were evenly distributed over the earth surface most of these wastes could probably remain unnoticed and perhaps harmless. But as city population increases, their residues also increases and concentrate around them.</p> <p>Solid waste disposal plays a multiple role in maintaining health and social stability and in preserving the values of a decent family life, community, State even the nation as a whole, This is because it constitute the physical environment in which society’s basic units develops. The improvement represents a concrete and visible rise in the general level of living conditions in a given location.</p> <p>Agbaje, (2008) defined wastes as rubbish or materials that are not needed and are economically unusable without further processing. It may be in liquid, gas, or solid from and originated from a wide range of human operations, such as industry, commerce, transport, agriculture, medicine, and domestic activities.</p> <p>UNPFA, (2006) defined waste as something which the owners no longer want at a specific time. Solid wastes can be generated from domestic, industrial, commercial and agricultural activities as long as there are human activities going on waste must be generated. However, poor solid waste disposal has been a major public health issues affecting the health quality of life of man and its environment.   In most African countries where their level of hygiene is low, accumulation of solid waste has created some health problems which are also the primary cause of epidemic resulting in severe deterioration of their health and environment.</p> <p> Brook, (1999) the term solid waste may be used to refer to municipal waste and can be categorized in seven groups. They include residential (or house hold or domestic waste). Commercial, institutional, street sweeping, construction and demolition, sanitation and industrial wastes. While municipal solid waste refers to solid wastes from houses, streets and public places, shops, offices, and hospitals, which are very often, the responsibility of municipal or other governmental authorities, solid waste from industrial processes, are generally not considered “Municipal”. However, it should be taken into account when dealing with solid waste as they often end up in the municipal solid waste.</p> <p>Solid waste can also be refers as municipal waste which can be categorized into seven which include: residential, (household or domestic) commercial institutional, street sweeping construction and demolition, sanitation and industrial wastes. While municipal solid waste refers to solid waste generated from houses, streets and public places such as offices and hospitals . Rush Brook,( 1999).          </p> <p> Osinowo, (2003)  stated that it is no longer news that Lagos State is over populated with about 17 million inhabitants; and houses about 50% of industries in Nigeria. Thus, waste is generated much more than any other state in the federation. Considering the public health implications varying from transmission of communicable diseases such as yellow fever, diarrhea, cholera with malaria accounting for 25% child mortality rate in Nigeria, continuous increase in indiscriminate dumping of waste has however led to spreading of vector their and borne vehicle diseases like malaria and cholera. It has also lead to offensive odour contamination of underground water, loss of aesthetic value of the environment, and flooding as a result of accumulated wastes blocking the high ways and drainage.</p> <p>The responsibility for solid waste management is placed on the shoulder of the ministry of environment (MOE), Sanitation Department of Local Government and Government Agency in particular Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA). It is noted that, solid waste disposal in Igando is being complicated on daily basis due to population growth and increase in the rate of waste being generated by the populace, which necessitates this research work.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Solid waste disposal has been a major problem to mankind; indiscriminate waste disposal has posed major threat to human health and ecosystem. Terrestrial and aquatic lives are exposed to various health hazards due to failure of mankind to go extra mile in waste management science.</p> <p>The inherent problems of waste generation, collection and disposal includes outbreak of epidemic environmental pollution and flood which often occurred due to persistent dumping of personal, industrial and domestic waste into the drainage. It is noted with dismay that indiscriminate disposal of solid waste on the highway is the causes of road accident. The prevalence of malaria and other vector and vehicle borne diseases are traceable to failure on the part of both the government and the community to instill right attitude toward waste disposal.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions are proposed for the study:</p> <p>1.                  Will open dump techniques on health status affect solid waste disposal in Igando?</p> <p>2.                  Will incineration techniques on health status affect solid waste disposal in Igando?</p> <p>3.                  Will landfill techniques on health status affect solid waste disposal in Igando?</p> <p>4.                  Will recycling techniques on health status affect solid waste disposal in Igando?</p> <p><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses  constituted the basic assumptions for the study:</p> <p>1.      Open dump techniques on health status will not significantly affect solid waste disposal in Igando.</p> <p>2.          Incineration techniques on health status will not significantly affect solid waste disposal in Igando.</p> <p>3.           Landfill techniques on health status will not significantly affect solid waste disposal in Igando.</p> <p>4.         Recycling techniques on health status will not significantly affect waste disposal in Igando.</p> <p><strong> Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to:</p> <p>(1)              Identify challenges of solid waste disposal in Igando.</p> <p>(2)              Establish whether there are plans in place by the waste collector, to improve residents participation for better solid waste disposal in Igando,</p> <p>(3)              Enumerate the roles of stakeholders.</p> <p>(4)              Suggest and evaluate residents initiatives of solving the problem of effect of solid waste disposal   in Igando.</p> <p>(5)               Identify the present disposal approaches and methods practiced in Igando.</p> <p><strong>Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>The study would be useful to the Lagos State Government as the researcher had laid emphasis on challenges to an effective solid waste disposal system in Lagos. The study would also be useful to the community, during the process of   educating them on  the proper way of disposing solid waste. It may further put every stakeholder on their toes.</p> <p><strong>Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study would be delimited to the following:</p> <p>(1)              Primary stakeholders which includes, residents,  Lagos State Waste Management Authority(LAWMA), Private Sector Participation ( PSP) operators</p> <p>(2)              Four (4)  Local Community Development Area ( LCDA) .This includes ,Ifeoluwa, Banjo,Feyintola and Oduduwa</p> <p>(3)              Self developed structured and validated questionnaire.</p> <p>(4)              Four hundred and sixty four (464) members of the communities       </p> <p>(5)              Simple random and purposive sampling techniques.</p> <p>(6)              Descriptive statistics of simple percentage and frequency table</p> <p>(7)              Spearman ranking for testing the reliability of the instrument.</p> <p><strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The problem be encountered during the conduct of this research is as follow:                        1.Problem of administration and retrieval of instrument from the respondents which prompted the researcher and his assistant to adopt on the spot questionnaire administration technique for collection.</p> <p>2.

The climate of an region depends on many factors including the amount of sunlight it receive, its height above sea level, the shape of land and how close it is to ocean.</p> <p>Global climate of the description of the climate of the planet as while, with all the regional difference average. Overall global climate depends on the energy trapped in the system. This amount are different for different climate. Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution weather over periods of time that range form decades to millions of years.</p> <p>In recent usage, especially in the context of environmental policy, climate change usually refers to changes in modern climate. It may be qualified as anthropogenic climate change more generally known as “global warning”. Over hundred years ago, people world wide began burning more coal and oil for homes factors and transpiration burning these fossil full releases carbondioxide and other greenhouse effects gases into the atmosphere to warm more quickly than in the past.</p> <p>Moreso, process as variation in earth orbits, mountain-building and continental draft, and changes in greenhouse gases condensations causes changes in climate.</p> <p>The sun is the predominant sources for energy input to the earth. Both long and short term variation in solar intensity are known to affect global climate three is four billions years ago the sun emitted only 70% as much power as it does toady. If the atmosphere composition had been the same as today, liquid water should not have existed on earth.</p> <p>Slight variations in earth leads to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface and how it is distributed across the globe. There is very little change to the area averaged annually averaged sunshine, but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution.</p> <p>The three processes types of orbital variations are variations in Earth’s eccentricity changes in the tilt angle of Earth’s axis of rotation and procession of Earth axis.</p> <p>Volcanism is a process of conveying materials from the crust and mantle of the Earth, to its surface, volcanic eruptions, geysers, and hit springs are example of volcanics processes which releases gases and/or particulates into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Anthropogenic factors are human activities that changes the environment. In some cases the claim of causality of human influence on the climate is direct and an ambiguous while in other instances it is less clear of most concern in these anthropogenic factors, is the increase in C02 levels due to emissions from fossil fuels combustion followed by aerosols and cement manufacture, other factors including land use, ozone depletion, animal agriculture and deforestation are also of concern in the rides they play both separately and in conjunction with other factors in affecting climate change, microclimate and measures of climate change.</p> <p>Climate change in the recent past may be detected by corresponding changes in settlement and agricultural pattern. Climate change of various civilization.</p> <p>During 20th century sea level rose about 15cms due to melting glacier ice and expansion of warmer sea water models predict that sea level may rise as much as 59cm turning the 21st century. Threading coaster community, wet land and coral reefs. However rainfall causes flooding in many regions normal temperature has lead to more intense rainfall in some areas.</p> <p>Extreme drought is increasing, higher temperature caused by a high rate of evaporation and more drought in some area of the world. As temperature warms species may either move to cover habitat or dying, thus the ecosystem is changing, species that are particular vulnerable including endangered species, coral reefs and polar animals.</p> <p>Warmer temperature affects human health these have been more death due to heat waves and more allergy attacks as the season grows longer. Sea water becoming more acidie due to C02 dissolving in the oceans . more so, climate change affect agricultural ecosystem in providing sufficient food for the world people as the population exceed six billon and as land, H20 and ecosystem resources are degraded through over use.</p> <p>Agriculture and water resources are linked with climate if the build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continual without limit examples of plants threatened by climate change include blue bells, quever trees. The threat of extinction to species who are unable to adapt or have limited habitats increase due to climatic changes, also changes in animal pole ward and elevational shifts associated with regional warning.</p> <p>Environmental preservation on the other hand is the setting of natural resources to prevent damaged caused by contract with human or by certain human activities such as logging, hunting, fishing, to replace them with human activities such as tourisms and recreation.</p> <p>In conclusion, it is important to note that human activities are response for climate changes.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The study of climate change and environmental related issues as been of much global concern in recent years, this could be easily attributed to the ezone layer depletion and this has and still has economic, social and political effect on the world over in the light of this there has been a ice of public awareness program but the basic engorge of the work is the knowledge of this subject matter among student in secondary school in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of the research is</p> <p>1.   To investigate students understanding of environmental concepts and climate change.</p> <p>2.   To find our is there are gender differences in students knowledge of climate change.</p> <p>3.   To find out is type of school (public and private) attended has any relationship with student knowledge of climate change.</p> <p>4.   To find out if the school location (urban or rural) has any relationship with students knowledge of climate change.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Biology is a core subject.

This study was guided by the following objectives; to find out the causes of deforestation in Odighi in Edo state, to examine the consequences of in rural household income, to determine the strategies of reducing deforestation.</p> <p>The study employed the descriptive and explanatory design; questionnaires in addition to library research were applied in order to collect data. Primary and secondary data sources were used and data was analyzed using simple percentages which was presented in frequency tables and percentage. The respondents under the study were 50 respondents including farmers, hunters and staff of agricultural and forestry department in Odighi Edo state, Abuja branch. The study majorly focuses on the consequences of deforestation on rural household income.</p> <p>The study findings revealed that deforestation negatively affects rural household income in Odighi Edo state; based on the findings from the study, efforts should be made by the Nigerian government and stakeholders in promoting tree planting and preservation.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0.</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Deforestation is the removal of a forest or stand of trees where the land is thereafter converted to a non-forest use.  Examples of deforestation include conversion of forestland to farms, ranches, or urban use. Deforestation occurs for many reasons: trees are cut down to be used or sold as fuel (sometimes in the form of charcoal) or timber, while cleared land is used as pasture for livestock, plantations of commodities and settlements. The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in damage to habitat, biodiversity loss and aridity. It has adverse impacts on biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Subsistence farming is responsible for 48% of deforestation; commercial agriculture is responsible for 32% of deforestation; logging is responsible for 14% of deforestation and fuel wood removals make up 5% of deforestation.</p> <p> Other causes of contemporary deforestation may include corruption of government institutions, the inequitable distribution of wealth and power, population growth and overpopulation, and urbanization. Globalization is often viewed as another root cause of deforestation, though there are cases in which the impacts of globalization (new ﬂows of labor, capital, commodities, and ideas) have promoted localized forest recovery.</p> <p>Deforestation is a contributor to global warming, and is often cited as one of the major causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect. Tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions. In deforested areas, the land heats up faster and reaches a higher temperature, leading to localized upward motions that enhance the formation of clouds and ultimately produce more rainfall.</p> <p>The water cycle is also affected by deforestation. Trees extract groundwater through their roots and release it into the atmosphere. When part of a forest is removed, the trees no longer transpire this water, resulting in a much drier climate. Deforestation reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture. The dry soil leads to lower water intake for the trees to extract. Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that erosion, flooding and landslides ensue.</p> <p>1.1.         <strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Forests cover almost a third of the earth’s land surface providing many environmental benefits including a major role in the hydrologic cycle, soil conservation, prevention of climate change and preservation of biodiversity (Sheram, 1993). Forest resources can provide long-term national economic benefits. For example, at least 145 countries of the world are currently involved in wood production (Anon., 1994). Sufficient evidence is available that the whole world is facing an environmental crisis on account of heavy deforestation. For years remorseless destruction of forests has been going on and we have not been able to comprehend the dimension until recently. Nobody knows exactly how much of the world’s rainforests have already been destroyed and continue to be razed each year. Data is often imprecise and subject to differing interpretations. However, it is obvious that the area of tropical rainforest is diminishing as observed in the case of Odighi forest in Odighi Local government area of Edo State and the rate of tropical rain forest destruction is escalating worldwide, despite increased environmental activism and awareness. Deforestation is the conversion of forest to an alternative permanent non-forested land use such as agriculture, grazing or urban development (van Kooten et al, 2000).</p> <p>Deforestation is primarily a concern for the developing countries of the tropics (Myers, 1994) as it is shrinking areas of the tropical forests (Barraclough et al, 2000) causing loss of biodiversity and enhancing the greenhouse effect (Angelsen et al., 1999). FAO considers a plantation of trees established primarily for timber production to be forest and therefore does not classify natural forest conversion to plantation as deforestation (but still records it as a loss of natural forests). However, FAO does not consider tree plantations that provide non-timber products to be forest although they do classify rubber plantations as forest.</p> <p>Forest degradation occurs when the ecosystem functions of the forest are degraded but where the area remains forested rather cleared (Anon., 2010).</p> <p>Thirty per cent of the earth’s land area or about 3.9 billion hectares is covered by forests. It was estimated that the original forest cover was approximately six billion hectares (Bryant etal., 1997). The Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America and China were the most forest rich countries accounting to 53 per cent of the total forest area of the globe. Another 64 countries having a combined population of two billions was reported to have forest on less than ten per cent of their total land area and unfortunately ten of these countries have no forest at all. Among these countries 16 are such which had relatively substantial forest areas of more 1than one million hectares each and three of these countries namely Chad, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Mongolia each had more than ten million hectares of forest. The forest area remained fairly stable in North and Central America while it expanded in Europe during the past decade. Asian continent especially in India and China due to their large scale afforestation programme in the last decade registered a net gain in forest area. Conversely the South America, Africa and Oceania had registered the net annual loss of forest area (Anon., 2010).</p> <p><strong>1.2.</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There is enough evidence that the whole world is facing an environmental crisis on account of heavy deforestation. For several years, there has been remorseless of destruction which must be put under control to avoid some bad consequences associated with deforestation. Nobody knows exactly how much of the world’s rainforests have already been destroyed and continue to be razed each year. Data is often imprecise and subject to differing interpretations. However, this research work will focus on the consequences of deforestation on the rural house hold income especially as observed in Odighi in Edo State.</p> <p><strong>1.3.</strong><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to determine the causes and consequences of deforestation in Odighi and the following objectives are stated for this research study:</p> <p>1.     To find out the causes of deforestation in Odighi Edo State</p> <p>2.     To find out the consequences of deforestation on rural house hold income in Odighi Edo State.</p> <p>3.     To determine the strategies for reducing deforestation.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.     What are the causes of deforestation in Odighi Edo State?</p> <p>2.     What are the consequences of deforestation on rural household income in Odighi Edo State</p> <p>3.     What are the strategies for reducing deforestation?</p> <p>1.4.         <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The significance of this research are:</p> <p>1.     To provide solutions which can assist educators, general public and the government on the causes and consequences of deforestation thereby raising an awareness about unwanted outcomes of deforestation.</p> <p>2.     Findings from this research work will also ascertain the extent of deforestation in Odighi Edo State</p> <p>This research work will help to improve the existing literatures on deforestation thereby contributing to the body of knowledge.</p>                                                            \n\nCONSEQUENCES OF DEFORESTATION ON RURAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSEQUENCES OF DEFORESTATION ON RURAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong></p> <p><em>The broad environmental issues faced by the oil and gas</em><em>exploration and production industry are manifested at both</em><em>local and global levels.

World primary energy consumption in 1994 stood at nearly 8000 million tonnes of oil equivalents (BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 1995); oil and gas represented 63 per cent of world energy supply, with coal providing 27 per cent, nuclear energy 7 per cent and hydro-electric 3 per cent. The challenge is to meetworld energy demands, whilst minimizing adverse impact on the environment by conforming to current good practice.</p> <p>The exploitation of oil and gas reserves has not always been without some ecological side effects. Oil spills, damaged land, accidents and fires, and incidents of air and water pollution have all been recorded at various times and places. In recent times the social impact of operations, espe­cially in remote communities, has also attracted attention. The oil and gas industry has worked for a long time to meet the challenge of providing environmental protection. Much has already been achieved but the industry recognizes that even more can be accomplished.</p> <p>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992—'The Earth Summit'—focused world attention on the close links that exist between the environment and socio­economic development. The Summit reviewed global envir­onmental issues and resulted in two conventions (theFramework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity), as well as the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21—plan of action. The centralmessage of Agenda 21 is one of interdependence and cross- sector partnership, and the plan of action provided a new approach to the wide-ranging socio-economic and environ­mental challenges facing the world community.</p> <p>The broad environmental issues faced by the oil and gas exploration and production industry are manifested at both local and global levels. They include: habitat protection and biodiversity, air emissions, marine and freshwater discharges,incidents and oil spills, and soil and groundwater contami­nation. The industry has responded to these issues. The chal­lenge is to ensure that all operations conform to current good practice.</p> <p>The continual evolution of the environmental agenda must also be taken into account. Industry places much emphasis on establishing effective management systems and has gone a long way to ensure that environmental issues are key components of corporate culture, with the issues related to health, safety and environment often being considered together, because they have much in common.</p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The Plant commenced operations with a total number of 1,376 staff, made up of 138 expatriates Technical Back-Up Services (TBS), and 1,246 Nigerian Staff.</p> <p>However, in 1999 EPCL started a gradual phase-out of the TBS Personnel as most Nigerian staff gained adequate experience on the operation and maintenance of the Plants.</p> <p>At 138 expatriate TBS Personnel the cost of about $2 million per month was abominable as it had negative impact on the cost of operations and cash flow for the Company. Today, the cost stands at about $0.64 million for 43 TBS Personnel.</p> <p>Historically, the Eleme Petrochemicals Complex Project was started in the Project Engineering Division of the NNPC under Mr. S. A. Kufeji as the General Manager, championed by Dr. E. I.Onyia, as Manager Petrochemicals.</p> <p>In early 1982, the Petrochemicals Division of the NNPC was created, with Mr. 0. 0. Lolomari as the General Manager, while Dr. E. I. Onyia continued his lead push for the petrochemicals programme. Later that year, NNPC signed the Consultancy Agreement with Foster Wheeler International Corporation of Reading, UK.</p> <p>Following a major re-organization of NNPC in October 1985, Dr.T. M. John was appointed the co-ordinator of the Petrochemical Sector. During another restructuring of the NNPC in 1988, Dr. T. M. John became the first Managing Director of Eleme Petrochemicals Company Limited (EPCL).</p> <p><strong>1.4   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objectives of this element of industrial fire engineering in the prevention of fire haroccus are as below:</p> <p>• To provide an orderly emergency response plan for all industrial workers.</p> <p>• To ensure all exit routes, emergency staircases are not obstructed and can be used in an orderly fashion during emergencies.</p> <p>• To ensure fast, organised and smooth evacuation of industry during emergencies.</p> <p>• To train fire engineers and emergency evacuation officers to conduct their duties successfully.</p> <p>• To test the working conditions and effectiveness of all fire and emergency equipment for all industrys in Imo State.</p> <p><strong>Purpose and scope</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of environmental issues in the oil and gas exploration and pro­duction industry, and of the best approaches to achieving high environmental performance in all parts of the world. It should be noted that it covers only exploration and produc­tion activities and does not discuss large scale storage and transportation issues, or downstream processing. Nor does itattempt to cover social development issues in detail, although they are mentioned as important elements in the text, alongside ecological issues.</p> <p>This document provides an overview for key stakehold­ers in industry and government.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Air pollution has been becoming a necessary evil with rapid industrialization and urbanization around the world, after it results in kinds of human health problems, such as ophthalmic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Brunekreef &amp; Holgate, 2002; Giles et al., 2011; Gudmundsson, 2011;Jamrozik &amp; Musk, 2011; Miller et al., 2007; Nandasena, 2010). The direst threat posted by air pollution may be its hard controlling caused by its strong flowability. Either could it be spread from one source location to a larger region, even the whole planet, and the sweeping radiation pollution in air originated from Fukushima in Japan is unfortunately in this case, or conversely diluted with changes of climatic conditions (Sample, 2007).</p> <p>Among all types of treatments of contaminants, including microbial bioremediation, phytoremediation stands out for its benefits yielded from self-maintaining, soil stabilization and other advantages to meet greater public approval (Doty et al., 2007). And different phytoremediation process is responsible for specific pollutant. Air pollutants can be divided into anthropogenic and natural pollutants according to their sources, or primary and secondary pollutants, which stem from reactions of primary pollutants, when taking production process into account (UNEP, 2004).</p> <p><strong>1.7   RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>A hypothesis is a proposition that is stated in testable form and prediction of particular relationship between two or more variables.</p> <p>Ho:   There is no significant relationship between Ergonomic specification and the control of industrial accident rate in agro allied industry</p> <p>Hi:    There is great significant relationship between Ergonomic specification and the control of industrial accident rate in agro allied industry</p> <p><strong>1.6   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following questions will be treated in the course of this research work thus:</p> <p>1.

The objectives of this research are to: examine the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of waste management entrepreneurs; identify the sources and destinations of recyclable municipal solid waste; analyse the quantity of waste materials (metal scraps, plastics and cans) recovered, reused and transported for recycling; identify the type of uses recyclable materials are put into in the study area; and examine the socioeconomic benefit of waste re-use and recycling. A total of 252 scrap metal/plastic collectors, scavengers and artisanal recyclers‘ were studied using purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Tables, percentages, charts and multiple linear regression techniques were used for the analysis. The results showed that majority of the waste collectors within the twelve localities of Zaria were less than 20 years old. Generally, the low educational level of the respondents indicates that formal educational qualification is not a major determinant of being an actor in this type of business. Cans and aluminium, scrap metal, assorted plastics, are the major materials that attract waste entrepreneurs in Zaria. about 71.8% of waste collectors collect waste from multiple sources and majority of the waste actors about 61.5% collect less than 100 kg of valuable waste materials every week. Products produced by artisanal recyclers from cans and scrap Aluminium includes majorly pots and frying pan. A relatively high proportion (56.7%) of plastic collectors disposes the assorted plastics to those involved in reuse like, bottling of locally made drinks (Zobo and Kunu), traditional herbs and honey. The average monthly income for about 43.3% was above N16, 000. 00 which is quite better compared with the Nigerian minimum wage standard. Also all the respondents claimed that no harmful solid substances were released into the environment as a result of artisanal recycling activity. Further, about 30% of waste management entrepreneurs are employers of labour, with 13.5% having more than 6 employees. The multiple regression analysis revealed that the number of people employed in waste business and quantity of waste collected have significant impact on their income with coefficients of 0.343 and 0.360 respectively, while the coefficient of multiple determination (R2) indicate a total variation of 42.5% at 5% level of significance. However, challenges militating against waste recycling in Zaria include lack of a functional recycling plant; price fluctuation and the cost of conveying recyclables to recycling plants outside the study area among others.</p> <p>It is concluded that municipal solid waste re-use and recycling activities contribute more to waste management than the government owned agencies in the study area. Their activities in sustainable waste management should be incorporated into the state environmental protection agency institutional framework.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p> 1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY </p> <p>The term ‗waste‘ has a different meaning for different people. In general, waste is unwanted‘ for the person who discards it; a product or material that does not have a value anymore for the first user and is therefore thrown away. But ‗unwanted‘ is subjective and the waste could have value for another person in a different circumstance, or even in a different culture (Van de Klundert and Justine, 2001). There are many large industries that operate primarily or exclusively using waste materials such as paper and metals as their industrial raw materials. In the context of Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM), waste is regarded both as valueless and as a useful material providing a potential source of income. This real value of waste in many low-and middle-income countries (developing countries) is confirmed by the huge informal sector that lives on waste collection and recovery (Van de Klundert and Justine, 2001).</p> <p>Waste, either in solid or liquid form is being produced since the dawn of human existence and it is not excessive to say, waste is the first thing generated before people are able to contribute to the betterment of lives. Due to social and environmental consequences, waste reuse, recycle and recovery have become essentials in minimizing the environmental damage that could occur through indiscriminate waste disposal (Sivapalan, Mohamad, Mohamad, and Muhd-Noor, 2005).</p> <p>Davies (2008) notes that ―what some people consider to be waste materials or substances are considered a source of value by others‖ This relative attribute of waste can be compared with the concept of ‗resource‘ which has also been defined as material that has use-value and ―a reflection of human appraisal‖ (Jones and Hollier, 1977). Just as a material becomes a resource when it gains use-value, it also becomes waste when it loses its use-value. Like resources, waste is also a relative concept of human appraisal because what constitutes waste can vary from one person to another, one society to another and over time. As noted by Jessen (2002) ―our waste stream is actually full of resources going in the wrong direction‖.</p> <p>Waste reuse and recycling as an alternative management option for waste is now recognized as an important approach to solving waste problem both in developed and developing world. Resource recovery from dumped consumer products is growing in significance, as waste is increasingly seen as a valuable resource. As human beings continuously realized that resources are finite, efficient use of resources and resources recovery from wastes are vital for global environmental sustainability (Zaman and Lehmann, 2011).</p> <p>Developed countries generally rely on land filling to overcome the problem of waste accumulation (Girling, 2005; Pacione, 2005). The landfill seems to have a special attraction for municipal waste managers because it offers a cheap and convenient option for waste disposal compared with other strategies such as reuse, recycling and energy recovery (Charzan, 2002). In fact, with the exception of few countries like Austria, the Netherlands and Denmark who recycle substantial proportions of their waste, most countries in Europe and North America still dump the bulk of their municipal solid waste in landfills (OECD, 2002; Girling, 2005). For instance, In May, 2008, the inadequacy of waste disposal land created mayhem in the Italian city of Naples when the streets became laden with waste, blocking traffic and causing nuisance and hazards (Anthony, 2009). The European Commission’s thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste (European Union, 2005) called for life-cycle thinking in waste policies and moving towards a recycling society. This has in turn highlighted the opportunities for improved coherence between policies on waste and those on climate change and resource efficiency</p> <p>(European Environment Agency (EEA), 2011).</p> <p>Additionally, specific technical expertise and related general repair and maintenance technology are often absent in developing nations‘ scenario. Incineration in Africa would be infeasible if the waste stream is indeed 70% wet organic content. Under these conditions, incineration is likely to be energy consuming rather than an energy-producing option. There is environmental-health problems associated with incineration. When conditions are not optimal, incineration volatilizes many compounds, such as dioxins, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxides, which are potentially harmful to human health, atmosphere, plants, and animals (Manyanhaire <em>et al</em>, 2009).</p> <p>Lastly in the hierarchy is land disposal (landfill), which involves haulage of garbage in open areas. Such areas range from unsanitary open dumps to properly operated sanitary landfills (Ukoje, 2011).</p> <p>In the past few years, research on SWM in Nigeria has focused essentially on contextualizing waste recycling as an approach to urban environmental management and livelihoods (Adeyemi, Olorunfemi and Adewoye, 2001; Agunwamba, 2003; Nzeadibe and Eziuzor, 2006; Nzeadibe and Iwuoha, 2008). Unfortunately, SWM appear to have received little attention from Nigerian social scientists especially from the viewpoint of the socially-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (Nzeadibe, 2009). Environmental concerns and sustainable development are germane to MDGs, which make an investigation into how wealth generated from waste helps in sustainable environmental management an appropriate subject of inquiry.</p><p> 1.2   STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM </p> <p>In the pursuit of sustainable waste management, the prevention of waste generation is the first priority, followed by waste recovery and safe disposal of waste on the hierarchy of principles for waste management (Figure 1.1). These principles need to be put in practice through joint waste prevention and management measures if growing environmental degradation is to be avoided. For example, the use of valuable land for waste disposal, the release of harmful substances from landfills and waste transports into air, soil and water, and the use of resources that are transformed into disposed waste instead of being reused or recycled will all have negative impacts on the environment, and will have a long-lasting direct and indirect influences on the quality of life (European Urban Waste Management Cluster (EUWMC), 2005).</p> <p>It is known that there have been some local methods by which solid wastes were been reused or recycled. The knowledge of waste reuse and recycling might not be totally new in the Nigerian context. Rather, it is the current sophistication involved that is rather new. Waste facilities in developing countries are minimal, but substantial quantities are diverted for recycling (Tajuddeen, 2003). So there was this reuse culture that has been planted in to Nigerians subconsciously. Every item used were structured for reuse. Even today, the sachets of ―pure water‖ are used by horticulturists for flower nursery and paper wrappers are reused. The reuse tradition is what makes old newspapers useful for wrapping roasted groundnut ( <em>Arachis hypogea Linn</em>) and pop corn (<em>guguru</em>) or <em>akara</em>, the popular fried beans cake. Apart from the fact that the reuse culture saves lots of money, it is highly conservative resulting in waste management (Ajibade, 2005).</p> <p>In spite of the enormous benefits associated with sustainable waste management strategies such as re-use and recycling, only a handful of countries are able to put them into practice. For instance, most of the economically developed countries are still unable to recycle much of their waste (Anthony, 2009). Besides, growing land scarcity and stricter environmental standards now make it difficult for many rich cities to find adequate and suitable disposal sites for the large volumes of waste being generated by their urban populations (Pacione, 2005; Charzan, 2002).</p> <p>The foregoing review demonstrates that waste to wealth has multiple socioeconomic and environmental benefits yet it has not been systematically examined in Zaria. The dearth of such work is an important research gap needed to be urgently filled.</p> <p><strong>1.2   RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The research questions posed are as follows:</p> <p>1.    What are the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of waste management entrepreneurs (WMEs) in the study area?</p> <p>2.    What are the sources and destinations of recyclable Municipal Solid Waste, in Zaria metropolis?</p> <p>·         What is the quantity of waste materials (metal scraps, plastics and cans) recovered, reused and transported for recycling?</p> <p>1.    What type of uses are the recyclable materials put into?</p> <p>2.    What are the socioeconomic benefits of waste management to waste management entrepreneurs (WMEs) in the study area?</p><p> 1.3      STUDY AIM AND OBJECTIVES </p> <p>The aim of the study is to evaluate the potential for municipal solid waste reuse/recycling as waste management strategies in Zaria metropolis to create wealth and promote a sustainable environment.  The specific objectives are to:</p> <p>i.examine the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of waste management entrepreneurs (WMEs) in the study area  ii.identify the sources and destinations of recyclable Municipal Solid Waste, in Zaria metropolis; iii.analyse the quantity of waste materials (metal scraps, plastics and cans) recovered, reused, transported for recycling.</p> <p>1.    identify the type of uses recyclable materials are put into in the study area.</p> <p>2.    examine the socioeconomic benefits of waste management to waste management entrepreneurs (WMEs) in the study area.</p><p> 1.4     JUSTIFICATION FOR THE STUDY </p> <p>There are several reasons for continuous research on waste problem at local, national and global levels. Firstly, the earth‘s natural resources are fast dwindling, hence the need to conserve the resources. Reuse and recycle are some of the conservation means for sustainable natural resource management, including municipal solid waste. This is the environmental justification for this study. Also, this study will provide evidence on the volume of wealth/job created from managing municipal solid waste (MSW) that can be used for future development planning in the area of employment generation. Evidence from other countries such as Germany, Australia and the US demonstrate how significant job creation at the local level has been achieved through high recycling rates, thus supporting new business formation (Mayor of London, 2003).</p> <p>In terms of contribution to knowledge on solid waste and urban environmental management, findings of the study will form a base knowledge for researchers interested in that area. It is hoped that this work will contribute to finding a sustainable way of handling scrap metal, can and plastic waste menace in Zaria with adaptive implications for the whole country and beyond.</p><p> 1.5      SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY </p> <p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for solid waste re-use and recycling as a management strategy to create wealth and promote a sustainable waste management. The spatial scope of this work are localities in Zaria which include; Samaru, Palladan, Basawa, Gyllesu, Muchia, Chikaji, Wusasa, Dogarawa, Sabon-Gari, Tudun Wada, Gaskiya and Zaria city. The areas were chosen based on the prominence of collection points. By indication, Zaria as used in this study comprises Zaria and Sabon-Gari Local Government Areas (LGAs), with four (4) districts namely; Zaria city district, Tudun Wada district, Sabon-Gari district and Samaru district.</p> <p>This study will therefore examine recovery, reuse and recycling of MSW. The focus will be limited to scrap metal, plastic bottles and cans; since they are the items that are majorly recovered by the entrepreneurs. The temporal scope for the field work was limited to one month (i.e. from second week of November to first week of December 2012).</p>                                                           \n\nASSESSMENT OF POTENTIALS OF WASTE TO WEALTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIALS OF WASTE TO WEALTH", "id": 64}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1     Background of Study</p> <p>Today, there is no doubt that the world has increasingly become urban and the 20 century witnessed rapid and unprecedented urbanization of the world’s population. The global urban population increased from 13% in 1900 to 29% in 1950, 49% in 2005 and it is estimated that by 2030, 60% of the population will live in the cities. This trend is a reflection of the growth of urban population that increased from 220 million in 1900 to 732 million in 1950 and is expected that there will be 4.9 billion urban dwellers by 2030 (annual urban growth rate of 1.8%). Almost all of this growth will be in lower income regions of Africa and Asia where urban population is likely to triple and in Asia will more than double. Of all the regions of the world, Asia and Africa are urbanizing faster and are projected to become 56% and 64% urban, respectively by 2050. Three countries; Nigeria, India, and China combined are expected to account for 37% of the projected growth of the world population between 2014 and 2050. At the beginning of the 20 century, just 16 cities in the world (mostly in developing nations) contained a million people or more. Today, more than 400 cities have a population of a million or more, about 70% of them are found in developing countries. For the first time in history, in 2007, more people live in cities and towns than will be living in rural areas and by 2017, the developing nation is likely to have become more urban in character than rural. While, there is no universal definition of what constitutes urban settlement, the criteria for classifying an area as urban may be based on one or a combination of characteristics as human population threshold, population density, proportion employed in non-agricultural sectors, presence of infrastructures such as paved roads, electricity, piped water or services, and presence of education and health services. On the other hand, urbanization denotes a process whereby a society changes from a rural to urban way of life or redistribution of populations to urban settlements associated with development and civilization. For millennia, urban areas have been centres and drivers of commercial, scientific, political and cultural life, having a major influence on the whole countries and regions. The Nigerian society is undergoing both demographic transition (people are living longer) and epidemiological transition (change in population health due to changes in lifestyle) mainly as a result of urbanization. The country is undergoing rapid urbanization with a rapidly growing population. At current growth rate of about 2.8%–3% a year, Nigeria’s urban population will double in the next two decades.</p> <p>The pattern, trend, and characteristics of urbanization in Nigeria have been alarming. The towns and cities have grown phenomenally with pace of urbanization in Nigeria showing extraordinary high rates of 5%–10% per annum. Consequently, there has been rapid expansion of Nigerian cities’ area up to 10-fold their initial point of growth and the fact that the growth has been largely unplanned and uncontrolled. Several studies have shown that inadequate planning of urban land uses in Nigeria and great intensity of use has exacerbated urban problems.</p> <p>In 1995, there were 7 cities with a population of over 1 million, 18 cities with over 500,000 population, 36 with over 200,000, and 78 with over 100,000. By 2020, it is projected that the number of cities with a population of 500,000 and 200,000, respectively will be 36 and 680 assuming annual urban growth rate of 5%. Over the decades, the population of most major cities/towns has increased by many fold. Lagos, Kano, Port Harcourt, Maiduguri, Kaduna, Ilorin, and Jos all had more than 1000% increase over the past 5 decades. For instance, Kano’s population rose from 5,810,470 in 1991 to 9,383,682 in 2006. Enugu had 174,000 in 1965, 464,514 in 1991, and 712,291 in 2006 while over the same period; Lagos had a population of less than a million, 4 million, and over 10 million, respectively. Lagos is a mega city where inadequate infrastructure and services, housing shortage, traffic congestion, crime, street violence, and other social vices are well pronounced. These population increases account in part, for the rapid physical expansion of these cities and consequent creation of urban slums and urban villages. In 1950, only 10.1% of population was urban in Nigeria, this rose to 20.0% by 1970, 43.3% in 2000, and it is expected to reach 58.3% by 2020.</p> <p>1.2     Statement of Problem</p> <p>Urbanization is a major public health challenge of the 21 century as urban populations are rapidly increasing, but basic infrastructures are insufficient and social and economic inequities in urban areas have resulted in significant health inequalities. In this sense, therefore, urbanization in a way is similar to globalization which can be seen as a structural social determinant of health that can challenge the aspirations of equity due to tendency of accumulation of wealth and power among urban elites. Today, most cities in Nigeria have undergone urban decay because of lack of or breakdown in basic services; potable water supply, electricity, efficient city transport services, affordable housing, and waste disposal systems. This is largely as a result of authorities coming to terms with the “tempo” of rising urban needs. These phenomenal transitions are not without health challenges to the population in urban areas and cities. These prompted this review as there is an obvious need to assess how these demographics can enhance our understanding of the current urban trait in Nigeria and its challenges. Urbanization is integrally connected to the three pillars of sustainable development, economic development, social development, and environmental protection, and as urbanization proceeds in Nigeria, the pace and scale of urban population growth will generate important public health challenges for town planners and governments. This is more so since urbanization has not been associated with sustained industrialization and socioeconomic development across the country. Urban poverty and the growth of slums and shanty settlements which are critical challenges to urban health have grown remarkably. Thus, the “health for all will not be achieved for all Nigerians without re-orienting the system to deal with urban health problems.” Systematic search of published literature in English was conducted between 1960 and 2015. Published peer review journals, abstracts, Gray literature (technical reports, government documents, reports, etc.), inaugural lectures, and Internet articles were reviewed. Manual search of reference lists of selected articles was checked for further relevant studies. In this research material, we broadly review the current knowledge on trends of urbanization in Nigeria and health challenges posed by this phenomenon to provide an informed background to stimulate further research and to promote positive urbanization. In addition, health of Nigerians should be a major consideration in both urban renewal and future town planning to ensure that urbanization is not only friendly across all ages but also works to reduce the double burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Hence, this work seeks to analyse environmental protection agency strategy for reducing health risks in urban areas.</p> <p>1.3     Research Objectives</p> <p>The general objective of this research work is to analyse environmental protection agency strategy for reducing health risks in urban areas. However, te following specific objectives are formed for the purpose of the research project;</p> <p>To evaluate the roles of the environmental protection agency in reducing health risks in urban areas in Nigeria</p> <p>To assess the performance of environmental protection agency in reducing health risks in urban areas in Nigeria</p> <p>To investigate problems affecting the effectiveness of environmental protection agency in reducing health risks in urban areas in Nigeria</p> <p>1.4     Research Questions</p> <p>What are the roles of the environmental protection agency in reducing health risks in urban areas in Nigeria?</p> <p>What is the level of performance of environmental protection agency in reducing health risks in urban areas in Nigeria?</p> <p>What are the problems affecting the effectiveness of environmental protection agency in reducing health risks in urban areas in Nigeria?</p> <p>1.6     Significance of Study</p> <p>This research project would be utilized by the government at both federal and state levels through their various ministries like, Ministry of Environment, Education, Health and Information. It will be beneficial ffor these ministries in the area of policy formulation, most especially in the area of educating the public and assisting them in the process of laws formulation to promote human health and protect the environment especially in the urban areas.</p> <p>The populace will also benefit greatly from this study, as the research project will reveal the environmental protection agencies and their strategies, as well as help the public to be aware of its activities and how their contribution can affect the effectiveness of these strategies.

Water is the most abundant environmental resource on earth but its accessibility is based on quality and quantity, as well as space and time. It may be available in various forms and quantity but its use for various purposes is the subject of quality. About 70% of the human body and about 60-70% of plant cells is made up of water (Smith and Edger, 2006). It is one of the determinants of human settlement, existence and activities on the earth. Its quantity is fixed but dynamic in formation and storage. Of all the environmental concerns that developing countries face, the lack of adequate, good quality water remains the most serious (Markandya, 2004). Once contaminated, groundwater may forever remain polluted without remedy or treatment. Water is one of the determinants of human earth system. Diseases may spring up through water pollution, especially groundwater contamination, and rapidly spread beyond human expectation because of its flow mechanism (Afolayan et al., 2012). One of the major factors that make the earth habitable for humans is the presence of water. Forming the major component of plant and animal cells, it is the basis of life and therefore the development of water resources is an important component in the integrated development of any area.</p> <p>Water is critical to our daily lives and is an extraordinary compound in nature. It covers 71% of Earth (USGS, 2014). Water is the most important resource of a country, and of the entire society, since no life is possible without water. It has this unique position among other natural resources, because a country can survive in the absence of any other resource, except water (Garg, 2009). According to the National Water Policy (2002), in the planning and operation of systems, water allocation priorities should be broadly as follows: drinking, irrigation, hydropower, ecology, agro-industries and non-agricultural industries, navigation and other uses.</p> <p>About 68.7% of the fresh water is tied up in polar ice caps and glaciers, and a further 30.1% is underground as groundwater, most of which is not available for use (Gleick, 1996). Rivers and lakes constitute a mere 0.32%, atmospheric moisture 0.03% and soil moisture 0.05%.The major sources of water are surface water (oceans, rivers, streams, seas and brooks), groundwater, snow and ice, and lakes. However their exploration and exploitation varies from place to place based on their state of existence. Groundwater plays a vital role for urban and agricultural water supply. It accounts for about 0.5% of total hydrosphere, approximately 6.73 x10km3 in volume (Ayoade, 2003). It constitutes a major portion of the earth’s water circulatory system known as hydrological cycle and occurs in permeable geologic formation known as aquifers i.e. formations having structure that can store and transmit water at rates fast enough to supply reasonable amounts to wells (Afolayan et al., 2012).</p> <p>Wastes of different types, mostly solid wastes are the major input of dumpsites/landfills. With respect to the hydrological analysis of groundwater, it flows from areas of higher topography towards areas of lower topography, thereby bringing about the examination of the degradable material which form leachate and contaminate the groundwater of the study area.</p> <p>Landfill practice is the disposal of solid wastes by infilling depressions on land. The depressions into which solid wastes are often dumped include valleys (abandoned) sites of quarries, excavations, or sometimes a selected portion within the residential and commercial areas in many urban settlements where the capacity to collect, process, dispose of, or re-use solid waste in a cost-efficient, safe manner is often limited. The practice of landfill system as a method of waste disposal in many developing countries is usually far from standard recommendations (Mull, 2005; Adewole, 2009; Eludoyin &amp; Oyeku, 2010). A standardized landfill system involves carefully selected location, and is usually constructed and maintained by means of engineering techniques, ensuring minimized pollution of air, water and soil and risks to man and animals. It involves placing waste in lined pit or a mound (Sanitary landfills) with appropriate means of leachate and landfill gas control (Alloway &amp; Ayres 1997; Eludoyin &amp; Oyeku 2010). Land filling of municipal solid waste is a common waste management practice and one of the cheapest methods for organized waste management in many parts of the world (El-Fadel et al., 1997; Jhamanani et al., 2009; Longe &amp; Balogun, 2010). Increasing urbanization results in an increased generation of waste materials and landfills become the most convenient way of disposal. Most of these landfills are mere ‘holes in the ground” do not qualify as sanitary means of solid waste disposal. Most of the areas around the Solous dumpsites depend either on dug-up wells or bore-holes which may likely be affected by the generated leachate through waste decomposition from the dumpsites despite the provision of pipe-borne water by government. According to Papadopoulou et al. 2007, as the natural environment can no longer digest the produced wastes, the development of solid waste management has contributed to their automated collection, treatment and disposal. One of the most common waste disposal methods is landfilling, a controlled method of disposing solid wastes on land with the dual purpose of eliminating public health and environmental hazards and minimizing nuisances without contaminating surface or subsurface water resource.</p> <p>There are three major landfills and two temporary landfill sites serving the area of Lagos State. The Olushosun landfill site is the largest, situated in the Northern part of Lagos within Ikeja Local Government Area, and receives approximately 40% of total waste deposits from Lagos (LAWMA, 2011).</p> <p>The Solous landfills, I, II and III, may be regarded as the second most functional landfill in Lagos State after the Olusosun landfill in Ketu. This is because of its location within the largest Local Government Area of the State. For the teeming population of the surrounding community, groundwater is the major source of water supply. Despite the provision of pipe-borne public water by Lagos State Water Cooperation mini water works, some households still prefer their personal wells and bore holes. Owing to this fact, the possibility of the generated leachate affecting the hydrology of the area deserves proper investigation through experimental analysis.</p> <p>1.2       Statement of Problem</p> <p>Landfills have served many years as ultimate disposal site for all types of waste; municipal solid waste, industrial sewage and hazardous waste. Physical, chemical and biological processes interact simultaneously to bring about the overall decomposition of the wastes. One of the by-products of this mechanism is chemically laden leachate. Leachate is produced by the action of rainwater aiding bacteria in the process of decomposition. Leachate is typically composed of dissolved organic matter, inorganic macro components (such as chlorides, iron, aluminum, zinc and ammonia), heavy metals and xenobiotic organic compounds such as halogenated organics. Other chemicals including pesticides, solvents and heavy metals may also be present. Leachates are a potential hazardous waste from landfill sites. If not dealt with properly they can cause pollution to groundwater, health problems and affect the environment. It is therefore important that leachates are treated and contained to prevent these occurrences (Kostova, 2006).</p> <p>The city of Lagos with its teeming population has less than 50 Water Supply Boards to cater to it in terms of water treatment and distribution. It therefore relies rely mostly on bore holes and hand dug wells for its water needs. The major environmental problem experienced around the Solous landfill areas is the contamination of groundwater via discharged leachate. Areas near landfills have great possibility of groundwater contamination because of the potential pollution source of leachate originating from the nearby site. Such contamination of groundwater resource poses a substantial risk to local resource users and to the natural environment. The impact of landfill leachate on the surface and groundwater has given rise to a number of studies in recent years (Mor et al., 2006). It is therefore important to study the water quality in areas especially those around these landfill sites to examine its impact on groundwater quality.</p> <p>1.3       Research Objectives</p> <p>The aim of the research is to examine the impact of sanitary landfills towards sustainable development in Nigeria. The research also considers the effect of the location of dumpsites on the underground water quality in Lagos State. To this effect, the study will particularly:</p> <p>Examine the effect of distance from dumpsite on the physical, chemical and heavy metal properties of sampled groundwater.</p> <p>Determine the effect of soil physical properties on the ground water quality in the study area.</p> <p>Examine if there is variation in water quality among sampled groundwater sources</p> <p>Compare the difference in the quality of sampled water with WHO and NSDWQ water quality standards.</p> <p>1.4       Research Questions</p> <p>What is the effect of distance from dumpsite on the physical, chemical and heavy metal properties of sampled groundwater?</p> <p>What is the effect of soil physical properties on the ground water quality in the study area?</p> <p>Is there any variation in water quality among sampled groundwater sources?</p> <p>What is the impact of sanitary landfill towards sustainable development in Nigeria?</p> <p>1.5       Significance of the Study</p> <p>Seasonality is the first criteria of the period of this research work because it plays prominent role in waste degradation and groundwater migration. Similar studies have also been carried out in the past during the rainy season and this study monitors the sites to compare results over time. This serves as the basis of the fieldwork being carried out in August, 2011 unlike either during the dry season when there is no water ingression or during the excess rainfall which can easily dilute and reduce parameter concentration. The study will also recommend measures with which local authorities can continue to reduce pollutant levels over time. The selected variables were based on their long life span and being the common pollutants within the landfill, as well as their degree of concentration in relation to groundwater migration. They have been regarded as being responsible for various health problems, being non-biodegradable, as well as their possibility of accumulation in the food web. Despite the provision of pipe borne water by state government in areas of the landfill, people still rely more on their dug-up wells which are easily contaminated through seepage. Low literacy levels may have influenced their choice of preference for dug-up wells. Some physical parameters like taste, colour and odour are the main indicators of water pollution to the people without taking into consideration the other physical, chemical and biological variables of water.</p> <p>This will add to the body of existing literature on this research topic as well as be a reference point for other researchers who want to write on a related field or area in the nearest future.</p> <p>1.6       Limitation of the Study</p> <p>Assessing the variability in leachate composition and leachate migration from old landfills needs an integrated approach. Historical information (including old maps, aerial photographs, interviews, etc.) creates a valuable basis for understanding the variability. Also, information on the hydrology of the dumpsite and the adjacent part of the polluted aquifer is needed. Detailed information of the site like depth could not be extracted from the appropriate authority due to the fact that the sites were not originally planned and designed for the purpose of waste management. As a result of proximity of the examined dumpsites, there were problems of spatial boundary location. The Solous dumpsites are interconnected and to establish surface hydrological boundary in between them posed a very serious task. However, surface delineation of landfill areas may not coincide with the underground water basin. Most of the inhabitants refused to cooperate due to their suspicion that the researcher was an agent to State Government set out to expose their non-compliance with the instructions of the Lagos State Water Corporation.</p> <p>The lack of standard laboratories as well as the high cost of testing each sample affected the number of samples tested. A long distance was travelled to avail the services of the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency to test the water samples and soil samples were tested out of state resulting in additional transport costs. Period of observation, that is rainy season, might also checkmate the results from the parameters.</p> <p>1.7       Definition of Terms</p> <p>Sustainable Development: is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while at the same time sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depend.

ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1            Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Contemporary globalization and urbanization is reproducing classic conditions historically associated with the emergence of infectious diseases and the periodically recurring pattern of epidemics and pandemics. The dynamics of contemporary globalization has contributed to various institutional gaps that make dealing with infectious diseases is increasing difficult and threaten concentrated human populations with potential calamity (Gibson and Gumer, 2012). Over the past few decades, there has been a rapid urbanization of the world’s population.</p> <p>According to Chilala (2015) Rapid urbanization has significant repercussions on migrants’ health. The increasing movement of people from rural to urban areas often alters the characteristic epidemiological disease profile of the country and at the same time new diseases appear or old ones remerges. Such is the case of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and recent case of Ebola and Lassa fever. Urbanization is also associated with changes in diet and exercise that increase the prevalence of obesity with increased risks of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>Philip (1993) defines Urbanization as involves a physical change in which increasing proportions of populations live in urban settings. It also implies considerable changes in the ways in which these people live, how they earn their livelihoods, the food which they eat, and the wide range of environmental factors to which they are exposed. There is another underlying assumption that, increasingly, urban populations will be healthier than their rural counterparts and those higher levels of urbanization will equate with better health status.</p> <p>It is however; manifestly evident that in many cities, particularly in the developing world, the poor are exposed to greater risks and have much lower health status than their richer neighbours. In addition, whilst urban residents may theoretically have a better access to health care and services than do residents in many rural areas, and whilst many indicators of health do appear better in more highly urbanized societies than ones less so, there are caveats Vlahov et al., (2007).  In certain cities in middle-income countries, residents, particularly the poor, are exposed to a double risk of both infection and chronic degenerative ailments.</p> <p>It has been emphasized that urbanization, and the concentration of human beings into new areas in particular, can bring exposure to new risk factors for large numbers of people. The growth of infectious and parasitic disease in some urban settings must therefore be recognized, as must the emergence of chronic diseases, with the concomitant need for investment in new types of health and social care. However, a number of constraints militate against the achievement of improved urban health, especially in developing countries (Ojogbe, 2002; Kotz, 2009; Salau, 2012).</p>                                                           \n\nIMPACT OF URBANIZATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH QUALITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF URBANIZATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH QUALITY", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>A lot of public latrine poses a very serious problem to the people of Awka and also to other places across the country. The problem of open defecation which some people often refer to as going to the bush or bush shitting has persistently been difficult to address in Awka and Nigeria because of the unavailability of good public and home toilets both in the cities and local communities or villages. A lot of people live without proper sanitation in Awka and these people have to decide on daily basis how to organize defecation without feeling ashamed or fear. Two hypothesis were formulated? To test the relationship between outbreak of disease and public latrine and the need for provision of latrine in public places. Data used for the study were collected from primary and secondary sources including questionnaire survey of the residents in Awka. From the analysis, it was found out that enough latrine are not provided in public places like markets, public compounds and even hostels thereby making the least provided to be overused and uncared for. The tests result shows that good latrine and the quality of life of the residents are significantly related. The recommendations made in the study include adequate provision of public toilets and toilets facilities as well as financing and maintenance of toilet facilities. It is hoped that the suggested measures of this study will go along way to improving the life residents in Awka territory. </p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Approval page</p> <p>Declaration</p> <p>Dedication</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Table of content</p> <p>List of table</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE  </p> <p>1.0  Introduction</p> <p>1.1  Background of the study</p> <p>1.2  Statement of research problems</p> <p>1.3  Research question</p> <p>1.4  Goals and objectives</p> <p>1.5  Statement of hypothesis</p> <p>1.6  Theoretical framework</p> <p>1.7  Scope of the study</p> <p>1.8  Significance of the study</p> <p>1.9  Limitation and constrain of the study</p> <p>1.10 Operational definitions</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>2.0   Literature review</p> <p>2.1   The nature of public latrine</p> <p>2.2   Environmental pollution</p> <p>2.3   Sanitation</p> <p>2.4   Surface water quality</p> <p>2.4.1Sources of water waste</p> <p>2.4.2Strategies for controlling and managing waste</p> <p>2.5   Biological processes in latrines</p> <p>2.6   Non-biological processes in latrine</p> <p>2.6.1Filling rates</p> <p>2.6.2Draining of liquid out of the pit</p> <p>2.7   Public latrine management technique</p> <p>2.7.1Management</p> <p>2.7.2Training of caretaker</p> <p>2.7.3Public health education</p> <p>2.7.4Maintenance</p> <p>2.7.5Economy and fees</p> <p>2.7.6Monitoring and supervision</p> <p>3.8   Summary of the review</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE    </p> <p>3.0   Description of the study area</p> <p>3.1   Brief history of Awka</p> <p>3.2   Location of the study area</p> <p>3.3   The physical characteristics</p> <p>3.3.1Topography and geology</p> <p>3.3.2Climate</p> <p>3.3.3Vegetation</p> <p>3.3.4Hydrology and surface drainage</p> <p>3.3.5Soil</p> <p>3.3.6Population of the area</p> <p>3.4   Physical feature of Awka</p> <p>3.5   Social/economic features</p> <p>3.6   Urban structural plan</p> <p>3.7   Land use pattern classification</p> <p>3.8   Major area having public latrine</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR  </p> <p>4.0   Research methodology</p> <p>4.1   The research design</p> <p>4.2   Sources of data</p> <p>4.2.1Primary source of data</p> <p>4.2.2Secondary data</p> <p>4.3   Methods of data collection</p> <p>4.4   Methods of data analysis</p> <p>4.4.1Determination of sample size (population)</p> <p>4.5   Procedure for data collection</p> <p>4.6   Constrains of data analysis</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE  </p> <p>5.0   Data analysis and survey</p> <p>5.1   Analysis and presentation of responses</p> <p>5.2   Problems of public latrine</p> <p>5.2.1Pollution of the environment</p> <p>5.2.2Pollution of water sources and food</p> <p>5.2.3Abuse of public toilet</p> <p>5.2.4Lack of maintenance</p> <p>5.2.5Lack of public health education</p> <p>5.3   Strategies for Managing public latrine</p> <p>5.3.1Safe and clean environment</p> <p>5.3.2Provision of public toilets</p> <p>5.3.4Maintenance and management</p> <p>CHAPTER SIX  </p> <p>6.0   Findings, Recommendation/Conclusion</p> <p>6.1   Summary of findings</p> <p>6.2   Avoiding risks of disease outbreak</p> <p>6.2.1Open defecation</p> <p>6.2.2Not washing your hands</p> <p>6.2.3Leaving dishes on the ground</p> <p>6.3   Recommendation</p> <p>6.4   Conclusion</p> <p>      References</p> <p>      Questionnaire </p>                                                           \n\nPUBLIC LATRINE SYSTEM AND ITS ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PUBLIC LATRINE SYSTEM AND ITS ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS", "id": 71}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This research was conducted on “Assessment of Solid Waste Disposal Practices in Majidadi ‘B’ ward in the Bauchi metropolis” aimed at assessing the nature and the methods used by the users of the area, which was first carried out through survey with the use of structured questionnaires to some persons chosen from the study area. 152 questionnaires were administered out of which 84.87% response was received. The data was analyzed using frequency table and the use of pie chart to distribute the percentages of responses. From the data analyzed it was revealed that 57.36% have no knowledge on waste disposal practices to adopt and the remaining percentages have acquired the knowledge from either environmental officers, through the media or other agencies. The result also shows that kitchen waste, wood and ashes and clothes account for the higher percentage of waste type generated with 23.26%, 21.71% and 17.05% respectively. 43.41% of the waste generated is collected in open containers before disposal and 19.38% in a dustbin while 12.40% uses trash can. Adequate and proper waste disposal facility is greatly needed as only 3.87% opined the presence of incinerators while the highest percentage of 55.87% is of the view of landfill which is unsanitary. This analysis revealed that waste disposal practices among the community of Majidadi ‘B” ward is poor and unhealthy, thus the need for some strategies which will help improve the situation. 30.23% of the households felt that government is responsible for disposing off wastes from the households to the disposal sites; however wastes are rarely disposed off by the agencies responsible, this could be as a result of inadequate equipment and funds challenging the agencies.</div> <div>The study concluded that most household generate high quantity of waste which are not properly disposed of either without knowing the disposal method to employ or are unaware of the dangers improper disposal may cause; which threaten human health and the environment. It is therefore recommended that public enlightment on health impacts associated with improper disposal of wastes should be made more intensified and a massive campaign on promoting awareness on proper waste disposal practices should be organized, and if these measures are taken then the government on her part can enforce laws and penalties regarding improper disposal.</div> <div> </div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENTS</div> <div>Abstract - - - - - - - - - -</div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div>1.0     Introduction - - - - - - - - - 1</div> <div>1.1 Background of the study - - - - - - - 2</div> <div>1.2.      Statement of the research problem - - - - - - 3</div> <div>1.3 Aim of the study - - - - - - - - 4</div> <div>1.4.   Objectives of the research - - - - - - - 4</div> <div>1.5   Scope and delimitation of the study - - - - - - 4</div> <div>1.6 Research methodology - - - - - - - 4</div> <div>CHAPTER TWO</div> <div>LITERATURE REVIEW</div> <div>2.0.     Introduction to review of related literatures - - - - - 6</div> <div>2.1     Concepts of waste - - - - - - - - 6</div> <div>2.2     Waste generation - - - - - - - - 8</div> <div>2.2.1   Waste Generation by Region - - - - - - 10</div> <div>2.2.2   Constituents of Solid Waste - - - - - - 13</div> <div>2.2.3   Types of waste - - - - - - - - 13</div> <div>2.3 Management of solid waste - - - - - - - 14</div> <div>2.4 Collection, evacuation and transportation of waste - - - - 16</div> <div>2.4.1 Frequency of Waste collection - - - - - 16</div> <div>2.5 Knowledge on solid waste disposal - - - - - - 17</div> <div>2.6 Solid waste disposal method - - - - - - - 18</div> <div>2.6.1 Sanitary landfill - - - - - - - 18</div> <div>2.6.2 Incineration - - - - - - - - 19</div> <div>2.6.3 Refuse Composting - - - - - - - 20</div> <div>2.6.4 Environmental impacts of waste disposal methods - - - 21</div> <div>2.7 Constraints of waste disposal and management - - - - 21</div> <div>2.8 Empirical studies on solid waste disposal - - - - - 22</div> <div>CHAPTER THREE</div> <div>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</div> <div>3.0     Introduction - - - - - - - - - 23</div> <div>3.1      The study area - - - - - - - - - 23</div> <div>3.1.1 Climate and Temperature - - - - - - 24</div> <div>3.1.2    Rainfall and Humidity - - - - - - 24</div> <div>3.2     Population of the study - - - - - - - 25</div> <div>3.3      Sample and Sampling Techniques - - - - - - 25</div> <div>3.4 Instruments for data collection - - - - - - 25</div> <div>3.5      Procedures for data collection - - - - - - 25</div> <div>3.6 Procedures for data analysis - - - - - - - 25</div> <div>CHAPTER FOUR</div> <div>4.0 DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS - - - - 27</div> <div>4.1 Socio-economic characteristics of the respondents - - -           -          27</div> <div>4.2 Knowledge of the Respondents on Solid Waste Disposal Practice - - 32</div> <div>4.3 Availability and Adequacy of Waste Disposal Facilities - - - 33</div> <div>4.4 Waste Collection before disposal - - - -- - - 34</div> <div>4.5 General Review of the respondents - - - - - - 39</div> <div>4.6 Discussion of findings - - - - - - - 40</div> <div>CHAPTER FIVE</div> <div>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION- - - - 41</div> <div>5.0 INTRODUCTION - - - - - - - - 41</div> <div>5.1 Summary - - - - - - - - - 41</div> <div>5.2 Conclusion - - - - - - - - - 41</div> <div>5.3 Recommendation - - - - - - - - 42</div> <div>REFERENCES - - - - - - - - - 44</div> <div>APPENDIX - - - - - - - - - - 46</div> <div> Questionaires</div>                                                         \n\n AN ASSESSMENT OF SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL PRACTICES IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  AN ASSESSMENT OF SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL PRACTICES IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS", "id": 72}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study assessed the Yankari Games Reserve as a tourist destination by investigating the perception of the tourists who patronize it. The assessment used indicators including the level of patronage in number of tourists attracted annually, wildlife resources of the reserve, infrastructure, facilities and safety. The method employed reconnaissance survey of the reserve for observations and the administering of questionnaires to a sample of the tourists. The sample of 50 respondents, representing 10% of the average daily number of tourists received during the period of the survey was used. The study showed that in the last decade tourist inflow has continued to rise. The assessment of the perception of the tourists shows that most travel to Yankari for viewing game, which is the most important attraction. The survey also showed that tourists are satisfied with the park with 42% indicating preference of Yankari over other parks in Nigeria. The study also showed that Yankari could be better if the master plan for its development is fully implemented. The reserve however has a good prospect in view of richness of its resources. Proposals were made on appropriate policies and institutional framework to develop the park to a higher standard comparable to similar ones in other parts of the world which have been reviewed in the study.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p><br/> Title Page</p> <p>Declaration</p> <p>Certification</p> <p>Dedication</p> <p>Acknowledgement</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Table of Content</p>

class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study was carried out to assess environmental impacts of a proposed tankfarm which is to be situated at the Olokola Free Trade Zone in Ondo State (OKFTZ).</p> <p>It encompasses various field sampling which includes soil, air and noise sampling taken from the proposed site. These samples were tested in the laboratory for parameters such as Total Hydro Carbon, pH values, Total Mean Percentage of Organic Matter, Heavy Metal Investigation, cation concentration. The Total Hydro Carbon which ranges from 4.8 to 33.0 milligram per kilogram</p> <p>(mg/kg) in the wet season and 4.0 to 78.5 mg/kg for dry season. The THC is reflective of an unpolluted environment, and it is widely accepted that soils with a hydrocarbon level below 100 mg/kg are considered unpolluted. Heavy metals investigation showed that Iron had the highest mean concentration (2213mg/kg) followed by Zinc (4.82mg/kg) and Copper (3.78mg/kg) for dry season while for wet season, Iron had 2039mg/kg followed by Zinc (8.68mg/kg) and copper (3.0mg/kg). The concentration of the monovalent cation in the soils was generally high. Sodium (Na) concentrations ranged between 2,136 and 7,341mg/kg</p> <p>in the wet season and 6,175 and 10,308 mg/kg in the dry season while potassium (K) ranged between 0.09 and 0.15 mg/kg in the wet season and 0.04 and 0.45mg/kg in the dry season. The high sodium content could be attributed to the proximity</p> <p>of the study area to the ocean. </p> <p>Suspended Particulate Matter Levels for Wet and Dry Season on shows that there are more suspended particulate matter in the dry season as the result indicated a value of 196 µg/m3 against 64µg/m3 in the wet season. Comparing these findings with EGASPIN guidelines for national air quality standards, more air quality monitoring is needed during the dry season as it reaches a high of 196 though it is still within the EGASPIN (Environmental Guidelines and Standards for Petroleum Industries in Nigeria)  limits. Noise measurements showed that the measured levels varied significantly in the different locations</p> <p>monitored and ranged from a low of 55.2dB to a high of 66.7dB, for the dry season and 52.7dB to a high of 67.9dB, for the wet season as compared to the World Bank standard of 45 dB(A) for residential areas during the daytime. It is recommended that environmental performance be monitored regularly to ensure compliance and those measures to be taken where necessary. The OKFTZ site is generally suitable for the proposed bulk fuel storage facility and all environmental risks can be minimized and managed through implementing preventative measures and sound environmental management systems.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Certification     </p> <p>Dedication       </p> <p>Acknowledgement</p> <p>Abstract       </p> <p>Table of Content </p> <p>List of Tables</p> <p>List of Figures </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 Introduction </p> <p>1.2 Objectives of the Project</p> <p>1.3 Scope of the Project  </p> <p>1.4 Justification of the Project </p> <p>1.5 Expected Contribution to Knowledge</p> <p>1.6 About OKFTZ (Olokola Free Trade Zone) </p> <p>CHAPTER TWO:   LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>2.1 Environmental Impact Assessment and the Environments</p> <p>2.2 General Overview of the EIA Process </p> <p>2.3 Steps Involved in EIA </p> <p>2.3.1 Screening </p> <p>2.3.2 Scoping </p> <p>2.3.3 Impact Assessment </p> <p>2.3.4 Mitigation </p> <p>2.3.5 Reporting</p> <p>2.3.6 Reviewing </p> <p>2.3.7 Decision Making</p> <p>2.3.8 Implementation</p> <p>2.4 Importance of Environmental Impact Assessment</p> <p>2.5 General Benefits of EIA and flaws </p> <p>2.6 Environmental Policy </p> <p>2.7 Nigeria Guidelines and Standards </p> <p>2.8.1 National Effluent Limitation Regulation </p> <p>2.8.2 Department of Petroleum Resources </p> <p>2.8.3 Nigeria Petroleum Industry Guidelines</p> <p>2.9 Effluent Standards </p> <p>2.10  Ambient Air Quality </p> <p>2.11  Noise Level   </p> <p>2.12.1  Potential Environmental Impact Analysis</p> <p>2.12.2  Impact Qualification </p> <p>2.12.3  Impact Rating</p> <p>2.12.3.1 Legal/regulatory Requirement (L)</p> <p>2.12.3.2  Risk (R) </p> <p>2.12.3.3  Frequency of Impact (F) </p> <p>2.12.3.4  Importance of Affected Environment Component and Impact (I)</p> <p>2.12.3.5  Public Perception (P) </p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>Materials And Methods</p> <p>3.1  Description Of The Study Area</p> <p>3.1.1 Geology Of The Study Area</p> <p>3.1.2  Local Climate And Meteorology </p> <p>3.2 Samples Collected</p> <p>3.3 Equipments</p> <p>3.4 Sample Preparation</p> <p>3.4.1 Soil</p> <p>3.5 Methods</p> <p>3.5.1  Determination Of Ph</p> <p>3.5.2  Determination Of Exchangeable Cations</p> <p>3.5.3  Temperature</p> <p>3.5.4  Determination Alkalinity</p> <p>3.5.5  Chloride Determination</p> <p>3.5.6  Determination Of Heavy Metals</p> <p>3.5.7 Determination Of Air Quality And Noise</p> <p>3.6 Assessment Methodology</p> <p>3.6.1 Impact Quantification</p> <p>3.6.2 Impact Rating</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>Results And Discussions</p> <p>4.1 Physiochemical Characteristics Of Soil</p> <p>4.1.1 Analysis Of Selected Physiochemical Charateristics Of Soil</p> <p>4.1.2 Analysis Of Selected Heavy Metal Observations</p> <p>4.2 Soil Texture Data </p> <p>4.2.1  Analysis Of Soil Texture</p> <p>4.3 Analysis Of Air Quality And Noise Data</p> <p>4.3.1 Analysis On Air Quality</p> <p>4.3.2 Analysis Of Noise Level</p> <p>4.4 Potential Impacts For The Proposed Tankfarm Facility</p> <p>4.4.1  Impacts On Air Quality </p> <p>4.4.2 Impacts On Noise Level</p> <p>4.4.3 Impacts On Soil Quality </p> <p>4.5 Mitigation And Management Measures</p> <p>4.5.1 Air Quality </p> <p>4.5.2 Noise</p> <p>4.5.3 Soil Quality </p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>Conclusions And Recommendations</p> <p>5.1 Conclusions</p> <p>5.2 Recommendations</p> <p>References</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Environmental Impacts Assessment is an assessment or the analysis of the possible positive or negative impact that a proposed project may have on the environment together consisting of the environmental, social and economic aspects (International Association of Impact Assessment, 2002). Environment Impact Assessment or EIA can also be defined as the study of predicting the effect of a proposed activity/project on the environment. A decision making tool, EIA compares various alternatives for a project and seeks to identify the one which represents the best combination of economic and environmental costs and benefits. EIA systematically examines both beneficial and adverse consequences of the project and ensures that these effects are taken into account during project design. It helps to identify possible environmental effects of the proposed project, proposes measures to mitigate adverse effects and predicts whether there will be significant adverse environmental effects, even after the mitigation is implemented (IAIA , 2002). By considering the environmental effects of the project and their mitigation early in the project planning cycle, environmental assessment has many benefits, such as protection of environment, optimum utilization of resources and saving of time and cost of the project (Wikipedia, 2013).  </p> <p>Environment refers to the totality of natural resources including the intricate interrelations among living and non living things which constitute the ecosystem and biomes (Randall et al; 1987). Webster’s new collegiate dictionary (2012) defined environment as the aggregate of all the external conditions and influences affecting life and development of organisms. Sada and Odemerho (2001) conceive environments as a system within which living organisms interact with the physical elements. Environment is a common property not only of existing stakeholders but also of the future generations (Okonkwo, 2004)</p> <p>A Tankfarm is also known as an oil depot or oil terminal, a facility for storage of petroleum products or petrochemical products from which these products are usually transported to end users for further storage facilities. An oil tankfarm typically has tanks or either above or under the ground and gantries for the discharge of products into road tankers or other vehicles such as barges or pipelines. Tankfarms are usually situated close to oil refineries or locations where marine tankers or vessels containing products discharge their cargo.</p> <p>A Tankfarm is a comparatively unsophisticated facility in that (in most cases) there is no processing or other transformation on site. The products which reach the depot from refinery are in their final form suitable for delivery to customers. Modern Tankfarms comprise the same types of tanks, pipelines and gantries as those in the past and although there is a greater degree of automation in site, there have been significant changes in depot operational activities over time (Wikipedia 2013).</p> <p>One of the key imperatives of Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) is that the operators of a Tankfarm must ensure that products are safely stored and handled. There must be no leakages which could damage the soil or the table water and these forms of undesirable activities gives rise to the analysis of some predictable and unpredictable impacts of Tankfarm to the existing environments and thus brought about the delivery of this project.</p>                                                         \n\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF A PROPOSED TANKFARM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF A PROPOSED TANKFARM", "id": 75}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>The Urban settlement over the world witness great influx of people from the rural area.

Once an environment is free of indecent waste, its impact is usually seen in all aspects of life of individuals having contact with that environment. The focus of this study was to assess the effect of waste disposal practices in Yenagoa metropolis of Bayelsa State. The need for effective management of solid waste is an issue that has required public health attention in various parts of the globe. It is of utmost importance to ensure that solid waste products are properly managed in order to prevent the occurrence of attendant problems associated with poor waste management including water contamination, air contamination, increased prevalence of vector-borne diseases, infection spread etc. Improper waste management methods have been shown to contribute to the decrease in the quality of health of a population as a result of environmental health nuisances that have arisen as a result of these poor waste management methods (Oyebode, 2013; Igbinomwanhia et al., 2014; Awajiogak, 2013). These waste products broadly called Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), includes effluents arising from agricultural, industrial, construction, mining and exploration or commercial activities which could be gaseous, solid, semi-solid or liquid in nature; garbage disposed at refuse dumps, abandoned non-functional cars/equipments and all other materials which are regarded as no longer useful. These waste products are however at certain times are not properly disposed or managed which in turn leads to the occurrence of environmental of environmental and public health challenges (Onwughara et al., 2010; Schübeler et al., 1996; Karija et al., 2013). Municipal solid waste management however remains a major environmental health challenge in Nigeria which has been attributed to indiscriminate roadside refuse disposal, open dumping of waste products, a massive unplanned urbanization trend and growth of the population, absence of actionable guidelines as regards refuse dumping and refuse dumpsites, inadequacy in funding, laxity in the practice of effective waste management as well as absence of organized waste management systems etc (Igbinomwanhia et al., 2014; Abah and Ohimain, 2010; Agwu, 2012). An assessment of the urban waste problem in Nigeria has revealed that Nigerian cities were among the dirtiest cities in the world and that over 80% of Nigerians use waste disposal methods that are not in line with World Health Organization standards (Federal Ministry of Environment, 2002). It is noteworthy to state that the government of Nigeria on its own part has played significant roles in ensuring that this menace is curbed through the enactment of regulations and legislations that ensure the practice of adequate waste management. This is however not enough on its own as the populace must also be educated on how best they can adhere to these laws as non-adherence not just only leads to facing penalties from environmental health agencies but can also lead to deterioration in health as well as deaths. This is an issue that must be addressed round the clock despite the many challenges being faced by the relevant waste management authorities. Environmental health education should be put into play, strict adherence and enforcement of environmental health laws and regulations, provision of adequate waste disposal methods for the populace, timely and proper waste management by relevant authorities, recycling of waste materials etc are some ways by which the prevailing occurrence of poor waste management can be tackled and thus providing a more healthy environment for labour and productivity (Onwughara et al., 2010; Karija et al., 2013; Owoeye and Okojie, 2013; Kafando et al., 2013). Seeing that effective and proper waste management practice is a problem that impacts on the health of individuals in Nigeria, it was necessary to carry this study to assess the waste disposal practices in Yenagoa metropolis of Bayelsa State as it provided a framework for evaluation of waste management efforts and provided areas that needed further attention in order to ensure achievement of effective waste disposal and management in Bayelsa State.The management of solid waste, perhaps, stands as the most visible environmental problem facing the capital and communities of Bayelsa State. The problem is growing daily as a result of increasing urbanization. The solid waste problem is visible in most parts of the communities within the Yenagoa metropolis, on the roads, within the neighbourhoods and around residential buildings. The environment of man lies at the mercy of both natural disaster and negligence on the part of man in the course of controlling the gifts of nature. The later takes the form of dumping solid waste in an uncompromising pattern, that can cause; desert encroachment, erosion, depletion of ozone layer, depletion of natural resources, pollution of land, rivers, the air and generally the environment (Aguwanba,1998). According to Egunlobi (2004), in the early times (pre- colonial days) up till 1970s, the disposal of refuse and other waste did not pose any significant problem. The population was small and enough land was available for assimilation of waste. Solid waste problem started with urban growth, resulted partly from nationalincrease in population and more importantly from immigration. Ndakara (2011) also states that the quantity of such waste depends mainly on location, activity and number of people in the household. However, it was not until the mid- 19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating cholera outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged. Thus the social reformer, Sir, Edwin Chadwick’s 1842 report on “The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population, became influential in securing the passage of the first legislation of waste clearance and disposal, in which he argues for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city’s population. (Barbalace, 2003). Early garbage removal trucks were simply open bodied dump trucks pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first closed body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain. These were soon equipped with “hopper mechanisms” where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The Garwood Load Packer was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor (Herbert, 2007). Mba (2003), noted that no town in Nigeria especially the urban and semi- urban centres of high population density can boast of having found a lasting solution to the problem of filth and huge piles of solid waste, rather the problem continues to assume monstrous dimensions. To urban and city dwellers, public hygiene starts and ends within their immediate surrounding and indeed the city would, take care of itself. The situation has so deteriorated that today the problem of solid waste management has become one of the nation’s most serious environmental problem (Okpala, 2002). Ineffective waste management could rubbish all the resources and efforts put in beautifying the environment. Every year, the government of Nigeria, Bayelsa state inclusive spends billions of naira to roll back malaria, without focusing on some environmental factors such as poor waste management that makes malaria to thrive. Blocked drains provide stagnant water which facilitates the breeding of mosquitoes and other sickness causing germs (Ogadimma, 2011).</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problem of ineffective and inadequate Waste management is a major problem to our society and the world at large, this is because improper waste management has led to the outspread of various diseases and health and environmental hazard.</p> <p>i)             Generation of toxic air and water pollutants, along with mountains of solid andhazardous wastes, which is becoming an overwhelming problem in YenagoaMetropolis.</p> <p>ii)           Strong possibility of a situation where failure to decide where to put waste or how todispose them safely will lead to the close down of some industries and result in wastebeing spread everywhere</p> <p>iii)          The health effects of pollution, toxic waste and other environmental ills of modernsociety becomes a greater threat to man than diseases.</p> <p>1.3 <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of waste management as a panacea to disease prevention and healthy environment in Bayelsa state. Specifically it seeks to:</p> <p>1.   Examine the effectiveness of waste management in Bayelsa state.</p> <p>2.    Examine how proper waste management can prevent disease and sustain healthy environment.</p> <p>3.   To ascertain how effectively managed waste disposal in Bayelsa state</p> <p>4.   To evaluate the consequences of improper waste management in Bayelsa state.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The following questions shall be answered in the course of this essay.</p> <p>i.             What are the implications of an improper waste disposal system?</p> <p>ii.            What is the present state of waste disposal in Bayelsa state?</p> <p>iii.          What are the modern technologies involved in waste management and their long term benefits?</p> <p>iv.          What method can be used to effectively managed waste in Bayelsa state?</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>When Bayelsa State was created in 1996 from the still existing Rivers State, itbecame obvious from inception that the fledgling state will face great challengeson its path to attaining the growth and development that autonomy had bestowedon her.The challenges of waste disposal being experienced in the State Capital City(Yenagoa) is on the increase and at a very fast rate, upon this ills this researchfinds its significance.As Nigeria aims to be amongst the top 20 economies in the world by 2020, it isimperative that issues of waste management be tackled from the state level, andaddressed from city to city.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study covers the effect of refused disposal on human health in Bayelsa state. However the study has some limitation which ranges from:</p> <p><strong>Finance:</strong> finance is a major limitation to the study as resources allocated to the study is limited</p> <p><strong>Time: </strong>time is a major constrain to the research as time allocated to the study is very limited</p> <p><strong>Research material: </strong>availability of research material is a major set back to the scope of the study</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Waste and wastes are unwanted or unusable materials. Waste is any substance which is discarded after primary use, or it is worthless, defective and of no use. Examples include municipal, solidn waste (household trash/refuse), hazardous waste, waste water  (such as sewage which contains bodily wastes (feaces and urine and surface run-off), radioactive waste and others.</p> <p><strong>WASTE MANAGEMENT</strong></p> <p>The collection, transportation, and disposal of garbage, sewage, and other waste products. Waste management encompasses management of all processes and resources for proper handling of waste materials, from maintenance of waste transport trucks and dumping facilities to compliance with health codes and environmental regulations.</p> <p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT</strong></p> <p>This is the combination of all actions taken to reduce the impact of human activities on theenvironment; such actions are specifically geared towards sustainable development.Sustainable development can be describes as a form of development that is able to meet theneeds of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations tomeet their own needs.</p> <p><strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong></p> <p>The word “environment” is of French origin “environner”, meaning to encircle or surround.(Webster, 2015) defined the environment as the conditions that surround someone orsomething: the conditions and influences that affect the growth, health, progress, etc., ofsomeone or something.These are the very things we depend upon on a daily basis e.g. water, food, market, industries,air, plants, and animals etc, the environment is a complexly interwoven system of ecologywhere a simple or drastic change in one aspect can emphatically or continually affect otheraspects.</p> <p><strong>BAYELSA YENAGOA METROPOLIS</strong></p> <p>Yenagoa is the capital city of Bayelsa state, located in the southern part of Nigeria.

It is a statutory approach or device used by the federal government to consolidate and harmonize the diverse tenures prevalent in the country before the promulgation. It aims at ensuring the protection of the rights of all Nigerians to enable them to provide for the sustenance of themselves and their families.<br/> It abolished the age long tradition of private ownership of land in the south and introduced a uniform system of land tenure throughout the country.<br/> Land tenure under this dispensation means that; one cannot have an interest in land beyond the terms granted to him by the statute (usually 99 years) and such interest is renewable on expiration.<br/> The act vests all land comprised in the territory of each state (except land vested in the Federal Government for its agencies) solely in the hands of the military governors of the state who would hold such land in true for the people.<br/> Finally, the promulgation of this Act was as a result of two main factors;<br/> Firstly, was the diversity of customary laws on land tenure and difficulty in applying the various customs of the different peoples.<br/> The second factor was the rampant practice in southern Nigeria with regards to fraudulent sales of land. The same land would be sold to different persons at the same time giving rise to so many litigations.</p> <p>Land being the most universal, most valuable, probably the most controversial assets, the one and the only foundation of all human activities, requires a planned system of holding, control and regulations so as to avoid misuse and abuse of rights thereof. <br/> In the words of Taslim O. Elias, (a renowned Jurist). “The indigenous system does not admit that land can ever be without an owner” indeed, if land (Real property), were to be a “res nullius” (something belonging to none), it will be valueless in the economic sense, there will be no question of compulsory acquisition, purchase, revocation and subsequent compensation. It may not be out of place to suggest that without valid control and regulation, ownership of land may depend purely on the physical strength of an individual or how violent the person can be. Such situation will definitely be anchoretic. <br/> This work therefore unraveled the effects of Land Use Act, 1978 to prospective investors on real property (land), estate surveyors, private individuals etc, particularly in Enugu urban.<br/> Since its promulgation however, the land use Act has been under intense fire as virtually almost every part of it has been criticized. The Act hardly went down well with traditional Nigeria, mainly because of the factors of interest in communal land ownership comprising several dead ancestors, relatively few living members and countless unborn generations. Many of their forefathers and mothers lost their lives in the process of acquiring the lands and were buried there. Unless their bodies and bones are exhumed, it remains a taboo to leave those lands. One therefore observes the existence of several motives and circumstances attracted to land ownership. In traditional Nigeria, many of which are non – economic and therefore cannot assuaged monetarily since the owners do not sale, alienate or part with land as freely or easily as other commodities. <br/> Professionally speaking, land and its attributes, features and components embodies value in encounter.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong><br/> From the above discussions, certain questions might be identified that certainly, needs answers. They include;<br/> 1. Is the land use decree 1978 (now Land Use Act) implemented to its fullest apart from over use of such powers by state governors?<br/> 2. What are the problems associated with the techniques for valuing properties compulsorily acquired for compensation under the act?<br/> 3. What is the effect of the Act on compensation?<br/> 4. What adjustments should be done to the compensation, revocation of rights of occupancy for overriding public interests, allocation of land for Agriculture and grazing sections of this Act?<br/> 5. What should be the appropriate technique for valuing properties compulsory acquired for compensation purposes under the Act?<br/> 6. What should be the appropriate technique for zoning of land and building and valuing properties compulsorily acquired compensation purpose under the Act?<br/> 7.

Four zones of Okpara Avenue, New Haven, Achara Layout and Ogui layout are sampled due the large land mass.<br/> These four zones are where property developments are more pronounced. Although lands within Enugu Urban are revoked by the public bodies for overriding public interest without putting it for what it was revoked for. The scope of the study therefore uses the four zones to represent other areas in Enugu urban where property developments take place.<br/> Such rights of communal land owner and property owners were usurped by the government thereby reducing their rights of occupancy to 99 years lease instead of allodia or absolute ownership.<br/> This research work was highly tideous, though extremely educative. The researcher therefore, encountered constraints during the course of this project especially finance, which made him redistrict the study to certain areas. <br/> Again time factor limited this study as I shared time among the project and other academic work. More so, the commitments of the researcher to the welfare of Estate Management Association (EMA) IMT as the president slightly delayed this work.<br/> The provisions of the Land Use Act are too extensive to be compressed into few pages. For the purpose of this study, only the arrangements of sections and the provisions pertaining to valuation and its effects are covered.<br/> Although the scope of this work was limited by time and finance, the researcher was able to carry out the work to completion.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Effect: effect is defined as a change which is a result or consequence of an action or other cause or cause (something) to happen; bring about.</p> <p><strong>Land:</strong>Land, sometimes referred to as dry land, is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently covered by water. The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat and natural resources. Some life forms (including terrestial plants and terrestial animal have developed from predecessor species that lived in bodies of water.</p> <p>Land use act:An Act to Vest all Land compromised in the territory of each State (except land vested in the Federal government or its agencies) solely in the Governor of the State , who would hold such Land in trust for the people and would henceforth be responsible for allocation of land in all urban areas to individuals resident in the State and to organizations for residential, agriculture, commercial and other purposes while similar powers will with respect to non-urban areas are  conferred on Local Governments.</p> <p><strong>Property:</strong>Property is that which belongs to or with something, whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing. In the context of this article, property is one or more components (rather than attributes), whether physical or incorporeal of a person's estate or so belonging to, as in being owned by, a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society.<br/></p> <p><strong>Development:Economic development</strong> is the process by which a nation improves the economic, political, and social well-being of its people. The term has been used frequently by economists, politicians, and others in the 20th and 21st centuries. The concept, however, has been in existence in the West for centuries. Modernization, Westernization and especially Industrialization are other terms people have used while discussing economic development. Economic development has a direct relationship with the environment and environmental issues.</p> <p><strong>Property development:</strong> Property development includes a range of activities from the purchase of land, development of facilities and buildings to meet customers' requirements. It also includes either the sale or lease of the land of properties on completion. Developers generally coordinate the activities converting plans, needs and ideas into property.</p> <p><strong>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows Chapter one is concern with the introduction, which consist of the (overview, of the study), statement of problem, objectives of the study, research question, significance or the study, research methodology, definition of terms and historical background of the study.

Almost every day in all the urban and rural markets in our county Nigeria, animals are slaughtered while the meats are sold to the public for consumption. Meat wastes sprang up from killing and also dehairing, paunch handling, rendering, trimming, processing and clean-up operations. That is the reason we will say that abattoir wastes often contain blood, fat, organic and inorganic solids, and salts and chemicals added during processing operations.</p> <p>In Nigeria, it is required that the Food and Drug companies that are in charge of importing livestock products and those produced locally meet the needs spelled out under the relevant Nigerian Standard for Meat and Meat Products. Despite the fact that Nigerian laws provide butchers and importers of meat with rules and regulations that ensure high safety and quality standards as well as a an all-embracing procedure which brings their activities into compliance with the law, making the law active appears to be a huge problem. Presently, activities at theBodjija and Akinyeleabattoir meet only 210 percent of the requirements pointed under the major standard for meat production and none of the storage requirements. The activities of the Abattoir are meant to regain the suitable and eatable portions of slaughtered animals for human consumption. In the process, important quantities of waste materials(organic and inorganic solids) are brought into existence. The solid waste comprises chiefly of bones, undigested ingest and occasionally aborted fetuses while the liquids includes of blood, urine, water, dissolved solids and gut contents. A good number of researchers point out that slaughterhouse activities are responsible for the pollution of surface and underground waters in addition to the quality of air which indirectly affect the health of residents living within the vicinity of abattoirs. Beside these, primary producers in the affected water bodies October also be destroyed by pollutants, which October directly or indirectly affect fish yield, accompanied by serious consequences on human diet. Inadequate discharge of blood and animal faeces into streams October cause a huge oxygenreduction as well as nutrientover enrichment of the receiving system which could cause increased rate of toxin accumulation (Nwachukwu 2014). Humanbeings October also be affected through sudden increase of water borne diseases and other respiratory and chest diseases. Abattoir waste disposal in many developing countries likeNigeria, especially in the Bodija and Akinyele market has been a very serious challenge over the years. In most cases, waste materials are disposed of without regard to sound environmental management practices; this makes them harmful to humans and other terrestrial and aquatic life. Numerous past and present research works from Nigeria and other developing nations show that many abattoirs in the respective countries either deposit waste materials in the direct environsor dispose their wastes directly into water bodies. Some also argued that the practice is majorly due to lack of or inadequate waste recovery and treatment facilities. In Nigeria, increasing demand for animal products especially meat has led to increase in the volume of abattoir waste generation and theconcerns about this situation is growing rapidly. An enquiry into activities of the main abattoir in the Bodija and Akinyele metropolis showed that liquid waste from the area was highly polluted, with all the measured parameters exceeding acceptable standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Nigeria. The studyalso revealed that residents within the community where the Abattoirhouse is located complained of bad smell from the liquid, pollution of their water sources and frequent sudden increase of different diseases among others. There has been a great concern about the way in which carcasses are prepared and subsequently handled en route to the markets.</p> <p><strong>1.2. Statement of the general problem</strong></p> <p>Environmental pollution is a huge threat to man’s physical surrounding, his health (Fereidoun et al, 4007) and those of other living species (EPHA, 4009). It therefore attracts scholarly attention since pollution problem is an exceedingly difficult one to solve (Robertson, 1987) especially in a developing country. Man damages the environment either intentionally by design or unintentionally by accident. Whatever the source of damages, he bears the primary consequences which are evident in the daily damages and deterioration of the environment and overall threat to his general well being. Schaefer and Lamn (19910) recalled the impossibility of examining all environmental problems in detail, but summarized them into three crucial types which are, air pollution, water pollution and contamination of land.</p> <p>The general problem of abattoir waste generated from markets has caused a lot of health hazards to the society; chief among these hazards is air pollution. The constant dumping of abattoir waste without adequate treatment in our markets has led to the outbreak of diseases in the society.</p> <p><strong>1.3.

Various methods of waste disposal exist and this study assessed the waste man- agement practices among residents of Owerri State, Imo state, Nigeria. It was a descriptive cross sectional study in which a total of 282 residents of Owerri State were selected by multi- stage sampling technique and studied using self and interviewer administered questionnaires. The results showed that 90% of respondents were aware of waste management while 97.5% had posi- tive attitude towards it. The major types of waste generated from households were food residues (97.1%) and vegetable products (95.4%). Also poor waste management practices among residents include open dumping, practiced by 66.3% of the residents and burning as practiced by 62.4% of respondents. The commonest means of waste transport to final disposal site was by wheel barrow. Gender and educational status of respondents significantly influenced their knowledge, attitude and practice of waste management (<em>p </em>&lt; 0.05). Good waste management is pivotal to sustainable healthy living conditions in any environment. The residents of Owerri need health education, reg- ular supply of refuse collection facilities and designated final dump sites. These will encourage strict adherence to proper and appropriate waste management practices among them.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Waste management is the process of collecting, transporting, processing or disposing, managing and monitoring of waste materials. The term usually relates to materials produced by human activity and the process is generally undertaken to reduce their effect on health, the environment or aesthetics. The major focus of this research is on waste management practices as obtains in the urban developing nations. Waste includes all items that people no longer have any use for, which they either intend to get rid of or have already discarded and these include: packing items garden waste, old paints containers, vegetables, metals etc. Poor waste management has been a major problem to human health and existence, affecting both rural and urban areas. A clean environment influences good health and good health further affects the productivity of man. Therefore, it can be said that a good and clean environment invariably affects the wealth and economic status of the nation.</p> </div> <p>There are various methods of waste disposal including: land filling: which involves burying the waste in abandoned or unused quarries, mining voids or burrow pits and covering it with layers of soil; incineration: involves subjection of solid organic wastes to combustion at a very high temperature of about 10,000 so as to convert them into residue or gaseous products; open dumping: whereby dumping can be done on open land or sea; composting: this is an aerobic, biological process of degradation of biodegradable organic matter; hog feeding: this involves feeding animals like pigs with left over materials of waste; mechanical destructor: this involves the use of machines to destroy waste materials. Recycling of waste which means taking waste materials and transforming them into raw products, results in saving natural resources, saving energy, reducing disposal costs, reducing harmful emission to air and water, saving money and creating jobs.</p> <p>Awareness and knowledge of waste disposal is influenced by many factors as pointed out in a work done by Margaret Banga on household knowledge, attitudes and practices in solid waste segregation and recycling in urban Kampala. It indicated that the participation in solid waste separation activities depended on the level of awareness of recycling activities in the area, household income, educational level and gender. Ayodeji Ifegbesan studied the waste management awareness knowledge and practices of secondary school teachers in Ogun state and it showed that teachers were aware and knowledgeable about waste management even though they possessed negative waste management practices. There seems to be appreciable awareness and know- ledge about waste disposal among people in Nigeria but most of them are only aware of the crude and traditional methods and are oblivious of the modern methods such as incineration and recycling. The attitude of people towards waste management can be affected by their level of knowledge and awareness of waste management and it has been reported that homes with waste bins engage more in proper way of storing waste than homes without waste bins. A Nigerian study about attitude towards recycling and waste management showed no significant effect of gender, employment and educational statuses, on willingness to recycle.</p> <p>Human wastes are great contributors of environmental health hazards. Poor waste practices lead to contamination of edible products thereby increasing the burden of infection and diseases among the citizens. About 1.3 billion tons of waste are generated globally, 0.035% being generated by Nigeria. About 85.8% of Nigerian waste is generated by households. It is estimated that an average Nigerian in the urban or rural areas generates about 0.49 kg of solid waste per day with household and commercial centres contributing almost 10% of total urban waste burden. Of this about two thirds of wastes are dumped indiscriminately on the streets and in the drains thus posing serious environmental health hazards.</p> <p>Furthermore poor waste management and disposal could lead to various diseases, infections and infestation and these include fly transmitted diseases like myiasis, diarrhea, typhoid, cholera; rodent transmitted disease like Lassa fever plague, leptospirosis, murine typhus; mosquito borne diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, filariasis, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Also gases like methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide and mercury vapor emitted from land fill site can constitute air contaminants and pollution. Another problem people face in proper waste management and disposal is the absence of storage facilities (waste bins with tight fitted covers) in some houses which lead to littering of refuse around the house, worsened by the absence of drainage systems in such houses. Even where the drains are available they are either constructed without a gradient or not properly maintained as they are clogged or blocked with sand or other debris thus preventing se- wage drainage.</p> <p>Against the background of these identified problems, this research further assessed waste management practices, factors that influenced these practices and provided solution to avert/prevent the complications which arose from poor waste management. This research helped to ascertain the level of awareness, knowledge and attitude of people towards waste management practices. It also helped in finding out the prevailing methods of household waste collection and disposal system adopted by Owerri State Council. It is hoped that the find- ings will enrich the reservoir of knowledge necessary to inform appropriate refuse management and environ- mental policy for the country.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>Waste management is one of the big challenges facing most urban cities in the world. Based on research in Nigeria (Awortwi, 2003 &amp; Obrih-Opareh, 2003) and Kenya 4 (Karanja, 2005 &amp; Mwangi, 2003) they pull together the evidence with respect to Solid waste and urban management in Africa. Besides private enterprises, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) may also play a role in activities like solid waste collection, sanitation and public awareness programs. Despite the initiatives to privatize solid waste management, the problem of uncollected solid waste stays a threat to the population and to the environment in general. Imo state is among cities which facing the problem of solid waste management which lead to view our city that are unorganized or uncontrolled. Management of solid waste all over the world is one of the first important priorities to the protection of community health as well as the environment pollution. Solid waste comprises all the waste arising from human and animal activities that are normally solid and are discarded as useless or un wanted disposal (Tchobanoglous, et al. 1993). The vehicles which collecting the solid waste, instead of collecting the solid waste they just distributing the waste around the city when they are on the way to dispose. This situation is too critical to vehicles of Imo state council which lead to distribute the outbreak diseases like cholera, tuberculosis and other related diseases which affect the human resources and environmental of the country. This study will analyse the whole process of waste management in Imo state.</p> <p><strong>1.3   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>To reach the main objective, there will be some question to be considered, they are:</p> <p>1.        How is the current condition of household waste in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.        How is the waste management policy in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.        What is an effective means to reducing waste in Nigeria at the present stage? Is an economic measure is the effective means to waste reduction: About its theoretical ground.</p> <p><strong>1.4        </strong><strong>RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>1. To identify the current condition of household waste in Nigeria.</p> <p>2. To identify the waste management policy in Nigeria?</p> <p>3. To know the effective means to reducing waste in Nigeria at the present stage </p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Findings from this study will provide information of analysis of problems facing in Imo state at Imo state m City Council on solid waste management process. The study will also help the government to make policies and plan programmes for state solid waste management proces; it will also help people to have a better insight and understanding on the optimization of state solid waste management process. Furthermore, the study will help to develop educational training programs to educate people about the importance of minimizing the cost of the state solid waste management process. Moreover, the study will act as the stepping stone to the minimization of state budget to solid waste management system and will be useful to the private contractors on planning their operations for solid waste collection. Lastly the study will help state planners to quantify the costs for state solid waste collections so as to opt for optimal one.</p> <p><strong>1.6        </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> Coverage for this study involves household waste. But in fact there are other types of waste generated in Imo state. For example liquid and gaseous waste is the part of waste produced in the city. This study therefore provides only solid waste management issues. Conclusions and suggestions may not benefit any desired improvement on other types of waste other than solid waste.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Limitation of study</strong></p> <p> Some residents refused to open their gates or attend to the interviewers perhaps because of the precarious security situation in the state at that time. This setback was however largely circumvented by selection of well-known indigenes as guides for the interviewers.</p> <p><strong>1.8   ORGANIZATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Thesis consists of five main chapters:</p> <p>Chapter one, Introduction: This chapter explains about my background of the study, research questions and objectives.</p> <p>Chapter two, literature review: This chapter explains about framework of the study, conceptual review and empirical review.</p> <p>Chapter three, shows the method of data collection and method of data analysis used in the research work.</p> <p>Chapter four, data presentation and analysis while chapter five gives out the necessary recommendations and conclusion.</p>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE MANAGEMENT OF GARBAGE COLLECTION AND WASTE DISPOSAL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF THE MANAGEMENT OF GARBAGE COLLECTION AND WASTE DISPOSAL", "id": 80}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/></p> <p>For thousands of years, sand and gravel have been used in the construction of roads and buildings.

Today, demand for sand and gravel continues to increase. Mining operators, in conjunction with cognizant resource agencies, must work to ensure that sand mining is conducted in a responsible manner.</p> <p>Excessive instream sand-and-gravel mining causes the degradation of rivers. Instream mining lowers the stream bottom, which may lead to bank erosion. Depletion of sand in the streambed and along coastal areas causes the deepening of rivers and estuaries, and the enlargement of river mouths and coastal inlets. It may also lead to saline-water intrusion from the nearby sea. The effect of mining is compounded by the effect of sea level rise. Any volume of sand exported from streambeds and coastal areas is a loss to the system.</p> <p>Excessive instream sand mining is a threat to bridges, river banks and nearby structures. Sand mining also affects the adjoining groundwater system and the uses that local people make of the river.</p> <p>Instream sand mining results in the destruction of aquatic and riparian habitat through large changes in the channel morphology. Impacts include bed degradation, bed coarsening, lowered water tables near the streambed, and channel instability. These physical impacts cause degradation of riparian and aquatic biota and may lead to the undermining of bridges and other structures. Continued extraction may also cause the entire streambed to degrade to the depth of excavation.</p> <p>Sand mining generates extra vehicle traffic, which negatively impairs the environment. Where access roads cross riparian areas, the local environment may be impacted.</p> <p>Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world’s use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone. This production represents enough concrete to build a wall 27 metres high by 27 metres wide around the equator. Aggregates also contribute to 90% of asphalt pavements and 80% of concrete roads and the demand for aggregates stems from a wide range of other sectors, including production of glass, electronics and aeronautics. Added to this are all the aggregates used in land reclamation, shoreline developments and road embankments (for which the global statistics are unavailable), plus the 180 million tonnes of sand used in industry. This sand and gravel are mined world-wide and account for the largest volume of solid material extracted globally and the highest volume of raw material used on earth after water (about 70-80% of the 50 billion tons material mined/year). Formed by erosive processes over thousands of years, they are now being extracted at a rate far greater than their renewal.</p> <p>Despite our increasing dependence on the colossal quantities of sand and gravel being used and the significant negative impact that their extraction has on the environment, this issue has been mostly ignored by policy makers and remains largely unknown by the general public. Indeed, the absence of global data on aggregates mining makes environmental assessment very difficult and has contributed to the lack of awareness about this issue. As a consequence, a large discrepancy exists between the magnitude of the problem and public awareness of it.</p> <p>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The impact of sand and gravel dredging or mining on the environment is enormous; this is so because when they see is dredge Excessive in stream sand-and-gravel mining causes the degradation of rivers. … Any volume of sand exported from streambeds and coastal areas is a loss to the system. Excessive in stream sand mining is a threat to bridges, river banks and nearby structures.</p> <p>With advancement in technology and infrastructural development, the need for sand and gravel is on the high side, and dredging happens to be the only solution to meet this needs. However if dredging and is not control it impact on the infrastructure can be very fatal.</p> <p>1.3  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The main objective of this study was to ascertain the impact of sand and gravel dredging on environment. However at the completion of the study, the researcher seeks to achieve the following objectives:</p> <ol><li>The impact of gravel dredging on the Lagos bar beach coastal area</li> <li>The impact of sand dredging on Nigerian waters</li> </ol> <ul><li>To ascertain the consequences of gravel dredging in coastal area</li> </ul> <ol><li>The challenges of dredging on Nigeria coastal area</li> </ol> <p>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>For the successful completion of these studies, the following research question was formulated:</p> <ol><li>What is the impact of dredging on Lagos coastal area?</li> <li>What is the impact of sand dredging on Nigerian waters emphasis on Lagos coastal area?</li> </ol> <ul><li>What are the consequences of gravel dredging on infrastructural development in Lagos coastal area?</li> </ul> <ol><li>To what extent has dredging affect the infrastructural development of the region?</li> </ol> <p>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>It is conceived that at the completion of the studies, the findings will be beneficial to the environmental agency and coastal guard who is saddle with the responsibility of protecting the region, the study will also be of benefit to the NIMASA who are responsible for protection of Nigerian water ways.</p> <p>Finally, the study will also be useful to academia, teachers, lecturers, researchers and the general public</p> <p>1.6   SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDIES</p> <p>The scope of this studies covers the impact of sand and gravel dredging on Lagos coastal area, however, the studies have some constrain which are:</p> <ol><li>a) AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL: The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study</li> <li>b) TIME: The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher have to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.</li> <li>c) FINANCE: The finance available for the research work does not allow for wider coverage as resources are very limited as the researcher has other academic bills to cover.</li> </ol> <p> 1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>DREDGING</p> <p>Dredging is an excavation activity usually carried out underwater, in shallow seas or freshwater areas with the purpose of gathering up bottom sediments and disposing of them at a different location. This technique is often used to keep waterways navigable. It is also used as a way to replenish sand on some public beaches, where sand has been lost because of coastal erosion. Fishing dredges are used as a technique for catching certain species of edible clams and crabs.</p> <p>SAND</p> <p>Sand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. It is defined by size, being finer than gravel and coarser than silt. Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e. a soil containing more than 85% sand-sized particles by mass.</p> <p>The composition of sand varies, depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), usually in the form of quartz. The second most common type of sand is calcium carbonate, for example aragonite, which has mostly been created, over the past half billion years, by various forms of life, like coral and shellfish. For example, it is the primary form of sand apparent in areas where reefs have dominated the ecosystem for millions of years like the Caribbean.</p> <p>GRAVEL</p> <p>Gravel is composed of unconsolidated rock fragments that have a general particle size range and include size classes from granule– to boulder-sized fragments. Gravel is categorized by the Udden-Wentworth scale into granular gravel (2 to 4 mm or 0.079 to 0.157 in) and pebble gravel (4 to 64 mm or 0.2 to 2.5 in). One cubic metre of gravel typically weighs about 1,800 kg (or a cubic yard weighs about 3,000 pounds).</p> <p>Gravel is an important commercial product, with a number of applications. Many roadways are surfaced with gravel, especially in rural areas where there is little traffic. Globally, far more roads are surfaced with gravel than with concrete or tarmac; Russia alone has over 400,000 km (250,000 mi) of gravel roads.[1] Both sand and small gravel are also important for the manufacture of concrete</p> <p>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows</p> <p>Chapter one is concern with the introduction, which consist of the (overview, of the study), statement of problem, objectives of the study, research question, significance or the study, research methodology, definition of terms and historical background of the study.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), malaria transmission in Nigeria is abysmally high with over 76% of the population reporting more than 1 case per 1,000 populations annually. There was a less than 50% decrease in projected incidence of malaria from 2000–2015. Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo account for more than 35% of the global total of estimated malaria deaths.</p> <p>Malaria is principally caused by protozoa (<em>Plasmodium species</em>) and is transmitted through the bite of an infected female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito (Mwangangi et al., 2013). Within the tropics and sub-tropics, human malaria is seen to be the most wide spread vector-borne disease (Ahmad et al., 2011). Available statistics have documented that malaria is highly endemic in Nigeria with over 90% of the populace at risk of infection. It is the prime cause of 60% outpatient consultation for all age groups and at least half of the Nigerian populace are exposed to at least one bout of malaria attack every year (Idowu J., 2012).</p> <p>An integrative approach has been recommended to mitigate the spread of malaria parasites. One of such strategy or approach is the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) through a combination of biological and chemical methods<strong>.</strong> It is aimed at improving ecological soundness and sustainability for the control of vector borne diseases, improve efficacy and cost effectiveness (Zacchaeus and Amadi, 2012). From a triad perspective which includes the agent, host and environment, researchers and scholars have encouraged the source reduction, elimination and eradication of mosquitoes breeding sites by concentrating on the environment. These tend to be essential because, the proliferation of mosquitoes continually perpetuate the transmission of malaria. So, it can be postulated that if the sources of mosquitoes breeding sites is eradicated or eliminated, malaria would be drastically reduced. This implies that good environmental sanitation practices could help mitigate malaria transmission, promote healthiness and improve quality of life of the populace.</p> <p> In its modern concept, environment includes not only water, air and soil but also the social and economic conditions under which we live (Park, 2011). The key to man‟s health lies largely in his environment. In fact, much of man‟s ill-health can be traced to adverse environmental factors such as water, soil and air pollution, poor housing conditions, presence of animal reservoir and insect vectors of diseases which pose threats to man‟s health. Often, man is responsible for the pollution of his environment through urbanization, industrialization and other human activities. </p> <p>According to the National Sanitation Foundation of USA, the word sanitation is defined as a „„way of life that is expressed in the clean home, farm, business, neighborhoods and community (Park, 2011). Also, World Health Organization (WHO) defines sanitation as the provision of facilities and services for the safe disposal of human urine and faeces (UNICEF AND WHO, 2012).</p> <p>Environmental hazards are responsible for about a quarter of the total burden of disease worldwide and as much as 30% in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. As many as 13 million deaths can be prevented every year by making our environments healthier. These facts and figures highlight the impact of environmental factors on public health. More than 2.4 billion people in the world currently lack access to adequate sanitation and are forced to dispose of their excreta in unimproved and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffer from this, lack most basic human needs and also tend to be victims of poverty, ill health and an overall poor quality of life (WHO, 2013). </p> <p>In developing countries like Nigeria, the main diseases of the environment are diarrhoeal disease, lower respiratory infections, unintentional injuries, and malaria. In children under the age of five, one third of all disease is caused by the environmental factors such as unsafe water and air pollution (WHO, 2010). The poor state of food sanitation in the country has been shown to play a significant role in the etiology of food borne diseases. One of the most significant diseases that arise from poor sanitation is diarrhea. Deaths resulting from diarrhea are estimated to be between 1.6 and 2.5 million every year (WHO, 2012). National records show that every year, about six hundred thousand (600,000) episodes of diarrhoea occur in children under the age of five (Alabi, 2010). </p> <p>Similarly, there have been increasing numbers of cases of cholera over the years. From January to December 2010, Nigeria reported 41,787 cases including 1,716 deaths from 222 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 18 States of the country. The most affected states were Borno, Bauchi and Katsina. In addition to the disease burden, Nigeria loses about N455 billion annually which is equivalent to 1.3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), due to poor sanitation as reported by water and sanitation program of the World Bank (Vanguard 2013). Most of the affected are young children below the ages of five. Other diseases that are caused by poor sanitation include schistosomiasis, trachoma, soil transmitted helminthiases, and malaria (WHO, 2013).</p> <p>One of the essential public health care elements is provision of safe drinking water and sanitation. However, deposition of faecal matter near homes, contamination of sources of drinking water (sometimes caused by poorly designed or maintained sewage system), dumping of refuse and sweeping into the gutters, defecating and disposing of faeces by the street corners and waterways and selling of food stuffs and cooked food by the road side are all unwholesome practices that pose potential risk to the development of diseases. Water quantity is as important as water quality. Washing of hands after defecation and before preparing food is of particular importance in reducing disease transmission, as has been demonstrated by Nigeria‟s recent control over Ebola Viral Disease. Poor housing also contributes to poor environment health and its consequent input in the health of the urban dwellers. Measures for the prevention of cholera mostly consist of providing clean water and proper sanitation to populations who do not yet have access to basic services. Health education and good food hygiene are equally important. </p> <p>The environmental sanitation-related diseases exacer-bate poverty by diminishing productivity and household income. In addition, the national cost of lost productivity, reduced educational potential and huge curative health costs constitute a major drain on the local and national economy. Besides, a dirty environment with its attendant health consequences, prevailing in most of our cities, can discourage tourists/investors and undermine the economic benefit of tourism to the country. Consequently, wide-ranging actions are required to solve Environmental Sanitation problems in order to reduce and avert their adverse health, economic and developmental effects.</p> <p>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Inadequate sanitation is a major cause of disease world-wide and improving sanitation is known to have a significant beneficial impact on health both in households and across communities. The word 'sanitation' also refers to the maintenance of hygienic conditions through services such as garbage collection and waste-water disposal. In addition, environmental sanitation according to World Health Organization is the control of all those factors in man‟s physical environment which exercise or may exercise a deleterious effect on his physical development, health and survival. It could also be seen as the principle and practice of effecting healthful and hygienic conditions in the environment to promote public health and welfare, improve quality of life and ensure a sustainable environment (Alabi, 2010). The essential components of environmental sanitation include: solid waste management; medical waste management; excreta and sewage management; food sanitation; sanitary inspection of premises; market and abattoir sanitation; adequate potable water supply; school sanitation; pest and vector control; management of urban drainage; control of reared and stray animals; disposal of the dead animals; weed and vegetation control; hygiene education and promotion. </p> <p>In most developing countries adequate environmental sanitation has not been strictly adhered to. For example in some parts of Nigeria, living with waste as part of the natural environment has become a way of life. Although there has been a remarkable improvement from what it used to be in the late eighties/early nineties, there is still much to be done as Lagos, our “Nigerian Centre of Excellence”, has been depicted a vast slum (Alabi, 2010). In the United States, slum is often used to refer to marginalized neighborhoods, but in developing countries, it usually means a settlement built in or near a city by residents themselves, without official authorization or regulation. Such housing units are typically substandard, and the infrastructure and services range from non-existent to improvised. Therefore, the study focuses on the assessment of the effectiveness if environmental sanitation in the control of Malaria in Abeokuta metropolis. </p> <p>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY      </p> <p>The general objective is to carry out an assessment of the effectiveness of environmental sanitation in the control of malaria, using Abeokuta metropolis as a case study. The specific objectives are:</p> <p>1.     To ascertain if inhabitants of Abeokuta metropolis know the implications of indiscriminate waste disposal in their environment.</p> <p>2.     To find out the level of efficiency in the control and management of waste in Abeokuta metropolis.</p> <p>3.     To know the rate of malaria infection among inhabitants of Abeokuta metropolis.</p> <p>4.     To investigate if inhabitants of Abeokuta metropolis adopt an effective environmental sanitation.</p> <p>5.     To examine the effect of environmental sanitation on the spread of malaria among inhabitants of Abeokuta metropolis.</p> <p>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>The relevant research questions related to this study are:</p> <p>1.     Do inhabitants of Abeokuta metropolis know the implications of indiscriminate waste disposal in their environment?</p> <p>2.     What is the level of efficiency in the control and management of waste in Abeokuta metropolis?</p> <p>3.     What is the rate of malaria infection among inhabitants of Abeokuta metropolis?</p> <p>4.     Do inhabitants of Abeokuta metropolis adopt an effective environmental sanitation?</p> <p>5.     What is the effect of environmental sanitation on the spread of malaria among inhabitants of Abeokuta metropolis?</p> <p>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  </p> <p>Considering the significant of the environment on the control and prevention of malaria, this study was aimed at assessing environmental sanitation practices on malaria prevention and control bin Abeokuta metropolis.

It gives the background to the study, statement to the problem, research questions, scope and the significance of the study, definition of terms and organization of the study. </p><p>  1.1 Background to the study  </p> <p>Solid waste management practices are essential component of environmental infrastructure in human settlements. These practices encompass all activities undertaken from the point of waste generation up to the final disposal. In most of African urban areas, solid waste management is ultimately a responsibility of Municipal Councils while most cases of rural areas the wastes are handled and disposed at the household level (Frank, 2006). Solid Waste Management (SWM) is major environmental issues particularly in municipalities of many developing countries that has been suffering from environmental problems. Alamgir, Donald, Roehl and Ahsan (2005) assert that urban population growth and economic development should be considered key issues for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation. Increasing unplanned urbanization along with user’s mindset of ‘out of sight out of mind’ of wastes is one of the factors that make the production of solid waste to increase and though intensifying environmental pressures including unorganized waste disposal in many municipalities. In many cases, the, SWM is found to be a major concern for the municipalities and towns of many countries and Nigeria is not an exception (ADB, 2012). </p> <p>Waste segregation is an act of dividing waste into dry and wet. Dry waste includes hard materials such as wood and related products, metals and glass and so on. Wet waste typically refers to liquid or organic waste usually generated by eating establishments and are heavy in weight due to dampness. </p> <p>Waste generation is increasing, while a sizeable portion of it is disposed on improperly located and operated dumpsites, resulting in dire impacts on environment and health. In addition, Mtey (2005) and Vincent (2000) report that between one-third and one-half of the solid waste generated within most cities in low and middle-income countries is not collected. They usually end up as illegal dumps on streets, open spaces and wetland; and the consequences to have never been favorable to flora and fauna. The Ministry of Infrastructure further reports that solid waste management needs to be reinforced through national policy and regulatory framework to addresses environmental issues. </p> <p>Accordingly, Abuja town’s waste contains still 70 percent of organic, biodegradable waste and in rural areas the portion of waste reach more than 95 percent. Waste sorting, composting and recycling activities have been at the very beginning and until 2015 and yet Nigeria has started to invest in environmentally safe landfills. The operating dumpsite receives about 400 tons per day of solid, not sorted waste or 140,000 tons per year (MININFRA, 2013). Deep seated fires, methane explosions, landslides and leakages threatening rivers and groundwater are some of the common problems of such basic dumpsites as environmental threats (Hogan, 2004). The current thinking is that poor waste management reflects largely the failure of the existing institutions to adequately address the waste problems (Yekeen, 2010). Any initiative to build capacity by urban institutions has to become attractive and conducive to environmental safeguard. Capacity needs to be weighed and understood at all level, formal and informal, to aid capacity building and then capacity assessment that is concerned with identifying existing capacity and what additional capacity is required to get things done (NUDB, 2008; Yekeen, 2010). </p><p>  1.2 Statement of the problem  </p> <p>The management of solid waste stands as the most visible environment problem facing the country Nigeria and is attaining a worrisome dimension with urbanization increment rate. Despite the rapid growth of its population, areas such as Abuja have never had any clear Master plan to re-organize the planning and settlement since colonial era. This has put pressure on the infrastructure which has resulted in many complex problems regarding settlement notably waste management, where the solid waste problem is visible in most parts of the area’s urban centers; on the roads, within the neighborhoods and around residential buildings and in different places of the urban areas. Failure to address waste management related issues is expected to lead to numerous social and environmental contaminations. </p><p>  1.3 Purpose of the study </p> <p>The purpose of this study was to assess solid waste segregation as a strategy for improved waste management in Abuja.</p><p>  1.4 Specific objectives  </p> <ol><li> <p>To establish the status of the existing solid waste collection, transportation and disposal practices in Abuja.</p> </li> <li> <p>To examine magnitude solid waste management problems in Abuja. </p> </li> <li> <p>To examine the challenges of solid waste segregation in Abuja.</p> </li> <li> <p>To design strategies to improve solid waste segregation challenges in Abuja. </p> </li> </ol> <p> 1.5 Research questions  </p> <p>In order to achieve the above objectives, the following research questions were used: </p> <ol><li> <p>What is the status of the existing solid waste collection, transportation and disposal practices in Abuja?</p> </li> <li> <p>What are the magnitude solid waste management problems in Abuja? </p> </li> <li> <p>What are the challenges of solid waste segregation in Abuja?</p> </li> <li> <p>What are design strategies to overcome solid waste segregation challenges in Abuja? </p> </li> </ol> <p> 1.6 Significance of the study  </p> <p>To a large extent, solid waste management efficiency depends on the way different actors understand the danger and the good of maintaining environment safe and their capacity but also the commitment of public and private sectors as well as the involvement and participation of the communities themselves in supporting the whole concept. It also depends on the useful information and lessons from current best practices in the provision of this important service. Such information and lessons can be obtained only through research and studies; hence this research can assist in the improvement and performance of solid waste management in the urban settlements and to identify opportunities for future strategic development in the field of solid waste management. Particularly, this study is useful to the different stakeholders including planners, administrators and private waste collectors, and in one way or the other contributes to future policy interventions in solid waste management sector of the city of Abuja and Nigeria at large. </p><p>  1.7 Scope of the study  </p> <p>The study was based on solid waste segregation as a method for improving waste management in Abuja; looking at practices from the generation up to the disposal. It examined solid waste collection, transportation and final disposal by criticizing magnitude problems of solid waste management and then designs the strategies of how challenges could be overcome as the increase of solid waste production is considerable and can be one of environmental considerations. </p><p> 1.8 Definition of key terms  Wastes  </p> <p>This study uses the definition by UNEP (2002) which defines wastes as substances or objects, which are disposed or are intended to be disposed or are required to be disposed by the provisions of national law. This definition is also in congruence with what Mugambwa and Kizito (2009); and Mukisa (2009) use that wastes refer to items, materials or substances which individuals consider useless at a given time and place. Usually, the definition of waste depends on types or categories and characteristics of waste under consideration. Some of the dominant types of waste include: municipal waste, solid waste, hazardous waste and electronic waste. </p><p> Solid waste  </p> <p>For the purpose of this study, solid waste are referred to as garbage; they are organic and inorganic waste materials that are normally solid produced by households, commercial, institutional and industrial activities that have lost value in sight of the initial users. </p><p> Municipal solid waste  </p> <p>The study will use the definition by Schubeler (1996); Cointreau-Levine and Coad (2000) in which municipal solid waste refers to refuse from households, non-hazardous solid waste from industrial, commercial and institutional establishments, market waste, yard waste and street sweepings but excluding excreta, except when it is mixed with solid waste. It is however necessary to note that in developing countries, it becomes difficult or even impractical to put a line between excreta and solid waste. In many instances, solid waste mixes with excreta to the extent of being potentially hazardous to human health (Schubeler 1996). </p><p> Solid waste management  </p> <p>This study defines solid waste management as practices used for collection, transportation, processing, recycling or disposal of garbage (Mugambwa and Kizito, 2009). It ought to be appreciated that waste management practices differ for developed and developing countries, for urban and rural areas, and for residential and industrial producers. The volumes and types of solid waste in the different sources of waste justify the difference in the waste management practices. It therefore implies that the methods appropriate in one setting may be different from another setting. Felix (2010) points out some key elements of Solid Waste Management as waste generation, waste storage, collection and transportation. </p> <p><strong>1.9 Organization of the study</strong></p> <p>The study is divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the study’s introduction and gives a background to the study. Chapter two reviews related and relevant literature. The chapter three gives the research methodology while the chapter four gives the study’s analysis and interpretation of data. The study concludes with chapter five which deals on the summary, conclusion and recommendation.</p>                                                         \n\nSOLID WASTE SEGREGATION AS A STRATEGY FOR IMPROVED WASTE MANAGEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOLID WASTE SEGREGATION AS A STRATEGY FOR IMPROVED WASTE MANAGEMENT", "id": 83}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>SOLID WASTE SEGREGATION AS A STRATEGY FOR IMPROVED WASTE MANAGEMENT</strong></p> <p><br/></p><p>  CHAPTER ONE   1.0 Introduction  </p> <p>This chapter introduces the research study.
