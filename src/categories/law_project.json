[{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The laws which govern employment occupy a position of considerable importance in any modern society. This is so because of the tremendous contributions which workers can make to national growth and development, as well as the general well-being of the nation’s citizenry. Labour law has a vital role to play in the mobilization of the work force for national growth. The major players in employment are essentially-the employer and the employee and whenever there is a contractual relationship between these two parties, the binding contract naturally brings about rights and duties which must be complied with. Their respective rights and duties have to be analyzed wholly in contractual terms. In many civilize countries, a case study of Nigerian, it has been observed from historical antecedents, a structured favour to employers over and above the employees liability arose. As much as it is an undisputed fact that employers reserve the right to dismiss alongside other rights, employees also have rights which they can also exercise. But in most circumstances, due to ignorance of many employees, the opportunity to challenge such unlawful acts of the employerselude them. Efforts has been made in this research projects to identify these problems, their causes and also solutions have been suggested in the concluding chapter for a need to reform the whole set up as it affects labor law and practice in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>    i.        Certification</p> <p>   ii.        Dedication</p> <p> iii.        Acknowledgment</p> <p> iv.        Abstract</p> <p>  v.        Table of contents</p> <p> vi.        Table of cases</p> <ol><li>Table of statutes</li> <li>List of abbreviations</li> </ol> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE:INTRODUCTION- MEANING AND SCOPE, FORMATION, HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF LIABILITY</strong></p> <p>1.1             Meaning and Scope of Contract Of Employment</p> <p>1.2             Formation of contract of employment</p> <p>1.3             Terms of a contract of employment</p> <p>1.4             Historical background of employer’s liability</p> <p>1.5             Basis Of The Employer’s liability</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO:DUTIES OF THE EMPLOYER AND RIGHTS OF THE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE</strong></p> <p>2.1        Source of the Employers Duties</p> <p>2.2        The common Law Duties</p> <p>2.2.1      Duties to make available proper tools and plants for</p> <p>work</p> <p>2.2.2      Safe place of work</p> <p>2.2.3      Safe and secure system of work and supervision</p> <p>2.2.4      Competent staff with reasonably competent fellow Employee’s</p> <p>2.3        The statutory duties</p> <p>2.3.1      Adequate training of workers</p> <p>2.3.2      Paymentof wages</p> <p>2.3.3      Provision of safe sanitary system and humane conditions of work</p> <p>2.3.4      Annual holiday with pay</p> <p>2.3.5      Sick leave</p> <p>2.3.6      Employee’s compensation</p> <p>2.3.7      Vicarious liability</p> <p>2.4        Rights of the employer and employee in a contract of employment</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE:LIABILITIES OF THE EMPLOYER AND REMEDIES OF THE EMPLOYEE</strong></p> <p>3.1        Contractual breach and employer’s liability</p> <p>3.2        Remedies provided by the contract to the aggrieved employee</p> <p>3.3        Remedies provided by the law to the aggrieved employee</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:SUMMARY,CONCLUSION AND</strong></p> <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong></p> <p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong></p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CASES</strong></p> <p>Chadwick v.

The vitiating factors are also applicable to it. What distinguishes a contract of employment from a simple contract, which chitty defines as a promise or a set of promises which the law will enforce1, is the degree of control that one party has over the other party2. Also, a contract of employment relates to a relationship that exists between two or more persons for the performance of services, while one person is employed by the other. Where as, a contract relates to a relationship that exist between two or more persons in any transaction, generally.</p> <p>       Traditional statements of what constitute a contract of employment, place most emphasis on the power of the employer to control the work of the employee in contrast to a contract with an independent contractor.<strong><em>In Chadwick v. pioneer private telephone Ltd,</em></strong> contract of employment was defined thus: contract of services implies an obligation to serve and it comprises some degree of control by the master”3. It must howeverbe noted that there is no comprehensive definition, only conflicting criteria’s. A contract of employment can be defined as a contract entered in to by two parties whereby one party submits himself to the service of the other for some considerations in most casess salary and wages. An attempt has, however been made in the sphere of labour Legislations in Nigeria4 at defining a contract of employment as;</p> <p>’’Any agreement whether oral or written, express or implied, whereby one person agrees to employ another as a worker and that other person agrees to serve the employer as a worker.”</p> <p>It is a contract of service and not for service, what differentiates them is the fact that in a contract of service, a man (employee), places his labor at the disposal of another, resulting in a relationship between the to parties. Where as, a contract for services involve a situation where a man who operates an independent business agrees to do labor or carry out a task or tasks for the person of another. In past times, the contract of employment was known as and called a relationship of ‘’ master and servant”. </p> <p>Since employment relationship strictly represents subordination of an individual as a worker to an employer, which relationship could be described as a dependent labor relationship, Mr. Y’s house keeper, gate keeper, driver or chauffeur is his employee, that a laundry man or a t-axi driver is an independent contractor5.</p> <p>Thus, for a contract of employment to be distinguished from a contract for service, the parties involved must avail themselves of the statutory rights under it. That is, it must be shown that a relationship of employer and employee or master and servant exists between them. Thus, there must be terms agreed by both parties for this will be the sole principle which will guide their acts and conducts during the subsistence of the employment. As held by the court in SMITH V. GENERAL MOTOR CAB. CO6, where the claim for the existence of such relationship between the parties fails.</p> <p> As must have been noted, a contract of service involves two separate legal categories of persons namely – an Employer, master, hirer, or recruiter, and an Employee. <strong>WHO IS AN EMPLOYER ?</strong>: Although this has no précise meaning in law;</p> <p>       ’’An employer is any person who has entered in to contract of employment to employ any other person as a worker her for himself or for the services of any other person and includes the agents, manager, or factor of that first mentioned person and the personal representatives of a deceased employer.”7</p> <p>An employer can also be defined as; ’’The entrepreneur who engages a worker under a dependent labor relationship and has control over that worker to the extent that such worker could be referred to as an employee’’. Also, an employer is ’’Any person who employs or engages labour or the service of another person under contract of service’’.Theemployer could be an individual, a partner, a corporate body or even a state (the Government).8</p> <p><strong>WHO IS AN EMPLOYEE?</strong></p> <p>       Any person who has entered in to or works under a contract with an employer whether the contract is for manual labor or clerical work or express or implied or oral or written, and whether it is a contract of service or a contract personally to execute any work or labor but does not include…………… persons exercising administrative, executive, technical or professional functions as public officer or otherwise.”9</p> <p>To identify an employer or servant then, the essential question is ’’ was his contract a contract of service within the meaning which an ordinary person would give to the word?”. In CASSIDY v. MINISTER OF HEALTH10Bomerell,l.jgave the view that, if the answer is YES, then such a person will be regarded as an employee. In ADEYEMO v. OYO STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISION,11 the plaintiff who was a deputy accountant Generalloyo state public service was held to be a servant or employee. Employee and servant have been used interchangeably by authors also, various Nigerian statutes have defined who a servant is by using words like workers, employee or workman.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Formation of Contract of Employment</strong></p> <p>The existence of binding relationship between the employer and the employee arises out of contract, as essential elements for the formation of  a contract of employment or service between an employer and employee upon which their rights and obligations depends are generally same as conditions in ordinary or simple contact. This legal relationship therefore presupposes the voluntary consent of the parties to its creation expressed through the process of hiring within limitation imposed only by the general law of contract or statutory regulation. The terms are often not negotiable by the individual employee except in some cases where remuneration is negotiable, depending on the professional skills required by the employer. As such,  the rights and dutiesof the master and servant are essentially the products of free bargaining  between the parties,  as they have liberty to decide  the terms and conditions of  service.</p> <p>Beside the element of voluntariness, there is also the presumption of equality between the parties but professor Odumosu has described this presumption of equality between the parties as a ’’Fiction’’.12 Also, AdeogunA.A commented on the presumption of equality and voluntariness of bargaining power between the master and the servant, as he noted that, ’’… the so-called bargaining power of the individual worker is of little importance in practice……”13</p> <p>The basic conceptual frame work for the individual employment relationship is provided by contract, and as such, the employment relationship created must of necessity satisfy all the essential features of a valid contract. There must be offer, acceptance, requisite capacity of parties, consideration, intention to give the agreement legal efficacy and no element vitiate the contract. With regard to capacity, the parties must have requisite legal capacity to enter the employment relationship, Generally, <em>the capacity of infants, women, and persons of unsound mind are limited in some ways.</em></p> <p> <strong>TERMS OF A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT</strong></p> <p>       The terms of the contract of employment can be derived from the individual contract itself, collective agreement and legislations.Besides this, the terms of a contract also depends largely on the intention of the parties, as they are free to agree upon the contents or terms of their employment relationship. The terms of contract relates to those statements, express or implied, by which the employer and the employee intend to guide their employment relationship. The term defines the rights and duties of obligations and liabilities arising from the relationship. As stated above, there are express or implied terms . The express terms include: Hours of work14 travel to work,15wages and control of wages. The Implied obligation of employer include: To pay wages,16To treat employee with due respect; provision of work for the employee; Safety of the employee at work; Provision of references; To indenify the employee.17.</p> <p>Some implied duties of the employee include: The duty of obedience; 18 Dutyto exercise skills and reasonable care;19  duty to render honest and faithful service; Avoid secret profit and personal gain; competition.Avoid misuse of confidential information.20</p> <p>       The contractual terms may be oral or written, but important contents of a contract ofemployment are as a matter of practice and prudence, made in writing and the terms documented properly.</p> <p><strong>1.4  Historical Background of Employer’s Liability </strong></p> <p>Munkman21asserts that a recorded history of an employer’s liability started in 1837, when it started by effecting a denial of the workman a remedy for his damage through the application of the Doctrine of Common Employment. This doctrine operated as a defence under Common Law. It depends on the theory that the contract of employment between an employer and an employee contains an implied term that the employee will not hold his employer liable for an injury due to negligence of a fellow employeeengaged in Common employment with him. Thus, a master was only liable to his servant when there was a want of care in selecting his servant or personal negligence or omission to take reasonable precautions to ensure his worker’ safety. The employer was therefore absolved of any vicarious liability for any tort committed by one fellow employee against another.22 This was the principle introduced into the common law by Lord Abinger CB in PRIESTLEY v. FOWLER,23 where he held that:“the mere relation of the master and the servant can never imply an obligation on the part of the master to take more care of the servant than he may reasonably be expected to do of himself”.   By this, Lord Abinger almost excluded the employer totally from any liability to his employee.</p> <p>       This remained the common law position until the English House of Lords WILSON and CLYDE COAL Co Ltd. V. ENGLISH,24 Maintained that the employer is under the duty to take reasonable care for the safety of his employee in the course of his employment. This doctrine of common employment continued to limit the remedy available to employees until the Wilson’s case: In the case, an employee was killed due to an accident caused by co-workers. The employee argued that the company was not liable on the grounds that the decreased employee contributed to his own death by not taking an alternativeroute on thegrounds that the decreased employee contributed to his colleagues aware of his location. The court held that the employer-company is liable for negligence in the performance of the duty to exercise reasonable care and to ]provide a reasonably safe system of work. That the implied duty of care was personal to the employer –company and it could not be devolved upon one of its employees, as the employer had argued that the duty of provide a safe system of work had been delegated to the colleagues of the deceased who caused the accident, that the employer has a delegable duty to create a safe system of work. The defence of common employment has also been statutorily abolished in Nigeria, in the then Federal territory of Lagos, in 1961. Eastern Region, 1962, Western Region, 1963, and for the whole country in 1988.25</p> <p>The Labour Act provides; </p> <p>(1)   It shall not be a defence to an employee who is used in respect of personal injuries caused by the negligence of a person employed by him, that, that person was, at the time the injuries were caused, in common employment with the person injured.</p> <p>2)    Any provisions contained in a contract of service or apprenticeship or in an agreement collateral thereto (including a contract or agreement entered into before the commencement of this section) shall be void in so far as it would have the effect of excluding or limiting any liability of the employee in respect of personal injuries caused to the person employed or apprenticed by the negligence of persons in common employment with him.</p> <p>       In NIGERIAN TOBACCO CO. LTD. V. ALLOYSIUS OLUMBA AGUNANNE,27 the Supreme Court opined that the doctrine does not exist to all.</p> <p><strong>1.5  BASIS OF THE EMPLOYER’S LIABILITY</strong></p> <p>The employee’s safety at work is generally guaranteed by the imposition of certain duties on the employer, duties either fixed by the contract itself expressly, or implied by and or imposed by statutes as the case may be. The breach of these duties may involve the employer in one form of liability of another.28 But one is baffled at the reason why the employer should be liable to the employee he has employed, as it is the employer who makes an offer of the existence of such employment to the employee and to pay him wages.</p> <p>       As stated above, certain duties are imposed on the employer, as fixed by the contract itself. That is, certain termsexpressly agreed on and fixed by both the employer and the employee as the sole principle which will guide their acts and conducts during the substance of the employment. In a situation where parties were free to go back on their promises without incurring any liability, employment relations would be unbearable and it would be impossible to carry on trade and commerce. In the case of a contract of employment, the employer’s liability to his employee should be breach any term of the contract arises because both –parties genuinely intended and consented their legal relations, to be bound by it.</p> <p>The general rule is that the employer at common law has the implied duty to take reasonable care of his employee. This duty is concerned with those protection given by the common law, to guarantee the safety of the employee at work or save the employer from damages in case of any injury to the employee in the course of the employment.29</p> <p>       The legal duties and responsibilities of the employer in course of his relationships with the employee can arise in two ways namely; personal or vicarious (Liability).</p>\n\nEMPLOYER'S LIABILITY TO HID EMPLOYEE UNDER THE NIGERIAN CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EMPLOYER'S LIABILITY TO HID EMPLOYEE UNDER THE NIGERIAN CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>The role of legislature in impeachment proceeding under the 1999 constitution of Nigeria</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Faculty of Law</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1 Background to the study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The Constitution of Nigeria clearly ensures the separation of powers as an underlining principle of the Nigerian governmental system. Separation of powers allows typical division of branches of government  into a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. It can be contrasted with the fusion or combination of powers like in the case of a parliamentary system, where the executive and legislature sometimes parts of the judiciary are unified, for the purpose of governance. Separation of powers as underlining principle of governance vests legislative power of the Federal Government in the National Assembly. It provides thus: The legislative power of the Federal Republic of Nigeria shall be vested in a National Assembly for the Federation which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representative.1</p> <p>The National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a bicameral legislature established under section 4 of the Nigerian Constitution. It consists of a Senate and a 360-member House of Representatives. The body, modeled after the federal Congress of the United States, is supposed to guarantee equal representation of the states irrespective of size in the Senate and proportional representation of population in the House. The National Assembly, like many other organs of government has functions such law making, checking  of other organs of government, especially the executive, representation etc. the mechanism in which the legislature uses in sanctioning the executive when there is any misconduct is the impeachment process. </p> <p>The Impeachment process has become a topical issue on the Constitutional development of Nigeria. The starting point was the impeachment of Alhaji Balarabe Musa former Governor of Kaduna State2. It has been contained that impeachment has been so much abused by the State Assemblies who do it without recourse to laid down Constitutional measures.[1]                                                              </p> <p>           No proceeding or determination of the panel or of the House of Assembly or any matter relating to such proceedings or determination shall be            entrained or questioned in any Court. This provision ousted the jurisdiction of the Court in matter relating to impeachment embarked upon by the Legislature.</p> <p>Impeachment rarely occurs therefore the term is often misunderstood. [2]The word impeachment derives its root from a latin expression to be caught or entrapped. Thus impeachment as a Constitutional process is not designed as a weapon of political oppression, suppression or harassment of a President or Governor whose face the Legislature does not want to behold any longer in the power.</p> <p> However, impeachment when used appropriately will put the government of the day on its toes, thereby making such government responsible and accountable.</p> <p>Impeachment was first employed in the Nigerian history during the second republic in the case of Balarabe Musa, former Governor of Kaduna State. Since then impeachment process has become a topical issue in Nigeria’s Constitutional development. </p> <p>The purpose of impeachment has been abused by the Legislature, who use impeachment as a tool of oppression and intimidation for those in impeachment proceeding is worth nothing. A proper study of these impeachment proceeding has shown the legality or otherwise.</p> <p><b>1.2 Statement Of The Problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In Nigeria Constitutional history, there have been four Constitutions. These are the 1960, 1963, 1979 and the 1999 Constitution respectively. Although there existed and still existing provisions from the removal of executive office holders like the President. </p> <p>This power vested on the legislature, which is sacred, aimed at checking abuse of office by President, Vice President, Governors and Deputy Governors, was unfortunately turned to an instrument of political vendetta to embarrass, intimidate, and hoodwink the executive (Enyia,2009). This impeachment saga in Nigeria is replete only with the removal of Governors of the Federating States and some Chairmen at the Local Government level in some States.</p> <p>The process of impeachment of different political office holders is clearly stated in different sections of the constitution depending on the nature of office. Hence, breach of procedures is usually one of the major challenge confronting the role of the legislature in this process.   The discretion in using this tool of impeachment is very much within the discretion of the legislature in this case the state or national of assembly. This exercise of this discretion is implicit in the wording of Section 188 (2) (b) stating, “that the holder of such office is guilty of gross misconduct in the performance of the functions of his office”. The term ‘gross misconduct’ is defined in Section 188 (11) as, “a grave violation or breach of the provisions of this Constitution or a misconduct of such nature as amounts in the opinion in the House of Assembly to gross misconduct”. This in itself is a very subjective test and in the absence of further definition in the constitution reliance is placed on the general dictionary definition of the term and what obtains in Employment law where the term is commonly used in contracts of employment. Gross misconduct can be defined as an unacceptable and wrong act by someone in a position of authority and responsibility. Reliance is once again placed on the three principles established in the U.S.A that gross misconduct can be established. It is respectfully submitted that without these three ingredients, the Impeachment proceedings cannot be effective. Corruption in its sense is a major challenging factor to the legislatures in delivery this responsibility due to personal interest.   </p> <p><b>1.3. Objective Of Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The main objective of this study is to determine the roles of Legislature in impeachment proceedings under the 1999 Constitution.. The role of the legislature will be considered on impeachment proceedings, the loopholes of such proceedings and make recommendations to curb the lapses created by these loopholes.

Trade dispute, when it occurs could be a very serious issue especially when it is allowed to degenerate into an industrial action. Few trade disputes get reported but the ones that are recorded help the government to get a proper analysis for the evaluation and policy purposes. Though quite a large number of disputes occurs without resort to strike, however they are equally as disruptive as cessation of work.[1]</p> <p>Since government is the largest employer of labour, it has from time to time enacted different laws to curb the incidents of trade disputes between employers and their workers in Nigeria.</p> <p>[2]Trade dispute has been defined by the Act as any disagreement between employers and workers, workers and workers which is connected to the employment, non employment or terms of employment or physical condition of work of any person.  It must be noted that before any dispute can be termed a trade dispute, there must be in existence proper parties and the subject matter must be related to the employment, non employment or terms of employment or physical condition of work of any person23[3].</p> <p>This shows that the parties and subject of a trade dispute must be clearly defined in order to fully understand what kind of dispute constitutes a trade dispute. The first attempt made by the government to regulate trade dispute was the Trade Disputes (Arbitration and Inquiry) (Lagos) Ordinance, 1941 and Trade Dispute (Arbitration and Inquiry) (Federal Application) Ordinance, 1957.  However, these attempts turned out to be unsuccessful because of some defects in them which eventually shortened their life span and new legislation were enacted, These are the Trade Dispute (Emergency Provision) Decree of 1968 and the Trade Dispute (Emergency Provision) (Amendment) (Decree No 2) of 1969.</p> <p>These two Decrees were enacted to correct the defects in the first two Ordinances they were effective in some aspect but they were designated to last for a short time. The Decree had some inherent defects which were to be regulated by the Trade Disputes Act, 1976 which till today remains the major machinery for the settlement of trade disputes and its amendment the Trade Dispute (Amendment) Decree No. 47 of 1992.</p> <p>The Trade Disputes Act, 1976 has provided different procedures for settling trade disputes when they occur, the Act provides for ways in which the parties may attempt the settlement themselves and ways in which a 3rd party may be appointed to help in the settlement processes.3 It also provides for ways in which the parties may take the dispute to the court for proper adjudication.</p> <p>[4]Examination of the laws and procedures for the regulation of trade disputes is the focus of this study and recommendation made where necessary for a better way of resolving trade disputes.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1.0: Background to the study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In any ideal industrial relations, great emphasis is placed on the attainment of industrial harmony in order to create a conducive environment for the realization of individual and organizational goals and objective.  However, it would appear that conflict is a common phenomenon in any human setting and when it exists, it creates human and industrial problems, which adversely affect the attainment of industrial peace.</p> <p>Since conflict in any work situation is almost inevitable because as labour and management relates, there are bound to be frictions which result from differences in interest and aspirations as both the employer and employee most times have divergent interest on issues touching on wages, conditions of work, terms of employment etc and resolving these dispute receives compromise, concession and a game of give and take between disputing parties.</p> <p><b>1.3              Definition of terms</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>“Trade Dispute” </b>is any disagreement between employers and workers or worker and workers which is connected to the employment, non employment or terms of employment or physical condition of work of any person.4[5]</p> <p><b>“Strike” </b>has been defined by the Act as the cessation of work  by a body of employed persons acting in combination, or by concerted refusal under a common understanding of any number of employed persons to continue to work for an employer in consequence of a dispute, done as means of competing with their employers or any person or body of persons employed, to aid other workers in compelling their employer or any person or body of employed persons to accept or not  to accept terms of employment and physical condition of work</p> <p>          In <i>Tramp shipping corporation v. Greewish marine Inc.</i> “The court of Appeal in united kingdom adopted the following definition of strike: ‘a concerted stoppage of work by men done … With a view to improve their wages or condition of employment or giving vent to a grievance or making a protest about something or others supporting or sympathizing with other workmen in such endeavour.

This is so because of the tremendous contributions which workers can make to national growth and development, as well as the general well-being of the nation’s citizenry. Labour law has a vital role to play in the mobilization of the work force for national growth. The major players in employment are essentially-the employer and the employee and whenever there is a contractual relationship between these two parties, the binding contract naturally brings about rights and duties which must be complied with. Their respective rights and duties have to be analyzed wholly in contractual terms. In many civilize countries, a case study of Nigerian, it has been observed from historical antecedents, a structured favor to employers over and above the employees liability arose. As much as it is an undisputed fact that employers reserve the right to dismiss alongside other rights, employees also have rights which they can also exercise. But in most circumstances, due to ignorance of many employees, the opportunity to challenge such unlawful acts of the employers elude them. Efforts has been made in this research projects to identify these problems, their causes and also solutions have been suggested in the concluding chapter for a need to reform the whole set up as it affects labor law and practice in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>    i.        Certification</p> <p>   ii.        Dedication</p> <p> iii.        Acknowledgment</p> <p> iv.        Abstract</p> <p>  v.        Table of contents</p> <p> vi.        Table of cases</p> <p>vii.        Table of statutes</p> <p>viii.        List of abbreviations</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE:INTRODUCTION- MEANING AND SCOPE, FORMATION, HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF LIABILITY</strong></p> <p>1.1            Meaning and Scope of Contract Of Employment</p> <p>1.2            Formation of contract of employment</p> <p>1.3            Terms of a contract of employment</p> <p>1.4            Historical background of employer’s liability</p> <p>1.5            Basis Of The Employer’s liability</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO:DUTIES OF THE EMPLOYER AND RIGHTS OF THE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE</strong></p> <p>2.1        Source of the Employers Duties</p> <p>2.2        The common Law Duties</p> <p>2.2.1     Duties to make available proper tools and plants for </p> <p>work</p> <p>2.2.2     Safe place of work</p> <p>2.2.3     Safe and secure system of work and supervision</p> <p>2.2.4     Competent staff with reasonably competent fellow Employee’s</p> <p>2.3        The statutory duties</p> <p>2.3.1     Adequate training of workers</p> <p>2.3.2     Paymentof wages</p> <p>2.3.3     Provision of safe sanitary system and humane conditions of work</p> <p>2.3.4     Annual holiday with pay</p> <p>2.3.5     Sick leave</p> <p>2.3.6     Employee’s compensation</p> <p>2.3.7     Vicarious liability</p> <p>2.4        Rights of the employer and employee in a contract of employment</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE:LIABILITIES OF THE EMPLOYER AND REMEDIES OF THE EMPLOYEE</strong></p> <p>3.1        Contractual breach and employer’s liability</p> <p>3.2        Remedies provided by the contract to the aggrieved employee</p> <p>3.3        Remedies provided by the law to the aggrieved employee</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:SUMMARY,CONCLUSION AND </strong></p> <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong></p> <p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong></p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CASES</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION-MEANING AND SCOPE, FORMATION, HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF LIABILITY</strong>.</p> <p><strong>1.1    </strong><strong>Meaning and Scope of Contract of Employment </strong></p> <p>           The contract of employment is a specie of contract, and is Therefore governed by general principles of the law of contract, consensusad item, Being a kind of simple contract, contract of employment must also satisfy the elements of a valid contract. The vitiating factors are also applicable to it. What distinguishes a contract of employment from a simple contract, which chitty defines as a promise or a set of promises which the law will enforce1, is the degree of control that one party has over the other party2. Also, a contract of employment relates to a relationship that exists between two or more persons for the performance of services, while one person is employed by the other. Where as, a contract relates to a relationship that exist between two or more persons in any transaction, generally.</p> <p>       Traditional statements of what constitute a contract of employment, place most emphasis on the power of the employer to control the work of the employee in contrast to a contract with an independent contractor.<strong><em>In Chadwick v. pioneer private telephone Ltd,</em></strong> contract of employment was defined thus: contract of services implies an obligation to serve and it comprises some degree of control by the master”3. It must howeverbe noted that there is no comprehensive definition, only conflicting criteria’s. A contract of employment can be defined as a contract entered in to by two parties whereby one party submits himself to the service of the other for some considerations in most cases salary and wages. An attempt has, however been made in the sphere of labor[1]Legislation in Nigeria4 at defining a contract of employment as;</p> <p>’’Any agreement whether oral or written, express or implied, whereby one person agrees to employ another as a worker and that other person agrees to serve the employer as a worker.”</p> <p>It is a contract of service and not for service, what differentiates them is the fact that in a contract of service, a man (employee), places his labor at the disposal of another, resulting in a relationship between the to parties. Where as, a contract for services involve a situation where a man who operates an independent business agrees to do labor or carry out a task or tasks for the person of another. In past times, the contract of employment was known as and called a relationship of ‘’ master and servant”.  </p> <p>Since employment relationship strictly represents subordination of an individual as a worker to an employer, which relationship could be described as a dependent labor relationship, Mr. Y’s house keeper, gate keeper, driver or chauffeur is his employee, that a laundry man or a t-axi driver is an independent contractor5. </p> <p>Thus, for a contract of employment to be [2]distinguished from a contract for service, the parties involved must avail themselves of the statutory rights under it. That is, it must be shown that a relationship of employer and employee or master and servant exists between them. Thus, there must be terms agreed by both parties for this will be the sole principle which will guide their acts and conducts during the subsistence of the employment. As held by the court in SMITH V. GENERAL MOTOR CAB. CO6, where the claim for the existence of such relationship between the parties fails.</p> <p> As must have been noted, a contract of service involves two separate legal categories of persons namely – an Employer, master, hirer, or recruiter, and an Employee. <strong>WHO IS AN EMPLOYER ?</strong>: Although this has no précise meaning in law;</p> <p>       ’’An employer is any person who has entered in to contract of employment to employ any other person as a worker her for himself or for the services of any other person and includes the agents, manager, or factor of that first mentioned person and the personal representatives of a deceased employer.”7</p> <p>An employer can also be defined as; ’’The entrepreneur who engages a worker under a dependent labor relationship and has control over that worker to the extent that such worker could be referred to as an employee’’. Also, an employer is ’’Any person who employs or engages labour or the service of another person under contract of service’’.Theemployer could be an individual, a partner, a corporate body or even a state (the Government).8</p> <p>[3]</p> <p><strong>WHO IS AN EMPLOYEE?</strong></p> <p>       Any person who has entered in to or works under a contract with an employer whether the contract is for manual labor or clerical work or express or implied or oral or written, and whether it is a contract of service or a contract personally to execute any work or labor but does not include…………… persons exercising administrative, executive, technical or professional functions as public officer or otherwise.”9</p> <p>To identify an employer or servant then, the essential question is ’’ was his contract a contract of service within the meaning which an ordinary person would give to the word?”. In CASSIDY v. MINISTER OF HEALTH10Bomerell,l.jgave the view that, if the answer is YES, then such a person will be regarded as an employee. In ADEYEMO v. OYO STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISION,11 the plaintiff who was a deputy accountant Generalloyo state public service was held to be a servant or employee. Employee and servant have been used interchangeably by authors also, various Nigerian statutes have defined who a servant is by using words like workers, employee or workman.</p> <p><strong><strong>[4]</strong></strong></p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.2 Formation of Contract of Employment</strong></p> <p>The existence of binding relationship between the employer and the employee arises out of contract, as essential elements for the formation of  a contract of employment or service between an employer and employee upon which their rights and obligations depends are generally same as conditions in ordinary or simple contact. This legal relationship therefore presupposes the voluntary consent of the parties to its creation expressed through the process of hiring within limitation imposed only by the general law of contract or statutory regulation. The terms are often not negotiable by the individual employee except in some cases where remuneration is negotiable, depending on the professional skills required by the employer. As such,  the rights and dutiesof the master and servant are essentially the products of free bargaining  between the parties,  as they have liberty to decide  the terms and conditions of  service.</p> <p>Beside the element of voluntariness, there is also the presumption of equality between the parties but professor Odumosu has described this presumption of equality between the parties as a ’’Fiction’’.12 Also, AdeogunA.A commented on the presumption of equality and voluntariness of bargaining power between the master and the servant, as he noted that, ’’… the so-called bargaining power of the individual worker is of little importance in practice……”13 </p> <p>The basic conceptual frame work for the individual employment relationship is provided by contract, and as such, the employment relationship created must of necessity satisfy all the essential features of a valid contract. There must be offer, acceptance, requisite capacity of parties, consideration, intention to give the agreement legal efficacy and no element vitiate the contract. With regard to capacity, the parties must have requisite legal capacity to enter the employment relationship, Generally, <em>the capacity of infants, women, and persons of unsound mind are limited in some ways.</em></p> <p>[5]</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>TERMS OF A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT</strong></p> <p>       The terms of the contract of employment can be derived from the individual contract itself, collective agreement and legislations.Besides this, the terms of a contract also depends largely on the intention of the parties, as they are free to agree upon the contents or terms of their employment relationship. The terms of contract relates to those statements, express or implied, by which the employer and the employee intend to guide their employment relationship. The term defines the rights and duties of obligations and liabilities arising from the relationship. As stated above, there are express or implied terms . The express terms include: Hours of work14 travel to work,15wages and control of wages. The Implied obligation of employer include: To pay wages,16To treat employee with due respect; provision of work for the employee; Safety of the employee at work; Provision of references; To indenify the employee.17.</p> <p>Some implied duties of the employee include: The duty of obedience; 18 Dutyto exercise skills and reasonable care;19   duty to render honest and faithful service; Avoid secret profit and personal gain; competition.Avoid misuse of confidential information.20 </p> <p>       The contractual terms may be oral or written, but important contents of a contract ofemployment are as a matter of practice and prudence, made in writing and the terms documented properly.[6]</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1.       Chitty, general principles of contracts (24thED) london: sweet&amp;Maxwell,1977</p> <p>2.       R.K salman, A critical analysis of rights of employer&amp; employee under the Nigeria contract of employment</p> <p>3.       (1914) ALL E.R. 522 at 535</p> <p>4.       Nigerian Labour Act, No 1974, Section 91 (1) </p> </div> <div> <p>5.

This progressive undeniable dynamism in human nature has made it quit vital that man must be creative and not just that, but also innovative to satisfy his ever increasing unsuitable wants, thereby prompting some legal installation to this effect. This piece of work is propelled toward examining the creative work of man vis-Ã -vis the way he can be protected against any undue and unwarranted encroachment on his creative ability and the possible bodies vested with authority to look into the issue and the likely way it could be remedied if peradventure his interest was breach. Chapter one of this work is gives an insight into the significance of the study and concept of copyright, tracing its antecedence and developmental phases it has passed through till date, Chapter two would be dwelling predominantly on the work to be protected, those eligible to be protected and how they can arrived at it. Also to be considered is the aspect of authorship and ownership of copyright, terms of copyright the exception to copyright and how it can be effectively transferred in the Nigeria context. <br/>Chapter three, will dwell essentially on the administration of copyright in Nigeria centering more on the duties of the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) and other regulatory bodies like Phonographic Performance Limited, Performing Musician and Artist of Nigeria, Performing and Broadcasting Rights of Author/Composer and publisher MRS and many others including inspectors who would be considered as forces behind the curtain seen to a hitch free inventory society like ours. It is difficult to have an absolute crime free society, thus chapter four will be considering the infringement that copyright works are subjected to and the likely cure to the injury she might sustain in that process in form of remedies. Lastly, chapter five would be offering recommendation which might turn out to be invariable, as the conclusion ushers in, collecting in a statement or to the whole piece as the curtain falls. Thus, this project shall be divided into five chapters.<br/><br/></p><p> Table of Content </p> <p>CERTIFICATION PAGE <br/>ABSTRACT<br/>DEDICATION<br/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<br/>TABLE OF CASES<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/><br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/><br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>COPYRIGHT IN NIGERIA<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: PROTECTED WORK AND SCOPE OF PROTECTION<br/>2.2.0: QUALIFICATION FOR ELIGIBILITY<br/>2.3.0: AUTHORSHIP AND OWNERSHIP OF COPYRIGHT<br/>2.4.0: TERMS OF COPYRIGHT<br/>2.5.0: EXCEPTION TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION<br/>2.6.0: TRANSFER OF COPYRIGHT<br/>2.7.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>ADMINISTRATION OF COPYRIGHT IN NIGERIA<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: NIGERIA COPYRIGHT COMMISSION [NCC]<br/>3.1.1: STRUCTURED<br/>3.2.0: THE DUTIES OF THE NIGERIA COPYRIGHT COMMISSION [NCC]<br/>3.3.0: OTHER REGULATORY BODIES<br/>3.3.1: COLLECTIVE MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION<br/>3.3.2: COPYRIGHT INSPECTORS<br/>3.3.3 CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND REMEDIES<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: INFRINGEMENT<br/>4.2.0: REMEDIES<br/>4.3.0: INTERIM REMEDIES<br/>4.4.0: OTHER TERMS OF REMEDIES<br/>4.5.0: CRIMINAL LIABILITY<br/>4.6.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>GENERAL CONCLUSION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/><br/></p><p> Introduction </p> <p>The introduction of this research is only available in the paid version.<br/><br/>The Nigerian Copyright Commission And Administration Of Copyright In Nigeria (an Appraisal)</p>\n\nTHE NIGERIAN COPYRIGHT COMMISSION AND ADMINISTRATION OF COPYRIGHT IN NIGERIA (AN APPRAISAL)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE NIGERIAN COPYRIGHT COMMISSION AND ADMINISTRATION OF COPYRIGHT IN NIGERIA (AN APPRAISAL)", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Analysis Of The Various Schools Of Thought In Relation To The Meaning Of Law</p> <div><br/></div> <div>AbstractLaw can be defined as the body of rule designed or formulated to guide human actions or conducts which are enforced among the members of a given society, the breach of which attract sanctions.<br/>However, in spite of the ambiguity created in defining law and failure to reach universally acceptable definition of the term law. Therefore, it is most pertinent to examine the meaning of law from the different schools. For instance the natural school lead by Thomus Acquina, he sees law as what is fair, just, right and good. The historical school postulate, that law should be rooted in the people and reflects the common consciousness. To the sociological school, law is the pertinent norm and value in the society while the realist perceived law to be made through the medium of court.

A court can convict on a single witness. A case is not decided by the numbers of witnesses, single credible convincing evidence is enough to convict in a case but there are some exceptions. The exceptions refer to by this learned mean the circumstances where corroboration will be required before any judge can decide his case. Although a judge can convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice but he must warn himself before given such conviction in fact he is advised to seek corroborating evidence before convicting an accused because failure to do so can lead to the setting aside of his judgment on appeal.<br/><br/>Generally, corroboration cuts a niche for itself, it is used both in criminal and civil cases. It will also state the position of judges on the issue of corroboration and various decisions of court on different issues arising from corroboration. In law, corroboration, though popular yet controversial virtually under all legal system this is due to the influence and interpretation of the provisions of the Evidence Act and the criminal and penal codes (on corroboration of evidence) by judges. The desirability of corroboration as a requirement in certain criminal and civil cases under the Nigerian law of evidence and the hope of examine it critically under our legal system is the core focus of this study. This work will therefore elucidate the meaning of corroboration in Nigeria and Canada generally, the role of judges in deciding both civil and criminal cases and various statutory provisions in respect of corroboration of evidence in Nigeria relying largely on both primary and secondary source of law of evidence in Nigeria.<br/><br/>Table of Content CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>PRINCIPLE OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF CORROBORATION IN NIGERIA.<br/>2.2.0: MEANING / DEFINITION OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.3.0: NATURE OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.4.0 EVIDENCE REQUIRING CORROBORATION<br/>2.5.0 CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>RULES/ FORMS OF CORROBORATION.<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION.<br/>3.1.0: FORMS OF CORROBORATION<br/>3.1.1.0: CORROBORATION AS A MATTER OF LAW.<br/>3.1.1.1 CORROBORATION AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE.V<br/>3.2.1.1: CUMULATIVE CORROBORATION<br/>3.2.1.2: IDENTIFICATION CASES AND CORROBORATION<br/>3.3.0: CORROBORATION UNDER THE COMMON LAW<br/>3.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>INCIDENCES OF CORROBORATION<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: CORROBORATION IN CIVIL CASES<br/>4.2.0: CORROBORATION IN CRIMINAL CASES<br/>4.3.0: ROLE OF JUDGES AND JURY IN CORROBORATION<br/>4.4.0: PROBLEMS OF CORROBORATION<br/>4.5.0: SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM<br/>4.6.0 CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0 RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY</div>\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CORROBORATION UNDER THE NIGERIAN LAW OF EVIDENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CORROBORATION UNDER THE NIGERIAN LAW OF EVIDENCE", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A Critical Appraisal Of Election Laws In Nigeria </p> <div>The electoral process is a total process that includes registration of voters, identifying the political parties to be voted for, voting, counting of votes, and declaration of election results. This process is the foundation of civil societies. A strong civil society is vital and needed to serve as the bedrock of a stable democracy. It represents the reservoir of resources -- political, economic, cultural, and moral -- to complement and, when necessary, to check the power of the state. A dynamic and diverse civil society directly stimulates social and political participation, increasing the involvement and commitment of citizens and promoting an appreciation of the obligations, as well as the rights, of citizenship. By providing many potential avenues for political, economic and social expression, a society with a rich associational life gives people a stronger stake in the social order. This in turn, creates a climate within which mutual respect, tolerance, negotiation, and compromise actually make sense, and flourish.<br/><br/>Nigeria claims to be democratic and seeks to prove that under the banner of representation and multi-party political systems. Elections are used as a means by which representatives and policies are decided. The choice between political parties or individual candidates is made through elections. It should be noted that the public function implies elections. This electoral process is the peaceful transfer of power and legitimate exercise of authority. It demands active, broad-based citizen participation. It is the election that actually determines who shall wield power for a number of years as specified by the constitution. An electoral system may be defined as a process in which the mode of coming to power or the change of government is decided in a particular country at a given time.This paper is going to examine the development of several election laws that has been developed and the progression of the laws.<br/><br/>Table of Content COVER PAGE<br/>CERTIFICATION PAGE<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>DEDICATION<br/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<br/>TABLE OF CASES<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>1.3.0 FOCUS OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4.0 SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5.0 METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0 LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0 CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK OF ELECTORAL LAW IN NIGERIA<br/>2.O.O.INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0.

Literally, trust means confidence reposed in others. It was this moral obligation that was eventually developed into a legal concept by the English chancery court and it became part of the Nigerian legal jurisprudence through statutory enactments, its administration regulated by established principles of equity and statutes. In medieval times, trust was widely employed as a means of transferring estates from one person to another for the benefit of a third party. The transferor is variously known as settlor, feoffor or testator, while the person (or persons) for whom the trust is created is called feofee or beneficiary. In the same vein, the person in whose care the settlor entrusts the estate is known as the trustee.<br/><br/>It is instructive to note that the office of the trustee is very vital for the smooth administration of the trust. This is so because the estate is vested in the trustee who holds such property in accordance with the terms of the trust for the benefit of the beneficiary. A person may be expressly appointed trustee by an instrument or through some other means recognized by law. The equitable principle that \"equity does not want for a trustee is to the effect that considerable importance is attached to the office of a trustee in the trust administration. Even in situations where the instrument fails to appoint one, a trustee can be appointed by the court or through statutory powers.<br/><br/>This long essay seeks to examine the powers of a trustee vis-a-vis its operational regime under the Nigerian legal system. As a general rule a trustee must be capable of holding and disposing of property in his capacity. He must be competent to deal with the estate as required by the trust instrument for the beneficiary benefit. He must not be under any disability by nature or by law. He must be amenable to the jurisdiction of the court and be capable of the business. He must disclose any situation which might result in a conflict between his personal interest and his job as a trustee. A trustee must ascertain the validity of his appointment and understand the terms and nature of the trust.<br/><br/>In our clime, experience has shown that in the course of carrying out their assignments, trustees have come up against a lot of challenges and limitations despite statutory provisions relating to the exercise of their powers. Some of these challenges have to do with our customary and religious beliefs which result many a time in unending litigation.<br/><br/>Essentially, this essay will discourse trust holistically. In pursuance of this objective, this work will be divided into five chapters. Chapter one will deal with the general introduction to the topic which will include the historical evolution of trust and its reception into the Nigerian legal jurisprudence. Aims and objectives, importance of study, scope of study, research methodology, and literature review as well as meaning of trust and parties to a trust will be discoursed in this chapter. Chapter two will examine the relationship between trust and other legal concepts, classification, capacity, and the essentials of trust will be discoursed. Chapter three will focus on the seemingly simple but complex duties and powers of trustees. Chapter four will deal with remedies for breach of trust and liabilities. In closing, chapter five of this long essay will make recommendations, suggestions and propositions on how to improve the administration of trust in Nigeria.<br/><br/>Table of Content COVER PAGE<br/>CERTIFICATION PAGE<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>DEDICATION<br/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<br/>TABLE OF CASES<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/><br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: MEANING OF TRUST<br/>1.8.0: PARTIES TO A TRUST<br/>1.9.0: APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEES<br/>1.0.1: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>THE CONCEPT OF TRUST UNDER THE NIGERIAN LEGAL SYSTEM<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: TRUST AND OTHER LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS<br/>2.2.0: TRUST AND CONTRACT<br/>2.3.0: TRUST AND BAILMENT<br/>2.4.0: TRUST AND THE OFFICE OF PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES<br/>2.5.0: TRUST AND AGENCY<br/>2.6.0: CLASSIFICATION OF TRUSTS<br/>2.7.0: PRIVATE AND PUBLIC TRUST<br/>2.8.0: EXPRESS AND IMPLIED TRUST<br/>2.9.0: COMPLETELY AND INCOMPLETELY CONSTITUTED TRUST<br/>2.0.1: RESULTING TRUSTS<br/>2.0.2: CONSTRUCTIVE TRUSTS<br/>2.0.3: TRUST OF PERFECT AND IMPERFECT OBLIGATIONS<br/>2.0.4: EXECUTED AND EXECUTORY <br/>2.0.5: CREATION OF TRUST<br/>2.0.6: CAPACITY TO CREATE A TRUST<br/>2.0.7: INFANTS AND MINORS<br/>2.0.8: PERONS SUFFERING FROM MENTALIN CAPACITY<br/>3.2.0.9: MARRIED WOMEN<br/>2.0.0.1: CORPORATE BODIES<br/>2.0.0.2: ESSENTIALS OF TRUSTS<br/>2.0.0.3: CERTAINTY OF WORDS<br/>2.0.0.4: CERTAINTY OF SUBJECT MATTER<br/>2.0.0.5: CERTAINTY OF OBJECT<br/>2.0.0.6: EFFECT OF UNCERTAINTY<br/>2.0.0.7: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>EXAMINATION OF THE DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE TRUSTEES<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: ANALYSIS OF DUTY AS A CONCEPT<br/>3.2.0: GENERAL DUTIES<br/>3.3.0: FIDUCIARY DUTIES<br/>3.4.0: ANALYSIS OF POWER AS A CONCEPT<br/>3.5.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>BREACH TRUST AND ITS REMEDIES<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF TRUST<br/>4.2.0: REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF TRUST<br/>4.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.0.1: RECOMMENDATIONS</div>\n\nA HOLISTIC APPRAISAL OF THE CONCEPT OF TRUST UNDER THE NIGERIAN JURISPRUDENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A HOLISTIC APPRAISAL OF THE CONCEPT OF TRUST UNDER THE NIGERIAN JURISPRUDENCE", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><br/></div> <div><br/></div> <div>Abstract<br/></div><p>The traditional focus of International Law has been upon the rights and obligations of states while International Criminal Law regulates the conduct of individuals and also punishes those who commit heinous and barbaric crimes against others. The most prevalent of these crimes include genocide, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity.<br/><br/>After the end of World War II, the Allies tried Nazi leaders responsible for the massacre to demonstrate that such would not be permitted in future. In the absence of a permanent criminal court, ad hoc tribunals were established. Unfortunately, in the succeeding years, the world sustained atrocities without having recourse to any permanent global mechanism for the prevention and punishment of such crimes.<br/><br/>Consequently, a treaty establishing the International Criminal Court was adopted in Rome on July 17, 1998 at the Rome Conference. The court came into being on 1 July, 2002 as that was the date its founding treaty, the Rome Statute entered into force and it can only prosecute crimes committed after that date.<br/><br/>Despite the courts various achievements, it still faces some challenges. These include the refusal of the United States to ratify its treaty, the non-cooperation of states that are not parties, lack of universal ratification of the Rome Statute and a host of others. In spite of all these, the International Criminal Court promises a lot because it seeks to deter other war criminals from committing inhumane crimes against others. The court is widely acknowledged as the missing link in the international legal system.<br/><br/>On the whole, this long essay seeks to examine the International Criminal Court, tracing its evolution from the post-World War II era to the establishment of<br/><br/>International Criminal Tribunals. The Courts achievements and also the challenges undermining its successes will be discussed.<br/><br/>Table of ContentCOVER PAGE<br/>CERTIFICATION PAGE<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>DEDICATION<br/>ACKNOWLEDGMENT<br/>TABLE OF CASES<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS<br/><br/><br/><br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>AN EXAMINATION OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: INTERNATIONAL CRIMES<br/>2.2.0: EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS<br/>2.2.1.0: INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL (IMT)<br/>2.2.1.1: INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL FOR THE FAR EAST (IMTFE)<br/>2.2.1.2: INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY)<br/>2.2.1.3: INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA (ICTR)<br/>2.2.1.4: SPECIAL COURT FOR SIERRA LEONE<br/>2.2.1.5: SPECIAL TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON<br/>2.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>AN OVERVIEW OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION <br/>3.1.0: THE ROME STATUTE<br/>3.2.0: JURISDICTION OF THE COURT <br/>3.2.1.0: TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION<br/>3.2.1.1: TEMPORAL JURISDICTION<br/>3.2.1.2: COMPLEMENTARITY<br/>3.3.0: MEMBERSHIP<br/>3.4.0: STRUCTURE<br/>3.4.1.0: THE PRESIDENCY<br/>3.4.1.1: JUDICIAL DIVISIONS<br/>3.4.1.2: OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR <br/>3.4.1.3: THE REGISTRY<br/>3.5.0: PROCEDURES OF THE COURT<br/>3.5.1.0: RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED<br/>3.5.1.1: PARTICIPATION OF VICTIMS<br/>3.5.1.2: REPARATION FOR VICTIMS<br/>3.6.0: CO-OPERATION BY STATES THAT ARE NOT PARTIES TO ROME STATUTE<br/>3.7.0: INVESTIGATIONS BY THE COURT<br/>3.7.1.0: UGANDA<br/>3.7.1.1.: DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO<br/>3.7.1.2: CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC<br/>3.7.1.3: SUDAN<br/>3.7.1.4: KENYA<br/>3.8.0: THE COURT AND THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW<br/>3.9.0: DOMESTICATION OF ROME STATUTE IN NIGERIA <br/>3.10.0: THE COURTS CONTRIBUTION TO INTERNATIONAL LAW <br/>3.11.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES OF THE COURT<br/>4.1.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.2.0: ACHIEVEMENTS<br/>4.3.0: CHALLENGES<br/>4.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/><br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>GENERAL CONCLUSION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5:1.0: RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS<br/>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET<br/>BOOKS<br/>NEWSPAPER REPORTS</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Applicability Of Natural Law Principles To The Law Of Negligence In Nigeria </p> <div>The essence of creation of man in any environment is to interact, relate and have dealings with each other, in these relationships, certain level of moral standards is expected to be maintained which has necessitated the need for a guiding of conduct.<br/><br/>Hence, the introduction of the law which is regarded as rules, and principles set out in order to streamline the activities of man with each other.<br/><br/>Natural law theory emphasizes that, law has a divine or supernatural origin and for human laws to be legally valid, they must conform to nature of man and dictates of reason.

Today capital punishment is typically accomplished by lethal gas or injection, electrocution, hanging or shooting.<br/><br/>The human right proponents see death penalties as a violation of the right to life and human dignity as such countries that are becoming more democratic are eager to abolish it. The trend in most industrialized nations has been to first stop executing prisoners and then substitute long terms of imprisonment for death as the most severe of criminal penalties, about 90 nation have abolished death penalties and an almost equal number of nations, (most of which are developing countries in which Nigeria is included) have retained it<br/><br/>This thesis considers the argument for and against death penalty in relation to human rights, the argument against this concept goes beyond the Human Right Parlance, as there are other arguments like; the propensity to condemn and execute innocent citizens, the non-deterrent effect of capital punishment, the arbitrary use of the concept against the poor, the discriminately application of the concept on the basis of race, and the lesser argument that proclaims that capital punishment is cruel and inhuman. All these argument have not been reckoned with by anti-abolitionist, as some of them have come up with other modes of executions that they believe are more humane and less cruel, the sole aim of this is to kill the argument of cruel and inhuman treatment<br/><br/>The retributive nature of the human race would rather love that a murderer be necessarily paid back in His own coin, this is believed to be the anti-abolitionist main reason for insisting on the retention of death penalty. If the cost of executing an innocent person and abolishing the concept of death penalty is compared, it would be discovered that, it is more beneficial to abolish the use of death penalty than to lose valuable citizens to wrongful executions. Moreover, countries that have substituted life sentence for death penalty are not worse off than countries that have retained it.<br/><br/>Table of Content COVER PAGE<br/>CERTIFICATION PAGE<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>DEDICATION<br/>ACKNOWLEDGMENT<br/>TABLE Of CASES<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.2.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.4.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.5.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.6.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND HUMAN RIGHT LAW<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.1FORMS OF PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.2COMPENSATION<br/>2.1.3INCARCERATION<br/>2.1.4CORPORAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.5BANISHMENT<br/>2.1.6CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.7OTHER APPROACHES<br/>2.2.0: HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.2.1: MODES OF EXECUTION<br/>2.2.2CRUCIFIXION<br/>2.2.3STONING<br/>2.2.4HANGING<br/>2.2.5: SHOOTING OR FIRING SQUAD<br/>2.2.6: GAS CHAMBER OR LETHAL GAS MODE OF EXECUTION <br/>2.2.7: ELECTROCUTION<br/>2.3.0: WORLD WIDE ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.4.0: HISTORY OF HUMAN RIGHTS<br/>2.5.0: CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND RIGHT TO LIFE<br/>2.6.0: CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND RIGHT TO HUMAN DIGNITY<br/>2.7.0: CONCLUSION <br/><br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>JUSTIFICATIONS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND ITS ABOLITION<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: JUSTIFICATIONS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>3.1.1JUST PUNISHMENT<br/>3.1.2DETERRENCE<br/>3.1.3INCAPACITATION<br/>3.2.0ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>3.2.1PROPENSITY TO CONDEMN INNOCENT DEFENDANTS<br/>3.2.2DISCRIMINATLY APPLICATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE<br/>3.2.3ARBITRARY APPLICATION AGAINST THE POOR<br/>3.2.4 COMPARING COST TO BENEFITS<br/>3.3.0FLAWS IN ARGUMENTS FOR ABOLITION<br/>3.3.1RACIAL BIAS<br/>3.3.2RISK TO THE INNOCENT<br/>3.4.0FLAWS IN THE ARGUMENTS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>3.4.1CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>A COMPARISON OF THE NIGERIAN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT TO THAT OF OTHER SELECTED COUNTRIES<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0 THE NIGERIAN AND U.S.A CAPITAL PUNISHMENT COMPARED<br/>4.2.0 THE NIGERIAN AND AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT COMPARED<br/>4.3.0NIGERIAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT COMPARED<br/>4.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0 RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS<br/>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET<br/>BOOKS<br/>CHAPTERS IN BOOKS</div>\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR AND THE ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UNDER HUMAN RIGHTS LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " JUSTIFICATION FOR AND THE ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UNDER HUMAN RIGHTS LAW", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Provocation As A Defence To Criminal Liability </p> <div>Provocation on its own it not a total defense as to make the accused discharged of his guilt.

The sore point of this enactment is the consent requirement provided under the Act especially Sections 21 and 22 therein.<br/><br/>Ever since the consent requirement of the Land Use Act made its first debut in our courts for interpretation in the case of Savannah Bank V. Ajilo(1989) 1 NWLR(pt.97) 305, much juristic ink has been expended in debate for or against the usefulness of the provisions. Judges, in their duty of interpreting the provision have sung incoherent and discordant notes on the issue. Some writers too, have tried to either show support for its relevance or call for its repeal or amendment.<br/><br/>However, the convergent point in this contentious issue of the consent requirement is the retrogression and retardation, which the requirement, has continued to inflict on the socio-economic life and development of the country. This project work x-rayed the difficulties associated with, and incidental to the strict implementation of the consent requirement with their attendant legal, socio-economic and developmental dysfunction. Moreover it reviewed the current Amendment Bill before the National Assembly while unattended areas were highlighted, which, if not taken care of, may resonate another call in no distant future for a further amendment.<br/><br/>Table of ContentInterpretation Act, Cap 89, LFN, 1958.<br/><br/>Land &amp; Native Rights Act NO 1, 1916 &amp; 1918.

Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery.<br/><br/>IntroductionDiscrimination against women is defined by Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women 1979 (referred to as the 1979 Convention) as “any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.”1 Discrimination then is symptomatic of any situation where patterns of structural inequality are maintained by rules, norms and procedures which dictate a subordinate role for women in all spheres of society. The movements calling for an end to all forms of discrimination against women emphasize the need for a radical re-definition of the process and content of economic, social and political development and stress the need for a holistic orientation which acknowledges the vital role of women in development and engineers their integration into development planning and process as equal partners with men. For this purpose, it is argued that legal and substantive protection at the domestic, regional and international levels must be coordinated for more meaningful enhancement of both the status and situation of women.<br/><br/>Discrimination against women in particular societies takes different forms, and thus requires the utilization of differential strategies in different historical epochs and societies.<br/><br/>Discrimination against women will continue to be a problem until all the factors responsible for its existence, maintenance and institutionalization are understood and eradicated.<br/><br/>Widowhood has also been defined as the state of mourning the loss of one’s husband or wife through death3. The stress of this phenomenon is as real as those of loneliness and divorce. Widowhood is thus seen as a life event with wide range of consequences. For instance, widowhood is known to be responsible for the poor health status of widows and widowers, with minimal long-term consequences and is also associated with intense grief and angry expressions, especially among more widows than the divorced (when) compared.4 This is possibly because of deprivation following loss of spousal intimacy through death. It can thus be concluded that widowhood by implication is a stressful life event demanding practicable support systems.</p>\n\nWIDOWHOOD PRACTICE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WIDOWHOOD PRACTICE IN NIGERIA", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Conflict Management In Africa: The Role Of The Civil Society</p> <div><br/></div> <div><br/></div> <div>Table of ContentTitle Page <br/><br/>Table of Contents <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>The Concept of Conflict and Conflict Management<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>The Phenomenon of Conflict in Africa <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Civil Society and Conflicts Management<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>Bibliography<br/><br/>IntroductionConflict is the incompatibility of goals and values between two or more parties in a relationship, combined with the attempt to control each other and antagonistic feelings towards each other. It is a state of discord caused by the actual or perceived opposition of needs, values and interests.1 It exist whenever incompatible activities occur. An activity that is incompatible with another is one that prevents, blocks or interferes with the occurrence or effectiveness of the second activity.<br/><br/>The incompatibility or differences may exist in reality or may only be perceived by the parties involved. Nonetheless, the opposing actions and the hostile emotions are very real hallmark between people in all kind of human relationship and in al social settings. As a result of the wide range of potential differences between people, the absence of conflict usually signals the absence of meaningful interaction2. A conflict can be as small as a perceived disagreement or as large as war. It can originate in the person, between two or more people or between two or more groups. Conflict by itself is neither good nor bad but the manner in which conflict is handled determines whether it is constructive or destructive.<br/><br/>A conflict is different from competition and cooperation because in competitive situations, the two or more individuals or parties have mutually inconsistent goals as either party tries to reach its goals, it undermine the attempt of the others to reach theirs. Therefore, competitive situations will by their nature cause conflict. Conflict can also occur in cooperative situation, in which two or more individuals or parties have consistent goals because the manner in which one party tries to reach its goal may undermine the other individual or party.3<br/><br/>A clash of interests, values, action or directions often sparks a conflict and conflict is also seen as the existence of the clash. The world ‘conflict’ is applicable from the instant the clash occurs. Even when it is described as a potential conflict, it is implying that there is already conflict of direction even though a clash has not occurred. As a result, conflict can occur whenever there is interaction. Leo Otoide describe this situation in the international system thus:<br/><br/>When states interact there is competition for power and prestige and in the process, the international system elicits a picture of perpetual conflict, of survival of the fittest, where the desire for power and influence determines the attitudes of states and the course of events.4<br/><br/>Conflict occurs in different levels. The first is interpersonal conflict. Interpersonal conflict is when two people have incompatible needs; goals, or approaches in their relationship.5 Communication breakdown is often an important source of interpersonal conflict and learning communication skills is valuable in preventing and resolving such difficulties. At the same time, very real differences occur between people that cannot be resolved by any amount of improved communication. Personality conflict refers to very strong differences in motives, values or styles in dealing with people that are not resolvable. For instance, if both parties in a relationship have a high need for power and both want to be dominant in the relationship, there is no way for both to be satisfied, and a power struggle ensures common tactics used in interpersonal power struggles includes the exaggerated used of reward and punishments, deception and evasion, threats and emotional blackmail and flattery or integration. Unresolved power conflict usually recycles and escalates to the point of relationship breakdown and termination.<br/><br/>Conflict Management In Africa: The Role Of The Civil Society<br/></div>\n\nCONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA: THE ROLE OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY 2<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA: THE ROLE OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY 2", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>United Nations And Conflict Management Of The Civil War In Liberia</p> <div><br/></div> <div><br/></div> <div>Title Page<br/><br/>Certification<br/><br/>Dedication<br/><br/>Acknowledgement<br/><br/>Table of Content<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chapter One<br/><br/>Background to the Outbreak of Civil War in Liberia<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chapter Two<br/><br/>The Limitation of ECOWAS and OAU Instrument of Conflict Resolution<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chapter Three<br/><br/>The United Nations Intervention in the Liberian Conflict<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chapter Four<br/><br/>The United Nations Agenda In Resolving The Liberian Conflict<br/><br/>Chapter Five<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bibliography<br/><br/>IntroductionLiberia became independent on duly 26, 1847 as a small republic of immigrant Americans on the coast traditionally called the “Grain Coast”. Thus it is considered the oldest African independent State except Ethiopia. Liberia is the only state in Sub-Sahara Africa that was never subject to colonial rule1.<br/><br/>Before the immigration, which led to the creation of Liberia, the largely forested area now covered by the Liberia state was people by various Ethnic groups that form the overwhelming majority of the population today. Monrovia was founded in 1822 by black America colonists sent by the American colonization society. Monrovia and other settlements founded by the American colonization society were never ruled by the U.S government.<br/><br/>The American Liberia fought war for nearly a century with indigenous people, whom they called “Aborigines or Tribesmen”. Among the America Liberians there was a power struggle between the “Mulatoes” or people of partly white birth, of whom president Roberts and Tubman was the leading members and those of pure African dissent2.<br/><br/>In 1944 William U.S. Tubman (1895-1971) a lawyer and senator, became president. He held office for 27 years. President Tubman made considerable progress towards reducing the legal and effective discrimination between America Liberians and “Tribesmen”. Political rights were extended to the latter. But under Tubman the supreme power of America Liberia of their few Aristocratic families, and of the True Wig Party (TWP was left unchanged). There were very few tribe ministers under him.<br/><br/>Tubman died in Britain on July 23 1971 he was strongly anti Communist, though he allowed the opening of relations with the USSR in 1956.<br/><br/>On the death of Tubman, Vice President William Tolbert automatically succeeded him. He was re-elected in 1975 and 1979. But announced that he would not stand again in 1983. President Tolbert frequently showed concern for the ordinary people. Among the many official slogans which were a distinguishing features of his regime was “Mat to Mattresses”3.<br/><br/>In 1979 Dr Tolbert showed the fairness and sense of justice for which he has come to be reputed by refusing to grant reprieve to two men of top America Liberian elite, son of true Wig Party (TWP) Chairman James Anderson and of former Vice President Yancy Sentenced to death.<br/><br/>From 1977 the close relations between Liberia and Sierra Leone were strengthened by the Mano River Union, under which major projects were agreed on to develop closer link. In 1975 Joined the new Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS). A Liberian Dr A Romeo Horton was managing Director of ECOWAS fund.<br/><br/>Relations with other countries were little changed under President Tolbert close relations with the U.S.A were illustrated by the big reception given to president carter on his visit in May 1978.<br/><br/>The 1970 was one such period of economic difficulty it was also a decade that witnessed the initiation of a national discussion of issues of social justice and equality and of the imperatives of democracy. Inquiring opposition groups emerged to engage the government. . The leadership of President Tolbert (1971 – 80) was problematic oscillating between a disposition to change and the maintenance of the status quo. A political vacuum was created.<br/><br/>On April 12 1980, a military coup was staged under the leadership of Samuel Doe, and for the first time the indigenous groups were in power. President Doe filled his ranks with people from his own ethnic group, the Krahns4.<br/><br/>Given the unprecedented nature of the coup and the excesses of its violence, as well as the unwillingness of the conservative elements of the old order to accept change, there were many observers who concluded that the act was revolutionary and that a profound social transformation would be sent in train. Others asserted that Liberia has experienced de-colonization from “black colonialism”. The meaning of this admittedly historic event was that the way was now clear for the replacement of settler minority rule by indigenous majority rule.5<br/><br/>But such a hopeful prospect was not to be, Liberia was too heavy with history to conform to what has proven to be simplistic assumption about it politics and society. Following a period of initial uncertainty by an inexperience military government and it civilian political enablers (the movement for justice in Africa (MOJA) and people progressive party (PPP).<br/><br/>The process of sorting out the imperative of a return to civilian rule was soon under way. Largely in response to pressure from the U.S government which was bankrolling the military regime in keeping with America Cold War requirement, a new constitution was drafted, approved through referendum, and under it election was held on the 15th October 19856. There is ample documentation that the elections were rigged and that the incumbent military leader, Doe, who was declared the winner of the presidency actually stole the election.<br/><br/>With the elections fraud endorsed by the American administration on the protest that such was the way of Africa politics.7.<br/><br/>Deep disappointment set in. General Quinwonkpa attempted his coup and its failure cost him his life, Brutal and massive repression ensued Liberia of Wimba Origin bore the brunt of Does brutality because of the slaine General Quinwonkpa’s country of origin8. <br/><br/>On December 24 1989 a small group of rebels attacked the border town of Butuo in Nimba County as a first step towards the overthrow of the Doe government. The rebels were the National patriotic front of Liberia (NPFL) headed by Charles Taylor.<br/><br/>United Nations And Conflict Management Of The Civil War In Liberia<br/></div>\n\nUNITED NATIONS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA2<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " UNITED NATIONS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA2", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Nigeria Roles In The Development Of International Of International Organization In Africa.

To travel from the west to the east is a distance of 1,120 kilometers (700 miles) from the south to north of the country about 1,040 kilometers (650 miles). It is bounded in the north by the Sahara Desert and in the south by the Gulf of Guinea, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean.<br/><br/>Seen on a map, Nigeria can best be described as an approximately square expanse of vast territory divided into three unequal parts by a rough letter Y, which is formed by the confluence of that majestic African river, the Niger, with its chief tributary, the Benue, on its coastward journey to the Atlantic Ocean, into which it merges in the mangrove forests that line the intricate network of the Niger Delta.2<br/><br/>Nigeria, being the most populous country in Africa, has been described as “the giant of Africa, benevolent hegemony”, etc. Nigeria with a population of approximately 150 million divided among three hundred and fifty ethnic groups practicing the two dominant monotheistic religions of Islam and Christianity and with a few still devoted to their African gods.3<br/><br/>Nigeria is also phenomenally endowed country with billions of barrels of crude petroleum and huge gas deposits, one of the largest in the world, abundant agricultural land and sunshine, untapped solid mineral of all kinds, coal rivers that are harnessed for hydro-electricity and above al, a virile and highly sophisticated and educated people.<br/><br/>Nigeria is indeed a land inhabited by a people of varied ethnic origin and culture, whose ancestors settled in the area that is now known as Nigeria in successive waves over many centuries. Among the chief ethnic groups that occupy Nigeria are the Hausa, Yoruba, Ibo, Kanuri, Fulani, Ibibio, Tiv, Ijaw, Edo, Efik, Nupe, Urhobo, Ekoi, Borgu and a host of other smaller groups each with its own tongue and specific cultural practices. However, underlying the diversity of the various group/peoples of Nigeria, is the deep current of cultural unity characteristic of all black Africa.<br/><br/>At the north, east and west borders of Nigeria are Nigeria, Cameroon/Chad and Benin Republic respectively.<br/><br/>Aggressive coastal erosion and flooding of the coastal villages and towns, a ravaging gully and bad land erosion of the eastern region characterized the land mass. There is aggressive desert encroachment from the north due to climatic changes and human activities (such as deforestation from fuel wood and overgrazing).<br/><br/>There is frequent flooding when rivers overflow their banks. Reservoir flooding is also a common occurrence. Besides, Nigeria gained independence in October 1st 1960. Since the first coup d’ et al in 1966, the country has been unstable, with so many coups.<br/><br/>However, Nigeria was divided into four main geographical zones: Zone 1 is along the coast where rainfall mostly of swamps. The area is served by many rivers and creeks. Rainfall is high and spread over about eight (8) months in the year; Zone 2 is the forest region where rainfall is also heavy and the vegetation is made up mostly of the thick forest; Zone 3 is the semi-Savanna Zone which lies between the forest Zone and; Zone 4 the true Savanna Zone, in the north. Here the main geographical features are grassland and the low incidence of rainfall. The Sahara desert is not far away.<br/><br/>It is important to note at this juncture, however, the special position which the River Niger has held in the country. It is not surprising that the country has taken its name from the river. We must note that the river is unlikely to have taken its name from the colour, black or niger, used to describe Simeon of the period of the Apostles (Acts 13:1), or from the Afro-Americans carried across the Atlantic as human cargoes.4<br/><br/>It was once suggested that the river had been called Nigeir or Nigir from the second century and derived from the Latin word “black”. Other suggestions have been that Nijer was the name given by an African community to the river, or that the Greek word for river is Naghar.<br/><br/>Whatever the root of the word “Niger”, it is sufficient for us to note that the word Nigeria was first used to describe the country by a British Lady, Flora Shaw.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the peoples of Nigeria have a history which stretches far back into the past; in the Savannah Lands and plains north and west of the river Nigeri, the Kanuri, Hausa, Fulani, Borgu, Nupe, Jukun and Yoruba people evolved well organized states of varying size, while the powerful Benin state lay in the forest lands immediately west of the Niger, and the Ibos, the Efiks and the people of the Niger Delta occupied the eastern bank of the Niger in political units of varied nature and size.<br/><br/>Nigeria Roles In The Development Of International Of International Organization In Africa.

This practice may be explained by the fact that though Western civilization and culture have permeated Nigerian society, most people, even the most sophisticated understandably regard themselves as bound by the customary law of their place of origin. The Nigerian Marriage Act has given validity to this practice by enabling who are married under Customary Law to marry each other under the statute.<br/><br/>Some legal questions arise from this practice. It is uncertain whether the statutory marriage supersedes, for all intent and purposes, the previous customary-law marriage, or if the customary law marriage is merely put into abeyance to retrieve after the subsequent statutory marriage has come to an end. There is also the question of whether both marriages co-exist.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project will be to examine all this questions and the position of such marriages and the associated problems in Nigeria.<br/><br/>Table of Content COVER PAGE<br/>CERTIFICATION PAGE<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>DEDICATION<br/>ACKNOWLEDGMENT<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>1.3.0FOCUS OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4.0SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5.0METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.7.0CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>GLOBAL CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE EXAMINED<br/>2.0.0INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE<br/>2.2.0CONSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE UNDER NIGERIAN LAW<br/>2.2.1CONSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE UNDER CUSTOMARY LAW<br/>2.2.2CONSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE UNDER STATUTORY LAW<br/>3.3.0LEGAL EFFECT OF MARRIAGE IN NIGERIAN<br/>2.4.0CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA: ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS<br/>3.0.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0 DEFINITION OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE<br/>3.2.0 REASONS FOR DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE<br/>3.3.0 IMPLICATION AND EFFECT OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE<br/>3.4.0 PROBLEMS OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>3.5.0 TERMINATION OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>3.6.0 CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>PROSPECT OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.0.0INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0ADVANTAGES OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.1.1SOCIAL BENEFITS OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.1.2ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.1.3JUDICIAL BENEFITS OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.2.0CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY ARTICLES IN JOURNALS ARTICLES ON INTERNET BOOKS <br/>NEWSPAPER REPORT ON THE INTERNET PAPERS PRESENTED AT CONFERENCE, WORKSHOP AND SEMINAR.</div>\n\nDOUBLE DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA (ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DOUBLE DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA (ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS)", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Ownership And Control Of Mineral Resources Under The Shariah And Nigerian Statute. A Comparative Analysis </p> <div>Most countries have conferred the power/ownership of their resources on their government, not allowing individuals to lay claim to them. This has been beneficial for international business purposes, especially in the petroleum sector and has ensured stable revenue which is then distributed amongst the individual states in the country; while some countries like the USA recognize both state and individual ownership. Associated with exploration and exploitation activities of most natural resources is environmental degradation, which puts the environment in a non-usable position. There is therefore a need to reduce the effect of these activities. With increasing Environmental damage from the international oil companies, which has not been properly addressed by the government in countries like Nigeria, individuals have began to opt for control of their resources rather than leaving them in the control of the government. This paper aims at analyzing the effect of resource ownership by the government of a state, using Nigeria as a case study and whether the Shairah rules as established in the four juristic schools of Islamic taught can avail Nigeria from the problem of resource control agitation by the people.<br/><br/>Table of Content COVER PAGE<br/>CERTIFICATION<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>DEDICATION <br/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<br/>CHAPTERS AND VERSES IN THE QURAN<br/>TABLE OF CASES<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVE S OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO:<br/>LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER SHARIAH<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION <br/>2.1.0: STATE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIA<br/>2.2.0: INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER SHARIAH<br/>2.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE:<br/>LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE NIGERIAN STATUTE<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES IN PRE-INDEPENDENCE NIGERIA<br/>3.2.0: OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES IN POST INDEPENDENCE NIGERIA<br/>3 .3.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR:<br/>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIAH AND THE NIGERIAN STATUTE<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF MINERALS UNDER THE SHARIAH AND NIGERIA STATUTE <br/>4.2.0: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIAH AND NIGERIAN STATUTE<br/>4.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER FIVE: <br/>GENERAL CONCLUSION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>ARTICLE IN JOURNALS BOOKS<br/>CHAPTERS IN BOOKS<br/><br/>  </div>\n\nOWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIAH AND NIGERIAN STATUTE.

It was in pursuance of this aim that both the various state and local government edicts and the for the schedule of the 1979 constitution of Nigeria assigned functions to local governments. These functions were divided into provisions of social services and economic development of the local government area.<br/><br/>However, it is glaring that there were criticism on the mocks – operandi of the staff employed to run its affairs. The criticism ranged from discontinuity, improper policy implementation, misplaced priority, reluctant to changes in its environment, bribery corruption, red tapism and inefficiency.<br/><br/>These malfunction and indeed the merit impediment to the smooth running of our local management services include the issues of misappropriation of funds generated which in effect, militate against the full discharging of the responsibilities of Enugu North local government area in particular and other local government in general.<br/><br/>Based on the above problem, the Enugu North local government area which was created for effective and qualitative rural transformation has not faired efficiently in the accomplishment of these objectives, which includes provision of basic need and infrastructural changes.<br/><br/>The autonomy granted to the local government has retarded the efforts of the local government service commission in bringing uniformity in the employment procedures in the local governments. The issue of mint was not therefore given a favourable consideration as it ought to be. It was based on political compensation, fancily ties, god-fatherism and local patrotism. One therefore wonders how a square peg could be put in a round hole.<br/><br/>In consideration of all these problems planning the Enugu North local government and all the other local government in the country, the need for this study should not be over emphasized.<br/><br/>The Impact Of Revenue Generation On Local Government Administration In Nigeria (A Case Study Of Enugu North L.G.A.

This piece of work is propelled toward examining the creative work of man vis-Ã -vis the way he can be protected against any undue and unwarranted encroachment on his creative ability and the possible bodies vested with authority to look into the issue and the likely way it could be remedied if peradventure his interest was breach. Chapter one of this work is gives an insight into the significance of the study and concept of copyright, tracing its antecedence and developmental phases it has passed through till date, Chapter two would be dwelling predominantly on the work to be protected, those eligible to be protected and how they can arrived at it. Also to be considered is the aspect of authorship and ownership of copyright, terms of copyright the exception to copyright and how it can be effectively transferred in the Nigeria context. <br/>Chapter three, will dwell essentially on the administration of copyright in Nigeria centering more on the duties of the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) and other regulatory bodies like Phonographic Performance Limited, Performing Musician and Artist of Nigeria, Performing and Broadcasting Rights of Author/Composer and publisher MRS and many others including inspectors who would be considered as forces behind the curtain seen to a hitch free inventory society like ours. It is difficult to have an absolute crime free society, thus chapter four will be considering the infringement that copyright works are subjected to and the likely cure to the injury she might sustain in that process in form of remedies.

Therefore, it is most pertinent to examine the meaning of law from the different schools. For instance the natural school lead by Thomus Acquina, he sees law as what is fair, just, right and good. The historical school postulate, that law should be rooted in the people and reflects the common consciousness. To the sociological school, law is the pertinent norm and value in the society while the realist perceived law to be made through the medium of court. Utilitarian sees law to promote utility.<br/>The definitions of law from the above is not all encompassing as Professors Okunniga Once posited<br/>Nobody including the lawyer is offered, nobody including the lawyer is offering, nobody including the lawyer will be able to offer a definition of law to end all definitions<br/>On the whole, the definition of law up till the present day is still a subject of controversy among the jurists. A precise and appropriate definition is yet to be given to the meaning of law. It is on this note that this research aimed at analyzing the definitions given by various Scholar of each school Vis-Ã-vis the meaning of law, the study is also intended to carryout divergent views among jurists, scholar on the essential needs for universally acceptable definition of law.<br/>To this end, the research consists of five chapters the first chapter, deals with general introduction, the second chapter focuses on the nature and meaning of law chapter three, deals extensively with theories of law while chapter four concentrates on the view of law in Nigeria legal system and the last chapter contains conclusion with recommendations.<br/><br/></p><p> Table of Content </p> <p>COVER PAGE<br/>CERTIFICATION<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>DEDICATION<br/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<br/>TABLE OF CASES<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS<br/><br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0:INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0:BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>1.3.0:FOCUS OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4.0SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5.0METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0CONCLUSIONS<br/><br/><br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>NATURE AND MEANING OF LAW<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: MEANING OF LAW<br/>2.2.0: FEATURES OF LAW<br/>2.2.1: LAW IS BODY OF RULES<br/>2.2.2: IT IS MAN MADE<br/>2.2.3: IT IS NORMATIVE IN CHARACTER<br/>2.2.4: IT HAS AN ELEMENT OF COERCION<br/>2.2.5: TERRITORIAL LIMITATION<br/>2.2.6: DYNAMIC IN NATURE<br/>2.3.0: FUNCTIONS OF LAW IN THE SOCIETY<br/>2.3.1: DEFINITION AND REGULATION OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS<br/>2.3.2: IDENTIFICATION AND ALLOCATION OF OFFICIAL AUTHORITY<br/>2.3.3: DISPUTE SETTLEMENT AND REMEDIES<br/>2.3.4: CHANGE OF LAW<br/>2.4.0: OBJECTIVES OF LAW<br/>2.4.1: LAW AND STATE<br/>2.4.2: LAW AND FREEDOM<br/>2.4.3: LAW AND JUSTICE<br/>2.4.3.1: FORMAL JUSTICE<br/>2.4.3.2: SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE<br/>2.4.4: LAW AND LEGITIMACY<br/>2.4.5: LAW AND SOVEREIGNTY<br/>2.5.0:SOURCES OF LAW<br/>2.5.1: PRIMARY SOURCES<br/>2.5.2: SECONDARY SOURCE<br/>2.6.0: SCHOOLS AND SCHOLARS OF THE SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT<br/>2.7.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>THEORIES OF LAW<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: THE NATURAL LAW SCHOOL<br/>3.2.0: THE POSITIVIST SCHOOL<br/>3.3.0: THE HISTORICAL SCHOOL<br/>3.4.0: THE UTILITARIAN SCHOOL<br/>3.5.0: THE SOCIOLOGICAL SCHOOL<br/>3.6.0: THE PURE-THEORY OF LAW<br/>3.7.0: THE REALIST SCHOOL<br/>3.8.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>THE VIEW LAW IN NIGERIA LEGAL SYSTEM <br/>4.0.0:INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0:THE PERSPECTIVE OF LAW BY THE NIGERIAN COURTS<br/>4.2.0: THE DEFINITION OF LAW WITHIN THE SOCIAL EXPERIENCE OF NIGERIA<br/>4.2.1: THE LITERARY RULE<br/>4.2.2: THE GOLDEN RULE<br/>4.2.3: THE MISCHEF RULE<br/>4.3.0 CONCLUSIONS<br/><br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>GENERAL CONCLUSION <br/>5.0.0:CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0:RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY <br/>ARTICLE ON THE INTERNET<br/>BOOKS</p>\n\nANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN RELATION TO THE MEANING OF LAW2<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN RELATION TO THE MEANING OF LAW2", "id": 26}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>There is no law that says the plaintiff or the prosecution must bring a million witnesses or evidence to court before he can succeed in his case. A court can convict on a single witness. A case is not decided by the numbers of witnesses, single credible convincing evidence is enough to convict in a case but there are some exceptions. The exceptions refer to by this learned mean the circumstances where corroboration will be required before any judge can decide his case. Although a judge can convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice but he must warn himself before given such conviction in fact he is advised to seek corroborating evidence before convicting an accused because failure to do so can lead to the setting aside of his judgment on appeal.<br/><br/>Generally, corroboration cuts a niche for itself, it is used both in criminal and civil cases. It will also state the position of judges on the issue of corroboration and various decisions of court on different issues arising from corroboration. In law, corroboration, though popular yet controversial virtually under all legal system this is due to the influence and interpretation of the provisions of the Evidence Act and the criminal and penal codes (on corroboration of evidence) by judges. The desirability of corroboration as a requirement in certain criminal and civil cases under the Nigerian law of evidence and the hope of examine it critically under our legal system is the core focus of this study. This work will therefore elucidate the meaning of corroboration in Nigeria and Canada generally, the role of judges in deciding both civil and criminal cases and various statutory provisions in respect of corroboration of evidence in Nigeria relying largely on both primary and secondary source of law of evidence in Nigeria.<br/><br/></p><p> Table of Content </p> <p>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>PRINCIPLE OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF CORROBORATION IN NIGERIA.<br/>2.2.0: MEANING / DEFINITION OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.3.0: NATURE OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.4.0 EVIDENCE REQUIRING CORROBORATION<br/>2.5.0 CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>RULES/ FORMS OF CORROBORATION.<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION.<br/>3.1.0: FORMS OF CORROBORATION<br/>3.1.1.0: CORROBORATION AS A MATTER OF LAW.<br/>3.1.1.1 CORROBORATION AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE.V<br/>3.2.1.1: CUMULATIVE CORROBORATION<br/>3.2.1.2: IDENTIFICATION CASES AND CORROBORATION<br/>3.3.0: CORROBORATION UNDER THE COMMON LAW<br/>3.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>INCIDENCES OF CORROBORATION<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: CORROBORATION IN CIVIL CASES<br/>4.2.0: CORROBORATION IN CRIMINAL CASES<br/>4.3.0: ROLE OF JUDGES AND JURY IN CORROBORATION<br/>4.4.0: PROBLEMS OF CORROBORATION<br/>4.5.0: SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM<br/>4.6.0 CONCLUSION<br/><br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0 RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p>\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CORROBORATION UNDER THE NIGERIAN LAW OF EVIDENCE2<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CORROBORATION UNDER THE NIGERIAN LAW OF EVIDENCE2", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>NIGERIA AND ARGENTINA CRIMINAL LAW: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.0 INTRODUCTION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1 THE NIGERIA CRIMINAL LAW</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>The Criminal Law is the principal law on crimes. It is not contained in any single statute book or even a fend. This tends to suggest that a good way to study the criminal law is  to study one statute after another. This may prove difficult because the catalogue of Criminal Law has not been compiled, nor is any attempt being made. Since the Criminal Law is all about crime, a better approach may be to study one crime after another. The number of acts and omissions that are forbidden by Criminal Law are inexustable. More are still being created directly or indirectly few are de-criminalised.  The existing ones  are either expanded or contracted in extent and scope through judicial interpretation.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>There may be another approach. Form the works of earlier writers,  it may be possible  to isolate certain features that may be common or different in a majority of crimes and make those features the subject of study.  This is the approach adopted in this course.</p> <p>The Criminal Law is a reflection of the fundamental character and intellectual life of the society in which it operates. Customary Criminal Law once prevailed but It was largely unwritten. It has given way to written law. Thus Customary Criminal Law has remained part of the law of crime to the extent it is written.</p> <p>This course consists of 21 Units of study and adequately takes care of the conveniences of the students whom we know are working and at the same time learning. This Course Guide offers you in a nutshell, what the Criminal Law is about:  it gives you an insight  into the course materials which have been deliberately compressed in order to ensure that you are able to cover as much as possible within the given period.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2 THE ARGENTINA CRIMINAL LAW</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The Argentine nation adopts for its democratic government the Representative, Republican and Federal form. It is representative because the country is governed by representatives of the people. It is republicanbecause people elect their representatives through vote, because the country is governed by a tripartite system made up of an Executive Power, a Legislative Power, and a Judicial Power, and because Argentina adopts a written Constitution. Finally, it is <i>federal</i> because the provincial governments keep their self-rule despite responding to a common government (The National government). The nation adopts this form of government as established by the National Constitution[1], passed on 1853.</p> <p>This text was modified in 1860 when the province of Buenos Aires is included, since it was not part of the Argentine Confederation in 1953.</p> <p> </p> <p>Then, in 1949, a constitutional convention replaced the 1853/1860 text for a new one which was rendered null and void by the provincial government through the April 27, 1956 proclamation that replaced the previous text. The National Convention approved the constitutional reforms on August 22, 1994 which became effective on August 24, 1994.</p> <p>These reforms refer, fundamentally, to the organic part of the Constitution.</p> <p>The Argentine Republic comprises 23 provinces and the city of Buenos Aires. The provinces are Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Corrientes, Córdoba, Chaco, Chubut, Entre Ríos, Formosa, Jujuy, La Pampa, La Rioja, Mendoza, Misiones, Neuquén, Río Negro, Salta, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Cruz, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero, Tucumán, and Tierra del Fuego.</p> <p>Each province has its own constitution which must state its administration of justice and municipal autonomy, and the scope and content of its institutional, political, administrative and financial orders.</p> <p> </p> <p>Each province also elects its own authorities: Governor, Legislators and other provincial officers. They dictate their regional legislation through local institutions and are entitled to enter into international agreements as long as they abide by the national foreign policy and do not affect the Federal government faculties or the National public credit. Likewise, they are allowed to enter into partial treaties supported by the Federal government for the purposes of justice administration, economic interests and public interest works.</p> <p>Provinces shall not execute partial treaties on political matters, enact commercial, interior or exterior navigation laws, set up provincial customs, mint currency, set up banks with bill issuance power without the Federal government authorization, dictate the Civil, Commercial, Criminal and Mining codes after being approved by the Congress, pass laws related to citizenship and naturalization, bankruptcy, currency forgery or state documents, establish tonnage rights or set up warship, neither shall they appoint or receive foreign agents.</p> <p> </p> <p>The constitutional legal code established for the Argentine nation, since 1853, the above mentioned form of government, divided into the executive, legislative and judicial powers.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3 THE COMPARISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Argentina’s criminal code, the Código Penal (CP), was adopted in 1921. The current CP was intended “to capture in a simple and pragmatically oriented text the basics of the Tejedor Code and the 1891 draft,” and to a significant extent it succeeded: the CP established a simple regime of sanctions, abolished the death penalty, and endorsed straightforward rules of responsibility and definitions of offenses. However, as Marcelo Ferrante notes, the numerous minor reforms and amendments adopted since 1921 have as is often the case with codes that are updated in piecemeal fashion “introduced complexity into an otherwise relatively simple text, often affecting the code’s systematicity.” Ferrante offers a particularly striking example of this in the area of punishment: possessing explosives in Argentina is now subject to longer imprisonment (5 to 15 years) than detonating the explosives and destroying goods or endangering human life (3 to 10 years) while human trafficking is about 10 to 15 years in Argentina.</p> <p>In the year 1999 Nigeria move for the adoption of the criminal code of 419. Some offenses purnishable by law to mention but a few; consider the case of a person caught with explosive, the maximum time in prison is from 5 to 10 years then human trafficking in Nigeria can take from 10 to 30 years inprison.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4 JURISDICTION IN NIGERIA</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Jurisdiction is genuine and fundamental in every proceeding in court. If a court adjudicates over a matter which it has no jurisdiction, no matter how brilliant the judgment is, its efforts and proceedings are nullity abinitio.</p> <p>Jurisdiction may be by reference to constitution or composition of the court. The law specifies the number of judges that must seat in a given matter failing which the court cannot competently handle the matter. </p> <p><br/><br/>Jurisdiction may also be determined by geographical area of operation of the court.</p> <p>The leading authority on the essentials of jurisdiction is the case of Madukolu V. Nkemdilim (1962) S.C.N.L.R 341. A court has jurisdiction:<br/>i. When it properly constituted as regards members and qualifications of the members of the Bench and no number is disqualified for any reason.</p> <p>ii. When the subject matter of the case is within its jurisdiction.<br/>iii. And when the case comes before the court initiated by due process of law, and upon fulfillment of any condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction.</p> <p>CFRN 1999 established seven (7) superior courts of record in Nigeria and confer on them both original and appellate jurisdiction in respect of certain matters.</p> <p><br/><br/><b>CATEGORIES OF COURTS IN NIGERIA</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.

Suffice to state, also that the company upon its incorporation can acquire property in its corporation name. This corporate personality, gives the company the status of a person; albeit artificial, having all the qualities of a normal human being.<br/>It should be noted, that a company is by virtue of the celebrated case of Salomon V. Salomon &amp; Co. (1897) A.C. 22, an entity separate from its members having the capacity to own assets, properties, liabilities, right and obligations incidental to the activities of the company done, giving it responsibilities for all its acts and not its members and/or officers.<br/>The effect of this, is that the members or officers of the company are not in any way under any form of liability for acts done in course of discharging their duties but the company (a legal person) bears all such liability; even though its activities are carried out by human beings whose acts are of paramount importance to the company.<br/>At this juncture, it would not be out of place to state with particular reference to this project work that the acts of directors as officers of the company are also accruable to the company. Be that as it may; the meaning and nature of a director is without a universally acceptable definition, neither could it lend itself an easy definition and a much easier understanding. However, directors can be defined as managers of the company. They are not employed by the company and as such cannot be said to be employees of the company, servants or members there to but they can be seen as officers of the company, for the purpose inter alia of making the company vicariously liable for their acts and omissions while engaged in the business of the company.<br/>In essence, this project work has as its sole aim; the consideration of the liabilities of a company for the acts of its agents, with particular reference and emphasis on the director of a company and it shall also consider, the position of the law, as it relates to the above issue of liability of a director with reference to a company.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>THE DIRECTORS OF A COMPANY</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: TYPES OF DIRECTORS</p> <p>2.2.0: APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS</p> <p>2.3.0: POWERS OF DIRECTORS</p> <p>2.4.0: PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS</p> <p>2.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: DIRECTORS AS TRUSTEES AND AGENT OF THE COMPANY</p> <p>3.2.0: DIRECTORS CONFLICT OF INTEREST</p> <p>3.3.0: DIRECTORS INTEREST IN CONTRACT</p> <p>3.4.0: DIRECTORS AND SECRET PROFIT</p> <p>3.5.0: FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES</p> <p>3.6.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>LIABILITIES AND REMEDIES OF DIRECTORS</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY FOR THE ACT OF ITS OFFICERS AND AGENTS</p> <p>4.1.1.0: CRIMINAL LIABILITIES</p> <p>4.1.2.0: CIVIL LIABILITIES</p> <p>4.2.0: REMEDIES</p> <p>4.2.1.0: RELIEF FROM LIABILITY</p> <p>4.3.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS</p> <p>BOOKS</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE LIABILITIES OF A COMPANY FOR THE ACTS OF ITS DIRECTORS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF THE LIABILITIES OF A COMPANY FOR THE ACTS OF ITS DIRECTORS", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <p>A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SECTION 144 OF THE 1999 CONSTITUTION: MUSA YARDUA AS A CASE STUDY</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>On the 23rd of November, 2009, President Musa Yar’Adua left Nigeria for treatment abroad in an undisclosed country. For the next 80 days, nobody heard from or saw the federal republic of Nigeria. Even the vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, could not give any reasonable report of the president’s whereabouts. The activities of the federal executive council became suddenly shrouded and ambiguous. As expected, question about the whereabouts and status of the president began to fly at the national assembly, the judiciary and the federal executive council.<br/>The attendant issues that emanated from this situation led to a very tensed period of fierce constitutional arguments by different quarters, especially from legal practitioners, scholars, authors and most especially, the media who put up quite a show fielding all sorts of rumors and speculations.<br/>The purpose of this thesis therefore, is to critically appraise the all the constitutional issues that emanated from the Yar’Adua’s saga. In view of this, the office of the president would be critically examined, together with his powers and obligations in relation to section 144 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. Also, the obligation of the Federal Executive Council, the National Assembly and the Judiciary would be examined too.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>APPRAISAL OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.1.1.0: THE PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.1.1.1: THE VICE PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.2.1: QUALIFICATION AND NOMINATION OF THE CANDIDATES  CONTESTING FOR THE OFFICE OF THESE OFFICES</p> <p>2.2.2: GROUNDS FOR THE DISQUALIFICATION OF CANDIDATE</p> <p>2.2.3: TENURE OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.2.4: PROVISION FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE TENURE OF THIS OFFICE</p> <p>2.2.5: DEATH, INCAPACITATION OF THE OF THE PRESIDENT ELECT BEFORE OATH OF OFFICE</p> <p>2.2.6: DUTIES, POWERS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.2.7: REMOVAL OF THE PRESIDENT FROM OFFICE</p> <p>2.3.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>IMPLICATIONS OF THE ABSENCE OF THE PRESIDENT FROM  OFFICE</p> <p>3.1.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.1: THE ABSENCE OF PRESIDENT MUSA YAR’ADUA FROM OFFICE</p> <p>3.2.0: THE LEGISLATURE IN RESPECT OF THE OF THE YAR’ADUA’S  CASE</p> <p>3.2.1: THE POSITION OF THE JUDICIARY</p> <p>3.2.2: THE POSITION OF AUTHORS AND SCHOLARS</p> <p>3.30:  CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>AN EXAMINATION OF THE PRESIDENT YAR’ADUA’S CASE</p> <p>4.1.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.1.0: PERMANENT INCAPACITY OF THE PRESIDENT</p> <p>4.1.1.1.: MEANING AND AN EXAMINATION OF PRESIDENT  YAR’ADUA’S MEDICAL CONDITION</p> <p>4.2.0: THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL</p> <p>4.2.1: AT WHAT POINT DOES THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL PASSES THE RESOLUTION DECLARING THE PRESIDENT  INCAPACITATED</p> <p>4.3.0: A CRITIQUE OF THE MUSA YAR’ADUA’S CASE</p> <p>4.4.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS</p> <p>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>BOOKS</p> <p>NEWSPAPER REPORTS</p> <p>NEWSPAPER REPORT ON THE INTERNET</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n\nA CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SECTION 144 OF THE 1999 CONSTITUTION: MUSA YARDUA AS A CASE STUDY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SECTION 144 OF THE 1999 CONSTITUTION: MUSA YARDUA AS A CASE STUDY", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A CRITICAL APPRAISALOF LEGITIMACY AND LEGITIMATION UNDER NIGERIA FAMILY LAW</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This long essay is concerned with the concept of legitimacy, which is an important concept, as it determines the status of a child in relation to the society, while a legitimate child is conferred with the rights and duties of a legitimate child, which includes right to maintenance, succession among other rights, an illegitimate child is denied of these right by virtue of the fact of his illegitimate birth and he remain so,  until and unless he is legitimated either by the subsequent marriage of the parents, or by acknowledgement of paternity by the father, the absence of which the child will be regarded as an illegitimate child, with the resultant social discrimination that will be melted out on him by members of the larger society.  <br/> This essay is therefore poised to giving a voice to illegitimate children in the society, by examining the concept itself, and the discrimination which an illegitimate child is being faced with; it examines the ways of legitimating an illegitimate child, in order to remove the discrimination, so that he will be accorded with the same status as a legitimate child.  <br/>Chapter one gives a general introduction of the work, it traces the origin of illegitimacy which appearances can be seen in the Holy Bible and the Holy Qu’ran,and which also dates back to our traditional societies, where an illegitimate child is seen more or less like a social outcast, and is treated like the child of nobody, it also discusses all the variables necessary to fully appreciate the concept, while chapter two talked about the concept of legitimacy under both customary and English law, it discusses the importance of a legitimate status, it also discusses illegitimacy, and the need to legitimize an illegitimate child, in other to remove the social stigma attached to that status.   legitimization was specifically discussed in chapter three, which can either be by the subsequent marriage of the parents of the child which can either be by statutory law, or by customary law, and the necessary conditions which must be met, Acknowledgement of paternity as a means of legitimation was also discussed with the condition precedent before a child will be said to have been acknowledged by the father  <br/> Chapter four discusses the effect of legitimation on an otherwise illegitimate child, which includes the rights and the duties of a legitimized child to the parents and the rights and duties of the parents to a legitimated child as when there is a right there must be a corresponding duty. Chapter five which is the concluding part of the work contains the findings of the work and includes the necessary recommendations.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0:INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0:BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0:OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0:FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0:SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0:METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0:LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0:DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0:CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>LEGITIMACY</p> <p>2.0.0:INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0:CONCEPT OF LEGITIMACY</p> <p>2.2.0:LEGITIMACY UNDER NIGERIAN CUSTOMARY LAW</p> <p>2.3.0:LEGITIMACY UNDER ENGLISH LAW</p> <p>2.4.0:LEGITIMACY OF CHILDREN OF VOID MARRIAGE</p> <p>2.5.0:LEGITIMACY OF CHILDREN OF A VIODABLE MARRIAGE</p> <p>2.6.0:ILLEGITIMACY</p> <p>2.7.0:DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEGITIMATE AND ILLEGITIMATE CHILD</p> <p>2.7.0:OTHER INSTANCES OF LEGITIMACY</p> <p>2.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>LEGITIMATION</p> <p>3.0.0:INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0:LEGITIMATION BY SUBSEQUENT STATUTORY LAW MARRIAGE</p> <p>3.2.0:LEGITIMATION BY SUBSEQUENT CUSTOMARY LAW MARRIAGE.</p> <p>3.3.0:LEGITIMATION BY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</p> <p>3.4.0:CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>EFFECT OF LEGITIMATION</p> <p>4.0.0:INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0:EFFECT OF A LEGITIMATION</p> <p>4.2.0:RIGHTS OF A LEGITIMIZED CHILD</p> <p>4.3.0:DUTIES OF A PARENT TO A LEGITIMIZED CHILD</p> <p>4.4.0:DUTIES OF A LEGITIMIZED CHILD TO THE PARENT</p> <p>4.5.0:CONSTITUTIONAL APPROACH TO LEGITIMATION</p> <p>4.6.0:CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION    </p> <p>5.0.0:CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0:RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>BOOKS</p>\n\nA CRITICAL APPRAISALOF LEGITIMACY AND LEGITIMATION UNDER NIGERIA FAMILY LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL APPRAISALOF LEGITIMACY AND LEGITIMATION UNDER NIGERIA FAMILY LAW", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>EXCESS OF INJUNCTION IN NIGERIA JUDICIAL SYSTEM</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Injunction serves as an order of equitable nature restraining the person to whom it is directed from performing a specified act or in certain exceptional circumstances cases requiring him to perform a specified act.  Injunctions are judicial remedy by which a person is ordered to refrain from doing or to do a particular act or thing. In the former case it is called a restrictive and prohibitory injunction and in the latter a mandatory or positive injunction. This work examines the basis and nature of injunction, the first is the exercise of the granting of injunction to prevent an impending or a threatened breach of a legal or equitable right. The second basis for the granting of injunction is the prevention of the defendants from infringing or breaching the legal or equitable right of the plaintiff but rather a need to prevent the defendant from acting in a manner which is unconscionable and contrary to equitable principles. The court grants injunction on the second basis on the ground that it is just and convenient to do so. Also, the work further examines the various types of injunction applicable in the Nigerian judicial system. The work further examines the need for the Nigerian court to grant injunctions in matters of extreme urgency and the power of the court in granting injunction. It also considers the procedure by which the Nigerian courts grant the application of any type of injunction as well as the grounds that are sine qua non before the application of injunction is granted by the Nigerian courts. Finally, the work is concluded with a succinct summary and recommendation.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS </p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATION</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>HISTORY, DEFINITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF INJUNCTION IN NIGERIA<br/>JUDICIAL SYSTEM.</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: HISTORY OF INJUNCTION</p> <p>2.2.0: MEANING OF INJUNCTION</p> <p>2.3.0: DOCTRINAL BASIS OF INJUNCTION AND ITS APPLICATION IN NIGERIA JUDICIAL SYSTEM</p> <p>2.4.0: NATURE AND PURPOSE OF INJUNCTIONS</p> <p>2.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3 </p> <p>TYPES OF INJUNCTION AND ITS ENFORCEMENT</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: EX-PARTE INJUNCTION</p> <p>3.2.0: INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTION</p> <p>3.3.0: MANDATORY INJUNCTION</p> <p>3.4.0: MAREVA INJUNCTION</p> <p>3.5.0: ANTON PILLER INJUNCTION</p> <p>3.6.0: PERPETUAL INJUNCTION</p> <p>3.7.0: INJUNCTION IN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW</p> <p>3.8.0: ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS OF INJUNCTION</p> <p>3.9.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4<br/>EXAMINING OTHER FORMS OF INJUNCTION AND THE POWER OF THE<br/>COURT TO GRANT INJUNCTION</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: QUIA TIMET INJUNCTION</p> <p>4.2.0: INJUNCTION PENDING APPEAL</p> <p>4.3.0: ARBITRATION AND INJUNCTION</p> <p>4.4.0: INJUNCTIONS CONCERNING MATRIMONIAL<br/>MATTERS</p> <p>4.5.0: INJUNCTIONS IN DEFAMATION ACTION</p> <p>4.6.0: INJUNCTION IN LAND MATTERS</p> <p>4.7.0: TRIBUNAL OF ENQUIRY</p> <p>4.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>BOOK</p>\n\nEXCESS OF INJUNCTION IN NIGERIA JUDICIAL SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EXCESS OF INJUNCTION IN NIGERIA JUDICIAL SYSTEM", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>DUTY CARE : ITS IMPLICATION TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IN NIGERIA</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The Medical field is one of the most referred and reverenced profession in that it deals with the lives of human beings and in the course of their dealings with patients, these patients go through tests, operations, diagnosis to mention but a few. The Medical professionals in the course of discharging their duties are sometimes Negligent as regards adhering strictly to their professional Code of Conduct. For instance where a doctor leaves operating instruments in the abdomen of a patient. In Nigeria there exists a countless catalogue of Negligent cases in which the involved Medical Personnel go scot free because their victims are ignorant of their rights let alone enforcements of such rights. The peculiarities imposed on the practice of Medicine in Nigeria by our Culture and Environment have been examined. The laxity or absence of policing of drugs and food in Nigeria has been highlighted. It is clear from this that some Nigerian laws which relate to many aspects of Medicine are outmoded and inadequate. This particular point is emphasized especially in matters of abortion an mental illness. This Negligent act can be described as the breach of duties, standard, care and diligence required by the Medical Profession. The main focus of this long Essay is to discuss the Legal Implications of the breach of Duty in the Medical Profession. As regards this, solutions would be proferred to curb all acts which might later occur in the nearest future. This work is divided into five chapters, chapter one deals basically with the general introduction. Chapter two gives us an insight into Medicine as a whole, how it evolved in Nigeria and how we received it. Chapter three gives us a proper understanding of the concept, Duty of Care and Medical Negligence, Chapter four avails a Medical Practitioner the opportunity to be free from liability in essence, they have defences they can rely on. Lastly, Chapter five deals with the general conclusion.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTE</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1 </p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>MEDICINE IN PERSPECTIVE</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: EVOLUTION OF MEDICINE IN NIGERIA</p> <p>2.2.0: AN OVERVIEW OF THE MEDICAL &amp; DENTAL PRACTITIONERS ACT</p> <p>2.3.0: NATURE AND SCOPE OF MEDICAL ETHICS</p> <p>2.4.0: NATURE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY</p> <p>2.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>NEGLIGENCE AND DUTY OF CARE</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0:MEANING OF PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE</p> <p>3.2.0: ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE</p> <p>3.3.0: DUTY OF CARE</p> <p>3.4.0: CONSEQUENCES OF BREACH OF DUTY</p> <p>3.5.0: DAMAGES AS A RESULT OF BREACH OF DUTY</p> <p>3.6.0: CRIMINAL LIABILITY IN NEGLIGENCE</p> <p>3.6.1.0: MURDER OR CULPABLE HOMICIDE PUNISHABLE WITH DEATH</p> <p>3.6.1.1: MANSLAUGHTER OR CULPABLE HOMICIDE NOT PUNISHABLE WITH  DEATH</p> <p>3.7.0: BURDEN OF PROOF: RES IPSA LIQUITOR</p> <p>3.8.0: VICARIOUS LIABILITY IN NEGLIGENCE</p> <p>3.9.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>DEFENCES TO BREACH OF DUTY</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE</p> <p>4.1.1.0: REMOTENESS OF DAMAGE</p> <p>4.1.1.2: DEFENCE OF CONSENT</p> <p>4.1.1.3: DEFENCE OF ACCIDENT</p> <p>4.1.1.4: DEFENCE  OF EMERGENCY</p> <p>4.2.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>BOOKS</p> <p>NEWSPAPER REPORTS</p>\n\nDUTY CARE : ITS IMPLICATION TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DUTY CARE : ITS IMPLICATION TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IN NIGERIA", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE RELEVANCY AND ADMISSABILITY OF ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE IN NIGERIA</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>In an attempt to address this fundamental issue regarding the admissibility of electronically generated evidence, recourse shall be paid had to the word evidence itself. Evidence is the means by which facts are proved excluding inferences and arguments. There are times in court when we desperately need to rely on evidence in order to prove a very vital point or issue in court. This point can be proved through the use of electronic generated documents which are believed to be in line with section 97 of the evidence act. Due to growth in technology, the use of electronic device such as computer printout, storage and communication system have risen sharply, especially in commercial and financial transactions in Nigeria and the world over which makes business communication greater in use. It would therefore be wrong for these electronic devices not to be accepted in court, if it has been valued and accepted all over the world. The thesis considers the problems posed to the admissibility of electronically generated evidence and the challenges bothering on authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of the evidence and offers solutions to the problems or challenges that electronically generated evidence is facing. The essence of the foregoing is basically to give a detailed and sufficient analysis of the subject matter. As we know tendering and taking of evidence is inevitable in court proceedings and this thesis is set to focus on the electronically generated evidence; its importance and effect in our judicial system.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>DEFINITION OF EVIDENCE</p> <p>2.0.0:  INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: AN APPRAISAL OF WHAT IS EVIDENCE</p> <p>2.2.0: CLASSIFICATION OF JUDICIAL EVIDENCE</p> <p>2.3.0: RELEVANCY AND ADMISSIBILITY</p> <p>2.3.1: WHAT IS A FACT</p> <p>2.3.2: WHAT IS FACT IN ISSUE</p> <p>2.3.3: RELEVANT FACT</p> <p>2.4.0: DESCRIPTION OF AFFIDAVITS; AFFIDAVITS AND EXHIBITS</p> <p>2.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE; AN EXAMINATION.</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: EVIDENTIAL STATUS OF ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE</p> <p>3.2.0: ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE AND ITS  ADMISSIBILITY</p> <p>3.3.0: ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE ADMISSIBLE  WHETHER   AS PRIMARY OR SECONDARY EVIDENCE<br/>3.4.0: COMPUTER GENERATED EVIDENCE</p> <p>3.4.1: ADMISSIBILITY OF COMPUTER PRINTOUT AS EVIDENCE</p> <p>3.4.2: EVIDENCE OF THINGS SEEN THROUGH TELESCOPE AND    BINOCULARS</p> <p>3.4.3: TAPES, MOVIES, TELEPHONE CONVERSATION, TELEFAX AND OTHER SOUND RECORDINGS AS EVIDENCE</p> <p>3.4.4: HOW TO EXHIBIT ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE AND WEIGHT ATTACHED TO IT</p> <p>3.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>CHALLENGES POSED TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF ELECTRONICALLY</p> <p>GENERATED EVIDENCE</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE</p> <p>4.1.1: WAY OUT OF THE CHALLENGES</p> <p>4.2.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION.</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATIONS</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES IN JOURNAL</p> <p>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>BOOKS</p>\n\nCRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE RELEVANCY AND ADMISSABILITY OF ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE RELEVANCY AND ADMISSABILITY OF ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE IN NIGERIA", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CRITICALLY ANALYSIS OF CORROBORATION UNDER THE NIGERIAN LAW OF EVIDENCE</p> <p>ABSTRACT </p> <p>There is no law that says the plaintiff or the prosecution must bring a million witnesses or  evidence to court before he can succeed in his case. A court can convict on a single witness. A  case is not decided by the numbers of witnesses, single credible convincing evidence is enough  to convict in a case but there are some exceptions”. The exceptions refer to by this learned mean  the circumstances where corroboration will be required before any judge can decide his case.<br/>Although a judge can convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice but he must  warn himself before given such conviction in fact he is advised to seek corroborating evidence  before convicting an accused because failure to do so can lead to the setting  aside of his  judgment on appeal.<br/>Generally, corroboration cuts a niche for itself, it is used both in criminal and civil cases. It will  also state the position of judges on the issue of corroboration and various decisions of court on  different issues arising from corroboration. In law, corroboration, though popular yet  controversial virtually under all legal system this is due to the influence and interpretation of the  provisions of the Evidence Act and the criminal and penal codes (on corroboration of evidence)  by judges. The desirability of corroboration as a requirement in certain criminal and civil cases  under the Nigerian law of evidence and the hope of examine it critically under our legal system  is the core focus of this study. This work will therefore elucidate the meaning of corroboration in  Nigeria and Canada generally, the role of judges in deciding both civil and criminal cases and  various statutory  provisions in respect of corroboration  of evidence in Nigeria relying largely  on both primary and secondary  source of law of evidence in Nigeria.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS  </p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0:  INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0:  BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0:  OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0:  FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0   SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0:  METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0:  LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0:  CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>PRINCIPLE OF CORROBORATION</p> <p>2.0.0:  INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0:  HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF CORROBORATION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>2.2.0:  MEANING / DEFINITION</p> <p>2.3.0:  NATURE OF CORROBORATION</p> <p>2.4.0    EVIDENCE REQUIRING CORROBORATION</p> <p>2.5.0:  CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>RULES OF CORROBORATION</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0:  FORMS OF CORROBORATION</p> <p>3.1.1.0: AS A MATTER OF LAW</p> <p>3.1.1.1: AS A MATTER OF PRACTISE</p> <p>3.2.0:   TYPES OF CORROBORATION</p> <p>3.2.1.0: MUTUAL CORROBORATION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>RULES OF CORROBORATION<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0:  FORMS OF CORROBORATION</p> <p>3.1.1.0: AS A MATTER OF LAW</p> <p>3.1.1.1: AS A MATTER OF PRACTISE</p> <p>3.2.0:   TYPES OF CORROBORATION</p> <p>3.2.1.0: MUTUAL CORROBORATION</p> <p>3.2.1.1: CUMMULATIVE CORROBORATION</p> <p>3.2.1.2: IDENTIFICATION CASES AND CORROBORATION</p> <p>3.3.0: CORROBORATION UNDER THE COMMON LAW</p> <p>3.4.0:  CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>INCIDENCES OF CORROBORATION.</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: CORROBORATION IN CIVIL CASES</p> <p>4.2.0:  CORROBORATION IN CRIMINAL CASES</p> <p>4.3.0:  ROLES OF JUDGES AND JURY IN CORROBORATION</p> <p>4.4.0:  PROBLEMS OF CORROBORATION</p> <p>4.5.0:  SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS</p> <p>4.6.0:  CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p>\n\nCRITICALLY ANALYSIS OF CORROBORATION UNDER THE NIGERIAN LAW OF EVIDENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICALLY ANALYSIS OF CORROBORATION UNDER THE NIGERIAN LAW OF EVIDENCE", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A LEGAL APPRAISAL OF THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR REFORMS IN NIGERIA</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Nigeria’s electric power sector requires substantial reform if the country’s economic development and poverty alleviation programme is to be realized. Currently, the country faces serious energy crisis due to declining electricity generation from domestic power plants which are basically dilapidated, obsolete, and in an appalling state of disrepair, reflecting the poor maintenance culture in the country and gross inefficiency of the public utility provider. The government encouraged the private sectors to invest into the electricity industry so that, the monopoly created by the NEPA could be demolished and at the same time, some independent power producers could enter into the electricity sector. This understanding is behind the introduction of the Power Sector Reform Act 2005 which was recently initiated by the Nigerian government with the goal of privatizing the National Electric Power monopoly, NEPA.  Age long principles of democratic governance, of sovereignty belonging to the people, the people’s entitlement to participate in their governance and most importantly from the point of view of the topic of this paper, that security and the welfare of the people are the principal aim of government, form the theme of the provisions of section 13 of the 1999 Constitution.  In Section 16 of the same Constitution, the second aim of government of ensuring the welfare of the citizens seems to be pointedly enjoined as the state is mandated therein to harness national resources and promote national prosperity and an efficient, dynamic and self-reliant economy which it shall control to secure maximum welfare, freedom and happiness of the citizens and without truncating the rights of individuals to participate in the major economic areas.   Building on the analysis of the introduction of the Reform Act, this long essay intends to present the central issues that led to d enactment of the Reform Act, the key objectives of the Reform Act. This includes the legal reforms, the Act, the essential sections, licenses and tariffs, tariff regulation, consumer’s protection, the impact of the reform, the shortcomings of the reform, the innovations and the consequence of the reform.  This steady decline in the Nigeria Electric Power Sector has led to a near complete failure of the system at the onset of the present civilian regime in 1999. The Reform program also led to the establishment of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission in 2005 which was made responsible for the regulation of tariffs. This long essay will therefore also examine the role of NERC as a sector regulators and its impact so far in establishing a licensing regime that will be attractive to potential investors.</p> <p>As Nigeria implements its national utility privatization program, it is hoped that this legal review will benefit policy makers and emerging managers and providers of electric service in the country.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY.</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>EVOLUTION OF THE POWER SECTOR AND PRIVATIZATION</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: DISCOVERY OF ELECTRICITY</p> <p>2.2.0: HISTORY OF THE POWER SECTOR</p> <p>2.3.0: PRIVATIZATION</p> <p>2.3.1.0: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE TO PRIVATIZATION</p> <p>2.3.2.0: ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF PRIVATIZATION</p> <p>2.3.3.0: PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES OF PRIVATIZATION</p> <p>2.3.4.0: PRIVATIZATION CONSIDERATION</p> <p>2.4.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>POWER SECTOR REFORM IN NIGERIA</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: IMPACT OF THE POWER SECTOR REFORM ON ELECTRICITY</p> <p>3.2.0: PROPOSED REFORM</p> <p>3.3.0: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES</p> <p>3.3.1.0: ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL</p> <p>3.3.2.0: POLITICAL ISSUES</p> <p>3.3.3.0: TECHNICAL CHALLENGES</p> <p>3.3.4.0: ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS</p> <p>3.4.0:   OPPORTUNITIES</p> <p>3.4.1.0: EFFICIENCY AND RELIABILITY OF SERVICE</p> <p>3.4.2.0: INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES</p> <p>3.4.3.0: EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES</p> <p>3.4.4.0:TRANSFER OF TECHNICAL MANPOWER</p> <p>3.4.5.0: ENCOURAGEMENT OF RESEARCH</p> <p>3.5.0: RECOMMENDATIONS</p> <p>3.6.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>STATUTORY REGULATORY SCHEME FOR THE POWER SECTOR REFORM</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR REFORM ACT 2005</p> <p>4.2.0: INNOVATIONS OF THE ACT</p> <p>4.2.1.0: FORMATION OF INITIAL AND SUCCESSOR COMPANIES</p> <p>4.2.2.0: DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPETITIVE ELECTRICITY  MARKET</p> <p>4.2.3.0: ACQUISITION OF LAND AND ACCESS RIGHTS</p> <p>4.2.3.1.0: CONDITIONS FOR LAND ACQUISITION</p> <p>4.2.3.2.0: ACQUISITION OF ACCESS RIGHTS</p> <p>4.2.3.3.0: PROTECTION OF LAND AND ACCESS RIGHTS</p> <p>4.3.0: NATIONAL ELECTRIC REGULATORY COMMISSION</p> <p>4.3.1.0: STRUCTURE OF THE NERC</p> <p>4.3.2.0: GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE NERC</p> <p>4.3.3.0: LICENSING BY THE NERC</p> <p>4.3.3.1: INTERIM LICENSES</p> <p>4.3.3.2.: REGULAR LICENSES</p> <p>4.3.3.3: CHALLENGES OF LICENSING</p> <p>4.4.0: EXTENT OF THE ACT</p> <p>4.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS</p> <p>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>BOOKS</p> <p>NEWSPAPER REPORTS</p> <p>NEWSPAPER REPORTS ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>PAPERS PRESENTED AT CONFERENCES, WORKSHOPS  AND SEMINARS</p> <p>REPORTS AND OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS</p> <p>REPORTS AND OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS ON THE INTERNET</p>\n\nA LEGAL APPRAISAL OF THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR REFORMS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A LEGAL APPRAISAL OF THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR REFORMS IN NIGERIA", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ATTITUDE OF THE JUDICIARY TOWARDS ADMISSIBILITY OF CONFESSIONAL STATEMENT</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>A confession is a species of admission.

In such a partnership, public and private resources are pooled and responsibilities divided so that the partners‟ efforts are complementary. The private sector partner usually makes a substantial cash or equity investment in the project and the public sector gains access to new revenue or service delivery capacity,1 and this arrangement between the public and private sector differ from service contracting2.</p> <p>Public-Private partnerships relate to perceptions and practices affecting public private sector relationships in ensuring national/global health, development and well-being of the society, and the conceptual aspects of such relationships, including the role of the key players in collaborating to make these partnerships successful or otherwise.</p> <p>1Dr. Babalakin B. O. Public Private Partnership: „Infrastructure Development as a vehicle for Economic Development‟ (being a paper presented at the 2nd Mustapha Akanbi Public Lecture organized by the Faculty of Law University of Ilorin pg 6.)</p> <p>2 Service Contracting will be limited to the provision of service with no ownership interest accruing to the private sector.</p> <p>15</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>Though no single, universally accepted definition for public-private partnerships, PPP are often termed to mean different things to different people, which can make assessing and comparing international experience in such partnerships difficult. In general, PPP refers to form of cooperation between public authorities and the private sector to finance, construct, renovate, manage, operate or maintain an infrastructure or service. At their core, all PPP involve some form of risk sharing between the public and private sector to provide the infrastructure or service. The allocation of sizable and, at times significant, elements of risk to the private partner is essential in distinguishing a PPP from the more traditional public sector model of public service delivery. There are two basic forms of</p> <p>PPP:   contractual and institutional. Although institutional PPP have been quite successful in some circumstances, particularly in countries with well-developed institutional and regulatory capacities, contractual PPP are significantly more common, especially in developing economies.</p> <p>Although there is no universal consensus about the definition of public-private partnerships, the following elements typically characterize a PPP: The infrastructure or service is funded, in whole or in part, by the private partner. Risks are distributed between the public partner and private partner and are allocated to the party best positioned to manage each individual risk. PPP are complex structures, involving multiple parties and relatively high transaction costs. PPP is a procurement tool where the focus is payment for the successful delivery of services (the performance risk is transferred to the private partner).</p> <p>16</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>PPP    is an output-/performance-based arrangement as opposed to the traditional input-based model of public service delivery where the focus is payment for the successful delivery of services. PPP typically involve bundled services (i.e., design, construction, maintenance and operation) to increase synergies and discourage low-capital/high operating-cost proposals. In general, PPP offer a new and dynamic approach to managing risk in the delivery of infrastructure and services. Although PPP is considered a new concept that has gained prominence in the last 20 years, PPP have actually been around for hundreds of years, wherever the private sector has been involved in the delivery of traditional public services (i.e., water, roads, rail and electricity).</p> <p>In PPP arrangements, the private partner is typically compensated through either: User-based payments (i.e., toll roads, airport or port charges) Availability payments from the public authority [i.e., PFI, power purchase agreements (PPAs), water purchase agreements (WPAs)] A combination of the above in user-based payment structures, the government or public authority often needs to provide some financial support to the project to mitigate specific risks, such as demand risk, or to ensure that full cost recovery is compatible with affordability criteria and the public‟s ability to pay. Government support mechanisms can take many forms, such as contributions, investments, guarantees and subsidies, but they should be carefully designed and implemented to allow for optimal risk allocation between the public and private sectors. When government supports are present, the objective is to increase private capital mobilization per unit of public sector contribution. Availability payments are at the heart of one form of PPP, the</p> <p>17</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>PFI model. This system provides capital assets for the provision of public services. Developed in the U.K., this model is used for a large number of infrastructure projects and gives the private sector strong incentives to deliver infrastructure and services on time and within budget. PFIs simultaneously allow governments and public authorities to spread the cost of public infrastructure projects over several decades. This creates greater budget certainty, while also liberating scarce public resources for other social priorities. Government Support Mechanisms hosting governments can provide financial support to or reduce the financial risk of a project in many ways. Common forms of government support mechanisms include: Cash subsidy: The government or public authority agrees to provide a cash subsidy to a project. It can be a total lump sum or a fixed amount on a per unit basis, and payments can be made either in installments or all at once. Payment guarantee: The government agrees to fulfill the obligations of a purchaser (typically a publicly owned enterprise) with respect to the private entity in the case of non-performance by the purchaser. The most common example of this is when a government guarantees the fixed payment of an off-take agreement (e.g., PPA or WPA) between a private entity and the publicly owned enterprise. Debt guarantee: The government secures a private entity‟s borrowings by guaranteeing repayment to creditors in case of default. Revenue guarantee: The government sets a minimum variable income for the private partner; typically this income is from customer user fees. This form of guarantee is most common in roads with minimum traffic or revenue set by a government</p> <p>18</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Public private partnership arose as a medium for infrastructure development, i.e. to make available adequate infrastructure through public private partnership‟s development.</p> <p>Public private partnership can be said to be a crossover from the normal contracting of projects to private personnel to develop a particular project which the government will pay such private personnel for the provision of such projects and which may not later be fully completed. Here, essence of PPP is to see to the successful development of infrastructure by the contribution and collaboration of both the public and private sectors.</p> <p><strong>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The average Nigerian is suspicious of PPP and is usually of the belief that it is a means of transferring power or control of the nation among a favored few, they refuse to see and appreciate the burden encountered by the private sector and public in ensuring the availability of a lasting and well functioning infrastructure which can better and faster be achieved through PPP. It is therefore expected that the result of this study is to enlighten and or educate those persons ignorant of what PPP is actually about and its mode of operation.</p> <p><strong>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This essay is going to focus on the historical background of PPP, types, nature and importance of public private partnership. It shall also focus on how infrastructure is</p> <p>19</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>developed by PPP and also the advantages and problem faced by public private partnership.</p> <p><strong>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Public private partnership can be said to be a recent development which must be tread on so softly. PPP being a recent development is thus a delicate area of study, so this research will carefully examine widely the gains and benefits of PPP.</p> <p>The center of concentration being the effects PPP will have in a particular locality i.e. its advantages and disadvantages where it is being practiced and also how it helps in the provision of needed and necessary infrastructure</p> <p><strong>1.5.0: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Public Private Partnership is a recent development and there are certain steps to be put in place and or taken to successfully carry out a public private partnership contracts.</p> <p>Textbooks dealing on this topic are hard to come by, thus the primary sources of information are materials downloaded from the internet, paper presentation, published and unpublished articles which have all been of immense benefit to this essay.</p> <p>This essay is analytical and expository in nature and which shall attempt to shed light on gray and unpopular areas of PPP.</p> <p>20</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>This topic is both academic and practical considering the vital role public private partnership plays and expected to play in the society, for example it is an avenue which allows the government to be of constructive use and benefit to the public.</p> <p>As earlier said, there is shortage of books on PPP which therefore led to the use of paper presented, articles, publications, materials downloaded on the internet for use in the compilation and research on this essay.</p> <p>DR.

It was said that PPP arose due to pressure to change the standard model of public procurement which arose initially from concerns about the level of public debt, which grew rapidly during the macroeconomic dislocation of the 1970s and 1980s. Governments sought to encourage private investment in infrastructure, initially on the basis of accounting fallacies arising from the fact that public accounts did not distinguish between recurrent and capital expenditures.</p> <p>The article further stated that the idea that private provision of infrastructure represented a way of providing infrastructure at no cost to the public has now been generally abandoned; however, interest in alternatives to the standard model of public procurement persisted. In particular, it has been argued that models involving an enhanced role for the private sector, with a single private-sector organisation taking responsibility for most aspects of service provisions for a given project, could yield an improved allocation of risk, while maintaining public accountability for essential aspects of service provision.</p> <p>Initially, most public–private partnerships were negotiated individually, as one-off deals. In 1992, however, the Conservative government of John Major in the United Kingdom introduced the private finance initiative (PFI), the first systematic programme aimed at encouraging public–private partnerships. The 1992 programme focused on reducing the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, although, as already noted, the effect on public</p> <p>6public private partnership &lt;www.wikipedia.org/publicprivatepartnership&gt; Accessed on 12 February 2010</p> <p>22</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>accounts was largely illusory. The Labor government of Tony Blair, elected in 1997, persisted with the PFI but sought to shift the emphasis to the achievement of \"value for money,\" mainly through an appropriate allocation of risk.</p> <p>It should be of note that many more unmentioned materials have been of great contribution to this essay, also is oral discussions with legal practitioners and law students alike which of course cannot all be mentioned but has been of help in this essay.</p> <p><strong>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP</strong></p> <p>Public private partnership has been defined as arrangements between governments and private sector entities for the purpose of providing public infrastructure, community facilities and related services. Such partnerships are characterized by the sharing of investment, risk, responsibility and reward between the partners7.</p> <p>Public private partnership has also been defined by the Canadian council for PPP as co-operative venture where there is an allocation of the risks inherent in the provision of public service between the public and private sectors8</p> <p>7 Public private partnership; A guide for Local Government prepared by the British Colombia Ministry of Municipal Affairs, May 1999.</p> <p>8   U.

The term ‘foreign element’ means any system of law prevailing outside the lex fori, that is, the local law of the place where the court is situated. It includes not only the law existing in a state under a foreign political sovereign but also the law prevailing in a sub division of a political state of which the forum is part. The law of England and any other law of a country outside Nigeria can be treated as a foreign law. The laws of Northern Nigeria can also be treated as foreign law in the Southern Nigeria. There is also the inter-state conflict of laws, a situation which arises due to the divergent laws in each state.<br/>With the increasing international relationship around the world, conflicts are bound to arise. Municipal laws of a State, which were promulgated and enacted into law to guide her own affairs, differ from one country to the other. For example, the Nigerian Legal system has provisions different from English Legal system. Therefore, whenever a course of action arises between the two legal systems, and a decision is arrived at, such decision is referred to as the choice situation.<br/>For the purpose of this long essay, we shall be examining issues like in cases of dispute involving two or more municipal laws, which law should prevail? How will a State’s attitude to foreign law affect its recognition and enforcement? Also, to what extent will the municipal court give effect within the domestic rules of international law, which are contrary to domestic law, in cases where two or more customary laws are applicable, for example, in Nigeria, which one should prevail? All these and more shall be discussed in this essay.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACK GROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY:</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>THE NIGERIAN LEGAL SYSTEM</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: SOURCES OF THE NIGERIAN LEGAL SYSTEM</p> <p>2.1.1.0: PRIMARY SOURCES</p> <p>2.1.1.1: THE RECEIVED ENGLISH LAW</p> <p>2.1.1.2: NIGERIAN LEGISLATION</p> <p>2.1.1.3: CASE LAW/JUDICIAL PRECEDENT</p> <p>2.1.1.4: DELEGATED LEGISLATION</p> <p>2.1.2.0: SECONDARY SOURCES</p> <p>2.1.2.1: THE NIGERIAN CUSTOMARY LAW</p> <p>2.2.0: THE NIGERIAN COURTS</p> <p>2.3.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>CONFLICT OF LAWS AND CHOICE SITUATIONS</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: DOMICILE</p> <p>3.1.1.0: MARRIAGE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES</p> <p>3.1.1.1: SUCCESSION</p> <p>3.1.1.2: INFANTS</p> <p>3.1.1.3: RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF   FOREIGN  JUDGEMENT</p> <p>3.1.1.4: RENVOI</p> <p>3.2.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>INTERNAL CONFLICT OF LAWS</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: CASES BETWEEN NIGERIANS</p> <p>4.1.1.0: CASES BETWEEN NIGERIANS AND NON-NIGERIANS</p> <p>4.1.1.1: CHOICE OF CUSTOMARY LAW</p> <p>4.2.0: LIMITATION LAWS/ STATUTES OF LIMITATION</p> <p>4.3.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>BOOKS</p>\n\nA COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CONFLICT SITUATION AND CHOICE OF LAWS IN THE NIGERIAN LEGAL SYSTEM AND OTHER LEGAL SYSTEMS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CONFLICT SITUATION AND CHOICE OF LAWS IN THE NIGERIAN LEGAL SYSTEM AND OTHER LEGAL SYSTEMS", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>RIGHT OF EXPRESSION UNDER THE NIGERIAN CONSTITUTION: ISSUES AND CHALLENGES</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The entrenchment of Right of Expression as a fundamental human right in Nigeria could be traced to the 1960 Independence Constitution and those that followed it. The Independence Constitution of 1960 and the Republican Constitution of 1963 have provisions for the protection of fundamental human rights. The 1979 and the 1999 constitutions went further by providing a bill of right. This entrenchment of human right provisions in our constitutions was aimed at creating a society which protects political freedom as well as the social and economic well-being of Nigerians. However, despite the guarantee of fundamental rights and liberties in the Nigerian constitutions since 1960, the country has had the misfortune of military interruption in its polity. This had profound and far reaching effects on the promotion and protection of democratic values such as freedom of expression among Nigerians. This study examines the legal framework within which freedom of expression is practiced in Nigeria due to that fact that concepts such as freedom of expression are subject to various philosophical interpretations. It gives insight into the genesis of right of expression in the modern jurisprudence and provides a proper conceptual framework of human right from which freedom of expression is derivable. The study also examines the judicial attitudes in Nigeria in interpreting the subject matter. Furthermore, some limitations to right to expression which are premised in substantive and procedural laws are also considered. The practical relevance of social justice in the enforcement of this right in Nigerian also forms part of the study.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>TABLE OF TREATIES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE:</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO:</p> <p>THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEFINITION OF RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: DEFINITION OF RIGHT OF EXPRESSION</p> <p>2.2.0: THE EVOLUTION OF RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>2.3.0: THE SOURCES OF RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>2.4.0: CLASSIFICATION OF RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>2.5.0: RIGHT OF EXPRESSION AND NIGERIA MILITARY JUNTA</p> <p>2.6.0: RIGHT OF EXPRESSION THROUGH NIGERIAN CONSTITUTIONS</p> <p>2.7.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE:</p> <p>RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION UNDER THE NIGERIAN CONSTITUTION</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: RIGHT OF EXPRESSION VIS-À-VIS THE 1999 CONSTITUTION</p> <p>3.2.0: RIGHT OF EXPRESSION VIS-À-VIS NIGERIAN TELEVISION AUTHORITY ACT</p> <p>3.3.0: RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION VIS-À-VIS NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA ACT</p> <p>3.4.0: RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION VIS-À-VIS NEWSPAPER ACT</p> <p>3.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR:</p> <p>ENFORCEMENT AND LIMITATIONS TO RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHT OF EXPRESSION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>4.2.0: DEFAMATION AS LIMITATION TO RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION</p> <p>4.3.0: TYPES OF DEFAMATION</p> <p>4.4.0: DISTINCTION BETWEEN LIBEL AND SLANDER</p> <p>4.5.0: DEFENSES TO A CHARGE OF DEFAMATION</p> <p>4.6.0: MEANING OF SEDITION</p> <p>4.7.0: SEDITION AS LIMITATION TO RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>4.8.0: SEDITION: A LIVING OR DEAD LAW?</p> <p>4.9.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE:</p> <p>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATIONS</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p>\n\nRIGHT OF EXPRESSION UNDER THE NIGERIAN CONSTITUTION: ISSUES AND CHALLENGES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RIGHT OF EXPRESSION UNDER THE NIGERIAN CONSTITUTION: ISSUES AND CHALLENGES", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <p>THE RIGHT OF AN ACCUSED PERSON UNDER THE NIGERIAN LEGAL SYSTEM</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Under the Nigerian criminal justice the constitutional right of an accused person is enshrined in Section 35 and 36 of the Constitution of  the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 such rights include, the right to be informed promptly in the language that he understands, the details and nature of the offence of the accused, the right to be given adequate time to prepare his defence, the right to defend himself in person or by legal practitioner of his own choice, the right to have an interpreter free of charge if he does not understand the language of the court, the right to have record of the proceeding kept and the right to have copies of this within seven days of the conclusion of the case, the right to remain silent during the trial, the right not to be tried and convicted twice for the same offence, the right to be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty and the right not to be charged for an unwritten offence. All these rights aimed at ensuring that an accused person is not unjustly dealt with.<br/>Also the relevant provisions in CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE, CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT and the CHILD RIGHT ACT shed more light on the rights of an accused person in criminal trials. The thesis in its totality is channelled toward making sure that Nigerians are fully informed/aware of their rights especially the accused person and how it could be enforced. This project will not seek to look at the rights generally but most importantly the right of an accused person vis-a-vis the relevant provisions.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION:</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACK GROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>1.3.0: OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.7.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN RIGHTS</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RIGHT IN NIGERIA</p> <p>2.2.0: DISTINCTION BETWEEN HUMAN RIGHT AND FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT</p> <p>2.3.0:  CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>THE CONCEPT OF RIGHTS OF AN ACCUSED PERSON</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: THE RIGHT OF AN ACCUSED UNDER</p> <p>3.2.0: THE CONSTITUTION</p> <p>3.3.0: THE RIGHT OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE</p> <p>3.4.0: THE RIGHT OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT</p> <p>3.5.0: THE JUVENILE CRIME AND THE CHILD RIGHT ACT</p> <p>3.6.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>SAFEGUARD FOR THE RIGHT OF AN ACCUSED PERSON</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: THE AWAITING TRIAL OF AN IN-MATE AS AN ACCUSED PERSON</p> <p>4.2.0: THE ROLE OF LEGAL AID COUNSEL, BAR ASSOCIATION</p> <p>4.3.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATIONS</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n\nTHE RIGHT OF AN ACCUSED PERSON UNDER THE NIGERIAN LEGAL SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE RIGHT OF AN ACCUSED PERSON UNDER THE NIGERIAN LEGAL SYSTEM", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>JUDICIAL ATTITUDE TO HOMICIDE IN NIGERIA</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Criminal Law in Nigeria is so wide that it applies to a wide range of crimes. a crime is and actatute or by the Common Law to be a public wrong and is therefore punishable by the state in Criminal proceeding. The crime of homicide which can be divided into two namely, lawful homicide which is a division of homicide justified or excused by law and they are self defence, suppression of riot, defence of property etc. unlawful homicide is prohibited by law with very stiff punishment melted out to its offenders. Unlawful homicide could be either murder or manslaughter, murder is an intentional killing of and human being and its carries a severe punishment of a sentence to death while manslaughter is an unintentional killing of another which must have been through provocation, negligence, causation, omission etc. and its carries a sentence of life imprisonment.the actus reus and mens rea of a crime must be proven before and accused can be convicted, the burden of proving that the accused committed the crime is on the prosecution and it never shifts. This study will be narrowed down to homicide generally ,the problems facing in the proving of guilt of an accused person by the prosecution and solutions will be proferred.<br/>Chapter one, general introduction to the whole will be discussed.<br/>The second chapter unearths the different definition of crime by different jurists and legal writers,ts and legal writers, it will discuss the burden of prove in Criminal Cases,and the ingredients that constitute crime.<br/>Chapter three discusses extensively the critical and general overview of the meaning of homicide, under which lawful and unlawful would be discussed.<br/>Chapter four espouses the main aim of this study where the judicial trend of Courts will be discussed, also the origin and meaning of punishment, enforcement of homicide laws, punishment for crime of homicide will be discussed.<br/>The fifth chapter closes with the summary of the whole study, Recommendation would have been made towards the advancement of Criminal Law through the provisions of both the criminal code and the penal code.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT<br/>TABLE OF CASES<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATION</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0:   INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0:  BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0:  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>13.0:  FOCUS OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4.0:  SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0:  METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0:  LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0:  DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0:  CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>INTRODUCTION TO THE CONCEPT OF CRIME<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: MEANING OF CRIME<br/>2.2.0: INGREDIENTS THAT CONSTITUTE CRIME<br/>2.2.1: ACTUS REUS<br/>2.2.2: ACTS<br/>2.2.3: OMISSIONS<br/>2.2.4: ACTUS REUS AND CAUSATION<br/>2.3.0: PRINCIPLESOFMENS REA<br/>2.3.1: INTENTION<br/>2.3.2: PROOF OF INTENTION<br/>2.3.3: RECKLESSNESS<br/>2.3.4: KNOWLEGDE<br/>2.3.5 NEGLIGENCE<br/>2.3.6: MOTIVE<br/>2.4.0: BURDEN OF PROOF IN CRIMINAL CASES<br/>2.5.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>A CRITICAL AND GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE MEANING OF  HOMICIDE<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: WHAT IS HOMICIDE?<br/>3.2.0: DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAWFUL AND UNLAWFUL<br/>HOMICIDE<br/>3.3.0: UNLAWFUL HOMICIDE<br/>3.3.1: MURDER-CULPABABLE HOMICIDE PUNISHABLE WITH<br/>DEATH<br/>3.3.2: MANSLAUGHTER-CULPABABLE HOMICIDE NOT<br/>PUNISHABLE WITH DEATH<br/>3.3.3: VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER<br/>3.3.4: ELEMENTS OF PROVOCATION<br/>3.3.5: INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER<br/>3.4.0: LAWFUL HOMICIDE<br/>3.4.1: EXECUTION OF SENTENCE<br/>3.4.2: SELF DEFENCE<br/>3.4.3: DEATH BY MISADVENTURE<br/>3.4.4: SUPPRESSION OF RIOT<br/>3.4.5: DEFENCE OF PROPERTY<br/>3.4.6: CONSENT TO DEATH<br/>3.4.7: PREVENTION OF CERTAIN OFFENCES<br/>3.4.8: LAWFUL ARREST, PREVENTING ARREST OR RESCUE<br/>AFTER ARREST<br/>3.4.9: KILLING OF THIEVES<br/>3.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>EXAMINATION OF JUDICIAL ATTITUDE TO HOMICIDE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: ORIGIN OF PUNISHMENT<br/>4.2.0: ENFORCEMENT OF HOMICIDE LAWS IN NIGERIA<br/>4.3.0: PUNISHMENT FOR THE CRIME HOMICIDE<br/>4.4.0: JUDICIAL TREND OF COURTS IN HOMICIDE CASES<br/>IN NIGERIA<br/>4.5.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p>\n\nJUDICIAL ATTITUDE TO HOMICIDE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " JUDICIAL ATTITUDE TO HOMICIDE IN NIGERIA", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>COMPETENCE AND COMPELLABILITY: IS CHILD EVIDENCE ADMISSIBLE</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Determination of lawsuits is highly dependent on these availability of evidence. In law, every person is a competent witness in any judicial proceeding unless otherwise prevented by the law. And every compellable witness is a competent witness as the court will not compel anyone to give evidence, if he is incompetent to do so. However, it is not every competent witness that is compellable in court. Competence does not imply ‘reliable,’ thus a witness may legally speaking not be able to give evidence for several reasons. For example, the witness may be a child who is too young that he/she cannot understand the questions put to him or give rational answers to them. Compellability on the other hands deals with the question whether as a matter of law, witnesses can be obliged to give evidence when they do not wish to do so but there are some circumstances in which competent witnesses cannot be obliged to give evidence against their will. This long essay therefore aims at analyzing the competency and compellability of a child to give evidence as a witness with respect to how it affects availability and admissibility of evidence.  Chapter one of the long essay which is introductory explains the objectives, focus, extent and limitation of the study as well as the methodology employed in carrying out the research. Chapter two gives an insight as to the elements of the topic by explaining what Competency and Compellability of a witness imply. In chapter three the long essay considers who a child is in law and the conditions for the admissibility of his testimonies.  While chapter four sheds light on issues relating to compellability of a child witness and the effect of compelling an incompetent child witness.   Lastly, chapter five summarizes the findings of the research and made far reaching recommendations were offered as a forward It is strongly believed that if recommendations made herein are taken seriously and reflected in proposed  amendment to the Act, the would go along way in  improving the state of the law in that direction.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0:   METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0:   LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>COMPETENCE AND COMPELLABILITY OF WITNESS</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: MEANING AND PRINCIPLES OF COMPETENCY AND   COMPELLABILITY</p> <p>2.2.0: PROVISIONS OF THE EVIDENCE ACT ON COMPETENCE AND COMPELLABILITY</p> <p>2.3.0: EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL RULES</p> <p>2.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>THE EVIDENCE OF A CHILD</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: A CHILD UNDER THE LAW</p> <p>3.1.2.0: TESTIMONY OF A CHILD IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS</p> <p>3.1.3.0: TESTIMONY OF A CHILD IN CRIMINAL  PROCEEDINGS</p> <p>3.2.0: ADMISSIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE OF A CHILD</p> <p>3.3.0:  THE FULL INQUIRY TEST</p> <p>3.3.1.0: PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS</p> <p>3.3.2.0: NATURE OF AN   OATH</p> <p>3.4.0: THE ROLE OF THE COURT IN ADMITTING THE EVIDENCE OF A   CHILD</p> <p>3.5.0:  CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>EFFECTS OF UNCORROBORATED EVIDENCE OF A CHILD</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: COMPELLABILITY OF A CHILD</p> <p>4.2.0: THE EFFECT OF COMPELLING AN INCOMPETENT CHILD</p> <p>4.3.0: IMPORTANCE OF COMPETENCE AND COMPELLABILITY OF A CHILD</p> <p>4.4.0: THE POSITION OF THE EVIDENCE OF A CHILD TO PROVE A FACT</p> <p>4.5.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5  </p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0 CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0:RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>BOOKS</p>\n\nCOMPETENCE AND COMPELLABILITY: IS CHILD EVIDENCE ADMISSIBLE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPETENCE AND COMPELLABILITY: IS CHILD EVIDENCE ADMISSIBLE", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>APPRAISAL OF TRESSPASS AS A TORTIOUS ACTION UNDER THE LAW OF TORT</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>There is no branch of law which transpires the true picture of the society more than the law of tort. The reason being that it is a branch of law that deals with the conduct of the people amongst themselves. Because of the contact people have with themselves in the environment, there are bound to be fiction which will bring about injuries or wrong whether direct or in indirect and for this reason, the law of tort is put in place to compensate persons harmed by the wrongful conduct of others.<br/>One of the major aspects of tort is Trespass. The term trespass has been used in different senses by Lawyers and laymen but the most acceptable of all is that Trespass is the unlawful interference with one`s person, land, and chattel. The law of trespass seeks to protect or compensate it`s victim and its bases is the prevention of breaches of peace. Trespass can be classified into three types namely; Trespass to Person, Trespass to Land, and Trespass to Chattel.<br/>Trespass to person is any direct and immediate interference with personal liberty which is actionable parse and it comprises of Battery, Assault, and False Imprisonment. Trespass to land is the entering upon another person`s land without permission whether forcible or not. Trespass to land can be by wrongful entry, remaining on land, placing things on land, and trespass above and beneath the surface of land. Trespass to chattel us a direct and wrongful interference in the possession of another. Conversion and Detinue come under trespass to chattel and there is no doubt that there are differences between the two even though they seem similar.<br/>This research work seeks to examine the principles of law applicable to Trespass to person, Trespass to land, and Trespass chattel which form the major classifications of Trespass with a view to enlightening the general public. Moreover, there are cases where a person may seek to justify his actions. Such justifications in law are known as defences. These defences shall be examined in the course of this research work.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>INTERVIEWS AND PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>TRESPASS TO PERSON</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: BATTERY</p> <p>2.2.0: ASSAULT</p> <p>2.3.0: FALSE IMPRISONMENT</p> <p>2.4.0: DEFENCE OF PERSON OR PROPERTY</p> <p>2.4.1: DEFENCE OF CONSENT</p> <p>2.4.2: DEFENCE OF LAWFUL ARREST</p> <p>2.5.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>TRESPASS TO LAND</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: TRESPASS BY WRONGFUL ENTRY</p> <p>3.2.0: TRESPASS BY REMAINING ON LAND</p> <p>3.3.0: TRESPASS BY PLACING THINGS ON LAND</p> <p>3.4.0: TRESPASS ABOVE AND BENEATH THE SURFACE OF LAND</p> <p>3.5.0: INTERFERENCE WITH POSSESSION</p> <p>3.6.0: DOES SELF-HELP CONSTITUTE A VALID DEFENCE?</p> <p>3.7.0: DEFENCE OF LICENCE</p> <p>3.7.1: DEFENCE OF JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>3.8.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>TRESPASS TO CHATTEL</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: TRESPASS ACTIONABLE PERSE</p> <p>4.2.0: CONVERSION</p> <p>4.2.1: CONVERSION BY TAKING</p> <p>4.2.2: CONVERSION BY USING</p> <p>4.2.3: CONVERSION BY WRONGFUL TRANSFER OF TITLE</p> <p>4.2.4: CONVERSION BY DETENTION</p> <p>4.3.0: DETINUE</p> <p>4.4.0: DEFENCE</p> <p>4.5.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p>\n\nAPPRAISAL OF TRESSPASS AS A TORTIOUS ACTION UNDER THE LAW OF TORT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPRAISAL OF TRESSPASS AS A TORTIOUS ACTION UNDER THE LAW OF TORT", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT<br/>The decree of dissolution of marriage which is defined as the legal separation o f man and wife effected by the judgement or decree of a court, and either totally dissolving the marriage relation, or suspending its effect so far as it concerns the cohabitation of the parties. Dissolution of marriage seems to be on the increase these days, this is due to the fact that people rushed into ill-advised marriages and they decided to rush out of these marriages as soon as they discovered that their marriages are not what they expected. Therefore, no proceedings for dissolution may be instituted within two years of marriage without leave of court except where divorce proceedings are based on the facts of wilful and persistent refusal to consummate, adultery or the commission of rape, sodomy or bestiality. The subject matter of this research is to examine the nature and the conditions for dissolution of marriage, the likely problems that tend to follow and prospects. However, the study will further discuss the various types of marriage, validity of customary marriage and statutory marriage, capacity and formalities of marriage. In carrying out this research, emphasis will be laid on the various grounds for dissolving statutory marriage under the Matrimonial Causes Decree and the Marriage Act 1970 and customary marriage under the customary law. Also, the differences between dissolution of customary marriage and statutory marriage. But, it should be noted that, it is not the intention of the researcher to see that marriages which are ordained by God and which were hitherto, build on mutual trust and confidence between the parties and their families go asunder. But rather, to discourage spouses on dissolution of their marriages by providing a lasting solution to this, in order for us to have a better society and also to consider the pathetic effect of such on the society, children and family.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS </p> <p>ABSTRACT<br/>TABLE OF CASES<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATION</p> <p>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERATION INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2<br/>CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: DEFINITIONS OF MARRIAGE<br/>2.2.0: TYPES OF MARRIAGE<br/>2.2.1.0: MONOGAMOUS MARRIAGE<br/>2.2.2.0: POLYGAMOUS MARRIAGE<br/>2.3.0: FORMALITIES FOR MARRIAGE<br/>2.3.1.0: NOTICE OF MARRIAGE<br/>2.3.2.0: REGISTRAR’S CERTIFICATE<br/>2.3.3.0: SPECIAL LICENCE<br/>2.4.0: CAPACITY TO MARRIAGE<br/>2.4.1.0: SINGLE STATUS<br/>2.4.2.0: INFANCY<br/>2.4.3.0: AGE<br/>2.4.4.0: CONSENT<br/>2.5.0: GROUNDS ON WHICH MARRIAGE MAY BE VOID<br/>2.5.1.0: EXISTING LAWFUL MARRIAGE<br/>2.5.2.0: PROHIBITED DEGREE OF AFFINITY  OR CONSANGUINITY<br/>2.5.3.0: FORMAL INVALIDITY<br/>2.6.0: GROUNDS ON WHICH MARRIAGE IS VOIDABLE<br/>2.6.1.0: INCAPACITY TO CONSUMMATE MARRIAGE<br/>2.6.2.0:UNSOUNDNESS OF MIND, MENTAL DISORDER AND EPILEPSY<br/>2.6.3.0: VENERAL DISEASE<br/>2.7.0: MATRIMONIAL CAUSES JURISDICTION<br/>2.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3<br/>DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: BARS TO A PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE<br/>3.1.1.0: CONDONATION<br/>3.1.2.0: CONNIVANCE<br/>3.1.3.0: COLLUSION<br/>3.1.4.0: PETITIONER’S ADULTERY<br/>3.1.5.0: PETITIONER’S DESERTION<br/>3.1.6.0: CONDUCT CONDUCING<br/>3.2.0: DISSOLUTION OF STATUTORY MARRIAGE<br/>3.3.0: GROUNDS FOR DISSOLUTION OF STATUTORY MARRIAGE<br/>3.3.1.0: WILFUL AND PERSISTENT REFUSAL TO CONSUMATE MARRIAGE<br/>3.3.2.0: ADULTERY AND INTOLERABILITY<br/>3.3.3.0: DESERTION<br/>3.4.0: DISSOLUTION OF CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE<br/>3.5.0: GROUNDS FOR DISSOLUTION OF CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE<br/>3.5.1.0: GENERAL GROUNDS<br/>3.5.2.0: STATUTORY GROUNDS<br/>3.6.0:DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DISSOLUTION OF CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE AND STATUTORY MARRIAGE<br/>3.7.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4<br/>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: GENERAL PROBLEMS OF DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE<br/>4.1.1.0: FINANCIAL PROBLEM<br/>4.1.2.0: PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM<br/>4.1.3.0: LACK OF PROPER MAINTENANCE<br/>4.1.4.0: SETTLEMENT OF PROPERTY<br/>4.1.5.0: CUSTODY OF CHILDREN<br/>4.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>ARTICLES ON INTERNET<br/>BOOKS</p>\n\nDISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>AN APPRAISAL OF THE COURT AND CONSTITUTIONALISM IN NIGERIA: A DECADE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Democracy is undoubtedly the commonest system of government mostly practiced in virtually all the countries of the world because it ensures the observance of people‟s rights and freedom. It is however basically characterized by three independent arms of government namely; the Legislative, Executive and the Judicial arm of government. While the Legislature is responsible for making laws and the Executive is charged with the implementation of such law, the Judiciary is responsible for the interpretation of the law in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. In line with the doctrine of separation of powers, which is a cardinal feature of a democratic system, the Nigerian Constitution guarantees the independence of the Judiciary. The Judiciary as an arm of government owes an essential duty to interpret the provisions of the law when they are in question, thus the court (judiciary) is referred to as the last hope of the common man.<br/>Be that as it may, the idea of constitutionalism is yet another concept that primarily operates in a democratic setting. Constitutionalism however connotes the belief in a democratic government where the affairs of the state are operated according to the provisions of the law. Basically, this work will adopt a purposeful effort to scrutinize the liberal constitutionalism and capture its salient features not merely as an imposition of limitation on exercise of powers, but also as a mechanism for accountable and developmental exercise of powers. Although some Critics had severally argued that the principle of constitutionalism is rarely observed in this part of the world.<br/>From the foregoing, the object of this work is principally in two folds. Firstly, to appraise the judiciary as an arm of government, vis-à-vis the Nigerian legal system. It is a common knowledge that the function of the judiciary is to provide judicial justice to the people where the circumstances so demand. Secondly, this work will make a deliberate attempt to properly examine the concept of Constitutionalism in our contemporary society. To this end, it is apposite to bring to the fore some concepts which are intricately intertwined with the principle of Rule of Law and how the courts had reacted to them in the last ten years.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE GENERAL INTRODUCTION </p> <p>1.0.0 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1 1.1.0 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0 FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0 LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0 DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0 CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO THE JUDICIARY  <br/>2.0.0  INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0  THE JUDICIARY AS AN ARM OF GOVERNMENT</p> <p>2.2.0  THE FUNCTIONS OF THE JUDICIARY UNDER THE 1999 CONSTITUTION</p> <p>2.3.0   CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER THREE IMPEACHMENT OF ELECTED OFFICERS  <br/>3.0.0  INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0  HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IMPEACHMENT</p> <p>.2.0  THE NATURE AND DEFINITION OF IMPEACHMENT</p> <p>3.3.0  IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE 1999 CONSTITUTION</p> <p>3.4.0   THE FOURTH REPUBLIC AND THE IMPEACHMENT HURRICANE</p> <p>3.5.0  THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS</p> <p>3.6.0  THE EFFECT OF IMPEACHMENT IN THE NIGERIAN POLITY</p> <p>3.7.0  CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER FOUR THE DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS  <br/>4.0.0  INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0  HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF SEPARATION OF POWERS</p> <p>4.2.0  JURISPRUDENTIAL BASIS OF SEPARATION OF POWERS<br/>12<br/>4.3.0  SCHOLARLY EXPOSITIONS OF THEORISTS AND JURUISTS ON SEPARATION  OF POWERS</p> <p>4.4.0  THE NATURE OF THE DOCTRINE UNDER THE 1999 C0NSTITUTION</p> <p>4.5.0  THE APPLICATION OF THE DOCTRINE IN THE NIGERIAN POLITY</p> <p>4.6.0  CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER FIVE CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  <br/>5.0.0  CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0  RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES IN JOURNAL</p> <p>BOOKS</p> <p>CHAPTERS IN BOOKS</p> <p>NEWS PAPER REPORTS</p> <p>PAPERS PRESENTED AT CONFERENCES,WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE COURT AND CONSTITUTIONALISM IN NIGERIA: A DECADE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF THE COURT AND CONSTITUTIONALISM IN NIGERIA: A DECADE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <p><strong>WILL: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS UNDER COMMON AND ISLAMIC LAW</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The conceptual divergence in respect of the formation of a valid will under both Islamic and common laws will be examined and discussed. Starting from introduction which will introduce us to the general message of the work. The chapters therein have been divided into five.</p> <p>Chapter one deals with the introduction as mentioned above, and chapter two will talk on pre and post Islamic era of Will.</p> <p>Chapter three deals with Will under Common Law, its position in the common law as well as under the English statute. Chapter four on the other hand, deals with the analytical comparison of what has been discussed in both chapters two and three, while chapter five, as the last chapter will focus on the general remark, summary and conclusion.</p> <p>In the Jahiliyah period, before the advent of Islam, Arabs dispose of their properties as they like, as no law concerning bequest or inheritance ever existed to guide them. They could make bequest in favour of any one, depriving their own heirs such as their children, wives and parents. But by the advent of Islam, the legal Quranic injunctions in respect of Will were revealed. These are that wasiyyah (Will) can be made only on 1/3 (one-third) of the entire estate; that no one can make a Will in respect of any legal Quranic heirs etc.</p> <p>On the other hand the English concept of Will under the common law has also made it un-compulsory on a testator to include any provision for his wife and children, that he could make his will in favour of any person without limitation what so ever.</p> <p>Under Islamic law, a testator in not bound to make a will in writing, neither the witness are bound to attest to it. A bequest in Islamic law may either be in writing or by words of mouth. In either case, it should at least be made before two witnesses. While under the common law, the testator must make the will in writing and signed in the presence of witnesses, who should also attest to it as prescribed.</p> <p>Distinguishing feature in the area of capacity in term of age, in also a remarkable aspect which has been resolved in this research. Under the Islamic law, physical puberty is attained at the age of fifteen (15) or above. While under the common law, the Wills Act of 1837 provides that no will made by a person under the age of twenty-one (21) should be valid, exceptora few exceptions.</p> <p>Further more, in Sharia, bequeathal property should not be something declared illegal or prohibited to possess, such as pigs, intoxicants etc. But under the English law, there is no such provision.</p> <p>From afore analysis, we are able to establish that wasiyyah or Will under the Islamic law is of a divine nature, deriving its validity from the Holy Quran and tradition of the Holy prophet Muhammad (S.A.W).while will under the received English law is never of such divinity, gaining its origin and authority from Man-made arrangement, i.e. the Will Act of 1637.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/></strong></p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Table of Cases</p> <p>Table of Statutes</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE:</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.0.0    Introduction</p> <p>1.1.0    Background to the Study</p> <p>1.2.0    Aims and Objectives of Study</p> <p>1.3.0    Focus of Study</p> <p>1.4.0    Scope of Study</p> <p>1.5.0    Methodology</p> <p>1.6.0    Literature Review</p> <p>1.7.0    Conclusion</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.0.0    Introduction</p> <p>2.1.1     Historical Background of Will Under Islamic Law</p> <p>2.1.1.0   Nature of Will in Pre- Islamic Era</p> <p>2.1.1.1   Nature of Will in Post – Islamic Era</p> <p>2.2.0     Definition of Will in Islamic Law</p> <p>2.2.1.0 Essential Elements of Will Under Islamic Law</p> <p>2.2.1.1 The Testator (Al- Moosiy)</p> <p>2.2.1.2   The Beneficiary (Al Moosiy Lahu)</p> <p>2.2.1.3   The Subject Matter of Will (Al Moosiy Bi- Hi)</p> <p>2.2.2.0  The Capacity of the Testator</p> <p>2.2.2.1   Infancy</p> <p>2.2.2.2   Insanity</p> <p>2.2.2.3   Intoxication</p> <p>2.2.2.4   Mistake, Duress and Coercion</p> <p>2.2.3       Formalities (Seegha)</p> <p>2.2.4       Witnesses</p> <p>2.3.0       Conclusion</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0.0     Introduction</p> <p>3.1.1     Historical Background of Will Under Common Law</p> <p>3.1.1.0   Nature of Will at Common Law</p> <p>3.1.1.1 Nature of Will under the Statute</p> <p>3.2.0       Definition of Will under the Common English Law</p> <p>3.2.1.0   Essential Element of Will in Common Law</p> <p>3.2.1.1   The Testator</p> <p>3.2.1.2   The Legatee</p> <p>3.2.1.3   The Subject – Matter of Will</p> <p>3.2.2.0   Capacity of the Testator</p> <p>3.2.2.1   Infancy</p> <p>3.2.2.2    Insanity</p> <p>3.2.2.3    Infirmity or Natural Weakness</p> <p>3.2.2.4    Mistake, Fraud, Duress, Coercion and Undue Influence</p> <p>3.2.3     Formalities</p> <p>3.2.4    Witnesses</p> <p>3.3.0     Conclusion</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p><strong>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF WILL UNDER ISLAMIC AND ENGLISH LAWS</strong></p> <p>4.0.0   Introduction</p> <p>4.1.0   A Comparative Analysis of Historical Background</p> <p>4.1.1   A Comparative Analysis of Definition</p> <p>4.1.2   A Comparative Analysis of Essentials</p> <p>4.2.0   Muslim Wills, and English Law: An Examination of Yunusa vs.</p> <p>Adesubokan</p> <p>4.3.0   Conclusion</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p>5.1    Recommendation</p> <p>5.2    Conclusion</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n\nWILL: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS UNDER COMMON AND ISLAMIC LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WILL: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS UNDER COMMON AND ISLAMIC LAW", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>O<strong>FFENCE OF ADOPTION: LAW AND POLICY IN THE NIGERIA LEGAL SYSTEM</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The essence of this work is borne out of the need to take critical look and an appraisal of the offence of Adoption under the Nigeria Legal System. In the course of this Study, an analysis shall be made as to it’s Law and Policy in the Nigeria Legal System. Chapter one of this work will give the basic introduction to this work, the background of the study, the object of this work, i.e. offence of adoption will be examined. Chapter two, will look deeply into the concept of Adoption in Nigeria vis-à-vis, the history of Adoption legislation in Nigeria, the adoption provision of the Child’s Right Act 2003, the procedure for the making of an Adoption Order, children who may be adopted, person’s who may adopt, consent required for adoption and finally the inter-country adoption system. Chapter three of this work, thus will look at the law and policy of adoption in Nigeria and the welfare of an adopted child.</p> <p>The global interest on the welfare of children in relation to their rights, duties, maintenance and status on the society, will be strictly considered as the place of children in many societies, cannot be undermined being the future of any society. Chapter four of this work, will look into the offense of Adoption under the Nigeria legal system and the legal effect of Adoption under the Nigeria legal system equally. Chapter five, will give a general conclusion and recommendations. Thus, this work is intended primarily to make adoption process to be legalized in order to give adequate attention to the welfare of innocent children, not only this but also to explain the current tread and orders in adoption proceedings. In the green days of childhood, the young begins their irreversible march into the future with the resolution and sweet calmness of innocence, the march of childhood goes on as the human race endures. To this end, the writer of this study, though it wise to give credence to the burning issue surrounding the welfare of Adopted children, the effect of Adoption on the adopted child and upon the adopting parent, the offence of adoption, and also to expose the inadequaties in our Law, proffering necessary proposals for reform which the government and indeed the Law Reform Commission may consider to take care of the present peculiarities as regards the welfare of adopted children, thereby laying a sure foundation for Nigeria tomorrow.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LISTS OF ABBREVIATION</p> <p>CHAPTER 1:  </p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1   INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.2   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3   OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.4   FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>1.5   SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.6   METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.7   LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.8   DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.9   CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2:   </p> <p>THE CONCEPT OF ADOPTION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>HISTORY OF ADOPTION LAW IN NIGERIA</p> <p>ADOPTION PROVISIONS OF THE CHILD’S RIGHT ACT 2003</p> <p>PROCEDURE FOR THE MAKING OF ADOPTION ORDER</p> <p>CHILDREN WHO MAY BE ADOPTED</p> <p>PERSON WHO MAY ADOPT</p> <p>RESIDENCE AND NATIONALITY FOR ADOPTION</p> <p>CONSENT REQUIRED FOR ADOPTION</p> <p>INTER-COUNTRY ADOPTION SYSTEM</p> <p>CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3:        </p> <p>LAW AND POLICY OF ADOPTION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>LAW AND POLICY OF ADOPTION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>LEGAL CONTROLS AND ADOPTION PRACTICES</p> <p>JURISDICTION OF COURT</p> <p>FUNCTION OF THE COURT</p> <p>WELFARE OF AN ADOPTED CHILD</p> <p>CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4:      </p> <p>THE OFFENCE OF ADOPTION UNDER THE NIGERIA LEGAL SYSTEM</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>OFFENCE OF ADOPTION</p> <p>PROHIBITION OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN AN ADOPTER AND THE ADOPTED JUVENILE</p> <p>PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS</p> <p>RESTRICTION OF SENDING JUVENILE AWAY FOR ADOPTION.</p> <p>VISIT TO ADOPTED CHILD BY CHILD DEVELOPMENT OFFICER’S</p> <p>LEGAL EFFECT OF ADOPTION UNDER THE NIGERIA LEGAL SYSTEM</p> <p>RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF PARENT AND ADOPTER OF A JUVENILE</p> <p>CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5:    </p> <p>CONCLUSION</p> <p>RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLE ON INTERNET</p> <p>BOOKS</p> <p>PRESENTATION OF PAPERS</p>\n\nOFFENCE OF ADOPTION: LAW AND POLICY IN THE NIGERIA LEGAL SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OFFENCE OF ADOPTION: LAW AND POLICY IN THE NIGERIA LEGAL SYSTEM", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>AN EXAMINATION OF LAWS REGULATING ELECTION PETITIONS IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF NIGERIA </p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Today, its no doubt that election petition forms an intrinsic nature of our democratic setting as dispute and dissatisfaction are bound to arise from the conduct of election and as such dispute has to be resolved and determined by a competent judicial bodies in order to maintain the interest law and order in the Country. The Constitution in fairness to this has created a special adjudicatory bodies otherwise called the tribunals and these as well include the National Assembly Election Tribunal, the Governorship and Legislative House Election Tribunal and the Court of Appeal with exclusive jurisdiction on matters pertaining to the presidential election but left a vacuum that has to do with laws creating and regulating Local Government Election Tribunal. This has therefore led to a lot of idea as to the nature and forms of laws regulating election petition in some Local Government in Nigeria. The project therefore examines the various Laws regulating election petition in some Local Government of Nigeria. The project examines particularly Bauchi and Kwara States Laws regulating election petition in their Local Governments.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>TABLE OF CASES<br/>TABLE OF

justice in Nigerian courts, problems and prospects” seems to attract to itself the attention and inquisitiveness on the part of the common man or every believer in   the Rule of law of what the writer is talking about or what he is going to upon since the mere mention of justice in our society today raises a conjecture and thereafter suffers from universally acceptable definition.</p> <p>An attempt is made in this essay to scrutinize what hampers the judicial powers vested in the courts under section 6(6)(b) of 1999 constitution which it is said shall extend to all matters between persons, or between government or authority and to any person in Nigeria, and to all actions and proceedings relating thereto, for the determination of any question as to the civil rights and obligations of that person.</p> <p>Also considered in the essay are the ‘defects’ in and/ or ‘injustices’ written into the substantive law. For instance the ouster of court’s jurisdiction, the down payment or deposit of a substantial amount of money paid into a court before a challenge to chieftaincy dispute is entertained, discrimination on the grounds of protection to the public officers of the state and the adoption of foreign culture and archaic statutes that were largely meant to nurture a colonial society among others are written into or found in the basic law of the state , then it is not possible to talk of justice under such a system. Sometimes a system fails because of procedural defects and inadequacies. When there exists structural injustice in the location of courts (for instance a poor litigant resides share, Kwara state and the Supreme courts is located in Abuja) and there is imbalance in the distribution of wealth in the society, there, the law is easily seen as instrument of oppression and a protection of the status quo.</p> <p>The above issues and some other interesting topics like the role or the part played by some agencies like the police, the Bar and the prison in the prosecution of cases will be considered in this essay and provide an avenue for the assessment of their performance in the administration of justice.</p> <p>The independence of the judiciary is not left untouched as it is a necessary adjunct to the proper administration of justice.</p> <p>The essay finally attempts to offer some useful suggestions and recommendations to arrest the ills plaguing our society today, as some stemmed from both internal and global structural ‘injustices’. However the essay is not claiming to be exhaustive.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>INTERVIEWS AND PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1: GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0 : BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0 : OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0 : SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF THE TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0: : CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2: PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE</p> <p>2.0.0 : INTRODUTION</p> <p>2.1.0 : POWERS OF COURTS</p> <p>2.2.0: OUSTER OF THE COURT JURIDICTION</p> <p>2.3.0: PROBLEM OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE</p> <p>2.4.0    LOCUS STANDI AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE</p> <p>2.5.0 : STATUTE BAR</p> <p>2.6.0: OBEDIENCE/DISOBEDIENCE OF LAWFUL COURT ORDER</p> <p>2.7.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3: INSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: PROSECUTION OF CASES BY THE POLICE</p> <p>3.2.0: DELAYS IN RECEIVING REPORTS FROM</p> <p>GOVRNMENT EXPERTS</p> <p>3.3.0: THE ROLE OF THE BAR (OFFICIAL AND PRIVATE)</p> <p>3.4.0: AN APPRAISAL OF THE PRISON AND REMAND HOMES</p> <p>FOR JUVENILES</p> <p>3.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4: INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: SOURCE OF JUDICIAL POWERS</p> <p>4.2.0: APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES</p> <p>4.3.0: TENURE OF OFFICE OF JUDICIAL OFFICERS</p> <p>4.4.0: REMUNERATION OF JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND</p> <p>FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE</p> <p>4.5.0: OTHER STAFF IN THE JUDICIARY</p> <p>4.6.0:   CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAMME</p> <p>4.7.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5: GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS</p> <p>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>BOOKS</p> <p>CHAPTERS IN BOOKS</p> <p>NEWSPAPER REPORTS</p> <p>NEWSPAPER ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>PAPERS PRESENTED AT CONFERENCES, WORKSHOP AND SEMINARS</p> <p>REPORTS AND OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS</p> <p>REPORTS AND OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS ON THE INTERNET</p>\n\nADMINISTRATION OF JUSTCIE IN NIGERIAN COURTS, PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTCIE IN NIGERIAN COURTS, PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS", "id": 50}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF PRESUMPTIONS IN RELATION TO THE LAW OF EVIDENCE</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p> Presumption either of law or of fact, is an independent piece of evidence which may or must be drawn from a given sets of facts until the contrary is proved. In general sense, it has cut a niche for itself as it maybe employed in both Civil and Criminal cases. This study will therefore examine the various incidences where presumptions must or may be made before there can be a conviction and how they have been affected by various judicial and statutory authorities.</p> <p>The essay would also analyse various decisions of the court on different issues arising from both presumptions of law and presumptions of facts and their legal effects. The essay posits that, presumption is popular and incontrovertible under virtually all legal systems and that under the Nigerian legal system, the popularity and controvertibility of presumption did not abase. This is established owing to the influence and interpretation of the provisions of the Evidence Act and the Criminal and Penal Codes (on presumptions) by the judges.</p> <p>A conclusion made as to the existence or non-existence of a fact that must be drawn from other evidence that is admitted and proven to be true. If certain facts are established, a judge or jury must assume another fact that the law recognizes as a logical conclusion from the proof that has been introduced. A presumption differs from an inference, which is a conclusion that a judge or jury may draw from the proof of certain facts if such facts would lead a reasonable person of average intelligence to reach the same conclusion.</p> <p>Conclusive presumption is one in which the proof of certain facts makes the existence of the assumed fact beyond dispute. The presumption cannot be rebutted or contradicted by evidence to the contrary. For example, a child younger than seven is presumed to be incapable of committing a felony. There are very few conclusive presumptions because they are considered to be a substantive rule of law, as opposed to a rule of evidence.</p> <p>The essay also focuses on the desirability of presumptions as a requirement in certain criminal and civil cases under the Nigerian Law of Evidence. Finally the analysis of the long essay examined the role of the court, and the juris prudential basis of the various statutory provisions in respect of presumptions in the Law of Evidence in Nigeria and in some other jurisdictions.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p> CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0.

As indicated above, confessions represent the most important and most frequently encountered exception to the rule against hearsay in criminal cases, fundamental changes in the law pertaining to confessions were introduced by the Evidence Act 1990, but in order to understand the principles of admissibility of confessions, it is necessary to understand the principles of admissibility developed at common law to govern the admissibility of confessions. Apparently, we will summarize the most important aspects of the common law rules, we will then proceed to examine the new statutory definition and rules of admissibility of confessions.</p> <p>While the common law recognized that a confession might be both reliable and cogent as evidence of guilt, and indeed saw no objection to a conviction in cases where a confession was the only evidence against the accused, the law recognized that a confession could be regarded as reliable only when given freely and voluntarily. If coerced on forced, reliability of the confession might be totally compromised and the integrity of the system of administration of justice itself made to suffer. The exclusion of evidence obtained through torture, force or other coercive methods was the means of protection of the accused developed by the judges during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when the memory of an age when such methods were commonplace still lingered. Its significance may be gauged by the fact that in English law, the rule that a confession obtained by oppression, in circumstances likely to render it unreliable must be excluded, is the only instance of the mandatory exclusion of illegality or unfairly obtained evidence. The classic statement of the common law rule as to admissibility of confession was that of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim .V. R1</p> <p>          “It has been established that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shown by the persecution to have been voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear, or prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority”.</p> <p>In common parlance, ‘voluntary’ meant simply of one’s free will’. That test of voluntariness, as defined by Lord Sumner was supplemented by Lord Parker C.J in Callis .V. Gunn2, when he</p> <ol><li>(1914) A C 559, 609</li> <li>(1964) IQB 495,501</li> </ol> <p>added the requirement that a confession must not have been</p> <p>obtained in ‘an oppressive manner’, his observation was, strictly speaking, obiter – the case involved the admissibility of fingerprint evidence. But when the Judges’ Rules appeared in revised form in 1964, the introduction started that the rules did not affect the principle, which was overriding and applicable in all cases that:</p> <p>… It is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in evidence against any person equally of any oral answer given by that person to a question put by a police officer and of any statement made by that person, that it shall have been voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, exercise or held out by a person in authority.</p> <p>Interestingly, Lord Sumner’s phrases fear of prejudice’ and ‘hope of advantage’ are habitually spoken of as ‘threats and ‘inducements’ respectively. It give rise to some problems in the application of the rules of admissibility at common law. In particular, the suggestion of some deliberate act in the words ‘threats’ and ‘inducements’ for a time led the courts to concentrate on the mind of the questioner, rather than on the mind of the suspect. As the problem may recur, despite the apparently clear wording – of the 1990 act, it is worth pursuing briefly. In R .V. Iseguilla3, the court of Appeal concluded that:</p> <ol><li>(1975) I. W. L. R. 716,721-2</li> </ol> <p>“… Under the existing law the exclusion of a confession as a matter of law because it is not voluntary is always related to some conduct on the part of authority, which is improper or unjustified. Included in the phrase ‘improper or unjustified’ of course must be the offering of an inducement, because it is improper in this context for those in authority to try to induce a suspect to make a confession”.</p> <p>This view of the law would have left the accused without recourse in a case where without any improper intent and perhaps even without realizing it, the questioner created some fear of prejudice or hope of advantage in the mind of the suspect.’ In such a case, the resulting confession might well be involuntary, but under the Isequilla rule, would nonetheless be admissible. In D.P.P .V. Ping Lin4, the House of Lords was called upon to decide whether it was the state of mind of the questioner or that of the suspect which was to control the question of voluntariness. The House firmly held that it was the latter that governed the question of whether or not the confession was voluntary, and that should therefore also control the question of admissibility.</p> <ol><li>(1976) A. C, 574</li> </ol> <p>Indeed, the rules of admissibility applied only where the fear of prejudice or hope of advantage was excited or held out, or the oppression created by a ‘person in authority’, The question of what persons were or were not persons in authority, has, however, settled that a person in authority must have, or reasonably be thought by the suspect to have, some influence over his arrest, detention or persecution, or in other words, be of a person from who a threat or inducement might appear credible. The limitation of the rule in this way was not of great importance, since the vast majority of confessions are made to police officers and others who are undoubtedly persons in authority, and it has been abolished expressly by the Evidence Act 1990. But it remains germane to consider it in the light of the common law rule that the fear of prejudice or hope of advantage must have been generated by the person in authority, with the consequence that self-generated fears and hopes would not destroy the voluntariness of the confessions. However, the result is different under the new statutory rules, even though the confession is made to a person who previously have been a person in authority.</p> <p>In addition to the rules governing admissibility, the trial Judge had power to exclude a confession, in the exercise of his discretion, where it had been obtained by means of or following a breach of the</p> <p>Judges’ Rules. The Judges’ Rules were rules of conduct and procedure for the guidance of police officers and others concerned in the arrest, detention and interrogation of suspects. They were fist promulgated by the judges of the then king’s Bench Division in 1912, and subsequently revised from time to time. The Rules were not rules of law, and did not affect the legal principles of admissibility of confession. However, in R. V. May6, Lord Goddard C.J held that the trial judge might refuse to admit a statement if a breach of the rules occurred. But the main importance of the rules always lay in the fact that a breach of the rules might provide evidence that the resulting confession was not voluntary.</p> <p>1.2   DEFINITION OF CONFESSION</p> <p>At common law, a confession was the name given to an adv-erse admission by the accused relevant to the issue of guilt in a criminal case. In Nigeria, as the case in point, confessions are covered by section 27 to 32 of the Evidence Act 1990. The word “confession” is derived from the Latin word ‘confessus’ which mean to speak or confess completely? 7.</p> <p>Under the Evidence Act8, confession is defined thus:</p> <p>“A confession is an admission made at any time by a person</p> <p>charge with a crime, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that crime.</p> <ol><li>v. Rennie (1982)I. W. C. R.64</li> <li>(1952) 36Cr. App R. 91,93</li> </ol> <p>A confession, like any other admission, may be made orally, in writing, by conduct or in any way from which a proper inference may be drawn adverse to the maker. Usually confessions are made to police officer or other investigators as a result of interrogation, but may equally be made to the victim of an offence, a friend or relative or any other person.</p> <p>The law regarding confessions is now the same in all cases, and it no longer matters whether the person to whom the confession is made is a person in authority.</p> <p>Importantly, although in common law parlance, the word ‘confession’ connotes a full admission of guilt, it has no such meaning in law, either at common law or under the statutory definition. As long as any part of a statement is adverse to the maker, in that it has some relevance to the issue of guilt, it will be deemed a confession for the purpose of the law of evidence.</p> <p>More still, going by the definition given by the Evidence Act, it is clear that admission of such guilt can be made “at anytime’ is so far it was made after the commission of an offence. Such a confessional</p> <p>statement can even be made before the accused is charged.</p> <ol><li>The lawyer’s biggest journal of Bendel State University law student Association 1989. Pg.8</li> <li>Section 27(1) Evidence Act cap112 laws of the federation, 1990</li> </ol> <p>The case of Sunday Onungwa .V. The state9 is very illustrative in this respect. In that case, the appellant was convicted of murder. It appeared from evidence which the trial judge accepted that, during the investigations (by the police) preliminary to him being charged with the offence, the appellant admitted to ownership of a blood stained matchet recovered near the scene of the murder admitting at the same time that he had killed the deceased “as a result of the work of the devil”. The admissions was made in the presence of other members of his family amongst them was his elder brother who also testified confirming the admission made by the appellant. It was argued at the lower court that these admissions being “extra judicial” should have been rejected and that when the admissions were made it was not then decided the appellant should be charged with any offence and that no caution was administered to the appellant before they were made. Overruling these submissions, the Supreme Court held: ‘that an admission made at anytime by a person charged with crime suggesting the influence that he committed the offence is a relevant fact against the maker and if it is made voluntarily it is admissible in evidence.</p> <ol><li>(1976)2 Scpg. 169 R.V. Udo Eka Ebong (1997)12 WACA</li> </ol> <p>Also, in Gbadamosi .V. State10, confessions was defined thus:</p> <p>“Legally, the word ‘confession’ means an admission of an offence by an accused person it means an acknowledgement of crime by an accused person. It is an admission made at anytime by a person charged with crime stating or suggesting the inference that he committed the crime”.</p> <p>For a confessional statement to be admitted in evidence, it must be freely and voluntarily made. The accused person must make it out of his own freewill and choice.</p> <p>1.3    NATURE AND SCOPE OF CONFESSIONAL STATEMENTS</p> <p>Confessions are either judicial or extra judicial. Judicial confessions are confessions made in the court in the course of the proceeding in question. Section 27 of the act is obviously wide enough in its wording to cover both, but judicial confessions are also expressly dealt with in section 218 and sections 314 of the criminal procedure Act and section 37 of the Evidence Act, also section 157(1), 161(2) and 187(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. If during his trial in court an accused person confesses to the</p> <ol><li>(1991)6 NWIR PT 196 pg 182 at 189, also Ikemson.V. State(T.989)3 NWTR PT 100 pg.455</li> </ol> <p>offence charged, and such a confession is in the nature of a plea of guilty section 218 of the Criminal Procedure Act prescribes the consequences of such a plea11“, Section 161(2) and 187(1) of these Criminal Procedure Code deals respectively With such consequences in trials in the magistrate courts and in the High Courts of the Northern State. It should be noted that by pleading guilty, an accused person does not admit the truth of the facts contained in the dispositions. He merely admits that he is guilty of the offence as charged and nothing else12.</p> <p>Under section 314 of the criminal procedure Act, a statement made by an accused person at preliminary inquiry is admissible without further proof unless it is proved that the magistrate purporting to sign the statement did not infact sign it, whilst under section 37 of the Evidence Act any statement made by an accused person at such an inquiring or at a coroners inquest may be given in evidence.</p> <p>Usually ‘admission’ in relation to a crime is used to denote the admission of a fact relevant to the crime, whilst ‘confession’ is used</p> <ol><li>V. Olagunju (1961) 1All N. L. R. 21 .R.V.Wilson (1954)VFSC175</li> <li>RovRiley (1896) Q.B 309</li> <li>Edet Obosi J. the state (1965) NMIR 119, 122</li> <li>Customs &amp; Excise Commissioners IV. Harz &amp; power (1967) IALLER 177,182</li> </ol> <p>to denote the admission of guilt13. However, the definition of confession seems wide enough to include an incriminating admission falling short of a full confession14”.</p> <p>An admission made in a plea in civil proceedings does not amount to a confession for the purpose of criminal proceedings. Also an extra- judicial admission of guilt made in another proceeding not being the one in which it is intended to prove the confession must have been made by the person and not his counsel. In R .V. Asuquo Etim Inyang15 the accused was resident in Calabar and went through a form of marriage in the church there. Some 18 months later proceedings were taken against him in the magistrate court to enforce a maintenance order made against him by London magistrate’s court in respect of a marriage which the accused had contracted in England seven years previously. Before the Calabar magistrate’s court counsel for the accused admitted the facts of the London marriage. The accused himself merely gave evidence as to his financial circumstances. Criminal proceedings on a charge bigamy were instituted against him at the Calabar assizes, the prosecution relying solely on the two marriage certificates and the</p> <ol><li>(1931) I. O. N. L. R 33</li> <li>Olusegun Ofutale &amp; others .V. the state N. M. L. R. 261</li> <li>(1961) All N.L.R. 654 (F.S.C)</li> </ol> <p>admissions made before the Calabar magistrate. It was held that the admissions could not be treated as confessions for the purposes of proving the criminal charge as they were not made by the accused himself. An extra judicial confession though made orally would carry no less weight than the one made in writing16.</p> <p>A confession must be direct and positive, not equivocal. In RaimiAdebisi Afolabi .V. Commissioner of police17, the accused was the storekeeper to a firm in Ibadan. When a shortage was discovered in his stores and this was brought to his notice by the manager of the firm, he told the manager that he had taken certain of the stores and sold them to assist defray his election expenses but he did not indicate how much he had sold. During a retrial he repudiated this story. It was held that, ‘as the alleged confession was neither direct nor positive as to the items contained in the charges, it was not admissible. However in R .V. Akpan Udo Essien18, it was held that a statement amounting only to a confession of implication in the crime cannot be regarded as a confession under this heading. A man confess to his own acts, knowledge or intentions but he cannot ‘confess’ as to the acts of other persons which he had not seen and of which he can only have knowledge or hearsay. The failure by the prosecutor to prove an essential element in the offence charged cannot be cured by an admission of this kind19”, he point has also been raised whether by section 27(1), which speaks of “an admission made at anytime by a person charged”, it is intended that a confession, if it is to be admissible, must have been made subsequent to the accused being charged with an offence. In R. V. Udo Eka Ebong20, it was held that a statement may amount to a confession even if made before the accused was charged with the offence. However, a statement made before the commission of an offence cannot amount to a confession.</p>\n\nCONFESSIONAL STATEMENT UTILITY IN CRIMINAL TRIALS (AN OVERVIEW)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONFESSIONAL STATEMENT UTILITY IN CRIMINAL TRIALS (AN OVERVIEW)", "id": 52}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Critical Appraisal On Opinion Evidence </p> <div> Abstract Generally, where a court is faced with the problem of determining a suit before it, such can only be solved after making an enquiry into the relevant facts of the evidence put before it by the parties, drawing inferences from those facts, and listening to arguments of parties to the case or of their counsel.

Although the legal process involved (either in formality or requirement) varies from one jurisdiction to another, marriage is often characterized by disputes which range from divorce to custody of children, maintenance e. t. c. Marriage, as examined in this context, is limited to that conducted under statutes.<br/><br/>In resolving these disputes, recourse is made to adjudication. But overtime, various shortcomings are being found for litigation. These include unnecessary delay caused by congestion of court, high cost of litigation, confrontational nature of litigation amongst others. Employing the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1970, which operates within Nigeria jurisdiction, this research presents an outlook of litigation in resolving marriage disputes and also points out its shortcomings.<br/><br/>Consequent upon the shortcomings found for litigation, various alternatives to litigation are being come up with. This research, in line with resolving matrimonial disputes, focuses on examining few of these alternatives which are collaborative divorce, divorce mediation and divorce arbitration. In examining these alternatives, this research points out the advantages they have over litigation in their application to marriage disputes and these amongst others include promotion of confidentiality, cost and time saving. The challenges facing the use of these alternatives which include inadequate skills, lack of enforcement e. t. c. are also examined.<br/><br/>Furthermore, ways of curbing these challenges which are put forward as recommendations are included in the latter part of this research.

It is the third arm of any modern government. This was popularized by Montesquieu, the French political philosopher and jurist who postulated that there should be separation of judicial duties from legislative and executive functions to forestall tyranny.</p> <p>A court system implies a judicial arrangement of graduated competences of hierarchal structural arrangement from lower to superior courts, courts of first instance to Supreme Court, where appeals are taken or heard, and special courts or tribunals, exists in modern democratic countries.</p> <p>Lastly, for the administration of justice to be fair and equitable in any political setting, it should combine autonomy with accessibility and a certain degree of uniformity. To be fair means that it is objective and fearless. To be equitable implies that court rules are equally applied, as rewards and punishment to both the poor and the rich. Autonomy connotes independence and authority.</p> <p><strong>1.1   Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The Judiciary arm of government is responsible for interpreting the law of the land, while applying it in situations where they are necessary; this makes the job of the Judiciary a very critical one. The law of the land constitutes the bases upon which judgments are ruled; it is therefore fundamental that its interpretation and application be carried out with absolute alacrity and meticulousness (Chambers, 2005). The Nigerian Judicial System comprises of ‘the Body of Benchers’ and ‘the Bar’ itself. The Body of Benchers is a collection of the highest ranking legal practitioners in the country which is headed by the Chief Justice of the Federation. It also has as its members the respective Chief Judges of the States of the Federation and certain very reputable lawyers in the country, whereas the Bar is a body of all the barristers in the country. These together constitute the ‘Nigerian Legal Class’. The Nigerian Judicial System has come a long way, taking its origin from the colonial era. It was saddled with the responsibility of checking the activities of the Executive and Legislative arms of government. The Judiciary as a matter of fact, plays a very vital role in the development of the country considering the fact it is the mechanism that oversees to the usage and management of power in the country. If the power that is vested on the Executive and Legislative offices is not checked, the bulk of the citizenry will have lots of troubles and challenges to contend with (Akpuru-Aja, 1999).</p> <p>The primary responsibility of the Judiciary is to ensure that the Executive and Legislative arms of government function within the ambits of the constitutional provisions made available to them. The Judiciary ought to stand isolated while performing its constitutional duty. It does not need any interference from the Executive or Legislature in carrying out its primary assignment. It operates independent of any external disturbances and functions with the constitutional power vested in its office. The Nigerian Judicial System has had lots of challenges to contend with. During the shambolic military era, the Judiciary was subjected to abject emasculation to the extent that it lost the substance to its name and only existed as a nomenclatural entity. To say the least, ‘the Judiciary sank into oblivion’. But with the advent of democracy came an organized political façade that accorded the Judiciary its rightful place as the watchdog of the polity. The importance of the Judiciary in any political system cannot be over-emphasized, hence the constitution provides for its absolute independence to enable it perform its sacred constitutional function without sentiments and reservations (Akpuru-Aja, 1999).</p> <p>Personnel problems constitute by far the most daunting challenge facing the judiciary and is the single most important problem threatening the sanctity of the judiciary as the bastion of justice. The judiciary comprise of judicial officers who are human beings and therefore subject to the vagaries of human nature in its insidious form. While there are good, intellectually sound and upright judicial officers of impeccable character and integrity in Nigeria, it is sad to say that a sizeable percentage of judicial officers in Nigeria fall below the standard expected of judicial officers in the area of intellectual capability, uprightness, character and integrity and this reflects in the poor quality of judgments delivered by the various courts in Nigeria and the growing problem of conflicting judgments and the attendant confusion it brings in the legal system in Nigeria</p> <p>The judicial system in Nigeria is beset with several deficiencies in its procedural set up that make it very difficult to obtain justice and quick resolution of disputes in courts. Most of the procedural rules of the various courts in Nigeria are in dire need of reform and review to make it accord with the need to discard technicalities and uphold substantive justice. A situation where many cases in Nigerian courts take years to be resolved does not bode well for the judicial system and encourages resort to self-help by disgruntled litigants.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>There is no doubt that the Nigerian judiciary is plagued by a myriad of problems ranging from institutional to personnel problems, poor facilities to inadequate financial provisions and procedural to constitutional problems. Previous researchers that has sought need for solution to the problems suggested that there is the urgent need for constant training and re-training of judicial officers in the form of workshops, seminars and symposiums for judges to update their knowledge and restructuring the appointment process of judicial officers to ensure that only persons of acceptable intellectual capability, character and integrity are appointed to the bench. However, the researcher is examining the Nigerian judicial system with and view of identifying the problems within and recommending the way out </p> <p><strong>1.3 Objectives of Study</strong></p> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the problems in the Nigerian judicial system.</p> <p>2.  To identify the way out of problems in the Nigerian judicial system.</p> <p>3.  To determine the factors encouraging problems in the Nigerian judicial system.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions shall guide the study;</p> <p>1.  What are the problems in the Nigerian judicial system?</p> <p>2.  What is the way out of problems in the Nigerian judicial system?</p> <p>3.  What are the factors encouraging problems in the Nigerian judicial system?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses will be tested in the study;</p> <p><strong><em>Ho:</em></strong>The Nigerian judiciary system is not delivering justice to the people.</p> <p><strong><em>Hi:</em></strong>The Nigerian judiciary system is not delivering justice to the people.</p> <p><strong><em>Ho: </em></strong>The corruption into the Nigeria judiciary system has no way out</p> <p><strong><em>Hi;</em></strong> The corruption into the Nigeria judiciary system has a way outas proposed </p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The results of this study will educate the general public on the problem in the Nigerian judicial system with a view of finding a lasting solution to the problems.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Scope and Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will cover all the issues within the Nigerian judicial system and also cover the approaches that can be used to solve the problem for better delivery. </p> <p><strong>1.8 Limitation of Study</strong></p> <p>1.  Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p>2.  Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

It is therefore evident that criminal activities have negative impact on society, community, and most especially on the victims, on which such crimes are perpetrated. Activities such as murder rape, arson, burglary, gambling, robbery embezzlement assault and prostitution are examples of these crimes committed. It should be noted that individuals have the desire to feel safe in their homes places of work, community and wherever they find themselves.

Some crimes reported are not done in a way that the actual event of things is made known. These crimes lack uniformity, which produce obvious difficulties in actually investigating and solving the crimes that are reported. Another causal factor may include the time frame of the crime.

Man may meet untimely death. He may suffer from accident, destruction of property, fire, floods, earthquakes and other natural calamities. Whenever there is uncertainty, there is risk as well as insecurity. People always want to avoid the financial consequences of these risks e.g replacing personal property that is lost or damaged. Insurance exists because risk exists. Insurance cannot remove the risk or the likelihood that one might become a victim of risks, but it ensures the transfer of all or some of the financial impact. </p> <p>Insurance is a contract between two parties (insurance company (A) and the insured or policyholder (B) in which the risk is transferred to the insurance company in exchange for the payment (in advance) of a token called Premium with the insurance company agreeing to make good the loss to the policy holder whenever he suffers any loss.1</p> <p>Social and economic changes open up new areas in which insurers are called upon to provide insurance coverage. Apart from natural risks to life, the risks to life from coups, kidnapping and political assassinations have become real and common. </p> <p>      </p> <p>1Wale Onaolapo (MD/CEO), Sovereign Trust Insurance Plc. A paper delivered at the 6th Practical Maritime</p> <p>Dispute Resolution Seminar. Lagos, Nigeria: May 22, 2014</p> <p>Insurance is a form of risk management; a risk- transfer mechanism. It is a method of coping with risk. Its primary function is to substitute certainty for uncertainty as regards the economic cost of loss-producing events and the aim is to compensate the owner against the losses arising from a variety of risks which he anticipates to his life, property and business. It is a means of pooling of risks, under which a group of people who are subject to an insurable risk contribute regularly to a fund. The fund so created is utilized to compensate those members of the group who actually suffer a loss due to some unexpected calamity. Thus the loss of a few is shared by all the members on an equitable basis. The practices of insurance businesses as they exist today are relatively young in theft to motor insurance policy holder is part of the new areas where the services of insurers are needed.2</p> <p>Thus, insurance has become the champion to combat the risks insured against by the</p> <p>insured and the reward of the promoter of this champion is reimbursement which places the insured in the same position he stands immediately before the risks occur and thus it has been jointly said ‘verily verily I say unto you brethren, if you belong to the right caucus and take the best insurance covers, no weapon fashioned against you including the EFCC shall prosper’.3</p> <p>2 Olusegun Yerokun, <em>Insurance Law in Nigeria</em>(3rd)(Nigeria Revenue Projects Publisher, Lagos) [1992] , p. 1</p> <p>3   Nigeria Tribune Wednesday, 21 February [2007]. p. 9</p> <p><strong>1.1    DEFINITION</strong></p> <p>Insurance laws do not provide a definition to explain the meaning of insurance, as even lawyers cannot give a definite definition.</p> <p>The best a writer can do is to describe what is insurance and not to define insurance, that is, since there is no definite definition, the available description suffices as the definition of insurance for when there is no alternative, the available becomes the alternative. It is pertinent to point out here that a good definition must combine legal, economic and social viewpoints of insurance as to bring out the functions, features and purposes of thesame. </p> <p>Encyclopedia Britannica defines insurance as:</p> <p>“A system under which the insurer, for a consideration (usually agreed upon in advance) promises to reimburse the insured or to render services to the insured in the event that certain accidental occurrences result in losses during a given period”. 4</p> <p>Greene’s definition combines both legal and functional approaches as it states that:</p> <p>“Insurance is an institution which reduces risk bycombining under one management a group of objectso situated that the aggregate accidental losses towhich the group is subject becomes predictable butnarrow limits”.</p> <p>Green further explained that insurance include certain legal contract under which the insurerwithin certain consideration promises to reimburse the insured or render services in the case of accidental services or losses suffered during the time of the agreement.5</p> <p>4http://www.britannica.com/topic/insurance(August, 2014)</p> <p>5 Greene: <em>Risk and Insurance </em>(4th ed.)(Butterwoth, London) [1977] p. 49</p> <p>Also, ‘Ivamy’,defined insurance from the legal and functional point of view, by bringing out the essential elements of insurance. He said;</p> <p>“Insurance is a contract whereby one person called theinsurer or assurer undertakes in return for an agreedconsideration called the premium to pay anotherperson called the insured or assured a sum of moneyor its equivalent on the happening of a specifiedevent”.6</p> <p>The quoted part of Ivamy’s book above, made it crystal clear that the essential elements ofinsurance are the insurer, the insured and the consideration, which is known as‘Premium’ in insurance contract.</p> <p>Lord Choley and O. C. Giles preferred to suggest the prescription of what insurance is all about as the purchase of security, the assured anxious to protect himself from risk purchase from the insurer, a right to indemnify if the risk should materialize. Thepurchase price which the assured pay the insurer is known as the premium often anannual payment and the insurer’s promise to pay if the event assured against occur. It is embodied in what is called a policy.</p> <p><em>Black’s Law Dictionary</em>, 7th Ed, Bryan A. Garner define insurance to mean</p> <p>“An agreement by which one party the insurercommits to do something of value for another arty(the insured) upon the occurrence of some specified contingency, especially an agreement by which one party assumes a risk faced by another party in return for a premium payment”7</p> <p>There has also been notable pronouncement on the meaning of insurance.

The practice of insurance then spread to the United Kingdom in the 16th century, though it was still quite informal and was carried out in the House of Lloyds. After marine insurance, fire insurance came up </p> <p>9 [1996] 1 NWLR (pt 423) 192 CA</p> <p>10(See: Mary M. Bob-Alli; Fundamentals of Insurance Operations at page 19).</p> <p>after the Great fire of London and then life and accident insurance was developed.Upon colonialism and trade on the Western Coast of Africa by Europeans, modern insurance was introduced to Nigeria and this was at the beginning of the twentieth century. It was introduced to help reduce the burden of possible risk involved in trade and as a result of this; it was initially indulged in by foreigners and not Nigerian citizens. The increase in trade and commerce led to an increase in shipping and banking activities, thus, making it necessary for there to be some form of risk back up handled locally. The insurance companies in Europe appointed agents (Merchants) to arrange insurance cover for their trading concerns. These agents had the power of attorney to accept risks, but claims were still referred to the parent company, thereby making the merchants insignificant. These agencies and the few Nigerians employed in them had little or no knowledge of the insurance practice as they were not exposed to insurance practice before then.</p> <p>The Royal Exchange Assurance Company which was a London based body opened a branch office in Lagos in 1921 and this was the first insurance company in Nigeria headed by Late George Golding. It enjoyed monopoly as the only insurance company for a period of about twenty-eight years when three others came up. (These three were the Legal and General Assurance Society, Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society and the Tobacco Insurance Company). By 1960, there were twenty-five insurance companies in Nigeria. Of the twenty-five insurance companies in Nigeriaby 1960, twenty-two were foreign owned and three were indigenous. Patronage was however, quite low as most Nigerians were not aware of insurance and its importance.</p> <p>With the lack of proper legislation and awareness about the industry, there was a rapid and rather unhealthy increase in the number of insurance companies after independence, bringing the number of insurance companies in Nigeria to eighty by 1975. </p> <p><strong>The insurance </strong>business<strong>in Nigeria began with the report of the J.C. Obande Commission of 1961, which was followed by other acts and decrees, such as the Insurance Companies Act of 1961, the Insurance Decree of 1976, the Insurance Special Supervisory Fund decree 1989 and other enactments.</strong>The National Insurance Commission is responsible for a lot of positive changes for Nigeria regarding insurance.</p> <p>The J.C. Obande Commission report of 1961 resulted in the establishment of a Nigerian Department of Insurance in the Federal Ministry of Trade, which was later transferred to the Ministry of Finance. The Insurance Companies Act of 1961 classified insurance businesses into various classes for registration and provided forms for record keeping. The Insurance Decree of 1976 provided for the authorization of insurers, modes of operation, organization and transfers, administrative and enforcement guidelines, and penalties.11</p> <p>The National Insurance Commission was established in 1997 with the responsibility of regulating and supervising insurance in Nigeria. The commission has since been the main insurance regulator in Nigeria. The Insurance Special Supervisory Fund decree of 1989 strengthened the Insurance Supervisory Board and included a provision mandating that all insurance companies contribute 1 percent of their gross earnings to the fund. As a result of the insurance decrees and developments since 1961, the insurance industry in Nigeria has been growing steadily. Incomes have increased at a rate of approximately 18 percent per year.</p> <p>It should be noted that all companies before 1961 including insurance company, finance company etc were governed by the Companies Act of 1922. The situation remained like that until Nigeria adopted the new and its own insurance law.</p> <p>The development of insurance has grown ever since with the recent re-capitalisation</p> <p>which has made the Nigerian insurance industry to begin a new process of transformation.12The insurance companies have, over the years, experienced certain challenges that gave rise to the need for reforms and transformations. </p> <p>11Oke, Michael Ojo.

The interpretation provision of the Act only says that “Insurance“ includes “assurance“. In a number of cases, the Nigerian courts have widely defined Insurance Contract as</p> <p>“Contracts whereby one person called the insurer undertakes in return for the agreed consideration called the premium, to pay another person called the assured, a sum of money, or its equivalent, on the happening of a specified event“.14</p> <p>From the above case law definition of Insurance Contracts, there must be an element of uncertainty. In the case of life assurance where death is certain, the time of death must remain uncertain before a business of insurance can be consummated. Going</p> <p>by the judicial definition the insurer must assume the risk as being transferred and</p> <p>13 The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) via its President, Chief DedeIjere,</p> <p>while lauding the actions taken by the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) on Recapitalization</p> <p>process at the December edition of NCRIB members evening in Lagos.

Under the Common Law principle and incorporated into Nigerian Statute no insurance contract is to be made on a life without an insurable interest.15</p> <p>Whilst it is essential that the insured interest attaches to the policyholder, the Nigerian regime allows a situation whereby, under the customary law and Islamic law, one person assumes responsibility for the maintenance and care of the other even though the relationship is not through blood line. </p> <p>It also goes without saying that Compulsory Insurance Contracts are essentially meant to protect the third party, e.g. the third party motor vehicle insurance policy. </p> <p>In practice, insurers are allowed to reinsure part of their risks with a view to mitigating their risk. This is purely an actuarial issue and not necessarily a classification of insurance contracts.

In spite of nature’s generous provision of these necessities of life, the environment has been and is still being polluted by man through indiscriminate disposal of domestic, commercial and industrial wastes.<br/>    Environmental pollution leads to the degradation of the environment, which is a consequence of industrialization.  Mankind is now faced with the fact that the current rate of destruction might lead to a very bleak or even a non-existent future for the earth and its inhabitants.  The control and regulation of the use of the environment by all nations is therefore essential, because man’s life is tied to the environment.  Honourable Justice Belgore J.S.C. while expressing gladness at a seminar on environmental law stated thus:     <br/>This gathering will discuss the problem of the survival of this earth in relation to man made destructive things now you are going to discuss the whole legal ramification of the environment in Nigeria.  But you may discover that you are thinking of life on this earth most of the time.<br/>    Also, the Honourable Prince Bola Ajibola stated concerning the importance of the environment to life when he stated that: <br/>It is the policy of the administration to vigorously pursue the protection of the Nigerian environment in order to preserve the quality of life of all citizens and conserve the resources for the benefit of future generations of Nigerians.<br/>    From the above, it stands clear that life depends on the environment.  Contrary to the attitude and belief of most people in developing countries that their life and livelihood depend entirely on their immediate neighbourhood, it is now being realized that environment extends beyond a people’s immediate surrounding sometimes assuming international dimensions.<br/>    Man depends on resources in his immediate vicinity for sustenance.  But these resources are routinely depleted without adequate or any consideration for their conservation or replacements.<br/>    As there is a growth in the number of people who are demanding goods and services, that increasing knowledge and technology make possible, industrial production and trade also grows.  The implication of this is that there will be new factories and chemical plants, new sources of resources depletion and environmental pollution, also, growing in the amount of leisure time that people have.  There is also a fast growing tourist industry.  People have more time and opportunity to encroach upon countryside and beaches, often times polluting land, air and water, as well as jeopardizing plant and animal life in the process.  These selfish exploitations of natural resources make bleak the future of world youth and the unborn generation.<br/>    Indeed, the old view that development must necessarily be accompanied by resources depletion has given way to the modern view of development without destruction.  Mankind has also come to realize that the environment belongs to all generations, present and future; hence the concept of sustainable development.<br/>    The term, sustainable development has been defined as: <br/>Development that meets the needs and aspirations of the current generations; without compromising the ability to meet those of future generation.<br/>    From the above, it stands that all life on earth forms part of a single independent system, which influences and depends on the non-living components of the planetary rock, soils, water and the atmosphere.<br/>    Every human being has equal rights within the limits of the earth to the resources needed for a decent standard of living and no individual or group should deprive another of his (their) means of subsistence.  Each person or society is obligated to the protection of these natural resources for the mutual benefit of all.<br/>    From the above, it can be seen that there is really the need to police and protect the environment from being polluted.<br/>    In every society, competing demands are frequently made on society’s natural resources such as air, water, land and wildlife.  The competition is usually between the forces of deterioration whose dominant objective is to consume or deteriorate natural resources, and the conservationists whose primary concern is how to preserve the society’s natural resources.  But people often lack honesty and objectivity in appraising the facts about pollution.<br/>    While environmental protection may exaggerate negative aspects in support of their argument, their opponents may play up the positive side.  But the truth is that everything is growing, including the problems.<br/>    Environmental damage consists essentially of pollution in all its ramifications.  Some apparently innocuous activities of man also contribute to the problem, domestic refuse carelessly thrown about residential areas, aerosol cans of cosmetics and insecticides in common use, emission of industrial fumes and other effluents into the atmosphere, construction of structures without appropriate authorization.<br/>    To control environmental pollution, laws are put into place in order to safeguard our environment.  There are also institutions put into place to enforce these laws.<br/>    However, recent experience has shown that despite these laws and institutions the environment, (air, water and land) is still being polluted with reckless abandon by man, yet man lives in this environment, man’s survival is also tied to the environment.<br/>    Oil production has been going on in Nigeria for over 52 years together with the flaring of natural gas.  The resultant effect is the unsustainable practice of air, water and land pollution.  Our cities still experience heaps of refuse being dumped indiscriminately, oil spillage in the Niger Delta is still a regular occurrence; this pollutes the environment.<br/>    Consequently, the crucial issue is not to halt all domestic, commercial and industrial activities in order to sustain the quality of the environment, rather, the issue is to examine the legal and institutional framework for the control of environmental pollution in Nigeria whether they have been able to attain the objective of their enactment and establishment.  If they have done that, then we shall be done but if not, we shall proffer certain recommendations so as to meet their effectiveness.<br/>1.1    DEFINITION OF ENVIRONMENT<br/>What is environment?  And why the need to be environment conscious?<br/>    “The word environment means different things to different people.  In its general sense, it may mean the surroundings, that which is encircling, surrounds people and effects their health and the quality of their lives .  Man is seen as the central unit or the measure of all things.   “In the environment a combination of material and social things” which condition the well being of people.<br/>    The environment now has a wider meaning than that which affects the quality of life for people and their physical and mental well being.  In this regard, it has been defined as  “the totality or physical, economic, cultural, aesthetic and social circumstances and factors which surround and affect the desirability and value of property or which also affects the quality of people’s live”.<br/>    On its part the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency Act 2007, in Section 37 defines environment as: <br/>“Including water, air all plants and human beings or animals living therein and the inter-relationships which exist among these or any of them”.<br/>    It is submitted that this definition is all embracing as it touches every aspect of what constitutes the environment.  It implies that the basic necessities of human existence constitute the environment.<br/>    The above definition has been adopted by the Supreme Court in the case of   A.G. Lagos State v. A.G. Federation where the court defined environment as natural conditions, for example land, air and water in which people, animals and plants live”.<br/>    For the purposes of law therefore, the environment has been defined as: <br/>“The system of abiotic, biotic, and socio-economic components with which man interacts and simultaneously to which he adapts and transforms and uses in order to satisfy his needs”.<br/>    Generally, environment means surroundings in the natural condition in which we live in.  It covers the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, the soil, climate and the inter-relationship amongst these factors.<br/><br/>1.2    POLLUTION<br/> “Pollution has been defined as man made or man aided alteration of chemical, physical or biological quality of the environment to the extent that is detrimental to the environment beyond acceptable limits”<br/>    Pollution also involves the making of any feature of the environment offensive, harmful or less suitable for human, animal or plant life and the effectiveness of the legal regimes on pollution control which is the focus of this project.<br/>    Pollution is the release into any environmental medium any process of substances which are capable of causing harm to man or any other living organisms supported by the environment.  It is the introduction by man directly or indirectly of substances or energy into the environment resulting in deleterious effects of such a nature as to endanger human health, farm, living resources and ecosystems.<br/>    The 1972 United Nations Conference at Stockholm defines pollution as: <br/>“The discharge of toxic substances and the release of heat in such qualities or concentrations as to exceed the capacity of the environment”.<br/>1.3    TYPES OF POLLUTION AND SOURCES<br/>    There are different types of pollution, they shall be treated based on how they affect human’s life.<br/>1.3.1    WATER POLLUTION AND SOURCES<br/>    Apart from the production energy, water is needed for human and animal consumption, production of food, fibre and industrial goods.  Water provides a completely cheap means of transportation compared to other means. Varieties of recreational activities can also be carried out on water.  As a result of all the above mentioned uses of water, it thus becomes imperative that the marine environment should be kept clean and safe from pollution of any kind.  Industrial effluents and indiscriminate domestic waste disposal have ruined the environment, especially the coastal waters.<br/>    The oil industry is a potentially dangerous industry to the environment.  This industry is the main source of revenue for Nigeria.  The oil industry impacts on water in the Niger Delta in two main ways.<br/>    First, it affects the hydrological patterns of rivers, particularly seasonally flooded plains and disturbs marine life.  Secondly, the oil industry is a huge source of pollution to the marine environment.  Oil spills and blow outs are major source of water pollution in the Niger Delta.  In its over 47 years operation, the sheer volume of spills into the Niger Delta environment including its waters has been enormous in the exploration stage.  The industry uses drilling mud, this drilling mud in very high quantities, could be harmful to the marine environment if it is introduced into it.<br/>    When fish ingest these pollutions, it becomes poisoned and could become dangerous for human consumption.  All these have significant impact on human health particularly because of the reliance of people on these waters for their domestic needs and also as a source of subsistence.<br/>    Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen – a chemical association that is chemically represented as H2O.<br/>    Water pollution therefore could be defined as the introduction by man, directly or indirectly of substances or energy into the marine environment resulting in such deleterious effects as are harmful to the marine activities like fishing and which may cause impairment of quality of use of water and reduction of amenities.<br/>    Water pollution occurs in oceans, lakes, rivers and streams and affects life directly through toxicity, killing most water plants and animals, and causing reproductive failures in others.<br/>    The principal sources of water pollution are oil spills, industrial refuse and agricultural fertilizers.  Water pollution comes in many forms such as: <br/>a.    De oxygenating materials e.g. sewage and other organic waters like spillage, farm wastes and wastes from a number of heavily industrial processing units.<br/>b.    Nutrients enriching materials such as fertilizers may cause an acceleration of plant growth and lead to a decline in water quality.<br/>c.    Soil waste:  This may impede the flow of water or block out light for the growth of plants that live in the water.<br/>d.    Toxic materials:  Some materials such as heavy metals and pesticides are toxic to aquatic life, depending on the dosage received.<br/>e.    Discharge of waste from the sewage system also affects the quality of inland and coastal waters.<br/>1.3.2    NOISE POLLUTION AND SOURCES<br/>    Noise may be defined as unwanted or excessive sound. Economic growth has led to an increase in the source of noise pollution which seems to have been accepted by people in the society.  This general acceptance may be due to the ignorance of the health hazards created by noise pollution C.S. Ola has affirmed this position when he stated thus:<br/>The average urban dweller is open to health problems as a result of long continuous exposure to noise sometimes at high intensities.<br/>    Worker in some industries are exposed to high levels of noise over a long period of time.  Other sources of noise pollution include:<br/>    Domestic noise, amplified music, vehicles and motorcycles aeroplanes, railway noise, voices beat engines, road traffic, noise construction sites.  Factories, industries and air-guns used to detect the presence of hydrocarbons.<br/>    On the effect of noise pollution, it is instructive to note that long exposure to noise of a high intensity may cause hearing impairment, decreased efficiency, emotional disturbances, psychological disorder and disturbance of sleep.  The negative effect of noise on fish, schools causing them to be dispersed and also on calls between fish’s destruction of eggs and larva are not exempted.<br/><br/>\n\nLEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE CONTROL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE CONTROL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION IN NIGERIA", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CRIMINOLOGY: SOCIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF GENDER, RACE AND RELIGION ON CRIME</p> <p>BY</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The essence of this topic is to explain in details what criminology entails, the study, methodology, etiology, scope amongst others, it also describes why crime is committed, who defines or determines crime and what constitutes crime.

It is an interdisciplinary field of study in which various aspects of human behaviour are involved in analyzing why a particular behaviour is referred to as criminal. It relates on who defines behaviour as criminal and why; what determines or predisposes individuals into committing crime and juvenile delinquency; and the necessary steps to curbing criminal behaviour.<br/>Its concept consists of various theories and how sociological and psychological concept from both societal point of view and internalized biological hereditary mold of a criminal. It went further to state the sociological theories of crime ranging from Chicago school, differential, Anomie and Social control theory in respect of human behaviour in relation to crime. The psychological concept of crime gives an elaborate explanation from scientific approach of human interaction based on genetic make up as sole responsibility in determining criminal propensity among human beings especially, i.e. relation to race and gender; other forms as the psychoanalytical theory which deals majorly with moral development occasioned from a physiological component.<br/>Moreso, the biological concept which is intrinsically intertwined with both genetic and hormonal structure such as from data study, neurological abnormality in reference to brain makeup and levels of serotonin and other chemical imbalance, nerve structure or neuron-transmitter, the personality theory and how groups of individual suffering from mental disorder affects crime population as a whole. Giving an analytical approach as to how socio-psychological concept of crime in relation to Gender, race and religion are affected by this concept and how various theories, hypotheses and theses contributed to this while trying to give an objective reason void of sentiment as to why certain category of gender, race and religion are more proportionally represented in crime than the other, from a socio-psychological point of view of criminology.<br/>1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>The term criminology analysis not only the concept of crime, but the inherent attitude which pre-dispose individuals to crime and how society shape this attitude in criminals. If and when the antecedent of why and how people commit crime are understood then the problem of crime and its victimization would be drastically reduced by focusing on the root source, be it sociologically or psychologically incline.<br/>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>The aim of this topic is to critically analyze the concept of crime, theory of ‘born criminal’ and relate the nature of crime, its causes and evaluate the effects on society as a whole both as a contributing factor to crime and as its victim. Its objective is to educate, give a vivid insight into an in-depth nature of crime not only in penological theories of punishment or rehabilitation mechanism but to deal directly with the remote causes of crime and how best to solve them. Moreso, to understand why certain individuals within gender, religion or race/ethnic bracket are more pre-disposed to crime than others within a sociological or psychological makeup.</p> <p>1.3 SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>The scope of study is to mirror the overall effects of socio-psychology on gender, race/ethnic and religion within a criminologically defined value system and their corresponding interaction with each other.<br/>1.4 LIMITATION<br/>The various factors limiting against this subject arise majorly from the dearth of criminologist expert in Nigeria to give an insight from a Nigerian point of view beside most criminologists are foreign trained with no works that essentially covers a Nigerian perspective. Another limitation is the poor record facility of the Nigeria police, lack of basic information on victims, lack of forensic or scientific experts on genetic or biological know-how, no report study, unwillingness by securities and medical practitioners to give data on victims based on confidential relationship. Moreso, most criminals or crimes are not grouped along gender, religion or ethnic nationality when computing statistics except for issues on incarceration or death row which are gender sensitive. Furthermore, moral and religious claims have made it hard for major scientific breakthrough to make public the reports which makes DNA study enables scientist determine behavioural tendencies of individuals along race, gender outside sociological factors and the subjective nature of most socio-psychological thesis, theories and hypothesis in application to crime.<br/>1.5 METHODOLOGY<br/>The method of approach to this topic is analytical/descriptive through a tabular representation of data and careful chronological arranged sequential order of criminology, its scope of study as it relates to socio-psychological effects of gender, race and religion.<br/>1.6 NATURE AND SCOPE OF CRIMINOLOGY<br/>The concept has no universal acceptable definition like law and philosophy as what constitutes crime in itself is variable from one society to another. As an academic discipline, criminology encompasses such disciplines as law, sociology, psychology, psychiatry, medicine, economics, political science, geography, biology, chemistry, history, public administration and anthropology.<br/>Criminology’s main focus as a specialized field of study, academic and professional is enumerated as follows:<br/>To introduce the key conceptual and substantive issues involved in the study of crime and justice.<br/>To define the concept of crime and describe the historical development of the criminal law and criminology.<br/>To study criminal behaviour as it relates to several varieties of crime.<br/>To explore the causes of crime and their remedy.<br/>To understand crime as a historical, social and political development.<br/>To compare the theories of crime, and explore alternative strategies to understanding crime as a phenomenon.<br/>To obtain familiarity with the motive, causes, reasons and correlates of crime.<br/>To increase our appreciation of the various theories of crime, how they have changed over time, their impact on social policy, and the extent to which they are supported by empirical data.<br/>To increase our appreciation of both formal and informal processes of social control, as well as their influence on crime and criminals.<br/>To apply crime theories to current events.<br/>To connect academic knowledge to real-world experiences through research.<br/>In defining criminology, various researchers in the field have adopted a number of approaches. Sykes defines what he calls “modern criminology” as the study of social origins of criminal law, the administration of criminal justice, the causes of criminal behaviour, and the prevention and control of crime. In this definition, the emphasis is on the functions of law and the efficacy of the administration of justice in the prevention and control of crime.<br/>For Sutherland and Cressey, criminology is the “body of knowledge regarding delinquency and crime as social phenomena”. According to them, criminology includes within its scope… the process of making laws, of breaking laws, and the reacting to the breaking of law”. In their conclusion, “criminology consists of the sociology of law, criminal etiology and penology”.<br/>However, Taff and England provide both the broad and narrow definitions of criminology. In the broad definition, criminology is the study “…. which includes all the subject matter necessary to the understanding and prevention of crimes and to the development of law, together with the punishment or treatment of delinquents and criminals. The narrow definition emphasizes the explanation of criminal behaviour in terms of why people behave the way they do. It is an attempt to answer the question “why and how do individuals become criminals?”<br/>In a more simple definition, Mannheim defines criminology as the study of crime and punishment which takes three forms: the descriptive, the casual, and the normative. The descriptive form involves the observation and collection of facts about crime and criminals; the casual form is the interpretation of the observed facts which can be used to search for the causes of crime, an aspect referred to as etiology; and the normative form aimed at the discovery of what he calls “universally scientific laws and conformities or trends”.<br/>Reckless who laced his definition with the concept of victimology defines criminology in terms of an understanding of delinquent and criminal behaviour within the operation of the criminal justice system. According to him:<br/>The first mentioned concern, namely the study of involvement has two aspects:<br/>1(a) the study of the ‘doer’, and<br/>The study of the ‘doer’s’ behaviour, including the human victim.<br/>The second mentioned concern deals with:<br/>2(a) The input of persons into the criminal justice system at all points of complaint to arrest, to court action, to probation, to institutionalization, and to parole; and<br/>The output or products of the criminal justice system of its several points of exodus…<br/>Criminology also includes the relation of crime and deviance to law and social values… patterns of criminal careers, organized crime and white collar crime the history, and trends of punishment.<br/>Haskell and Yablonsky define criminology in its scientific nature in relation to the study of crime and criminals. For them, criminology involves the analyses of the nature and extent of crime; the causes of crime and criminality; the development of criminal law and the administration of justice; the characteristic and the treatment of the criminal; patterns of criminality; and the impact of crime on social change.<br/>In conclusion, criminology is the study of crime, criminals and the punishment of criminals. It involves the criminal justice system as a whole; the function of crime, criminals, victims vis-à-vis victimology, the justice system vis-à-vis the court, police, society, institute, correctional facilities, prison, penological theories as it relates to sentencing, death penalties and other forms of deferent, the effects on the society, the criminals and the trends in keeping them in check as well as the biological/psychological reasons for “recidivism”. In a nutshell, it is the scientific study of crime and criminal behaviour, investigating the nature and extent of crime, the possible explanations to criminal behaviour, including juvenile delinquency; the functions of criminal law; the study and rehabilitation of the victims of crime; and the strategies for prevention and control of crime. The main motive being a comprehensive study of the individual and society, in an attempt to provide an answer as to why and how people commit crime.<br/>1.7 ETIOLOGY OF CRIME<br/>It is lucidly delineated in positive determinism that “every act had a cause”. What then is the cause of crime? What triggers criminal behaviour? Is crime simply a normal or natural phenomenon that occurs in all societies, as the Durkheimian sociology indicated? Or, are criminals the products of their innate constitution or a genetic factor? In other words, are criminals born in accordance with the Lambrosian theory? Why are there gender differences in certain crimes, especially the violent ones? Why are crimes more in inner cities or urban centres than in rural or suburban areas? Why is it that while some people commit crimes, others do not? Why is crime more pronounced among certain population groups than others? Is criminal behaviour influenced by either the psychological, physiological, social or environmental predisposition of the individual? Or, is it a combination of all these factors? Why are some people violent and others are not? These are some of the questions to be addressed. However, it is imperative to define what a crime is, before attempting to answer the above questions.<br/>What is Crime?<br/>It is difficult to present a universal definition of crime. The reasons are obvious, but foremost is the fact that acts defined as criminal vary with time and space. An act may be a crime in one society but not in another. Likewise, an act defined as a crime at one time may not be at another. In some cases, even if same or similar acts are defined as crimes in different societies, the gravity or seriousness to which each society views the act may be different. In addition, there are conflicting views on the definition of crime among jurists and social scientists, mostly bordering on ethical and ideological orientation.<br/>On the definition of crime, a United Nations Research institute observed that:<br/>Crime in the sense of a breach of a legal prohibition is a universal concept, but what actually constitutes a crime and how seriously it should be regarded, varies enormously from one society to another. Perceptions of crime are not determined by any objective indicator of the degree of injury or damage but by cultural values and power relations.</p> <p>In a strict legal definition, however, a crime is a violation of the criminal law, which is subsequently followed by legal punishment. In criminal law, a crime is an act of omission, which attracts sanctions, such as fine, imprisonment, or even death.<br/>A crime in law consists of two basic elements, the actus reus and the mens rea. The actus reus is the physical element or the guilty act, and it requires proof. Where there is no actus reus, there is no crime. It includes all the elements in the definition of the crime with the exception of the mental element. The actus reus could be made up of conduct, its consequences and the circumstances in which the conduct takes place.<br/>Criminologists are very much concerned with all potentially criminal behaviour, but not only in the strict legal sense. The definition of crime among criminologists will therefore recognize factors such as value system, norms and religious attitudes in a given culture. Crime is therefore a reflection of cultural legal system, a violation of the rules agreed to be respected by all members of the society, and upon which the rest members of the society mete sanctions upon those guilty of the violation. It is for this same reasons that the legal system views crime as a public and moral wrong. It is public wrong because “crimes are wrongs which the judges have held, or parliament has from time to time laid down, and are sufficiently injurious to the public to warrant the application of criminal procedure to deal with them. Likewise, it is a moral wrong because, according to Lord Devlin:<br/>There is a public morality which is an essential part of the bondage which keeps society together and that society may use the criminal law to preserve morality in the same way that it uses it to preserve anything else that is essential to its existence.</p> <p>Criminal law is therefore seen to be concerned with public wrongs, or wrongs against society. Such wrongs involve acts of physical violence, such as murder and rape; infringement of property rights, such as theft, fraud and burglary; and crimes against health, morals, and public safety, such as prostitution, gambling, drug abuse, homosexuality, and so on.<br/>Crime and Its Causes<br/>All theories of criminal behaviour attempts to address the question why people commit crime on the assumption that such a course of action is inexplicable, therefore criminals are somehow different from the rest of society; and that there might be single cause of criminal behaviour. However, criminal behaviour cannot be explained by a single factor, because human behaviour is a complex interaction between genetic, environmental, social, psychological and cultural factors. In the first instance, there are many different types of crimes committed by different types of people at different times, in different places, and under different circumstances.<br/>Any attempt therefore to find fixed</p>\n\nCRIMINOLOGY: SOCIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF GENDER, RACE AND RELIGION ON CRIME<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRIMINOLOGY: SOCIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF GENDER, RACE AND RELIGION ON CRIME", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND OIL SPILLAGES: AN INDICTMENT TO HUMAN RIGHT AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW</p> <p>BY<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>Title Page – – – – – – i<br/>Certification – – – – – – ii<br/>Approval – – – – – – iii<br/>Dedication – – – – – – iv<br/>Acknowledgement – – – – – – v<br/>Table of Contents – – – – – – viii<br/>Table of Statutes – – – – – – x<br/>Table of Cases – – – – – – xii<br/>Abbreviations – – – – – – xiii<br/>CHAPTER ONE: Introduction 1<br/>What is Environmental Degradation 2<br/>The Emergence of Environmental Degradation 7<br/>Classifications of Environmental Degradation 16<br/>Notable forms of Environmental Degradation 19<br/>Challenges posed by Environmental Degradation 24<br/>CHAPTER TWO: Human and Environmental Right or<br/>Law Concept 32<br/>The Human Rights Concept 32<br/>The Environmental Right Concept 35<br/>The Nigeria Constitution, Human and<br/>Environmental Rights 37<br/>The Impediments confronting judicial enforcement<br/>of Environmental Laws in Nigeria. 45</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE: Environmental Degradation as an<br/>Indictment to Human Right and<br/>Environmental law<br/>3.1 An Appraisal 53</p> <p>3.2 Environmental Degradation as Indictment or<br/>Violation of Human Right 54</p> <p>Environmental Degradation as Indictment to<br/>Environmental Right in Nigeria 65</p> <p>Environmental Degradation as an Indictment to<br/>International Environmental Legal Instruments 73</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR: Global Efforts at combating<br/>Environmental Degradation</p> <p>An Appraisal 78<br/>Environmental Degradation as an indictment to<br/>Environmental law in U.K. and U.S.A. 79</p> <p>Global inability to enforce Laws against<br/>Environmental Degradation 83</p> <p>The Industrialized countries as Violators/Culprits<br/>Of Environmental Degradation 93</p> <p>International Agency/Co-operations in combating<br/>Environmental Degradation. 95</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE: Conclusion and Recommendations</p> <p>Conclusion 100<br/>Recommendations 103</p> <p>Bibliography 110</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>Associated Gas Re-injection Act, Cap 26, LFN 1990 40, 48, 65, 67</p> <p>Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. 38, 39, 47, 55-60, 62-65, 104</p> <p>Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by<br/>Dumping of waste and other matters 1992 73, 86</p> <p>U.N.

It is indisputable that the natural environment before the advent of environmental degradation, created unlimited opportunities for development and economic sufficiency of the inhabitants or the populace, but with the advent of environmental degradation, the inhabitants have been denied these opportunities and made to languish in abject poverty.<br/>In recognition of the dangers posed by environmental degradation, the international community and the Nigerian government have put in place various laws to combat environmental degradation, while the various environmental laws in Nigeria and that of the international community (international legal instrument) in combating environmental degradations intended to yield encouraging result by enhancing environmental sustainability. The recalcitrant attitude of those involved in environmental degradation has continued to attenuate environmental laws with the government and its agency indirectly collaborating in the act of flouting environmental laws.<br/>Unfortunately, the existing law legal mechanism in place have done little or nothing to eradicate this menace of environmental degradation. Environmental degradation continues to evolve everyday and everywhere with no end in sight of how this crime can be checked.<br/>Thus this thesis intends to appraise how environmental degradation constitutes an indictment to human right and environmental laws. It also aims to serve as a theoretical framework for the review and harmonization of the relevant municipal and legal instruments. Similarly international agency/corporation in combating environmental degradation will not be left out.<br/>Hence, it is imperative to give a brief description or definition of environmental degradation.<br/>Environmental Degradation<br/>Before environmental degradation is considered we must first of all know what is environment or what constitutes the environment.<br/>Environment is the natural world in which people, animals and plants live. The Black’s Law Dictionary also defines it as the totality of physical, economic, cultural, aesthetic and social circumstances and factors which surround and affect the desirability of value of property and which also affect the quality of life of people’s lives. Under the Nigeria law, “environment” includes water, air, land and all plants and human beings or animals living therein and the inter-relationship which exist among these or any of them. Therefore Environmental Degradation is the deterioration of the environment through depletion of resources such as air, water and soil; the destruction of the ecosystems and the extinction of wildlife.<br/>Environmental degradation is one of the ten threats officially cautioned by the high level threat panel of the United Nations. Therefore the importance and relevance of the environment cannot be over-emphasized, the environment is a complex and delicate system that when properly managed and harnessed can be geared to productive domestic, aesthetic and even spiritual benefit but when poorly managed could predictably be hazardous not only to human survival, but the survival of all living things. It is therefore inferable that the environment is the physical foundation upon which survival rests.<br/>It is however sad to note that over the years, the environment has been greatly threatened with adverse and disastrous effects on human habitation and survival, which has reflected in the World Bank report. More than 30,000 people die each day globally, short of their predestined life span due to environmental degradation and pollution. In a year, 108 million people die as a result of environmental degradation and pollution. Further research shows that between 1990 and 2009, which has a period of 19 years, about 7.3 million people died worldwide due to environmental degradation and pollution. Therefore it constitutes a threat to the existence of mankind and needs to be checked by all the countries and organizations in the globe</p>\n\nENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND OIL SPILLAGES: AN INDICTMENT TO HUMAN RIGHT AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND OIL SPILLAGES: AN INDICTMENT TO HUMAN RIGHT AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW", "id": 60}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>RIGHTS AND OBLIGATION OF PARTIES UNDER THE CONTRACT OF CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA</p> <p> TABLE OF CASES PAGES </p> <p>Archbold (Freightage) Ltd. v.

The purpose of this project is to illuminate the nature and the inherent features present in the contract of Carriage of Goods by Sea and to also highlight the rights as well as the duties owed by the parties. It also seeks to point the obligations the law imposes on the parties as well as the liabilities they would incur on the event of breach in this form of contract.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>THE NATURE OF THE CONTRACT OF CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA</strong></p> <p>1.1 <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Man has always been by his nature an interactive and interdependent being, and trade has been one of those means by which he interacts and shows his interdependency. He engages in the exchange of goods and services for a valuable consideration.</p> <p>The concept of international trade is not new to man, only that here, this form of exchange seems to resonate on a much broader platform involving a complex web of structures and processes which makes this sort of transaction possible and one of this structure is the carriage of goods by sea, thus it is important to point out that, this form of transportation of goods is not only vital to international trade, but it also forms an integral part of it, that the absence it would make international trade very difficult to undertake.</p> <p>Though our focus is the rights and obligations of parties under the carriage of goods by sea, full appreciation of this rights and duties will not be attained, if some attention is not given to highlight the nature of this form of transaction.</p><p> 1.2 DEFINITION </p> <p>The contract of carriage of goods by sea can easily be seen as a contract involving two parties who for an agreed sum agree to be bound by the terms reached by them. But this definition may be very misleading, for though the contract of carriage involve this important element it is not the same as the usual contracts reached and agreed by parties.</p> <p>Perhaps looking at some definitions posed by some authorities, more light would be shed on the nature of this kind of contract. <em>Clive M. Schmitthoff </em>tried to give a vivid description as to the nature of this contract, here he said that a contract of carriage entails a situation where an exporter concludes with a ship owner to carry goods in his ship from one port to another, usually overseas, such contract is known as the contract of carriage by sea. R.M. Goode on the other hand sees a contract of carriage involving two parties the shipper and the carrier. The shipper is the person to whom the carrier undertakes the duty of transporting the goods.</p> <p><em>Black’s Law Dictionary</em> defines it as an agreement for carriage of goods by water, which may employ a bill of lading, a charter party or both to ship goods.</p> <p>Finally, <em>Article 1 Carriage of Goods By Sea Act</em> defines contract of carriage as those that:</p> <p>“Apply only to contracts covered by a bill of lading or any similar document of title, in so far as such document relates to the carriage of goods by sea, including any bill of lading or any similar document as aforesaid issued under a pursuant to a charter party from the moment at which such bill of lading or similar document of title regulates the relations between a carrier and a holder of the same”.</p>\n\nRIGHTS AND OBLIGATION OF PARTIES UNDER THE CONTRACT OF CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RIGHTS AND OBLIGATION OF PARTIES UNDER THE CONTRACT OF CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>WRONGFUL TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA: A CASE FOR REINSTATEMENT OF PRIVATE EMPLOYEES</p> <p>BY</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title page – – – – i<br/>Approval page – – – – ii<br/>Dedication – – – – iii<br/>Acknowledgement – – – iv<br/>Abstract – – – – v<br/>Table of Contents – – – vi<br/>Table of Cases – – – ix<br/>Table of Statutes – – – xii<br/>Abbreviations – – – xiv</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE: CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT: MEANING AND NATURE</p> <p>Introduction – – – 1<br/>Meaning and Nature of Contract of Employment 1<br/>Offer and Acceptance – – 2<br/>Consideration – – – 3<br/>Intention to Create legal relation – – 4<br/>Capacity – – – 4<br/>Parties to a Contract of Employment – – 6<br/>Employer – – – 7<br/>Employee – – – 8<br/>Independent Contractor – – 8<br/>Why an Employee needs Protection – – 9<br/>Conclusion – – – 11<br/>CHAPTER TWO: TERMINATION OF CONTRACT OF<br/>PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT</p> <p>Introduction – – – 13<br/>Under Public Employment – – 13<br/>Different methods of Termination of Contract<br/>of Employment – – – 15<br/>Termination by Operation of Law – 16<br/>Termination by Intention of Parties – 20<br/>Summary Dismissal – – 27<br/>Conclusion – – – 30</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE: WRONGFUL TERMINATION OF CONTRACT OF PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT</p> <p>Introduction – – – 33<br/>Wrongful Termination of Contract of Private<br/>Employment – – – 34<br/>Lack of Just Cause – – – 36<br/>Wrong Procedure – – – 42<br/>Lack of Proper Notice – – 46<br/>Breach of the Rules of Natural Justice – 51<br/>Conclusion – – – 55<br/>CHAPTER FOUR: REINSTATEMENT<br/>Introduction – – 58<br/>Reinstatement – – – 59<br/>Conclusion – – 70<br/>CHAPTER FIVE: OBSERVATIONS, SUGGESTIONS<br/>AND CONCLUSION<br/>Introduction – – – 72<br/>Observation and suggestions – – 73<br/>Conclusion – – – 82<br/>Bibliography – – – 86</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>AFOLABI v.

S. – Section<br/>27. pp. – Page</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT: MEANING AND NATURE</p> <p>1.1 Introduction<br/>A contract of employment is an agreement between two or more persons relationship established by contract, creating an obligation to do a particular thing in a contract of employment.<br/>1.2 Meaning and Nature<br/>The nature of contract of employment is the relationship between an employer and his employee comes into existence as a result of a contract between them generally referred to a contract of service, which means any agreement whether oral or written, expressed or implied, where by one person agrees to employ another as a worker and that other person agrees to serve the employer as a worker as contained in Labour Act<br/>Generally, the contract of employment is an off-shoot of our general law of contract where the essential ingredients of the contract must be found present before it’s enforceability.<br/>1.2.1 Offer and Acceptance<br/>In every contract of an employment, there is a meeting of the minds of the parties before the enforceability of the contract. That is to say, an offer must be made by one party called (offeror) as in Callil v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. and the acceptance of the offer by the other party called (offeree) as in the case of Afolabi v. Polymera Ind. Nig. Ltd. This principle of offer and acceptance entails freedom of both parties to offer and accept unconditionally the terms of employment.<br/>1.2.2 Consideration<br/>In a contract of employment, where there is an offer and acceptance by both parties to the contract of services, there must be a consideration to furnished the contract, describing some rights, interest, profit or benefit occurring to one party or some fore-bearance detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaking by the other. The above explanation was illustrated in the case of Currie v. Misa Therefore, consideration in the contract of employment is the salary and other fringe benefits which an employee earns on one part and services which an employer receives on the other part.</p> <p>1.2.3 Intention to create Legal Relation<br/>The relationship between an employer and employee is established by contract. Where both parties agreed on the terms of the contract of employment, creating a common intention of both parties to enter into a legal obligation that is contained in the employment agreement Rose and Frank v. Crompton<br/>1.2.4 Capacity<br/>The law is settled that parties to a contract of employment must possess the capacity of contract as recognized by law at common law. Certain categories of persons namely; infants, mentally infirm and disordered person and drunkards in certain circumstance are incapable of entering into a contract. This has been specified in our statute Nigeria Labour Act 2004.<br/>In the case of an infant, the law forbids to engage a person (child) below the age of sixteen years from entering into any contract of employment except that of an apprenticeship. But the Act provides in Section 19(1) of the Labour Act 2004 that a child under twelve years of age can be employed only by a member of his family and even then, subject to his rights, agricultural, horticultural or domestic work approved by the Minister of Labour as stated in Section 91(1) (a) Labour Act.<br/>However, Section 59 of the Act is an exception apparently to enable a youth receive his education in a technical school. In respect of working on a ship in general, Section 61 (3) of the Act provides that even when the non-adult is allowed to be so employed, he can work only on a vessel in which only members of the same class are employed.<br/>Under Section 59 of the Act, the Minister of Labour has power to notify an employer in writing that the kind of work in which a young person is employed is injurious to his health, immoral or otherwise unsuitable.<br/>Finally on mentally infirm and disordered person are persons who are insane, unsound minds incapable of being conscious and rational thinking on the obligation of the terms of the contract of employment.<br/>1.3 Parties to a Contract of Employment<br/>A contract of employment or services is entered into and enforceable by the employers and the employees, which automatically forms or constitute the major parties to a contract of employment in Nigeria Labour Law.<br/>A person who is in a contract of employment with another cannot be transferred to another employer without his consent. This is in conformity with the provision Section 10 (1) of the Act which provides as follows<br/>“The transfer of any contract from one employer to another shall be subject to the consent of the worker and the endorsement of the transfer upon the contract by an authorised labour officer”.</p>\n\nWRONGFUL TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA: A CASE FOR REINSTATEMENT OF PRIVATE EMPLOYEES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WRONGFUL TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA: A CASE FOR REINSTATEMENT OF PRIVATE EMPLOYEES", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A LEGAL AND JURISPRUDENTIAL ANALYSIS OF HOMOSEXUALITY AND SAME SEX MARRIAGES: SUPPORTING THE NIGERIAN POSITION</p> <p>BY</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title Page i<br/>Certification ii<br/>Approval iii<br/>Dedication iv<br/>Acknowledgement v<br/>Table of Contents vii<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Definition of Homosexuality 1<br/>1.2 Who is a Homosexual? 16<br/>1.3 What is Marriage? 18<br/>1.4 Forms of Same-Sex Marriages 26<br/>1.5 Same-Sex Marriage in Contradistinction with Purpose<br/>of Marriage in the Ordinary Sense 30<br/>CHAPTER TWO: LAW AND MORALITY IN RELATION TO HOMOSEXUALITY AND SAME MARRIAGES</p> <p>2.1 The Moral Implication of Homosexuality and Same-Sex<br/>Marriage 35</p> <p>2.2 Moral Implication of Homosexuality in Nigeria 47<br/>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.1 Anti-Homosexuality and Same-Sex Marriage<br/>Legislations in Nigeria 56</p> <p>3.2 Attempts by the Nigerian Legislature and People<br/>to Stopping the Scourge 59</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR: OPINION ACROSS THE WORLD<br/>4.1 Social and Legal View Point of Homosexuality<br/>Around the World History 68</p> <p>4.2 Social and Legal View Point of Homosexuality<br/>in America 72</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.1 Conclusion 78<br/>5.2 Recommendations 81<br/>Bibliography 82</p>\n\nA LEGAL AND JURISPRUDENTIAL ANALYSIS OF HOMOSEXUALITY AND SAME SEX MARRIAGES: SUPPORTING THE NIGERIAN POSITION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A LEGAL AND JURISPRUDENTIAL ANALYSIS OF HOMOSEXUALITY AND SAME SEX MARRIAGES: SUPPORTING THE NIGERIAN POSITION", "id": 63}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AND ITS ROLE IN THE PROSECUTION OF GENOCIDE</p> <p>BY</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>CONCEPT OF CRIMES AND THE NECESSITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT</p> <p>Introduction<br/>The history of mankind is a chronicle of bloodshed and violence among people with competing interests, ideologies and aspirations. In the face of the calamitous historical records, one might be tempted to conclude that ingrained practices are inexorable and unalterable and that the final arbiter of irreconcilable disputes between sovereign states will remain the power of armed might.<br/>However, significant changes have taken place which points a striking fact that the old ways are not necessarily immutable, and in a thermonuclear world, the illogical deduction that the violent past is merely prologue to the future might turn out to be man’s most suicidal error. The dire need for justice to take its full course cannot be over-flogged or over-emphasized:<br/>But there can be no peace without justice, no justice without law, and no meaningful law without a court to decide what is just and fair under any given circumstance. The process of codification, adjudication and enforcement is as vital to a tranquil international community as it is to any independent national state”.</p> <p>This was succinctly stated by Benjamin B. Ferencz in his book “An International Criminal Court, A Step towards World Peace”. He saw the need for the codification of laws in a bid to achieve justice in its greatest maximum and a permanent court to implement such goals bringing it to fruition.<br/>The concept of an international arm code and an international criminal court are the results of two trends in international law- The need to punish offenders (individuals) for international crimes, and the need for an impartial international tribunal or court; hence the of International Criminal Court. Kofi Annan, former United Nations Secretary-General said thus:<br/>For nearly half a century – almost as long as the United Nations has been in existence – the General Assembly has recognized the need to establish such a court to prosecute and punish persons responsible for crimes such as genocide. Many thought… that the horrors of the Second World War – the camps, the cruelty, the extermination, the Holocaust – could never happen again. And yet, they have, in Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda. Our time – this decade even – has shown us that man’s capacity for evil knows no limits. Genocide… is now a word of our time too, a heinous reality that calls for a historic response.</p> <p>The “response” he referred to in his above words of wisdom, is a permanent court girded and saddled with the responsibility of promoting justice by holding individuals accountable; to end impunity; to help end conflicts and ease the transition to peace; to remedy the deficiencies of ad hoc tribunals and to deter future war crimes.<br/>In the long run, the great question that comes to play is: “How far has the court fared in the actualization of its goals. Propagation of justice and the abatement of international crimes to its bearest minimum”. Thomas Darnstadt et al equally stated thus in his book. A dangerous luxury: The International criminal Court’s Dream of Global Justice.<br/>“The International Criminal Court in the Hague is supposed to bring war criminals to justice, but it has yet to deliver a single verdict. Can International law bring peace to war-ran regions – or does it actually hinder the peace process”.<br/>A cursory look into the history, necessity and role of the International Criminal Court will therefore be done. The attitudes of states towards its existence and their cooperation geared towards supporting the court’s operation will not be left out.<br/>It is worthy of note that the dangers of international crimes with particular reference to genocide cannot be over-emphasized and should be given prompt attention and effective solutions/control strategies proffered. We seek a climate where the global economy and open trade are graving, where democratic norms and respect for human dignity and rights are increasingly accepted and where terrorism, drug trafficking and international crimes do not undermine stability and peaceful relations.<br/>1.2 Definition of International Crimes<br/>The prosecution of severe international crimes is a necessary to enforce international criminal law and deliver justice to victims. This is an important component of transitional justice or the process of transforming societies into rights respecting democracies and addressing past human rights violations.<br/>What then are International Crimes?<br/>In an early essay on “International criminal law”, Sir John Fischer Williams opined that “International crimes” appeared “to have at least two meanings: one, a crime against international law, and the other, ‘a crime which brings or may bring an offender into conflict with the laws of more than one country. It is this second sense which is the most popular use of the phrase and which is associated with the “International criminal” who is known to the authorities of more than one Police Force”.<br/>International crimes has also been broadly defined as “an act universally recognized as criminal which is considered a grave matter of international concern and for some valid reasons cannot be left within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state that would have control over it under ordinary circumstances”.<br/>This strikes a cord to the fact that international law imposes criminal liability directly on individuals. Erstwhile, it was questionable whether “true offenders” could actually be brought to book and punished accordingly, especially where such laws addressed itself only to states. It could repress individual conduct only by authorizing states to do so through their legal systems. However, since the end of the Second World War, the notion has thus transcended to the fact that individuals can have both international rights and duties, “there has been an increasing trend towards the expansion of individual responsibility directly established under international law.<br/>The crimes that states are thereby obligated to repress can be classified in different ways. The most generally useful schemes may be one that distinguishes between various types of international crimes on the basis of the degree of official involvement in the conduct constituting the crime. Accordingly, international crime can be adjudged roughly into three general heads.<br/>The first general heading includes violations of international norms directed towards restraining the conduct of state officials acting under colour of law. Offences under this heading include; conventional war crimes such as violations of the Hague and Geneva Convention, in addition are two other categories of crime that were prosecuted at Nuremberg: Crimes against peace and crimes against humanity. They are equally known to comprise of the “classical domain” of international criminal law. By extension this heading includes: genocide, apartheid and torture.<br/>The second heading includes the crimes associated with terrorist activities that have been the subject of the relatively recent conventions. This dwells strictly on criminal responsibility by individuals. The subject of these conventions is to deny offenders “safe haven” to close bolt holes. A classical example is the offence of piracy. “<br/>The third heading covers other acts of private individuals that have been subjected to treaty prohibition because they involve either transnational traffic or illicit commodities (narcotics, endangered species and at one time obscene publication).<br/>International crimes are also classified or categorized as “crimes against the peace and security of mankind”.<br/>Article 16 crime of Aggression<br/>Article 17 Crime of genocide<br/>Article 18 Crime against Humanity<br/>Article 19 Crimes against United Nations and Associated Personnel<br/>Article 20 War Crimes</p>\n\nTHE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AND ITS ROLE IN THE PROSECUTION OF GENOCIDE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AND ITS ROLE IN THE PROSECUTION OF GENOCIDE", "id": 64}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>AN EXAMINATION OF CORRUPTION UNDER THE NIGERIA CRIMINAL LAW</p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p> <strong>This research work examines corruption, its legal effect, its meanings and peculiar manifestation in the Nigeria society.

Rules of Court are meant to be obeyed. Apart from Rules of Court, there are other statutes which provide for procedure. Apart from Rules of Court or statutes which are specifically enacted to regulate procedure, other statutes which establish corporations for example, also stipulate procedural requirements. A good number of pre-action notices can be found in such statutes. The law is that where a statute has provided for how something should be done, such a provision must be complied with. It is indeed a concern that the applicability of pre-action notice is not in consonance with the spirit of the rule of law. It is important to note that a deep-rooted analysis of relevant procedural law does not in fact guarantee pre-action notice any justification. No useful purpose is achieved by continuing to uphold the constitutionality of pre-action notices. The reasons which are used to justify the notices can be dispensed with. A letter from a prospective plaintiff or his agent should be enough to commence a process of deciding whether to make reparations to the plaintiff or not. Anachronistic rules such as pre-action notices serve no end of justice and it is often a procedural requirement which is employed by defendants to delay or deny an inquiry into the merits of the case. They also cause untold hardship. The aim of this work is to distill the inadequacies and excesses of pre-action notice as currently applicable in Nigeria. This work will also look at the position of other countries as it relates to the doctrine of pre-action notice and finally proffer solutions. This work is divided into five chapters. Chapter One deals with the general introduction while Chapter Two deals with the doctrine of pre-action notice as it applies in Nigeria. Chapter Three deals with the doctrine of pre-action notice as an obstacle to justice while Chapter Four deals with the application of the doctrine of pre-action notice in foreign jurisdictions. Finally, Chapter Five deals with the conclusion and recommendations.</p>\n\nA CRITIQUE ON THE DOCTRINE OF PRE-ACTION NOTICE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITIQUE ON THE DOCTRINE OF PRE-ACTION NOTICE IN NIGERIA", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ENFORCEABILITY OF AGE LIMIT FOR MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA</p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Child Marriage is a topic which has raised so much public outburst and has caused a lot of controversies. It is a topic which comes with it a great deal of public emotions. Child marriage is tied to a number of factors including religion, traditions and customs. Child marriage usually refers to two separate phenomena which are practical in some societies. The first and most common practice is that of a young child being given out in marriage to an adult. In practice, it is almost always a young girl being married to a man. The second practice is a form of arranged marriage in which the parents of two children from different families arrange a future marriage. In practice, the individuals who become betrothed often do not meet one another till the wedding ceremony, which occurs when they are both considered to be of marriageable age. Whether a marriage is to be condemned for falling within the meaning of child marriage depends on whether such marriage is between an adult and a child. In other words, a marriage is enforceable only when it cannot be said to be a child marriage. The question that this raises therefore is, “what is the age limit for a valid marriage?” the answer to this question appears to be uncertain. The law has made an attempt in this regard. For instance in Nigeria, some statutes provide a specific age as the minimum age for marriage. The problem however is that there is no uniformity of application of these statutes. Indeed the law on age limit for marriage in the Southern Nigeria is not uniform with the Sharia law as it applies in some Northern parts of Nigeria. Again, the customary laws of the regions appear to apply different standards for determining marriageable age. This work attempts to examine the different enactments in force in Nigeria and how they apply with regard to marriageable age. It also attempts an examination of the customs of the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria namely Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba, and their practices on marriageable age with a view to determining the validity of theses customs based on the validity tests. The work also looks into the practices of other nations on child marriage and marriageable age. A solution on how uniformity of marriageable age can be achieved will be given at the end of the work. This work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the general introduction while chapter two deals with the overview of the statutes that provide for marriageable age in Nigeria. Chapter three deals with marriageable age under the Customary law while chapter four deals with the enforceability of age limit for marriage in foreign jurisdiction. Finally, chapter five deals with the conclusion and recommendations.</p>\n\nENFORCEABILITY OF AGE LIMIT FOR MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENFORCEABILITY OF AGE LIMIT FOR MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>LOCUS STANDI AS AN OBSTACLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Environmental Justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, colour, sex, national origin or income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies.</p> <p>Environmental Justice emerged as a concept in the United States in the early 1980’s; its proponents generally view the environment as encompassing and seek to redress inequitable distributions of environmental burdens.</p> <p>In Nigeria, foreign exchange earnings from crude oil sources account for the single most important source of Nigeria’s foreign exchange. Hence, since oil was discovered in the Niger Delta region of the country in commercial quantities in 1956, there have been increased activities in the oil sector in the areas of exploration and exploitation, refining, export and domestic distribution. While these oil activities have generated immense financial benefits for the country, they have also created serious health and environmental problems.</p> <p>With the increase in the oil activities and its resultant consequences, it became clear that the common law remedies were not easily available to the victims of the pollution. This worked injustice on the victims. Further there was no comprehensive national policy and enforcement statute for the country’s environmental protection. It took the 1988 Koko toxic waste dump for the country to fashion out a national policy on the Environment with supporting statutory legislations.</p> <p>However, even with the statutory legislation in place the problems of the victims were far from over. These victims hardly get any justice from the courts. This is because of the many impediments that comes with environmental litigation, the most troublesome being the doctrine of <em>locus standi</em>. The doctrine of <em>locus standi</em> is a common law doctrine that has found its way into our legal system. <em>Locus standi</em> is the existence of a right of an individual or group of individuals to bring an action before a court of law for adjudication.</p> <p>This work seeks to examine the concept of environmental justice in Nigeria, what constitutes Environmental justice, its impediments, and to this extent, we will look at the doctrine of locus standi and its effect on Environmental justice. We will also look at other impediments to Environmental justice. We will also look at few foreign jurisdictions to find out how the concept of environmental justice has been applied. Finally, we will proffer solutions on how best to achieve environmental justice.</p> <p>This work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the general introduction. Chapter two deals with the issue of <em>locus standi</em> in Nigeria. Chapter three deals with the challenges of Environmental justice. Chapter four deals with Environmental justice in foreign jurisdictions. Finally, chapter five deal with conclusion and recommendation.</p> </div> <p><strong> <strong><br/></strong></strong></p>\n\nLOCUS STANDI AS AN OBSTACLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LOCUS STANDI AS AN OBSTACLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN NIGERIA", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CONFLICT BETWEEN SHARIA LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW ON RIGHTS OF WOMEN. AN APPRAISAL</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>The practice of Islamic law in Nigeria, by northern states, raises a number of constitutional questions and questions the supremacy of the constitution.  The activities of these states have shown that the federal government do not really have the interest of its citizens and have refuse to strictly enforce the spirit of  the letters in the Nigerian constitution which provides for the unity, peace, principle of freedom equity and justice – in Nigeria[1].  Thus, no discrimination is envisaged by the constitution. This lack of enforcement is more burdened on women who are said to be governed under Islamic law, especially, as it relates to fair hearing towards them. Thus, instances have shown that fair hearing is not for women. This is one of the greatest threats in democracy and more so, the nation’s constitution. The civil liberties organization reports that: an 18-year-old nursing mother Tawa Bello was subjected to ten stroke of canes after being convicted by a Sharia Court in Guassau Capital of Zamfara States, for wandering and prostitution. This court did refuse to hear her side of the story and did not give her legal representation[2].</p> <p>         Discrimination against women is institutionalized in parts of the Islamic criminal legislation, which has resulted to lack of fair hearing towards women.</p> <p>There are two main provisions in the law, which discriminate against women. The first is the inequality in the weight of testimony. According to the sharia penal codes, a woman’s testimony as evidence in a trial is worth half of a man or the testimony of one male witness equals that of two female witnesses.</p> <p>Another aspect of discrimination, which can lead to lack of fair hearing, is the inequality in standard of evidence in cases of Zina. Women have been adversely affected in these cases under the sharia codes in force in Nigeria, based on the maliki school of thought; pregnancy is consideredsufficient evidence to convict a woman of adultery. For the male defendant, the sharia penal code requires that the act of adultery must have been witnessed by four independent individuals before the man can be convicted - a standard of proof which is usually impossible to obtain and has not been obtained in any of the cases which have been arisen so far. This glaring discrimination in standards of evidence has had serious consequences for women charged with Zina. It has resulted in situations such as those of BariyaMagazis. SafiyaHusseni[3] and AminaLawal.[4] There have been also been cases when men have been convicted for adultery but these conviction have usually been based on the man’s own confession. The intriguing thing about this kind of society or judicial system is that, women are very vulnerable and they suffer from this form of human right abuse and violations.</p> <p>         This paper is written to address the problem of lack of fair hearing towards women who are governed by Islamic law (Sharia) in Nigeria. From this paper, it will be shown how injustice have been meted on the woman governed under Islamic law (Sharia) in relation to fair hearing as it contradicts  the provision of section 36 of the Nigeria constitution of 1999 (as amended).</p> <p><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Fair hearing is a very important, in every legal system.It tells a lot about a particular society or brings bad light or image about a particular society that does not practice it or adhere to it.</p> <p>Lack of fair hearing or the non-observance of the principle of fair hearing especially as it relates to women govern under Islamic law in Nigeria can ensure a lot or problems which include:</p> <p>1.          Lack of public confidence in the legal system which can lead to anarchy in the country</p> <p>2.          It will affect the economic development of that part of the country because of the inhuman laws that is applicable.</p> <p>3.          Devalues the force behind the constitution.</p> <p>4.          Paves way for high level of illiteracy towards women due to the realistic intimidation before them.</p> <p><strong>Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>In the course of this short essay, my intensions, is to exposes the contradictory provisions of the Islamic laws (Sharia) as it regards to fair hearing toward women, in the Nigerian constitution 1999 (as amended). Also, examine the extent to which it can affect the regions of the country.</p> <p>Consequently, to examine how it impedes human development to that part of the country that do not adhere to the practice of fair hearing.</p> <p>Furthermore, to investigate the extent to which the practice of not adhering to the principle of fair hearing towards women, has eaten deep into the Nigerian legal system.</p> <p>         Lastly, to suggest solutions on the need to repeal some of these lawsthat is contradictory to the provisions of the constitution regarding the subject matter.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>This study will firstly, add to the wealth of literatures existing in this subject matter of law for educational purposes. However, the work will be more valuable to lawyers and Islamic law judges. The reason is  that the beginning and end of a matter or case in court rest on how well the principle of fair hearing have been used in  the adjudication of a matter. Any breach of this principle results to the nullity of the entire process no matter how well conducted it may appear.</p> <p>         The Nigerian population is largely uneducated especially women in the northern part of Nigeria, this study will be an eye opener to civil rights group and NGOs to do more in their pursuit for human rights.</p> <p>         Likewise, the executive arm of government, to know the way women are being treated in the northern part of country and what can be done about the situation. </p> <p>To the legislators, to know the laws that are not intandem with the constitution and see how these laws can be amended or reflect the spirit of the constitution.</p> <p>And lastly to the general public especially women in the north, to know the realities to steering them before their eye and possible ways to go about this reality.</p> <p><strong>Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>This work will span through the unconstitutionality of Islamic law in Nigeria especially as it relates to the lack of fair hearing towards women who are govern under Islamic law in Nigeria. This will involve an examination of specific cases where the Islamic law court have gone contrary to the principle of fair hearing which is more burden on the woman.</p> <p><strong>Research methodology</strong></p> <p>In sourcing for materials for this work, the law library was of immense help in sourcing for materials as it availed me a variety of opinions and argument from different Islamic laws scholars and lawyers and civil groups as continued in both articles, publications and books written by Nigerian authors. Also given the computer age, it is no doubt that the internet facility was in no small helpful as there were plethora of materials that came handy as online articles.</p> <p><strong>Literature review</strong></p> <p>Related works do not directly discuss our topic however, various authors have expressed their opinion on their articles on issues of fair hearing towards women who are governed under Islamic law.</p> <p>Ikenga,[5] is of the view that, the Quran reveals the general tradition imposed on all testamentary evidence in Islam that, the evidence of a woman is half the evidence value of one man. The verse states [6] “when you contact a debt for a fixed period, write it down… and get two witness out of your own men… and if there are no men available,  then a man and two women, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her ….”</p> <p>         However, from the foregoing verse, it can be seen that this evidentiary rule is primarily restricted to cases of business transactions, civil debts and contracts. It is true that as lacking in experience and requisite skills, however, this practice is still in force in the modern society such as the Nigerian society.</p> <p>         Ikenga is of the view that this Islamic practice in the aforementioned verse is still being practice and it is in at variance with the provision of the section 42 of the constitution which[7] state;</p> <p>         “A citizen of Nigeria of a particular community, ethnic group, place of origin, sex, religion or political opinion shall not by reason only that he is such a person</p> <p>a.           Be subjected either expressly by or in the practical application of, any law in force in Nigeria or any executive administrative action of the government, disabilities or restrictions to which citizens of Nigeria of other communities, ethnic group, sex,religions or political opinion, are not made subject to”.</p> <p>Also section 17 (2) (a)[8] which states</p> <p>“In furtherance of the social order every citizen shall have equally rights, obligations and opportunities before the law”.</p> <p>He further opines that, by extrapolation, this practice perhaps degrades the human status of women folk alberts by making two women equal to one man. Hence, this unfair gender equation collides with the provision of section 34 of the Nigerianconstitution which states that no person shall be subject to degrading treatment. He further said that besides, Nigerian adjectival law regard everybody as equal irrespective of gender as a competent witness in court proceedings except, in the consideration of the court, one is prevented from understanding the questions by reason of tender years, extreme old age, diseases whether of the body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind[9].</p> <p>         Ikenga concluded by saying that nowhere is the court consideration based on gender yet in Nigeria today Shariacourts have insisted on two women as equivalent to one man. This has even been made statutory in some of the Shariapenal codes.</p> <p>         On  the issue of procedural irregularities of Shariacourts[10] he is of the view that, all the notorious criminal causes decided by one Shariatrail court judges since 2000 in respect of adultery or fornication (Zina), women have always been victims of judicial disregard to the constitution safeguards on fair hearing as provided in section 36 of the constitution. These constitutional safeguards or procedural guarantees are mainly the basic rights of an accused person before, during and after the trial. Hence, in the cases of the state vsSafiyatuTudis[11] and the state vsAminaLawalKurami[12], the procedural guarantees were not observed in favour of the accused person, thereby resulting to denial of justice and violation of fundamental rights.</p> <p>         Ikenga wonders whether the court’s decision confirmed to the equality cause of section 14 of the constitution and non-discrimination provisions of section 42 thereof.</p> <p>         Simeon Emakhis[13] is of the view that there isa lot of discrimination against women prevalent in northern Nigeria. Firstly, Shariadevaluatea women’s testimony or evidence in areas courts. Secondly, punishment mented out by Shariacourt in adultery cases discriminates against women[14]. She further complains on the wrong impression that, adultery could be committed by one person.</p> <p>         She concludes by calling on all state parties to take appropriate measures to modify or abolish such discriminating laws.</p> <p>Izabazza[15] is of the opinion that, there are specific or direct law to protect the right of women and that the existing laws are not adequate. She further grieved that, even the laws which stipulates the fundamental rights[16]are not being known by most women. She concludes by saying that there are many laws which implies protection of women in Nigeria but these laws are not implemented.</p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Islam</strong></p> <p>Islam is seen as one of the three main religions in Nigeria which adherents are predominant in the north. Its teachings are founded on the Quran, life of Muhammad and some other sources (Ozigbo 1988:2). An adherent of Islam is called a Muslim which is the active participle of the same verb of which Islam is the infinitive.</p> <p><strong>Sharia</strong></p> <p>Sharia is Arabic word that literally means “a drinking place” or “a path leading to a watering hole” (Ubaka, 2000:11, Kenny, 1986:20). The implication is that since water is regarded as a source of life, Muslim claim that Sharia is the foundation of not only earthly but also eternal life. Farlex (2009) describes Sharia as a code of law derived from the Quran and from the teaching and examples of Mohammed. Johnson (2009:) expands the meaning of Shariaas “inspired not only by Islam and Quranbut also by Arabic traditions and early Islamic scholars”. In this paper, Shariais understood as constituting those rules of conduct derived from different sources of Islamic religion and codified into a body of law by relevant legislatures with the intention of getting them enforced through state machinery. It is equally understood as that body of Islamic law as interpreted by the Maliki School of Islamic jurispendence which is the only acceptable version in Nigerian Islam.</p> <p><strong>Zina</strong>: is an Islamic law concerning unlawful sexual relations between Muslims who are not married to one another through a nikah. It includes extramarital sex and pre-marital sex as adultery, fornication and homosexuality. The Quran deals with Zinain several places. First is the quaranic general rule that commands Muslims not to commit zina. Quran, sura 17 (al sira) ayat 32 reads “nor come nigh to fornication/adultery: for it is shameful deed and an evil, opening the road (to the evils)”.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] Preamble of the federal republic of Nigeria constitution 1999 (as amended) </p> </div> <div> <p>[2] Contrary to section 36 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria</p> </div> <div> <p>[3]  (Unreported) case No USC/GW/CR/FI/10/01; judgement delivered on 9/11/2001</p> </div> <div> <p>[4] (Unreported) case NO 9/2002, sharia court Bakori, Katsina state judgment delivered on 20/03/02</p> </div> <div> <p>[5]       Oragbunam, Ikenga.

Irrua and other towns around her are part of the Esan group. It is situated in the western portion of Esanland. The town covers about 80 square kilometers. It shares a common boundary with Agbede to the north, Ewu to the North-west, Ekpoma to the South-West and Uromi to the South-East.<br/>The town is made up of twenty (20) villages namely; Eguare, Usugenu, Akho, Idumebo, Idumabi, Usenu, Onogbo, Agua, Edenu, Ugbokahre, Ibore, Atuagbo, Ugbalo, Udomi, Ibhuolulu, Afuda, Ekomojoudu, Idumuogodo, Idumoza and Ujabhole. The traditions of origin of the people have put Irrua into two groups: these are Otoruwa group and Uwesan. But administratively Irrua is divided into four (4) groups of Otoruwa, Uwesan, Ikekato, Ujabhole. The Otoruwa group consists of Eguare, Usugbenu, Idumebo, Idumabi and Usenu. Uwesan consists of Onogbo, Agua, Edenu, Akho, Ugbokare and Ibore. Iketato consists of Atuagbo, Ugbalo, Udomi and Ibhuolulu. Ujabhole consists of Aguda, Ekomojouda, Idumuogodo, Idumuoza and Ujabhole.<br/>In pre-colonial times, the people were predominantly farmers due to their fertile soil. There was considerable thick forest in which timber and palm tree were plentiful. The pre-colonial Irrua society depended on Agriculture as the major foundation upon which other economic activities were built. Both men and women had different roles to play in the society. While the men constituted the farming, hunting bands and fighting force, the women were more involved in trading and supplemented the men with the cultivation of crops like, cassava, pepper, tomatoes, okro and beans.<br/>It was through the Onojie of Irrua that most of Enijie in Esan paid their annual tribute to the Oba of Benin. This position given to Irrua was confirmed and awarded the title of Okaijesan on Ikhihibhojere, by Oba Akenzua 1 of Benin in 1723.</p> <p>TRADITIONS OF ORIGIN, MIGRATIONS AND SETTLEMENT<br/>The origin of the people of Irrua is characterized by the lack of documentary sources in explaining it early history which is also peculiar to the pre-colonial history of most West African states and in an attempt to know how the people of Irrua came to be where they are would lead to various accounts of its origin.<br/>According to the people from the Otorowa group, the great migration, which took place in Benin during the 15th and 16th century, mostly during the reign of warrior Kings like Ewuare the great, Oba Ozolua and Esigie brought about the settlement of Irrua.<br/>According to this tradition, the migration from Binis was occasioned by the inhuman mourning laws decreed by Oba Ewuare the great in 1460. Majority of these migrates escaping Ewuare’s tyranny moved in groups. The fleeing Bini groups were led by notable warriors like Oghu, who settled at Ivue, Uromi. They found their way to Esanland after months of wondering in the forest between Benin and Esan. The tradition further states that, the very first group mostly people from Ugboko in Benin City landed in Irrua under the leadership of one Amilele, a great warrior (Okankulo) of Benin. They settled in Irrua territory.<br/>According to Dr. C.G. Okojie in his book “Ishan Native Laws and Customs”, Amilele together with his followers founded the present day Eguare settlement and due to the superiority of the new immigrants in term of number, cooperation and domineering spirit were able to conquer other settlements around them in which some of their neighbours migrated to Iki which is the present day Opoji.<br/>When Oba Ewuare finally realized that he could not use force or the use of force would not be able to bring back his rebellious subjects back to Benin, he sought diplomatic means. He declared a general amnesty to the leaders Okankulo and promised them rewards if they could return to Benin. The group that settled in Irrua sent back to the Oba with the word “Iriowa iide-e” (we are at home, we are not coming). It was the word Iriowa that was later corrupted to Irrua during the colonial era.<br/>The second tradition has it that the people of Irrua migrated from Uhe near Ile-Ife many years ago. Amilele gathered his people and took them on diplomatic visit to Benin to pay homage to the then Oba of Benin who was called Ohe. On getting to Benin, the Oba (Ohe) gave his daughter called Iruiwa to Amilele as his wife and gave him the title of Onojie (Enigie). After a short stay, Amilele and his new wife, together with followers set out from Benin to return home. But on their way home to Ifeku, they stopped to rest on the way and the site they rested became the present day Eguare. While resting, they sighted a large and ripe palm fruit and subsequently interpreted to be an evidence of the fertility of the land. Amilele decided to settle there and sent a report to the Oba of Benin notifying him of their decision to settle in the new territory. There and then they named that settlement Iriowa, after the Oba’s daughter and Amilele beloved wife.<br/>The fault of the second tradition of the origin of the Otorowa people in Irrua is that of Ifeku island which did not occur until the 19th century. However, both traditions of origin have Benin as its place of origin and Amilele as the hero or founder.<br/>According to the intelligence report on Ishan division of Benin Province, has it that they began to grow and in no time other villages were established around Eguare. The villages founded by the descendents of Amilele and his followers were Akho, Eguare, Usugbenu, Idumabi, Idumebo, Usenu and Onogbo. They were collectively known as Otoruwa. Tradition has it that the remaining thirteen villages of Ibore, Atuagbo, Ughekhare, Agua, Ugbalo, Udomi, Ibhuolulu, Eidenu, Afuda, Ekomolouda, Idumogodo, Idimuoza and Ujabhole, migrated originally at different times from Benin, Ifeku, Otuo and Agbede. The establishment of the twenty villages that constituted Irrua will be treated separately.</p> <p>EGUARE<br/>Eguare is the headquarter and residence of the Onojie, due to the arrival of Amilele and his followers. According to the tradition of origin, the immigrants migrated from Ugboka in Benin City. Due to their domineering attitude they were able to conquer the people around them which made some to migrate to Iki-Okpozi. Ekpereijie was the first Onojie appointed by Oba Ewuare in 1463 in Benin City.1</p> <p>AKHO<br/>The indigenous people of Akho came directly from Ibie. They came to settle in Irrua before other people but because they were defeated by Usenu, a later group of immigrants from Usen in Benin City, in the battle of Idigba, their power was redued and they took the third place after Eguare and Usenu in Irrua.<br/>But despite their status which was reduced, Akho still had in possession the Oto shrine (Aluoto). The ownership of the shrine is regarded as the first settler in any area in Esanland according to their belief.</p> <p>USUGBENU<br/>Most of its early founders came from Benin. Usugbenu is the largest village after Eguare. It is divided into five (5) (Idumu) Ikekiyala, Uhaekpen, Ugheriokhua, Uzebu and Ididigba.<br/>Ikekiyala: The founder of this quarter came along with the Benin immigrants led by Amilele. In search for farmland, they crossed the Eguare mot (Iyala) and settled, which gave rise to their name Ikekiyala meaning beyond the mot.<br/>Uhaekpen: the original settlers of this quarters came from Uhaekpen in Benin.<br/>Ughenokhua: Majority of the settlers of this quarters were from Ighanlan (Igalla).<br/>Uzebu: The founders of this quarter came directly from Uzebu quarters in Benin.<br/>Ididigba: This quarter was founded and populated by Irrua princess from Eguare. The founder princess were the princess of the Enijie between Ikhihibhojere and Ogbeide 1720 – 1840.2<br/>Uwelen Edo: Is a sub-quarter in Ididigba and was founded by later immigrants from Benin.</p> <p>USENU<br/>The original inhabitants of Usenu were said to have migrated to the area from Uselu in Benin at the time that the great migration took place in Benin during the reign of Oba Ewuare the great in the 15th century. These immigrants were said to have arrived in Irrua before the arrival of the Ugboka immigrants from Benin who eventually occupied the present Eguare the headquarter of the Onojie. Uselu migrants were said to be great warriors as regard to the defeat of Akho in the battle of Idigba. It was their victory in the battle of Idigba that made them second to the people of Eguare Irrua, in the matter of status and order of settlement.</p> <p>IDUMEBO<br/>Oral tradition has it that majority of its founders were not among those from Benin rather they migrated from Ibiebhe (Iseube)3<br/>The Idumebo quarter was said to have been settled by latter immigrants from Obeidu, a village in the present day Uromi. The original immigrants were said to have arrived Irrua almost the same time as the Ugboka immigrants from Benin.</p> <p>IDUMABI<br/>The founder of this village was said to have come from both Ujagben Urohi, but another account claimed that the original founder of this village were among the followers of Amilele.</p> <p>UNOGBO<br/>Unogbo was founded by Prince Amese (Omese) and his followers4. In the account, Etaghaife and Amese were prince of Ekpeneiji the Onojie of Irrua. Etaghaige was the elder and was obedient to his father the Onojie but Amese the younger was not. To avoid conflict after his death, the Onojie called Amese and gave him riches including slaves and servants and sent him away to the area now called Unogbo with the promise that in the new abode, his elder brother (Etaghaife) and others will no longer be able to interfere in his affairs.5 Amese gladly accepted the offer. Another has it that, Prince Amese was the heir apparent of Ekpereiji the Onojie of Irrua. After the death of his father, Ekpereigie, he collected all his first sons of all families in Irrua and went to Benin in order to collect the staff of office from the Oba of Benin.6<br/>He later returned to Irrua without the first sons he had left Irrua with. This action of Amese angered the Irrua people and they refused to accept him as the Onojie. Subsequently, they drove him away from Eguare. He wandered to Onogbo where he became the founder of the Onogbo people.</p> <p>AGUA<br/>The name Agua is from the Esan world ‘Ogua’ meaning ‘mixture’. As its name is so also is the village, which is made up of three quarters, apart from Eko-Eiche and Eko Kakulu, which are recent settlement.<br/>These three quarters are made up of immigrants from different areas which include Idumu-Eguale, Idumu-Abokha and Egbelualemon.<br/>Idumu-Eguale: The founders of this quarter are immigrant from Ugboha in the present day Esan North East Local Government Area. Their leader was Ihaianlomon.<br/>Idumu-Abokha: Was founded by Emando refugees from the Eguare-Ikeakhe war of 1850 in Ekpoma7. Egbeluabelomon quarters were immigrants from Ujamen, a suburb of Benin.</p> <p>EIDENU<br/>This village was founded by three (3) great warriors namely: Aighe, Unobi and Omorulare. They settled in three different quarters in what came to be known as Eidenu. Eidenu has three quarters Eidenu-Abo, Idinobi and Udowa.<br/>Eidenu-na-Abo was settled by Aighe and his followers. Its first settlement was Odoa. With the continuous increase in population led to the formation of quarters like Idinegbon, Ogbakha, Uwendalo and Eko-nou-khou. It is this area that was settled by the descendants of Aighe that became Eidenu-na-Ato quarters.<br/>Unobi and his followers settled in the quarter now called Idinobi. Due to increase in population Iyobhebhe migrated eastward to establish a quarter called Eko-Iyobhebhe. The descendants of Omariare, a Nupe warrior left Emmaudo-Ekpoma during the Eguare-Ikeakhe wars of 1860 occupies the quarter now known as Udowo. In a report, the three warriors that settled at Eidenu were from Ifeku. But they did not arrive at Irrua until after the immigrants from Ugboka in Benin.</p> <p>UNEAH<br/>Uneah is the name for the people who now settle in Ibore, Atuagbo and Ugbalo villages. The various tradition of their origin claimed that they migrated from Otuo, a town in the present day Owan East Local Government Area.<br/>According to .O. Okosun, Ineah was the teacher of the quarter – in Otuo. Due to the constant maltreatment of the people by the king of Otuo, he gathered his people and left Otuo. At Irrua, the Onojie granted Ineah and his group protection and permission to settle in Akho.8<br/>According to Dr. C.G. Okojie, the migrants were different from that of the people that protected them. For instance, in Irrua when animals like buffalo, wild pig and eagle were killed by hunters, the right leg of the animal must be sent to the Onojie as sacrifice. But if a tiger is killed, the dead animal must be sent to the Onojie. According to Irrua custom, the killer of the tiger after presenting the animal to the Onojie and rewarded,the dead animal is buried as an honour to the king of the animals.<br/>But for fear of offending the Onojie of Irrua, every animal killed by the migrants were presented to the Onojie accompanied with war song and dance.<br/>The Uwagwe – leader of Akho, was surprised at the strange behaviout of the immigrants even the Onojie was not comfortable with the strange behaviour. It was anticipated that one day, one of the Uneah hunter might commit a taboo against Esan custom, and this may lead to unfavourable consequence to the society. Just as it was anticipated the deed was done in the sense that an Uneah hunter killed a tiger sent it to the Onojie after rewarding the hunter. In accordance with the custom, the Onojie ordered the dead tiger to be buried but the people (Uneah) insisted that they should eat the dead animal. The attitude of the people made the Onojie to belief that they could do worse things than that, on this basis, he (Onojie) ordered them to leave Akho which they moved far into the forest.<br/>This was how they moved to their present home which became known as Age-Okhouria. But was later changed to Uneah as a memorial of their founder.</p> <p>UGBOKHARE<br/>The original founders of this village came from Ifeku directly to their present settlement. But after the indigenous Irrua group had already settled at Eguare, the leader of the original founder was said to be great warrior like the founder of Eidenu. He was said to have followed after them but he met the people of Eidenu already settled, so he moved northward and settled in their present village.</p> <p>UJABHOLE<br/>The founders of Ujabhole were immigrants from the Uhe quarters in Benin. They came during the great movement in the 15th century during the reign of Oba Ewuare the great. They first settled near Oghus at Ivue due to constant conflict in Ivue, they migrated to their present settlement.7<br/>The Ujabhole village is the most outlying Irrua district toward Uromi from the direction of Usesa. The Onojie of Irrua land had right from the time of their arrival given the title of Iyasele (commander-in-chief of the warriors) to their leader. He made him oversee all Uwesan villages and the Onojie’s representative in the area. According to tradition as a symbol of testimony to the status of the Ujabhole’s leader, the Onojie gave him a short stem of Ukhimi (new bodia leaves) to plant in his village (Ujabhole) and the Onojie instructed him not to allow it to be uprooted (Ujabhole) hence the name Ujabhole, which has since remain the name of the village.</p> <p>UDOMI<br/>The original founders of this village was said to have migrated directly from Benin during the great migrations of the reign of Oba Ewuare. According to tradition, Oghu was the warrior-leader who left Benin during the reign of Oba Ewuare. Oghu and his group settled in Ivue (the highest point in Esan). When Oba Ewuare sent for the war leaders in 1463, Oghu was among. But he gave execuse for not going due to the problem he had with his foot. He pleaded with his first son, Oghala to go for him to Benin which his son declined and in an alternative, Oghu consulted his younger brother, Ichesan who went for him.<br/>The hatred between the father and son spread to the village. According to C.G. Okojie, Oghala and his supporters were banished from Ivue. Oghala and his followers first settled at Onewa and later at Aho, finally at Udomi. Their present home in Irrua.10<br/>Another version of this tradition of origin has it that it was Oghu who migrated from Ivue and sought for permission to settle on Irrua soil at Udomi, which was as a result of the decision of Ichesan, who on his return from his elder brother’s assignment to Benin kept the Onojie title he brought to himself instead of delivering it to his elder brother, Oghu.</p> <p>EKO-OMOJOUDU (UHE)<br/>The original founders of this village came directly from Uhe in Benin under the leadership of Omojoudu. This was during the period of the great movement from Benin in the reign of Oba Ewuare. A testimony to this account of origin is the fact that this village is popularly called Uhe.</p> <p>IBHIOLULU<br/>The founders of the village came directly from Avbiele in the district of Agbede. According to Pa E. Osagie, the founder of the village were from Benin, who left Benin during the movement in Oba Ewuare’s reign in 1440 – 1473. They first settled at Avbiele along with other immigrant from Benin, but left to their present home Ibhiolulu.</p> <p>IDUMU-OGHODO<br/>The founders of this village are closely related to the founders of Ibhiolulu. They are said to have migrated from Avbiele about the same time as the founders of Ibhiolulu.</p> <p>AFUDA<br/>The original founders of Aguda came directly from Benin during the reign of Oba Ewuare in Benin. But majority of it present inhabitant later migrated from Eguare rrua.</p> <p>IDUMU-OZA<br/>The founders of this village constituted a branch of Ujabhole. The site of this village was the farmland of the settlers of Ujabhole.</p> <p>TRADITIONAL RELIGIOUS BELIEFS<br/>Religion is the belief in the existence of a supreme power, who is belief to be the creator and controller of the universe, who gave to man a spiritual nature, which continues to exist after the physical death of the body.<br/>Esan were polytheist in their religious belief. The polytheism was highly influenced by the nature of the environment. The Esan have gods ike Idigun – god of iron, Unoko – god of the Iroko tree, Osun – god of medicine and goddesses like Obiehmon – goddess of the sea (this was gotten from Benin traditional belief). Nature features like rocks, sea creatures like crocodile inter alia where not worshipped because such features were absent from the Esan environment.<br/>The central religion worship was ancestral worship in Esan land that is the soul of a person is continuous. The death of the physical body does not imply the end of life or existence. Esan believed that after death the person climbs into a more superior realm (the world beyond). In this realm the earthly dead continues to exist in a more superior way. Here (the world beyond) he is able to see and communicate with Osenobua the supreme God. This ability enables him to direct and influence the activities of the people he left behind on earth. It was this Esan belief that influenced their worship of ancestors whom they regarded to as Elimin spirit.<br/>Every family in Esanland had it own ancestral god. In appeasing the gods or ancestors sacrifices of various kinds are made. It was the surviving first son (Omijiogba) in a family that had in his possession of the ancestral god. Any of his uncles, aunts, younger brother and sisters who needed blessing from the ancestors approach him to perform the rites or worship for him or her. Items used for sacrifice include goats, fowls, pounded yam with well prepared soup.<br/>At the appointed day of the worship, all the family members are invited to the ancestral shrine in the Oduwa (main compound where the Omijiogba lives). The Omijiogba slaughters the provided animal and blesses the particular appeaser using the Ukhure make some abstract signs before him or her. He prays for the entire family as well. The food provided was shared by all. At the end of it all, the appeaser goes home with the psychological belief and satisfaction that his or her supplication has been heard and accepted by the ancestors.<br/>In Irrua and also the entire Esanland, religion has utilitarian value in the society. It provided a moral etiquette for the people.</p>\n\nTHE PRE-COLONIAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF ESANLAND (A CASE STUDY OF IRRUA KINGDOM)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PRE-COLONIAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF ESANLAND (A CASE STUDY OF IRRUA KINGDOM)", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT OF ARTIFICIALY  INSEMINATED CHILD TO INHERIT UNDER ISLAMIC LAW</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Islamic law emphasizes the importance of fertility in both partners of a married couple and the ability to bear children, as the foundation of a healthy and successful marriage.</p> <p>The prophet‟s encouragement to prefer to marry a fertile woman (walud), who may not be so pretty, to a beautiful respectful woman who is sterile1 well conveys the message. Not only women are addressed in regard to fertility. In the <em>Hadith</em> we find that a sterile man („aqim) is reproached by the prophet for not informing his wife prior to their marriage that, he was incapable of begetting children. The prophet (S.A.W) instructed the man (<em>akhbirha</em> <em>wakhayyirha</em>).</p> <p><em>“Let her know and consequently let her choose!”</em><em>2</em></p> <p>The woman was legally justified on the basis of this information, to refuse to marry the sterile man. Every woman is entitled to a productive marriage, and the law strongly defends this right.</p> <ul><li>Sunnan-Al-Nisa’I, Cairo 1964,Vol.6,PP.65-66</li> </ul> <ul><li>Musanaf’Abd Al-Razzaq, 1st Lebanon 1972,Vol.6,P.162(Babul-Rajul Al-‘Aqim)</li> </ul> <p>12</p> <p>Although, marriage in Islamic law is not perceived only as a means for reproduction, and although, the sexual relations between husband and wife are not believed to be merely for reproductive purposes, the bearing of mutual, legitimatized children is nevertheless a desired and expected outcome of any <em>shar‟iah</em> marriage. Hence, Islamic law recognizes no other means/ way of obtaining children than by bearing them, especially adoption is completely forbidden in Islamic law. It is not surprising that, infertile Muslim couples have become highly interested in artificial insemination as a means of helping them to produce the desired child.</p> <p>In recent years, artificial insemination has acquired a variety of forms, including test-tube babies and surrogate mothers in various contractual agreements with infertile couples, as well as the simpler methods. All these have provided new hope to childless couples all over the world.</p> <p>It is however, expedient to proffer a definition for artificial insemination. Artificial insemination or A.I is the process by which sperm is placed into the reproductive tract (not through a sexual intercourse) of a female for the purpose of impregnating her through that means, other than N.I, or sexual intercourse3. As earlier revealed that, this medium of giving birth, is used as an assisted reproductive technology, using either sperm from the woman‟s male partner or sperm from a donor (donor sperm) in cases where the male partner produce no sperm or the woman has no</p> <p>3 http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/E:/Books/Artificial Insemination.html;assessed on the 5th December, 2010.</p> <p>13</p> <p>male partner (i.e. single women and lesbians). In cases where donor sperm is used the woman is the gestational and genetic mother of the child produced and the sperm donor is the genetic or biological father of the child.</p> <p>This matter has been highly debated by the lawmakers of the Western world (England, France, Egypt and other countries). The House of Commons (England) has decided that a committee of Legal experts should be formed so that they may study this subject.4</p> <p>The medics of France have made this matter dependent on the agreement of the spouses and permitted this, if both of them agree. In Italy, the Pope has made it prohibited through religious decree.5 The Grand Mufti of Egypt has in his own opinion, viewed artificial insemination to be worse than adoption, which was mentioned, is prohibited in Islam.6</p> <p>In view of the above positions, it will be relevant thus, to juxtapose those positions from the pure Islamic perspective of artificial insemination. Indeed, artificial insemination is one of the new issues on which Muslim scholars have recently done some <em>Ijtihad</em> in the light of some basic</p> <ul><li>Ayatullah Makarim Shiraz &amp; Ayatullah Ja’afar Subhani; <em>“Islamic View on Artificial Insemination”</em>; http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/E:/Books/Artificial Insemination.html;assessed on the 5th December, 2010.</li> </ul> <p>14</p> <p>principles and values of the Qur‟an and <em>Sunnah</em>. Artificial insemination using husband‟s semen, simply because he could not deposit them inside his wife‟s tract is legally recognized under the Islamic law, having it premised on the validity of their marriage. The semen collected from a donor, (AID) is illegal and to some jurist, apposite to committing of <em>zina</em>. To others it is not, but could be seen as grievous sin as <em>zina</em> in which <em>Hadd</em> punishment cannot be meted on the perpetrators but could only be punished under <em>ta‟azeer</em>. With regard to the child born as the result of this, he is to be ascribed to the mother who bore him, and not to the man who donated the sperm, as is the ruling the case of <em>zina</em> and as such, cannot inherit is father, but his mother.</p> <p>It should however, be pointed out at this juncture as observed by a professor of Islamic Jurisprudence, at Al-<em>Azhar</em> university, Cairo7; <em>“Artificial</em> <em>inseminations expected as a matter of</em> <em>necessity be conducted under meticulous as well as safe laboratory conditions. The owners of those labs should be trustworthy people”</em>.</p> <p>While affirming the permissibility of Artificial Insemination in Islam, Islamic <em>Fiqh</em> Council, stressed the necessity of carrying out of the operation when both the husband and wife are alive.</p> <p>. 7 Fattah A., in his commentary on this point July11, 2007, 4: pm; www.google.com</p> <p>15</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY.</p> <p>The issue of artificial insemination came to lime light in the recent years. Though, the first reported human artificial insemination donor was in 1884. This was carried out by Dr. Pancoast8, and his operations were tagged to be a rape. This is because; it was devoid of the woman‟s consent. Islamic law decries or detests artificial insemination by a donor (AID), the effect of which attributed the child bore to his mother. He could, as a matter of law inherits his mother and not the sperm donor. This is simply because there was no valid marriage contract between the duos. Artificial insemination by the husband on the order hand is recognized under the law in as much as, the marriage contract is valid and the operation is carried out during the duo‟s life time. The child born out of this can equitably inherit both parents and the paternity is ascribed to his father. All the jurist are unanimous of this ascribed to this opinion, having relied in an <em>Hadith</em> of the prophet (S.A.W), who said;</p> <p><em>“Marry and procreate that I will be proud with your numbers on the Day of Judgment”</em><em>9</em></p> <p>8http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/E:/Books/Artificial Insemination.html;assessed on the 5th December, 2010.He is a</p> <p>Prof. at Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia.</p> <p>9 Mukhtar, <em>Hadith Al-Nubaurr</em>, Darul Fikr,P.54</p> <p>16</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY.</p> <p>The sole aims and objectives of this study is to examine critically, the opinions of Muslim scholars regarding artificial insemination vis-a-vis the rights of such product (child) born out of that medium to inherit under the precinct laws of Islam.</p> <p>Furthermore, this work is also aimed at enriching the understanding and knowledge of the people about the legality or otherwise of the artificial insemination under Islamic law.</p> <p>Also, to justify the paternity of the child bore as a result of Artificial Insemination by Husband (AIH), and Artificial Insemination by Third Party (AID), this is in view of the prophetic tradition; which reads;</p> <p><em>“The child belongs to the bed and for the adulterer is the stone.”</em><em>10</em></p> <p>Lastly, contribution of a Muslim to knowledge, devoid of worldly gains but what awaits him or her in the hereafter serves as one of my aims and objectives of this study for I believe, it is highly rewarded .</p> <p>10 Khan M.M, <em>The Translation of the meaning of Sahih Al-Bukhari;</em> Madeenah, vol.8; Pg.422; Hadith No.6750.</p> <p>17</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY.</p> <p>This study examines the opinions of Muslim scholars on the legality or otherwise of artificial insemination vis-à-vis inheritance of the product (child) there from. It also considers various forms in which artificial insemination is conducted and the permissible one under Islamic Law.</p> <p>Thus, for the ascertainment of the positions of the law as regards inheritance of a child born out of Artificial Insemination to inherit under Islamic Law, recourse was had to Islamic Law of Inheritance.</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY</p> <p>This work is strictly limited to the indispensable but well-premised opinions of Muslim scholars on Artificial Insemination. However, for research conveniences, the work is restricted to Qur‟an,</p> <p><em>Hadith </em>and any other suitable materials that will suit this work so as to produce qualitative and original researched work.</p> <p>1.5.0: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>Being an essay project, the prominent things of note are set out for discussion in the work according to Islamic tenets.</p> <p>18</p> <p>In view of this, the materials used in this project include; works of prominent writers on the issue of artificial insemination under Islamic law of inheritance whose discussion, cannot be treated without having recourse to the both primary sources of Islamic law, Qur‟an and <em>Hadith</em>. Also taken to cognizance, are the statements of some highly versed person, who are knowledgeable/experts in Islamic Law of Jurisprudence, <em>Usul-al-fiqh.</em></p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>There has been series of work on the subject of Inheritance under Islamic law. In view of the significance of Qur‟an and <em>Hadith</em> regarding the issue of inheritance, the primary legal sources of</p> <p>Islamic law had laid down a very strong foundation of distributing a deceased person‟s property.</p> <p>Therefore, those areas that were not covered by the two earlier- mentioned sources are discretional to those that have attained the stage of Ijtihad, who may use their reasoning having broad knowledge of both the Qur‟an and <em>Hadith</em> in derivation of a rule therefrom.</p> <p>So be it on the issue of Artificial Insemination being a new phenomenon in our society, drawing the attention of various jurists on how true was its validity under Islamic law; and also the rights of the child born-out of that medium to inherit under the law.</p> <p>19</p> <p>As already stated, the scholars are not unanimous over the occurrence of this new medium of procreation mainly because, it was likened to the grievous but punishable offence of zina, which was absolutely prohibited by Allah and His messenger (S.A.W) in both Qur‟an and <em>Hadith</em>. This project is thus aimed at examining the views of scholars on the subject matter, artificial medium of procreation, (A.I).However, in a bid to arriving at the choice of the present study, some investigations were made to survey scholarly works on this topic of discussion of the contemporary jurists in nexus with the provisions of the both the Qur‟an and <em>Hadith</em>.</p> <p>Hence, with regard to the late well-known Grand Imam of Azhar, Sheikh Mahmoud Saltut, who was of the view that Artificial Insemination is despicable crime and a major sin just as <em>zina</em>.11</p> <p>Though, just like other jurist, he did not generalize his view as to the one involving the consent of the legal couples legally married under Islamic law. Amongst the jurists that likened Artificial Insemination by Donors (A.I.D) to <em>zina</em> are; Muhammad Saleh Al-Munajjid, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, Dr. Muzammil Siddiqi and a host of others. The rationale behind the whole rule was to bring a society stepped in immorality to observe the highest standard of morality, for when the interests of human being keep on shifting with a change in the circumstances, the laws also adjust accordingly.</p> <p>11 Shaltut, „Al-Fatawa‟, (ISLAMIC LEGAL DECISIONS); p..300.</p> <p>20</p> <p>1.7.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>Having set forth the above background, we shall in the subsequent chapter discuss in brevity, the Islamic law of Inheritance as elucidated upon by the Glorious Qur‟an, Sunnah of the Holy</p> <p>Prophet Muhammad, (S.A.W) and the various opinions of the Islamic jurists.</p>\n\nCRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT OF ARTIFICIALY  INSEMINATED CHILD TO INHERIT UNDER ISLAMIC LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT OF ARTIFICIALY  INSEMINATED CHILD TO INHERIT UNDER ISLAMIC LAW", "id": 71}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CONFLICT  SITUATIONS AND CHOICE OF LAWS IN THE  NIGERIAN LEGAL SYSTEM AND OTHER LEGAL  SYSTEMS.</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The project looks into the problems which arise when one legal system has to deal with the legal rules of another in matters of private rights. More particularly, because the ultimate test of the recognition of foreign law is what courts do about it. This work is also concerned with how a court, sitting in one country treats a case of private litigation in which the parties, the events or the circumstances demonstrate connections with one or more legal systems foreign to the court. The issue can raise in multifarious ways. An ordinary, apparently purely domestic, case may be found to have a significant connection with a foreign legal system. A case may be so genuinely international that it would be a foreign case in any court.</p> <p>In <em>Tapa v. Kuka</em>1, the deceased, a Nupe man died interstate in Bida, leaving a house in Lagos. The question was whether his domestic law should apply or</p> <p>1(1945) 18 NLR 5.</p> <p>18</p> <p>the law of the place where the property was located, that is, lex situs? The deceased’s personal law was applied which is the Mohammedian law, prevailing among the Nupe people. This shows that the forms of appearance of a foreign element are numerous:</p> <ul><li>The party may be foreign by nationality or may have a foreign domicile,</li> <li>The action may concern property situated abroad,</li> </ul> <ul><li>Or a disposition made abroad of a property situated in Nigeria.</li> </ul> <p>Just as the conflict of law exists because there are differences in systems of municipal law, so there are differences in the approaches that legal systems of Nigeria and other countries take to solving problems in the conflict of laws.</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>The raison d’être of Private International Law, also known as, conflict of law is the existence in the world of a number of separate municipal systems of law–a number of separate legal units- that differ greatly from each other in the rules by which they regulate the various legal relations arising in daily life. The</p> <p>19</p> <p>occasions are frequent when the courts in one country must take account of some rule of law that exists in another.</p> <p>There are several possible responses which a court can make when faced with a case having foreign contacts. Firstly, and most primitively, it can treat the case as a purely domestic one and apply its own law to its resolution regardless of the foreign element.</p> <p>Secondly, a court could take a view that its processes are inappropriate for a case with foreign contacts and refuse to adjudicate upon it. A court would seek to ensure that national courts took jurisdiction only when they were, in their own eyes, the appropriate forum or, at least, not an inappropriate one. The remaining possibility, and the one with which this book is concerned, is that the court recognizes that cases with foreign contacts cannot simply be turned away, and that they are special in the sense that they pose particular problems which demand serious treatment.</p> <p>20</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</p> <p>The overall objective of this study is to examine the differences between the Nigerian domestic law and other legal systems and find solutions to the conflict problems.</p> <p>Specifically, the study aims at achieving the following:</p> <ul><li>To examine and prescribe the conditions under which the court is competent to entertain a claim.</li> </ul> <ul><li>To examine and determine for each class of case the particular municipal system of law by reference to which the rights of the parties must be ascertained.</li> </ul> <ul><li>To examine and specify the circumstances in which (a) a foreign judgment can be recognized as decisive of the question in dispute and</li> </ul> <ul><li>the right vested in the judgment creditor by a foreign judgment can be enforced by an action in Nigeria.</li> </ul> <ul><li>To shed light on the level of experience and the depth of knowledge of Nigeria and some other countries in relation to private international law and how judges apply the principles of private international law.</li> </ul> <p>21</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>The main focus of this study is based on cases where there are conflict between various municipal laws, be it within of outside a sovereign State, which then results to the choosing of a particular system to govern such. Special attention will be given to the Nigerian legal system in comparison and contrast with other legal systems.</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>Private international law is not a separate branch of law in the same sense, as, say, the law of contract or of tort. It is all pervading. ‘It starts up unexpectedly in any court and in the midst of any process. It may be sprung like a mine in a plain common law action. In an administrative proceeding, in equity, or in a divorce case, or a bankruptcy case, in a shipping case or a matter of criminal procedure. The most trivial action of debt, the most complex case of equitable claims may suddenly be interrupted by the appearance of a knot to be untied only by a Private International Law.’2</p> <ul><li>Frederic Harrison, ‘<em>Jurisprudence and the Conflict of Laws’</em> (Macmillan, London 1919) p.101-102.</li> </ul> <p>22</p> <p>Nevertheless, Private International Law is a separate and distinct unit in the Nigerian Legal System just as much as the law of tort or of contract, but it possesses this unity, not because it deals with one particular topic but because it is always concerned with one or more of the three (3) questions, namely:</p> <ol><li>Jurisdiction of the Nigerian court,</li> </ol> <ol><li>The choice of law,</li> </ol> <ol><li>Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.</li> </ol> <p>All branches of private law will be considered, but only in connection with these three matters.</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The method to be adopted for this study will be based on primary and secondary sources (materials.) They include statutes, local and foreign textbooks, law journals, law dictionaries, opinions of legal writers, law reports and reported cases from case books, available literature on internet. Also, the historical, analytical and ethical methods are employed to dive deep into the study and have a good understanding of it.</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>23</p> <p>‘Conflict of law and choice situation under which this topic is based is a wide area of study. Reference will be made to several foreign and Nigerian texts by distinguished authors. Various journals will also be referred to.</p> <p>CHESHIRE AND NORTH’S Private International Law3 states that ‘Private International Law, then, is that part of law which comes into play when the issue before the court affects some fact, event or transaction that is so closely connected with a foreign system of law as to necessitate recourse to that system.’</p> <p>It has, accordingly, been described by THOMAS BATY4 as meaning</p> <p>The rules voluntarily chosen by a given State for the decision of</p> <p>cases which have a foreign complexion.</p> <p>JAMES, L.J.:5</p> <p>Can it be possible that a Dutch father stepping on board a steamer at</p> <p>Rotterdam with His dear and lawful child should on arrival at the</p> <ul><li>(Butterworths, 1992, 12th)</li> </ul> <ul><li><em>Polarized Law,</em>(Stevens &amp; Haynes, London 1914) p.148.</li> </ul> <ul><li><em>Goodman’s Trust </em>(1881) 17 Ch. 266 @ 298.</li> </ul> <p>24</p> <p>port of London find that the child has become a stranger in blood</p> <p>and in law and bastard fillus nullius.</p> <p>OBILADE A.O.6 on his own part believed that there are statutory choices of laws for determining inappropriate cases whether it is a customary law or non-customary law that governs a particular set of circumstances. He also opined that the rule of customary law is an alternative to English law and the customary law to be valid it must have passed the incompatibility test. He appreciated the fact that there is conflict between the English law and the rule of customary law and also that there may be the problem of which choice of customary to apply when two customary laws compete on the same subject matter.</p> <p>According to RAYMOND SMITH, in his book, Conflict of Laws7, he is of the opinion that a case with obvious contacts with one country may happen to be litigated in another because the plaintiff finds some advantage in bringing an action there or the defendant cannot be made subject to the jurisdiction of the</p> <p>6<em>‘The Nigerian Legal System’ ,</em>(Spectrum Books Ltd ,Ibadan 2003).</p> <p>7<em> Cavendish Publishing Limited, </em>1993.</p> <p>25</p> <p>country with which the case is, leally, most closely connected.

Therefore, if a person is subjected to two different laws at the same time, then, the problem is which of the rules will be applicable to the person.</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>Conflict lawyers use some Latin terms which have been adopted or derived from continental writers.</p> <p>Lex causea                                                       The law which the court has determined</p> <p>as the governing law of the issue.</p> <p>Lex domicile                                                   The law of the country where a person is</p> <p>domiciled.</p> <p>Lex fori                                                             The law of the court dealing with the</p> <p>issue.

It is a practice that is widely or relatively embraced by financial institutions as well as the private individuals (group of people). It is a subtle scheme that guarantees convenient home ownership through loan agreement. But in the same vein, it is seen generally beyond this perspective; a financing scheme through which desired property is acquired via the repayment process, especially with the conventional banking system.</p> <p>It should be noted that this financing scheme is conceived in many ways: It differs in operationalization with the conventional banking operator, the legal practitioner and the practitioners of the Islamic economic system cum the</p> <p>(Shari‟ah) regulator. By and large, the converging point with all these practitioners is that Mortgage Financing is a method of acquiring legal or equitable property upon installmental repayment.</p> <p>The Nigerian legal framework has thrived in the construction of provisions that regulate the operation of Conventional Mortgage Financing. This regulatory</p> <p>15</p> <p>framework therefore enables the conventional mortgage financing, which is been executed by many finance institutions: Cooperative Societies; Commercial Banks; Mortgage Banks; Private Home Builders1, etc to secure patronage of customers.</p> <p>The practice of Islamic Mortgage Financing in Nigeria is relatively at its nascent stage but, just like the Islamic Banking operation, it has not secured express approval of the government let alone expresses legal frameworks that will regulate its operation. If at all it has been operating, it is still through an informal process and with an intendment of guiding its operation with the relevant provisions of the <em>Shari’ah</em>. Though, one is yet to come into record, in case of dispute, it should be expected that the jurisdiction will <em>bonafide</em> lie with the <em>Shari’ah</em> Court2. From the foregoing notwithstanding, there are some</p> <ul><li>This refers to those that engage in the building of estates for the members of the public.</li> </ul> <ul><li><em>Shari’ah </em>court has provision under the Nigerian 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, to hear and determine as of right matters relating to Islamic personal law. This</li> </ul> <p><em>Shari’ah</em>2this refers to those that engage in the building of estates for the members of the</p> <p>public.</p> <p>2<em> Shari’ah </em>court has provision under the Nigerian 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria <em>ah</em>-oriented commercial disputed therefore will come under this particular provision.</p> <p>16</p> <p>specific areas of the legal framework dealing with transactions under which Islamic Mortgage Financing can be found fit and operational, within the entire laws guiding legitimate commercial transactions of all sorts. Thus, this research work is to examine by way of a comparative analysis how these two mortgage financing schemes operate under the related legal and regulatory frameworks, with a view to seeing the areas of similarities and disparities of these two financing schemes, within the purview of the laws.</p> <p>This work is therefore divided into five chapters: the first chapter discusses the general background knowledge about what this long essay is addressing, including background of the study, literature review and definitions of terms among others. Chapter two examines the conceptual background of what is understood by Conventional mortgage financing and Islamic mortgage financing. Chapter three probes into the legal and regulatory frameworks guiding the operationalization of the two mortgage financial systems. Chapter four looks into the analysis of the legal frameworks. Conclusion, Summary and recommendation make the concluding chapter of this research work.</p> <ul><li>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>The quest to research into this topic was appropriate by my interest to look into the Islamic Financial System. I have being opportune to have a critical</p> <p>17</p> <p>experience of how Nigerians and most importantly muslims live in their various habitat and likewise attended some few seminars and talk shows even though they are not reported and have concluded to help the <em>Ummah</em> in my little way. However, in proffering a solution to the low standard of living among the Muslims I have also decided to look into the legal means of getting a meaningful life at the same time a life that is not against the doctrines of Islam. Islamic Financing System which I know has helped a lot of Muslims outside Nigeria should also be introduced to bring an end to the low standard of living of most Muslims in this part of the world.</p> <p>Subject to my interest in eradicating the problems of home ownership among the muslims this work was researched into so as to bring to the notice of those in need of home where and how they can go about the funding of their homes and the measures put down by the government to assist home ownership and to realize the dream of everybody to become an owner</p> <ul><li>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>The major purpose of this research work is to do a legal comparism of Islamic and conventional mortgage financing and ways by which the lives of Muslims can be upgraded and how they can be landlords without transgressing the</p> <p>18</p> <p>bounds of Allah. Also, this work intends to bring to the knowledge of muslims the varieties of private and public institutions [Islamic or contemporary] which can profer solutions to the problems facing the <em>Ummah,</em> that is, difficulties in accessing accommodation by the Muslims in Nigeria, which is evident in the light of their conditions of living.</p> <ul><li>FOCUS OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>The focus of this research work is to deal with the problems accruing among Muslims and the legality of the likely solutions resorted to. It is evident all over the country there is a problem of accommodation and it is in fact more rampant among the Muslims this is basically because of the process through which housing loans are gotten, i.e. the calculation of interest. Also to differentiate Islamic Mortgage financing and Conventional Mortgage financing. It is also to reposition the market for the Muslim individuals and Islamic Institutional Enterprises that have the potentials of assisting in achieving the goal of providing homes for the Muslims at affordable prices and/or convenient repayment plans. It is also to add a little new idea to the topic of Islamic Mortgage Financing knowing full well that it is relatively a new area of research. And in similar vein, it is to highlight some of the</p> <p>19</p> <p>challenges of satisfying both religious tenets and governmental rules and regulations.</p> <ul><li>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>This work measures to seeing Muslims live a decent and stress free life with the concept of Home financing within Nigeria and also the entirety of the world because we are each other‟s keeper and usually at rest when our Muslim brothers and sisters are. The major issue is the possibility of a decent practice of a decent Islamic Mortgage Financing System in Nigeria and touching the lives of the target people.</p> <p>The conceptual frameworks of the systems of Mortgage Financial Systems will be examined in this work; this is aimed at so as to examine the modes of operation of the systems. The legal frameworks of the system will be examined to know the extent to which the operation of home financing has been recognized.</p> <ul><li>METHODOLOGY</li> </ul> <p>In carrying out the research, information will be gather from both published and unpublished materials, journals, textbooks, articles, fieldworks and most</p> <p>20</p> <p>importantly the Holy Quran and Hadith. The project by its nature demands a very carefully handled research. This being that many people are just being introduced to this kind of Islamic Financial Institution. People‟s attention had earlier been averted to conventional banking system .That is why some a muslims have found it difficult to hold but to concur with some hired writers by the west that there is no difference between conventional banking system and Islamic banking system. There for the above listed methodologist have being employed and exploited in a bid to present or hit the target of the work.</p> <ul><li>LITERATURE REVIEW</li> </ul> <p>The work of Dr. Abikan A.I. was examined titled Constitutionality Of Islamic Banking published in Contemporary Issues in Islamic Jurisprudence, a book published in honor of Chief Justice Of Nigeria Honorable Justice Idris Legbo Kutigi3, this work was fully relied on for the legality of Islamic Mortgage Financing but the concept of Conventional and Islamic Mortgage Financing Systems were not discussed. This work discussed in details the history of Islamic Banking in Nigeria and the laws in place for the establishment of Islamic Banks.</p> <p>3 Rawel Fortune Resources, Benin. 2009 chapter 7, pages 94-12</p> <p>21</p> <p>The work of Taiqullah Khan titled An Introduction to Islamic Finance is one of the relevant materials used in this research. He limited his discussion to the concept of Islamic Finance. He however did not discuss about the legality of Islamic Mortgage Financing which I intend to concentrate in this research work.</p> <p>I have also relied on the article titled Theory and Practice of Modern Islamic Finance from Dr S.M. Solaiman. The author centered his discussion on the practice of Islamic finance system in Australia without making comparisms between Islamic Mortgage Finance System and Conventional Financing. The two systems will however be compared in this research work. Another material relied upon in the course of this research is that of Sheik Haithman Al-Haddad who in his work titled Islamic Mortgage: Paradigm Shift or Trojan horse? discussed extensively on the doctrines of Islamic Mortgage Financing and the fact that it has been introduced even in places where the practices of Islam has not been accepted and the fact that Islamic Principles and teachings of Islam should not be twisted to fit preconceived solutions. He however made his discussions not to go beyond the peripheral level and he has made we muslims to realize our roles that is protecting the doctrines of Islam from external alterations.</p> <p>22</p> <ul><li>DEFINITION OF TERMS</li> </ul> <ol><li>Mortgage: A mortgage is defined in another way as a mortgage that is not backed by government insurance, by which the borrower transfers a lien /title to the lending bank or other financial institution.

This is followed by the intended area of concentration of the study while the methodology to be employed in the search for facts and figures to give credit of validity to the research work is also revealed.

Issues relating to competence and compellability of child evidence have been accorded much attention by the judiciary in making sure that children in given evidence in court are not misled. The idea of competency and compellability as it relates to the evidence of children allows the court to ensure that a child gives rational answers to questions put to him.</p> <p>At common law, it is not all evidence given in court that may be held admissible. For instance, before a child can give evidence which will be admitted, such child must be a compellable witness. Therefore, a proper attention will be given to the definition of competence and compellability, its nature and principles and the position it occupies in the law of evidence.</p> <p>It is also pertinent to addressing who a child is in law; the conditions which such child must satisfy before he becomes a competent and compellable witness. Importantly to note is the fact that given of evidence by a child may have some negative effect, and it has been advocated that there should be a systematic way of receiving a child’s evidence with proper consideration of the situation of the child and determination of whether the child is induced by a third party</p> <p>Also, attention will be paid to the effect of giving evidence in court and why most children may feel reluctant to give evidence in court as well as the issues of risk of hysterical intention, childish imagination and collisions which may be inherent in the evidence of a child in Nigerian courts.</p> <p><strong>1.1</strong> <strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This long essay focuses on competence and compellability of a child to give evidence before Nigerian courts. The meaning, general principles, importance, provisions of the evidence Act would be examined. The essay would also explain a child in law, the testimony of such a child in civil and criminal proceedings as well as the conditions for the admissibility of such evidence. More importantly, the essay examines then effects and defects of wrongfully admitting evidence by a child in court.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong> <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this study are:</p> <ol><li>To bring the fore and to explain the procedure and practices of Nigerian courts in relation to the admissibility of child evidence.</li> </ol> <p>b .To notify the masses of the importance and nature of competence and compellability as in relation to child.</p> <ol><li>To analyze the role and what should be the role of courts in ensuring that the evidence of a child is credible enough to be admitted and the conditions thereof.</li> <li>To explain as lucidly as possible the application of the Act in relation to the admissibility of child evidence</li> <li>To recommend possible solutions to the problems attached to the receiving of child evidence.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3     FOCUS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This long essay explains competency and compellability as regards child evidence as regards child evidence and examines the conditions which a child must satisfy before he or she becomes a competent and or compellable witness in courts of law. This essay focuses mainly on the relevant approaches of the courts as it relates to the competency and compellability of a child and the methods to be adopted.</p> <p><strong>1.4    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/></strong></p> <p>The scope of this essay is limited to the ambit of its title. Chapter one is on the general introduction which includes background of the study, objectives of the study, focus of study, scope of study, research methodology adopted, and review of related literatures as well as definition of terms having peculiar meaning. Chapter two deals with definitions and principles relating to competence and compellability; the provisions of the Evidence Act and the exceptions to the general rule.</p> <p>Chapter three explains the evidence of a child, who a child is in law and the conditions for the admissibility of his evidence. Chapter four deals with the implication of uncorroborated evidence of a child, effects of wrongful admission or rejection of a child evidence, the importance of competence and compellability and the negative effects of our court process on the child witness while chapter five concludes the work and gives recommendations to strengthen competency and compellability of child evidence before the Nigerian courts.</p> <p><strong>1.5     METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY<br/></strong></p> <p>The methodology adopted by the researcher to aid him actualize the study consist partly of both primary and secondary sources of law. The primary sources include basically the Evidence Act Children and Young Persons Act and case laws. The secondary sources include textbooks; both foreign and local textbooks, journal, articles and lecture notes on evidence.</p> <p><strong>1.6     LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>The fact that this area of law is not novel cannot be denied as there are sufficiently available texts, journals and learned articles in which opinions have been expressed on almost every aspect of the law in this area in Nigeria. It is not however being suggested that this long essay would be copying the works of others in to this essay, but to find a strong foundation for the present presentations and to examine earlier options. After all, precedents thrive well in law. As a result of this, the Evidence Act the Criminal Procedure Act the Children and Young Persons Act whose provisions will be useful in defining who a child is, is worthy of reference. Other materials to be appraised include the works on law of  Evidence of learned authors like Aguda on Law and Practice relating  to Evidence in Nigeria, Nwadialo Fedelis on Modern Nigerian Law of Evidence, Afe Babalola on Law and practice of Evidence in Nigeria, Christopher Allens on Practical Guide to Evidence, Oji’s  Competence  of Children as witnesses would be a matter of close scrutiny. It is important to add that because of constraint of time and space, not all the various materials source employed in this work are fully reviewed except those that are of direct importance to the subject matter of this work.</p> <p><strong>1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>The following are the terms that will be used in this research work:</p> <p><strong>Competence-             </strong>  The ability to do something well</p> <p><strong>Compellability-</strong>             The ability to use coercion on an individual to do that</p> <p>which he ought to do or something that is necessary for him</p> <p><strong>Child-                           </strong>A person under the age of fourteen</p> <p><strong>Evidence-                      </strong>The facts, signs or objects that make you believe that</p> <p>something is true</p> <p><strong>Witness-            </strong>Person who sees something happen and is able to</p> <p>describe it to other people</p> <p><strong>1.8 CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p>In conclusion, there is a presumption that everybody has the capacity or incompetent to give evidence in court. This presumption is rebuttable where a person is prevented from understanding questions put to him or giving rational answers to those questions by reason of tender age or disease of the body or mind. If a judge is in the opinion that a child is capable of understanding the nature of an oath and the duty of speaking the truth, he must warn himself so as not to judge based on the uncorroborated evidence of an incompetent child.</p>\n\nADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE IN NIGERIAN LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE IN NIGERIAN LAW", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS AS ITS APPLIES IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA 1999</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The concentration of powers in one arm of government may lead to dictatorship and arbitrary rule, therefore there is need to avoid the concentration of power in one arm, of government and each arm of government should be independent of another so that the act of one arm of government should not be control by another. It means a government that make laws enforce such laws and adjudicate over breaches of such laws to suit its own purpose either politically, economically or socially to the detriment of others. The concept of separation of powers therefore arose from the need to ensure and restrain power of government without carrying the divisions to an extreme incompatible to effective government, the three (3) arms of government viz, legislature, executive and the judiciary must have distinct function and must be independent of one another.</p> <p>In this regards while the legislature make the laws, the executive is charges with the implementation of law, while the judiciary is for the interpretation of the laws and its adjudication. The main notion of this is to avoid tyranny, anarchy, dictatorship and so on, this result from one person or group of persons handling powers.1</p> <p>Notwithstanding, in the majority of the modern systems of government, the powers of the government can be divided into three different arms, usually referred to as organs of government. However, the doctrine of separation of powers applies in the presidential system of government.</p><p>  1Johnson Ugoji Anyacle, Comprehensive Government for Senior Secondary School (Lagos: Johnson Publishers Ltd, 1991) page 69..  </p> <p>A presidential system of government is a government where all executive powers are vested in a president who is the head of state and of government. The president may exercise the executive powers of government either directly by himself or through the vice-president, ministers or other offices in the public services of the country. the powers of the president is to maintain the constitution and to apply all the laws made by parliament for the time being in force and to implement party programmes and generally uphold the interest of the nation and the welfare of the people at all time.</p> <p>However, although some political scientists, such as <strong>Locke, Rousseay, Jefferson, Bodin and the authors of federalist papers</strong> in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had the</p> <p>conception of the doctrine of separation of powers in their various writings, but the theory of separation of powers was only clearly formulated for the first time by a French political thinker and <strong>Jurist Baron de Monetesquieu</strong> in his book entitled “ESPIRIST DES LOIS”.2</p><p>  2 John Locke, second treatise on civil government chapter 12-20.  </p> <p>Meaning, the spirit of the laws-published in 1748. In his book, Montesquien divided the governmental powers into three separate and coordinate branches-the legislative, executive and the judiciary. He then argued that, if right, liberty of every citizen is to be fully guaranteed each function must be exercised by a separate and independent organ of government; i.e. an organ must be charged only with the legislative function, another with the executive function and another with the judiciasry.</p> <p>Notwithstanding, the doctrine of separation of powers called for the need of checks and balances which help in fighting against tyranny, dictatorship, anarchy and naked use of powers by different organs of government. Under the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria 1999, section 4,5,6, provided for the effective division of the three powers or branches of government.3 </p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>All over the years, various association, people states or countries have a separate law, or body of rules, which regulate such unit of people, the internal structure of the country, the powers and functions of government and the right and duties of the people.</p><p>    </p> <p>3 SS 4,5,6 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999.</p><p> </p> <p>However, the idea of separation of powers is put up in other to separate the three organs of government and for it to work effectively without one interfering with the work of one another.</p> <p>Notwithstanding, in some circumstance, the three organ of government has been interfering with the work of another. In the parliamentary system of government, all the executive powers of government are in a prime minister who is the majority party or ruling party, but is not the head of state. In this system, the head of state who exercises only ceremonial function may be a monarch, or president, who is the figure head, symbol of the state and the father or mother of a nation as the case may be. The prime minister is a prime inter pares<strong>, </strong>that is, a first among equal. In this sense, there is no complete separation of powers.</p> <p>Moreover, though the doctrine of checks and balances make it easy for each organs to checks on the activities of one another.</p> <p>But there is fusion among the three arms of government because the executive do interfere with the work of the judiciary, legislative with the work of the executive and judiciary with the work of legislative.</p> <p>So if there is a clear separation of powers among the organs of government, rights, liberty and freedom of a citizen will be maintained and guaranteed. In this, section 4,5,6 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 make it clear for the three arms of government to operate without interfering with one another.4 This include: legislature-law making.</p> <p>Executive – Implementation of law and</p> <p>Judiciary- Interpretation of law and it all jurisdiction.</p> <p><strong>1.3   THE RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The following research question was formulated to guide the study.

No arms of government are to be allowed to be so powerful as to subjugate the other arms of government and the organs are not all that equal.</p> <p>Lastly, do you know that, despite the doctrine of separation of powers and its wild provision in the constitution, there is still dictatorship, tyranny and arbitrary of powers among the organs of government that is the legislature interfering with the work of the executive, executive interfering with the work of the judiciary and so on.</p> <p><strong>1.4   JUSTIFICATION FOR THE STUDY</strong></p><p>  5 SS. 4, 5, 6 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999.  </p> <p>The study is expected to be adequately immensely benefited to many people in Nigeria. The justification of the study of this research work is to bring a total separation of powers in Nigeria  as applies in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 19995.</p> <p>            However, the word dictatorship, tyranny, arbitrary of powers and naked use of power by different organs of government should be abolished in the Nigeria society, if rights, liberty, freedom of a citizen is to be maintained and guaranteed to the bearest minimum.</p> <p>Notwithstanding, maintaining the liberty of the citizen is the primary and real reason for separation of powers in government. This is the most favourable views in most common law countries an in other countries of the world, as the greatest reason for the doctrine of separation of powers. This was formulated as a check against tyranny. The organs of government are to be co-equal.  No arm of government is to be allowed to be so powerful as to subjugate the other arms of government and the people. Moreover, the organs of government should learn to implement the doctrine of separation of powers, because it is a general safeguard against oppression and their social and political evils, such as legislative exercise of judicial function or more simply, legislative judgment and so.6</p> <p>            Finally, future researchers will make use of this study as a reference material in related to research work.</p> <p><strong>1.5   LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>In review of this literature we shall consider the following:</p> <p><strong>The British Philosopher John Locke </strong>(1632-1704) who observed the conditions of 17th century  England.

He was concerned with preservation of the</p><p>  7  John Locke, second Treatise on Civil Government, Chapter 12-15.  </p> <p>political liberty of a citizen. According to <strong>Montesquieu:</strong> “political liberty to be found only when there is no abuse of power. Experience show that every man invested with power will abuse it by carring as far as it will go. To prevent this abuse, it is neccesssary from the nature of things that one power should be a check on another.

Rather, the statute introducing such English Laws expressly made provision to the effect that British established courts in Nigeria should observe and enforce the observance of the Customary Law of the people.</p> <p>However, it is instructive to say that <strong>Ordinance 4 of 1876</strong> provided for the preservation of such customary laws in clear and unambiguous terms. <strong>Section 18 of Ordinance 4 of 1876 </strong> enjoined the British established courts in the colony to enforce the observance of the customary laws of the people of the colony.</p> <p>Subsequent local legislations over the years have since continued to retain these legislation. In essence, every High Court in each of the  twenty one jurisdictions in the country is enjoined to observe and enforce the customary law of the people in its area of jurisdiction.</p> <p>In the light of the above there are however, three pre-requisites to be fulfilled before the court can observe and enforce any customary law and these are:</p> <ol><li>The customary law must not be repugnant to natural justice equity and good conceive</li> <li>That such customary law must not be incompatible either directly or by implication with any law for the time being in force or</li> </ol> <ul><li>Contrary to public policy.</li> </ul> <p>The pre-occupation of the research is protruding of this research is protruding insight into the meaning of the doctrine and its applicability in Nigeria. Of note is its applicability and relevance on our socio-cultural environment.</p> <p>The trend of discussions in this work is to acquire into the origin of doctrinal, the purpose and limit of law, nature and classification of customary laws and the basic statutory provisions such as <strong>Section 14(3) of the Evidence Act </strong>and<strong> Section 20 of the High Court Law of Akwa Ibom State </strong>1 which contains the repugnancy and public policy test. Finally we will carefully examine the judicial approach and the implication of this approach to our legal and socio-political setting.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p><p> DEFINITION OF TERMS </p> <ul><li><strong>REPUGNANCY DOCTRINE</strong></li> </ul> <p>The doctrine of repugnancy owes its origin to the medieval period and evolution of English Equity. The doctrine was introduced into Nigeria by the end of the 19th century by <strong>Ordinance 3 of 1863 </strong>which received English Law into our legal system. The essence was to test our customary law for acceptability.</p> <p>The issue has been whether the application of the doctrine by Nigerian courts has an English colouring as a result of colourisation. That equity did not be over-emphasized as it is taken to be a universal concept of what is ‘good’, just and fair; which of course is consistent with <strong>Section 36(1) of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria. </strong> The problem of our customary law is that it is undated with multiplicity of customs complicated by superstitions. It is difficult to take judicial notice of it without conditionality.</p> <p>The Repugnancy Doctrine, therefore is that the rule of customary law which is sought to be enforced must not be repugnant to natural justice equity and good conscience. The repugnancy clause is found in both the early and modem statutes dealing with the administration of justice in Nigeria. <strong>Section 19 of the Supreme Court Ordinance 1914</strong>3 is one of the earliest provisions on  the  repugnancy test and states as follows:</p> <p>“Nothing is this Ordinance shall deprive the Supreme Court the right to observe and enforce the observance or shall deprive any person of the benefit of any law or custom existing in the jurisdiction, such law and custom not being repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience and in case where no express rule is applicable to any matter in controversy the court shall be governed by the principles of justice, equity and good conscience”. Although the above Ordinance have been repealed, subsequent enactments have continued to adopt the wordings of its repugnancy clause with slight modifications. Accordingly, the repugnancy clause is found in the High Court Laws of various states of the Federation. <strong>Section 20 of the High Court Laws  of Akwa Ibom State</strong>4 provides as follows: “the court shall observe and enforce the observance of every local custom and shall not deprive any person of the benefit thereof except when any such custom is repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience..”</p> <p>Thus, rules of customary law must pass the repugnancy test before they are enforced by the court.</p> <ul><li><strong>NATURAL JUSTICE, EQUITY AND GOOD CONSCIENCE</strong></li> </ul> <p>The term natural justice, equity and good conscience has always been or sure in the throat as it has been difficult to concede that an accurate meaning of the phrase, natural justice, equity and good conscience cannot be given. Speed Ag. C. J. in the case of <strong>Lewis V Baukole</strong>5 stated that “As to the second essential, I am not sure that I know what the term “natural justice and good conscience” mean. They are high sounding phrases and it would of course not be difficult to hold that many ancient customs of the barbaric times are repugnant thereto, but it would not be easy to offer a struck and accurate definition of the term”.</p> <p>In the more recent case of <strong>Mojekwu V Ejikeme,</strong>6 the Court of Appeal attempted an explanation out still acknowledged the difficulty in giving a precise legal definition to the words natural justice”.</p> <p>The expression “natural justice” generally means justice according to or pertaining to nature and therefore inborn. It is not the work of man and therefore cannot normally be interfered with by man. Although the expression is fluid vague and mostly incapable of a precise meaning, the above law creates a situation where the High Courts of Akwa Ibom State are statutory enjoined not to observe and observe and enforce customary law which is inconsistent with natural justice.</p><p> CUSTOMARY LAW </p> <p>It was Aristole who proclaimed and aptly to that “man is the best of animals when he is moderated by law, but the worst of the beast when he lives without law and justice”. If this statement is true, as indeed it is, then the indispensability of law comes to the fore.</p> <p>The next question is what would the society be without the law. T he above paradigm seeks to reiterate the duty of which any society in need of decorum and justice, has in developing customs and laws that becomes the mirror of the society</p> <p>The expression customary law has many defunction as there are lawyers. These defunctions are derived from statutes, case laws, as well as text writers. The Evidence Act cap 62, defines a custom, “as a rule which, in a particular district, has from long usage obtain the force of law”7 The Eastern Region Law No. 21 of 1956 defines customary law as a “rule or body of rules regulating rights and imposing duties, being a rule or body of rules which obtains and it is fortified by established usage and which are appropriate and applicable to any particular causes, action, suit, matter, dispute, issue or question”.8</p> <p>Also, <strong>Ghana Interpretation Act 1860</strong> defines it to “consist of rules of law which by custom are applicable to particular communities in Ghana, not being rules included in the common law under any enactment providing for assimilation of such rules of customary law as are suitable for general application”.9</p> <p>Again from the jurisprudence of courts, customary law has been variously interpreted.</p> <p>In <strong>Oyewumi V. Ogubunesan</strong>10 customary law as “the organic or living law of the indigenous people in Nigeria which regulates then rights and transactions”. Furthermore, in <strong>Agu V Ikewibe”</strong> customary court can be seen as “those rules of conduct which persons living in a particular geographical region recognizes as binding in then relationship with one another and amongst themselves”.  The decision of the court in <strong>KHARIE ZAIDEN V FATIMA KHALIL MOBSSEN</strong>12 add credence as to what customary law is all about. And in this wise, the court defined customary court as “the system of law, not being the common law, and not being a law enacted by any competent legislative in Nigeria, but which is enforceable and binding in Nigeria as between the parties subject to the way it sways”.</p> <p>To complement these definitions given by statutes and case laws, text writers have also advance then own definction of what customary law is all about. <strong>P. C. Lloyd </strong>defines customary law as; “the ancient law, the law which has always been observed. Its supposed antiquity”.13 In his book, the Nigerian legal system, A. O. Obilade 14 defines customary law as “customs accepted by members of a community as binding among them” “the law of a given community” according to Dr. Yaslim O. Ekas15 “is the body of rules which are recognized as obligatory by its members”. This recognition must be in accordance to then social imperative because, operating in every commonly is a dynamic of social conduction, an accepted norm of behaviour which the vast majority  of its members regard absolutely necessary for the common will. This determinant of the ethics of the community is it social imperative.</p> <p>A perusal of all these definitions will reveal that emphasis has always been or acceptance, usage, flexibility as well as sanction. In Nigeria, it should be appreciated that the use of a single term customary law does not indicate that there is a single uniform set of custom prevailing in the country. It is used rather as a blanket description covering many different customs. It include not only tribal or ethnic laws but also Islamic laws. In <strong>Section 2 of the Native Courts Laws of Northern Nigeria16</strong> it was explicitly provided that “native law and customs include Muslim law”. Thus for practical purpose Muslim laws and various ethnic or tribal laws are treated alike.</p>\n\nREPUGNANCY DOCTRINE: AN ATTEMPT TO DESTROT OR PRESERVE CUSTOMARY LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " REPUGNANCY DOCTRINE: AN ATTEMPT TO DESTROT OR PRESERVE CUSTOMARY LAW", "id": 76}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><em>UTILITY OF CONFESSIONAL STATEMENT IN CRIMINAL TRIALS</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>An adverse admission relevant to the issues of guilt in a criminal case is known at Common Law as confession, and the same terminology is employed by the Evidence Act 1990. As indicated above, confessions represent the most important and most frequently encountered exception to the rule against hearsay in criminal cases, fundamental changes in the law pertaining to confessions were introduced by the Evidence Act 1990, but in order to understand the principles of admissibility of confessions, it is necessary to understand the principles of admissibility developed at common law to govern the admissibility of confessions. Apparently, we will summarize the most important aspects of the common law rules, we will then proceed to examine the new statutory definition and rules of admissibility of confessions.</p> <p>While the common law recognized that a confession might be both reliable and cogent as evidence of guilt, and indeed saw no objection to a conviction in cases where a confession was the only evidence against the accused, the law recognized that a confession could be regarded as reliable only when given freely and voluntarily. If coerced on forced, reliability of the confession might be totally compromised and the integrity of the system of administration of justice itself made to suffer. The exclusion of evidence obtained through torture, force or other coercive methods was the means of protection of the accused developed by the judges during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when the memory of an age when such methods were commonplace still lingered. Its significance may be gauged by the fact that in English law, the rule that a confession obtained by oppression, in circumstances likely to render it unreliable must be excluded, is the only instance of the mandatory exclusion of illegality or unfairly obtained evidence. The classic statement of the common law rule as to admissibility of confession was that of Lord Sumner in <strong>Ibrahim .V. </strong><strong>R1</strong></p> <p>“It has been established that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shown by the persecution to have been voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear, or prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority”.</p> <p>In common parlance, ‘voluntary’ meant simply of one’s free will’. That test of voluntariness, as defined by Lord Sumner was supplemented by Lord Parker C.J in <strong>Callis .V. Gunn2</strong><strong>, </strong>when he</p> <p>  1.     (1914) A C 559, 609 </p> <p>2.     (1964) IQB 495,501</p> <p> </p> <p>added the requirement that a confession must not have been</p> <p>obtained in ‘an oppressive manner’, his observation was, strictly speaking, obiter – the case involved the admissibility of fingerprint evidence. But when the Judges’ Rules appeared in revised form in 1964, the introduction started that the rules did not affect the principle, which was overriding and applicable in all cases that:</p> <p>… It is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in evidence against any person equally of any oral answer given by that person to a question put by a police officer and of any statement made by that person, that it shall have been voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, exercise or held out by a person in authority.</p><p>  3.     (1975) I. W. L. R. 716,721-2 </p> <p> </p> <p>Interestingly, Lord Sumner’s phrases fear of prejudice’ and ‘hope of advantage’ are habitually spoken of as ‘threats and ‘inducements’ respectively. It give rise to some problems in the application of the rules of admissibility at common law. In particular, the suggestion of some deliberate act in the words ‘threats’ and ‘inducements’ for a time led the courts to concentrate on the mind of the questioner, rather than on the mind of the suspect. As the problem may recur, despite the apparently clear wording – of the 1990 act, it is worth pursuing briefly. In <strong>R .V. Iseguilla3</strong><strong>, </strong>the court of Appeal concluded that:</p> <p>“… Under the existing law the exclusion of a confession as a matter of law because it is not voluntary is always related to some conduct on the part of authority, which is improper or unjustified. Included in the phrase ‘improper or unjustified’ of course must be the offering of an inducement, because it is improper in this context for those in authority to try to induce a suspect to make a confession”.</p> <p>This view of the law would have left the accused without recourse in a case where without any improper intent and perhaps even without realizing it, the questioner created some fear of prejudice or hope of advantage in the mind of the suspect.’ In such a case, the resulting confession might well be involuntary, but under the <strong>Isequilla </strong>rule, would nonetheless be admissible. In <strong>D.P.P .V. Ping </strong><strong>Lin4</strong>, the House of Lords was called upon to decide whether it was the state of mind of the questioner or that of the suspect which was to control the question of voluntariness. The House firmly held that it was the latter that governed the question of whether or not the confession was voluntary, and that should therefore also control the question of admissibility.</p> <p>Indeed, the rules of admissibility applied only where the fear of</p> <p>  4.     (1976) A. C, 574 </p> <p> </p> <p>prejudice or hope of advantage was excited or held out, or the oppression created by a ‘person in authority’, The question of what persons were or were not persons in authority, has, however, settled that a person in authority must have, or reasonably be thought by the suspect to have, some influence over his arrest, detention or persecution, or in other words, be of a person from who a threat or inducement might appear credible. The limitation of the rule in this way was not of great importance, since the vast majority of confessions are made to police officers and others who are undoubtedly persons in authority, and it has been abolished expressly by the Evidence Act 1990. But it remains germane to consider it in the light of the common law rule that the fear of prejudice or hope of advantage must have been generated by the person in authority, with the consequence that self-generated fears and hopes would not destroy the voluntariness of the confessions. However, the result is different under the new statutory rules, even though the confession is made to a person who previously have been a person in authority.</p> <p>In addition to the rules governing admissibility, the trial Judge had power to exclude a confession, in the exercise of his discretion, where it had been obtained by means of or following a breach of the</p> <p>Judges’ Rules. The Judges’ Rules were rules of conduct and procedure for the guidance of police officers and others concerned in the arrest, detention and interrogation of suspects. They were fist promulgated by the judges of the then king’s Bench Division in 1912, and subsequently revised from time to time. The Rules were not rules of law, and did not affect the legal principles of admissibility of confession. However, in <strong>R. V. May6</strong><strong>, </strong>Lord Goddard C.J held that the trial judge might refuse to admit a statement if a breach of the rules occurred. But the main importance of the rules always lay in the fact that a breach of the rules might provide evidence that the resulting confession was not voluntary.</p> <p><strong>1.2 DEFINITION OF CONFESSION</strong></p> <p>At common law, a confession was the name given to an adv-erse admission by the accused relevant to the issue of guilt in a criminal case. In Nigeria, as the case in point, confessions are covered by section 27 to 32 of the Evidence Act 1990. The word “confession” is derived from the Latin word ‘confessus’ which mean to speak or confess completely? <strong>7</strong>.</p> <p>Under the Evidence Act8, confession is defined thus:</p> <p>“A confession is an admission made at any time by a person</p> <p>      5.     R. v. Rennie (1982)I. W. C. R.64 </p> <p>6.     (1952) 36Cr. App R. 91,93</p> <p> </p> <p>charge with a crime, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that crime.</p> <p>A confession, like any other admission, may be made orally, in writing, by conduct or in any way from which a proper inference may be drawn adverse to the maker. Usually confessions are made to police officer or other investigators as a result of interrogation, but may equally be made to the victim of an offence, a friend or relative or any other person.</p> <p>The law regarding confessions is now the same in all cases, and it no longer matters whether the person to whom the confession is made is a person in authority.</p> <p>Importantly, although in common law parlance, the word ‘confession’ connotes a full admission of guilt, it has no such meaning in law, either at common law or under the statutory definition. As long as any part of a statement is adverse to the maker, in that it has some relevance to the issue of guilt, it will be deemed a confession for the purpose of the law of evidence.</p> <p>More still, going by the definition given by the Evidence Act, it is clear that admission of such guilt can be made “at anytime’ is so far it was made after the commission of an offence. Such a confessional</p> <p>  7.     The lawyer’s biggest journal of Bendel State University law student Association 1989. Pg.8 </p> <p>8.     Section 27(1) Evidence Act cap112 laws of the federation, 1990</p> <p> </p> <p>statement can even be made before the accused is charged. The case of <strong>Sunday Onungwa </strong><strong>.V. The state9</strong> is very illustrative in this respect. In that case, the appellant was convicted of murder. It appeared from evidence which the trial judge accepted that, during the investigations (by the police) preliminary to him being charged with the offence, the appellant admitted to ownership of a blood stained matchet recovered near the scene of the murder admitting at the same time that he had killed the deceased “as a result of the work of the devil”. The admissions was made in the presence of other members of his family amongst them was his elder brother who also testified confirming the admission made by the appellant. It was argued at the lower court that these admissions being “extra judicial” should have been rejected and that when the admissions were made it was not then decided the appellant should be charged with any offence and that no caution was administered to the appellant before they were made. Overruling these submissions, the Supreme Court held: ‘that an admission made at anytime by a person charged with crime suggesting the influence that he committed the offence is a relevant fact against the maker and if it is made voluntarily it is admissible in evidence.</p> <p>       7.    (1976)2 Scpg. 169 R.V. Udo Eka Ebong (1997)12 WACA  </p> <p>Also, in <strong>Gbadamosi .V. State10</strong><strong>, </strong>confessions was defined thus:</p> <p>“Legally, the word ‘confession’ means an admission of an offence by an accused person it means an acknowledgement of crime by an accused person. It is an admission made at anytime by a person charged with crime stating or suggesting the inference that he committed the crime”.</p> <p>For a confessional statement to be admitted in evidence, it must be freely and voluntarily made.

Though “ownership” normally are vested on shareholders (it is not the objective of this project to discuss extensively on shareholding) for they bear the ultimate risk in the event of any mishap to the company. It is an established fact that directors stand in a fiduciary relationship to the company and also owe duty of care and skill.</p> <p>Generally directors owe certain obligations to the companies in the performance of their functions. It must be noted that the Act also provides for circumstances upon which a director could be removed. The responsibility of enforcing the duties of directors lies with the company, technically speaking therefore, it is the responsibility of the directors to enforce this duties. It is pertinent to note that the rule in Foss V Harbottle has been whittled down by certain exceptions, which are also statutorily provided. This project also highlights the liability of directors and when a shareholder could institute derivative action for and on behalf of the company.</p> <p>Finally, I shall proffer suggestions on the ways of improving corporate management through directors and where necessary, suggest for the amendment of certain provisions in the Act which does not reflect contemporary corporate management in Nigeria and the need for our courts to live up to their constitutional responsibilities in the interpretation of statutes as it affects company directors.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>MEANING, APPOINTMENT AND QUALIFICATIONS OF DIRECTORS</p> <p>1.1   <strong>WHO IS A DIRECTOR?</strong></p> <p>A director is a person duly appointed by the company to direct and manage the business of the company.1 This definition goes a step further than the 1968 Act2 by adding due appointment as a condition precedent. Section 244 (2) provides a rebuttable presumption that all persons described by a company as directors, whether as executive or otherwise, have been duly appointed. This safeguards third parties dealing with the company. In Aberdeen Railway Co. V. Blaikie Bros3, Lord. Cransworth defined directors to be somebody to whom is delegated the duty of managing the general affairs of</p><p>      1.    Sec 244(1) of the Companies and Allied Matters Act CAP C20 LFN 2004– the term “director” of a company would be defined “as a person appointed or elected according to Law, authorized to manage or direct the affairs of a company or Corporation” Sofowara, Mordern Nigerian Company Law”, second edition, 2006, p.425 </p> <p>2.    Formally Companies Decree No. 51 of 1968 at p</p> <p>3.    (1859) 3 &amp; 4 Macq 461 at p. 471</p> <p> </p> <p>the company. Section 245 (1) of the Act4 defines a shadow director as “any person on whose instructions and directions the directors are accustomed to act”. A shadow director is also deemed to be a director. Although this definition is not explicit, it is deemed to take care of the practice where recognized groups or corporations nominate directors on another company’s board to represent and protect their interests. This is usual with some banking institutions, which lend huge amounts of money to companies. Another good example of shadow director is where a government nominates some directors to represent its interest in a company where the government has substantial or controlling shares, for instance, the Nkalagu Cement Company Ltd has in its board some directors nominated by the government of Enugu, Anambra, Imo and Abia States. These four state governments could be described as shadow directors in relation to the Nkalagu Cement Company Ltd, because their nominee ‘directors’ are</p><p>      4. Decree No.1 of 1990 later designated as “Act”  </p> <p>accustomed to act on their instructions. It should be noted that the above mentioned situation is a deviation and an exception to the rule that directors must only be appointed by shareholders at a general meeting of the company as provided by Section 248 of the Company and Allied Matters Act, CAP C20 LFN 2004.</p> <p>However, it is pertinent to mention that persons who give advice to directors in their professional capacities are not included in the concept of shadow directors.</p>\n\nDUTIES AND POSITION OF COMPANY DIRECTORS UNDER NIGERIAN COMPANY LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DUTIES AND POSITION OF COMPANY DIRECTORS UNDER NIGERIAN COMPANY LAW", "id": 78}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>HUMAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL SECURITY:  A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE NIGERIAN PERSPECTIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>It is widely and almost universally acceptable that the significance of Human Rights in any democratic society has been given wide recognition. While some societies find consolation in entrenching fundamental human rights in their constitutions, as a means of guaranteeing the enforcement of these rights other societies prefer to adopt other means all aimed at guaranteeing the rights. Whatever method of guarantee adopted it must be observed that the enforcement of these rights deepens more on the government in power than on the critical entrenchment of these rights in constitutional documents. This is so because any government determined   to abandon the democratic course will find ways of violating the rights. It is therefore my intention in choosing this topic to highlight and critically appraise those instances, where the government has found ways of violating human rights by justifying their actions on grounds of National security, National interest, Public interest, Public policy and so on. National Security itself, as an instrument limiting Human Rights, has a legal validity and is desirable if properly and genuinely exercised because it helps to check the excesses of Human Rights and ensure that the society as a whole is in peace and  order. But the annoying situation is where the governments of (National Security, National interest) to perpetrate injustice. An example of such situation was buttressed in the case of AGBAJE V C. O. P. (1969) NMLR 176, where the court held that Agbaje was unlawfully detained by the police complying wife an order made by the Inspector General of police acting under powers conferred on him by the Armed Forces and police (special powers) Act 1967.        Finally; the topic in discourse is based on incisive jurisprudential evaluation of the extent to which the government enforce human rights visa-viz the nations security. And it contains in improving our study and knowledge in that aspect of our law.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF STATUTES</strong></p> <p>The African Charter on Human and People’s Rights Cap 10 LEN1990.</p> <p>The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999.</p> <p>The Land Use Act 1978, Cap 202 Laws the Federation of Nigeria. 1990.</p> <p>The Magna Carta of 1215.</p> <p>The United Nations Declaration on Human Rights 1948.</p> <p> SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY </p> <ol><li>AGUDA, T.

While the exact scope of human rights may be in dispute, the researcher has no doubt that any discussion which has the possibility of enhancing the quality of man’s existence on earth must be related to the rights of man.</p> <p>It could be correctly asserted that there has been concern for human rights since antiquity through the various stages of socio-economic formations upto the modern era. In the study of human rights, one encounters relevant legal acts, constitutions, statutes and international instruments, various terms and notions other than human rights. These include fundamental rights fundamental freedoms, civil liberties and civil rights, individual and collective human rights as well as peoples rights1. It is also relevant to mention that the activities of man’s right from birth to his death are directed by an incessant desire and search for justice and ceaseless  efforts to avoid injustice.2</p> <p>Thus, as would be seen hereunder, the issue of human rights and National Security have become contentious question of concern. This is not unconnected with the fact that Human right claims at times directly or indirectly affect the national security of the area where the agitation is made. The two dominant players in the arena being the state and individual (citizens) often times overlook the necessity of striking a balance between protection and enforcement of Human rights and the maintenance or promotion of National Security. This failure to strike a balance at times lead to suppression of human rights to the detriment of the citizens in one hand, and inordinate claims of rights which could become a threat to National security on the other hand.</p> <p>From time immemorial, the state has been placed with the task of promoting the inalienable rights of it’s citizens and as protecting and safe guarding National security. From the state of nature, when might was right to the emergence of a civilized. Society and submission of absolute power to the state, man has been the cause of human rights abuses and National Insecurities. A good instance could be seen in aspect of domination and assertion of liberation from dominance as evidenced in outbreak of civil wars.</p> <p>Attempt is made in defining the relevant terms “National Security” has been defined to mean freedom from fear, risk, danger, vulnerability or susceptibility. Because self – preservation or survival is regarded as the first law in nature, security logically becomes a primary consideration of any Government. It is small wonder than that <strong><em>Section 14 (1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria</em></strong> unambiguously prescribes that “the security and welfare of the people shall be a primary purpose of government”. Thus, conceptualized national security is a collective or public good that governments try to provide for all their citizens, regardless of the quantum of resources which individuals and communities contribute through taxation and regardless of the fortunes and performance of others who may be described as free-riders” those who enjoy the enjoy the benefits of collective goods but pay little or nothing for them.4</p> <p>National security is also used in it’s widest sense to include not only the measures relating to the preservation of the country’s physical entity, but also the preservation of the country’s political stability, it’s economic and national interests, and the general protection of the safety and well – being of it’s citizen. Government’s constitutional responsibility for guaranteeing the security and welfare of it’s people necessarily entails discharging certain obligations under municipal law and international law. Domestically, this obligation calls for the making of laws, rules and regulations aimed at ensuring peace, order, safely of lives and property as well as good governance of the country. Internationally, government is obligated to observe international law which protects the lives of citizens and promotes their welfare.</p> <p>A comprehensive conceptualization of the notion of national security distinguishes between two contending viewpoints. One is the conventional security Doctrine which perceives national security as being associated with the protection and defence of the irreducible minimum of a states vital interests or core values such as the preservation of political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state interests or values which can only be maintained by military prowess5. That is why in classical terms, military might is considered the principal instrument for guaranteeing national security. It is pertinent to indicate that <strong><em>Section 217 (2) </em></strong>6 deals with the “Armed Forces” of the Federation, composed of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force while the “Security Forces” or the “Security Machinery” in Nigeria other than the Armed Forces include the office of the National Security Adviser; and the Prison Service. As is well known in performing their constitutional functions, the security agencies may incorporate or coordinate the activities of other bodies such as the Fire Service, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the Nigeria Police, the State Security Service (SSS), the National Intelligence Agency, (NIA), Defence Intelligence Agency (DID), the Custom Service (CS) etc.</p> <p>Consequently, it should be noted that the work also discusses in details how National Security overrides individual rights in protection of human right as was buttressed in the case of <strong><em>ALHAJI MUJAHID DOKUBO-ASARI V STATE</em></strong> 7. Where the learned counsel for the respondent contended that “where national security is threatened or there is the real likelihood of it being threatened, human rights or individual rights of those responsible takes second place. Human rights or individual rights must be suspended until the national security can be protected or well taken care of”.</p> <p>At the end of this work, the researcher would be able to say with certainly whether National Security should override the individual’s human rights and also how it affects most rights known as the fundamental rights of a Nigerian citizen as enshrined in chapter <strong>Iv of the 1999 Constitution.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    DEFINITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS</strong></p> <p>As a preambular remark, Human Rights stricti sensu cannot be construed as Fundamental Human Rights. Human Rights have a vast applicability and are not limited to territorial borders of a state while Fundamental Rights are applicable within a particular country and is more particularistic than Human Rights.</p> <p>Thus, following the definition of Human Right in discourse, it is be noted that there is no unanimity in the definition of human rights by both legal and political writers. According to THESIGER l. J,8 “definitions are proverbially dangerous”. This contention agrees with the Latin maxim <strong><em>“Omnis definitio in large periculosa” – </em></strong> which means that all definition in law are dangerous. The idea behind such contention is premised on the fact that every definition is distilled from the perspective of learning and experience of the author.</p>\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL SECURITY:  A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE NIGERIAN PERSPECTIVE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HUMAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL SECURITY:  A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE NIGERIAN PERSPECTIVE", "id": 79}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><em>LAND REGISTRY PRACTICE IN NIGERIA</em></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <ul><li><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul> <p>This research work is based on the premise of discovering what the practices of land registration has been and how to improve on it. The registration of land before now was a tedious thing to achieve due to the movement from one capital to another (in Akwa Ibom). Lands in the rural and some urban area are not registered therefore fraudulent practices sometimes emerge due to the lack of authenticity of lands in this areas. The dubious practice that go with unregistered instruments arise due to the fact that such instruments are not registered and when a buyer of the land comes, such buyer finds it difficult to trace the history of the land and has to go through rigorous practices of having to trace the ancestors of the vendor and getting confirmation from the village heads, family heads and family members etc. Such lands are earmarked with trees which cannot give a valid or authenticate certification that the land belongs to the vendor.</p> <ul><li><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></li> </ul> <p>The problem that this research work is going to raise, is the problem that originates in the registration of land, land registration practice in Nigeria is a practice that gives validity or authenticity to a bonafide land owner it certifies that a person has acquired a valid title to the lands but due to the erroneous practices that follows the registration of land, land buyers do not have interest in registering their land with the land registry, the tedious practice of waiting for long periods and the monetary terms involved discourages people from registration. The problem with land registry practice also is the lack of awareness, this problems are the driving forces behind this work. The problem of land registration in a state like Akwa Ibom State is traced to the fact that when files where moved from the then Cross River State to Akwa Ibom State that was newly created, files where lost and cannot be properly traced in the land registry.</p> <p>A critical look at the critics of Nigeria today reveals that they are confronted with plethora of land related problems emanating from the uses registration, allocation, distribution and ownership of land. I want to find out about the implementation of the Land Registration Act of 1994 and to investigate on contemporary issues of registration of land in Nigeria. In this stating the 1994 Registration Act was selected and its implementation critically examined. The reason for selecting the 1994 Registration Act was because since the drafting of no other Registration Act have been drafted, which happens be the current and Registration Act that have been drafted in Nigeria. the land Registration policies in this study were the effect of non-registration, principles of registration, the prerequisite of registration land, the compulsoriness of registration and the reactions of Nigerian courts toward non-registered instruments.</p> <p><strong>1.4    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES    </strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Aims of the Study</strong></li> </ul> <p>The aim of this work is  to clarify the issue of registration of land and reasons why land are or are not registered and to add a little contribution to the registration practice in Nigeria especially Akwa Ibom State.

This work will be limited to Akwa Ibom and Cross River State, Uyo and Cross River that is the state capital will be my area of concentration. Akwa Ibom State was carved out of Cross River State, the two states have a link with each other and Enugu State was formerly the capital for registration of land, but the purpose of this research work concentration and emphasize will be made be Akwa Ibom and Cross River State. The little reference will be made to Lagos State, the practice in Lagos State is more advanced therefore a little comparative will be made between Lagos State and the two states.</p> <p>This research topic is too wide to be treated nationally, but rather the researcher has limited it to only Uyo urban.

These instruments severally place specific obligations on State parties to take legislative and other measures to ensure that women’s rights are protected and enforced.[3]Africa is one region of the world whose slow development has attracted a lot of concerns from the United Nations and other developed countries due to her peculiar pedigree.[4]Although Africa may be seen as a late comer in the formation of a regional instrument for the protection of human rights,[5] she has a reputation for having a unique Charter which addresses individual rights, people’s rights among other features that are not in other instruments and above all for having a charter that reflects African values.[6]The need to specifically enumerate and ensure the protection of women’s rights led to the adoption of a special Protocol to the African Charter on women’s rights.[7]A notable feature of the Women’s Protocol is that in Article 2(1)(a) parties are mandated inter alia to “include in their national constitutions and other legislative measures if not already done, the principle of equality between women and men and ensure its effective application.” There has been series of agitations from women about the need to catalogue the rights of women in Constitutions of African countries.[8]Some African Countries have actually taken commendable steps in enumerating some women’s rights in their constitutions while others are yet to do so.[9] The failure of some countries to articulate the rights of women in their constitutions and the heavy reservations raised by some African Countries on the rights of women actually call for a rethink on the chances of attaining the philosophy behind the rights of women in Africa.[10]Beyond the idea of integrating the rights of women in constitutions is the question of acceptability of some of the rights to the African people and women themselves. Thus, the question of universalism of human rights and the question that some rights are culturally relative still struggle for ascendancy.[11] Irrespective of the conceptions, theories and idiosyncrasies, one fact remains sacrosanct and widely accepted, which is, that the cries of women in Africa for their rights are quite alarming[12] and several efforts have been made to address these issues[13], even though the efforts may not be commensurate with the cries. The challenges may be daunting but there are still a lot of prospects.[14] While a lot of approaches have been adopted by the stakeholders, there is still a yawning gap between dreams of realization of women’s rights and the fulfillment. It is therefore expedient to balance the cries for women’s rights with the concerns of other stakeholders in order to arrive at a concrete set of rights that will stand the test of time.[15]Other core stake holders, such as the African Union, National governments, religious leaders, traditional rulers and family heads need to be enlightened about agreeable core rights of women in Africa and such rights should form part of the Constitutions of African states.[16]</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of Research Problem     </strong></p> <p>In spite of the general Constitutional provisions on freedom from discrimination on basis of sex and gender equality, among other rights; there is a recurrent clamour, especially from women, for the need to specifically enumerate and provide for the enforcement of the rights of women in African National Constitutions.[17] The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa requires state parties to include in national constitutions, make legislations and take appropriate measures for the full realization of women’s rights stated in the protocol.[18]Regrettably, women’s rights are yet to be enumerated in Constitutions of most African Countries, neither are there specific provisions for the enforcement of these rights in the Constitutions or specific National legislations. Writings on women’s rights have not separated issues of women’s rights from the general feminist agenda; which creates reluctance from other stakeholders, to balance women’s rights with the rights and concerns of other stakeholders and to address peculiar legal and factual circumstances of the African women. The constitution is seen as the grundnorm in most African States and rights that are not enumerated in constitutions are not usually given sufficient respect.[19]</p> <p>Thus, the central statement in this thesis is that, given the peculiar problems of women in Africa, enumeration and provision for enforcement of their rights in constitutions of African States is a necessity, but it must be balanced with the concerns of other stakeholders.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Research Questions</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the rationale behind differentiating Women’s Rights from general provisions on human rights available to everyone?</li> <li>What are the obstacles to the constitutional enumeration and provision for enforcement of women’s rights in Africa?</li> </ol> <p>iii..   How can the African Union, National Governments, Women organizations and other stakeholders solve the legal comatose involving women’s rights without twisting the neck of other beneficiaries of human rights?</p> <ol><li>Are women the architects or contributories of their own misfortune or complete victims of masculine idiosyncrasies and high handedness?</li> <li>Do precedents of the rights of women in other world regions fit into the African women context and is it a question of wanting “to be like other nations” when they have a peculiar pedigree?</li> <li>What core rights of women should be integrated in Constitutions of African Countries?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4       Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <ol><li>To show the legal foundation for requiring women’s rights to be enumerated and made enforceable in constitutions of African countries.</li> <li>To explain the peculiar background and identify human rights issues faced by women in Africa.</li> </ol> <p>iii.  To identify the factors militating against the enumeration and provision for enforcement of women rights in Constitutions of African Countries.</p> <ol><li>To strike a balance between advocating the rights of women and other beneficiaries of rights in evolving a Constitutional framework for human rights.</li> <li>To recommend informed alternative strategies or approaches that can be adopted by the relevant stakeholders (African Union, legislative houses, and women organizations etc.) to ensure that the rights of women are entrenched in National Constitutions or their equivalent in African States.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5.      Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research into women rights in African constitutions serves as a one stop material for the African Union and her agencies, future researchers, law teachers, students and women who wish to find justification for integration of women’s rights in African constitutions. It provides a solid framework for comparing the experiences of women in Africa with other regions of the world. This research is cutting edge in that it seeks to create a balance between raw advocacy for women’s rights and the need to balance it with the concerns and rights of other stakeholders. The approaches to the struggle for women rights suggested in this work will attract greater results and ultimately lead to more respect for women’s rights in Africa.</p> <p><strong>1.6       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This work focuses on Women’s rights. Not just rights of women all over the world, it addresses women’s rights from the African context. The study however takes off from the point that women’s rights are of global concern before narrowing down to African States. The study draws lessons from other regions of the world with the aim of either drawing useful inspiration to make changes in Africa or showing that some of those templates do not fit into the African mould. Being mindful of the fact that Africa is a vast continent with huge diversities in terms of religion, culture, colonial history among others; the study randomly selects some countries to address the issues at stake.[20] The study acknowledges that there may be general national statutes or policies on women’s rights but it goes further to show that they are not sufficient. The study emphasizes the issues, challenges and prospects of integrating women’s rights in constitutions of African countries.[21] This study also scrutinizes some of the rights canvassed by women in Africa to find the justification or otherwise of including such rights in the Constitutions of African states. Consequently, the work will advocate that some rights which are merely cosmetic or have damning or negative consequences may not be proper in the Constitution while some core rights that are proven to give true essence to womanhood must be inserted.</p> <p><strong>1.7.      Methodology of the Research                     </strong></p> <p>This research is library based. The writer will rely  on primary sources by assembling  key international, regional and national instruments and judicial  decisions  dealing with women’s rights and will proceed to randomly explore provisions of  constitutions of African states on women’s rights. The research also employs narrative methods especially in tracing the history and development of women’s rights. A comparative study of provisions of selected non-African constitutions will be examined to see how women’s rights are addressed .The work shall make an  analysis of reports of international, regional and national bodies in order to explain the problems. A combination of the above methods will bring to fore the real issues involved in this work than relying on a single method, for example a  mere narrative method on problems faced by women will not provide indices to sway society from preconceived notions on women’s rights but some empirical and verifiable data works better.</p> <p><strong>1.8.  Chapterization</strong></p> <p>This thesis is divided into five chapters comprising an Introduction, Literature Review, two chapters on the main body and the final chapter embodies the Conclusion. Under the introduction, the meaning and debate on the issue of ‘women’s rights’ is addressed. The researcher will trace the evolution of women’s rights at the global level and also unveil the regional peculiarities in this regard. An exegesis of the effect of the issues of universalism and cultural relativism as it relates to women’s rights is also examined. The issues of inter–relationship between international obligations and domestic enforcement are also addressed. The chapter also sets the stage for appreciating constitutionally guaranteed rights as opposed to ordinary rights. Chapter two examines existing African and Non-Africa literature on the subject. It brings to fore the fact that most literatures on the subject of women’s rights concentrate on the failure to insert clear provisions, respect and enforce women’s rights. The approaches in existing literatures are largely that of mudslinging and seeming exaggeration of the failure on the part of governments and the men folk. This thesis therefore ,departs from those conceptions and rather seeks to ‘hear the other side,’ by examining why these rights are not incorporated and to discover ways of putting across the necessity for the comprehensive integration and provision for  enforcement of these rights in constitutions in a way that balances the competing interests of women and other stakeholders.</p> <p>Chapter three focuses on the legal instruments that regulate women’s rights in Africa. Global, Regional, Sub-Regional and selected National instruments are carefully examined in order to appreciate the current legal foundation. The Chapter contains much emphasis on the Protocol to the African Charter on the Rights of women which is the core instrument on women’s rights in Africa. The Chapter reviews the core rights provided for in the Protocol and the mechanisms for implementing the rights. Criticisms of the protocol are highlighted and suggestions are made on how to give life to the Protocol. The Chapter goes further to examine the issue of balancing women’s rights with the concerns and rights of other stakeholders like men and children. In examining the rights of other stake holders, the chapter examines the practical challenges of treating women’s rights in isolation.</p> <p>Chapter four examines the types and sources of the problems affecting the realization of   women’s rights in Africa. Beyond the diagnosis of the problems the chapter goes further to articulate the prospects of realizing these rights. To do justice to this chapter some legislations, reports, decisions of courts and other measures that promote or retard the growth of women’s rights are also examined. The chapter further examines peculiar interpretations given to women’s rights in African international and national courts and the roles played by classified institutions and organizations in the development of women’s rights.  Chapter five consists of the summary of the thesis, conclusion and core recommendations for ultimate action.</p> <p><strong>1.9       Definition of  Key Terms</strong></p> <p>The title of this thesis contains core terms that are worthy of definition and the definitions given hereunder will serve as a guide in appreciating the context in which they are used throughout the thesis.</p> <p><strong>1.9.1    Women’s Rights</strong></p> <p>More often than not writers on women’s rights just proceed with discussions on the evolution of women’s rights movements or the kind of rights accruable to women without pausing to give a precise meaning of the phrase ‘women’s rights’.[22]Women’s rights have been defined as, ‘The rights claimed for women, equal to those of men, with respect to suffrage, property, the professional fields etc.’[23]This definition appears to beg the question. The Phrase women’s rights is a juxtaposition of two words, to wit- women and rights. For there to be a comprehensive appreciation of women’s rights one must give answers to the following questions: what does the word ‘women’s’ connote and what are ‘rights’?</p> <p>The word women’s is the possessive form of the plural of ‘woman’.[24]The word woman derives from the Old English <em>Wif-man, Wif </em>meaning “female” and <em>man </em>meaning “human being.”[25]A more accurate meaning attached to the word woman which shows the distinction from the younger females is “[a]n adult female person.”[26]A creative definition of the word women is “The feminine component of human species, who apart from serving as a vehicle for nurturing human life, is also a producer, a consumer and an equally endowed agent for fostering a wholesome political, social and economic development in society.”[27]On the other hand, rights connote moral or legal entitlements to have or obtain something or to act in a certain way.[28]The word has been defined inter alia as ‘something that is due to a person by just claim, legal guarantee, or moral principle’[29] .</p> <p>With the above background in mind, women’s rights, for the purpose of this work, connotes the sum total of all legal entitlements or justifiable demands and claims made by female human beings as being exclusively due to them, whether such claims have been formally recognized in specific legal codes or not.[30]The list of claims or entitlements that can be classified as women’s rights is not in a watertight compartment. Indeed, issues that were not regarded as women’s rights some decades ago now form part of the core rights of women and have been inserted in major world treaties and some national constitutions.[31]One can therefore safely say that women’s rights have a dynamic meaning in terms of specific subjects or issues it comprises of since the issues keep evolving. Thomas captured this point to the nicety when she said:</p> <p>What is striking about the growing women’s human rights movement is its resistance to polarization and, therefore, its dynamism. Both within and between the essays collected here, there is constant movement from the particular experiences of women to commonalities and affinities that arise from those experiences. The particular and the general constantly interrogate and inform one another. The goal is a politics of difference that has already begun to give rise to rejuvenated conception of universality as the foundation for human rights at local, national, regional, and international levels, a rejuvenation from which the entire human rights movement stands to benefit.[32]</p> <p><strong>1.9.2    Constitutions</strong></p> <p>The term “Constitutions” is the plural form of the word Constitution. The word Constitution conveys several meanings but it is used in this work from the legal perspective. According to Harper:</p> <p>A constitution, whether for a powerful nation or for a local garden club, is a set of rules, a supreme or paramount law that outlines how the organization will operate .In terms of a nation, the constitution sets forth political principles, establishes power and authority, and defines responsibilities. The Constitution proscribes the general principles for what a government can and cannot do. Specific laws enacted by the government, also called statutory law, spell out the details. For example, the US Constitution gives the government the authority to collect taxes, but leaves it to the government to decide who and what will be taxed and how much.[33]</p> <p>Flowing from the above, a Constitution apart from setting the Political framework and responsibilities of government; usually integrates the fundamental rights and in some cases the duties of the people.[34]The key factor to note is that a constitution is regarded, especially in democracies, by the people bound thereby as “the foundational, fundamental, basic or underlying rule that is of such importance to the organization or people as the very substance of their existence, the condition for their intra relationship and the compass that must be followed in the daily administration of the organization or government.”[35] This work deals with the Constitution as it affects nations as against clubs or related organizations. Nwabueze posits that “A Constitution is a mode of organizing a state and its government; it is in other words, a body of fundamental principles according to which a state is organized.”[36]Harper goes further to state that, “[t]he United States Constitution is a master document, the paramount or overriding set of laws laying out the foundation of American democracy and the rule of law.”[37] Thus it has been further defined as the “Fundamental and entrenched rules governing the conduct of an organization or nation state, and establishing its concept, character and structure. It is usually a short document, general in nature and embodying the aspirations and values of its writers and subjects.”[38]In the sense presented above, the constitution does not generally provide so much details but it prescribes the fundamental principles while other laws can be used to set out the details of the principles.

The essence of the research is vividly captured in the above prelude. Records reveal that before the state took over the provision of security for its citizenry through its official law enforcement agency – the police -, victims of crime were solely responsible for identifying those who wronged them, footing the bills of investigating their crimes and prosecuting the felons when arrested.[2] Thus, where a crime was committed without witnesses, efforts to identify the assailant became the tasks borne by the victims unaided, as no government agencies was responsible for investigating crimes.[3]</p> <p>Nmerole admitted that, this was the situation in the United Kingdom during the frankpledge era (a system under which each adult member was responsible for the good conduct of the others).[4] And after the Norman Conquest in 1066, though constables were added and saddled with the tasks of guarding the city gates at night, investigating crimes and prosecuting cases still remained a private matter handled by the victims themselves. In the United States, private prosecution dominated criminal justice during the colonial era, and criminal cases were initiated by complaints of private citizens, and the responsibility to pursue the case to its logical conclusion rested primarily with the private citizen who began the process. As a result, he was required to pay the justices’ fees and hire attorney to plead the case, which situation still prevails in the common law nations.[5]</p> <p>However, in pre-colonial Africa, according to Tamuno, “crime in most societies was viewed as an infraction against the entire community and not the individual victim”.[6]  Therefore when crime was committed, all that the victim needed to do was to alert the neighbours, and the entire members of the community, particularly members of the secret society responsible for security, would chase and apprehend the culprit; who would subsequently be tried by the elders’ council and if found guilty, “would be promptly, adequately and publicly punished”.[7] For instance, in the Kanuri speaking area of Nigeria, “communal solidarity, rather than personal gains and successes, held sway in the sphere of defence”.[8] As a result, “whenever and wherever an individual member of the community was attacked, the entire village would rise up in arms in defence of the victim”.[9]</p> <p>Tamuno also confirmed that, “There was no police force, but rather it was the supernatural sanction of their religion that policed the primordial Nigerian village society”.[10] These, “Indigenous religions had that strong moral code and supernatural sanction that were both able to keep the old village society morally clean and free from crime”.[11] He argued that what ensured a high level of public security and public safety was that, “The people so affected  realized  that  crime  did not pay. Besides, neither the high nor the mighty in society</p> <p>could claim exemption from the sanctions in force in pre-colonial times”.[12] Ndifon similarly affirmed that under the customary legal system, every offence had its own punishment, and “Punishment was often effectively and realistically administered to the wrongdoer”.[13] For instance, for murder, “Punishments ranged from replacement in specie, enslavement, suicide, banishment of the wrongdoer, to payment of specific sum to the family of the deceased victim”. He maintained that, “Justice for the victim or his relatives was the ultimate aim of punishment in pre-colonial African justice system”.[14]  To him therefore, it was the introduction of the British police tradition and adoption of the alien court and legal systems in Nigeria and other African countries that abolished these pre-colonial customary legal ideals from the territories.[15]</p> <p>According to Tamuno, “This alien government recruited its own police to enforce its laws and keep the peace of the imperial crown”.[16] The police system, “Stressed prevention and detection of crime and punishment of the criminal, as against compensation and restitution of the victims which were the essence of the customary legal systems”.[17] The alien police and legal systems emphasised, and still emphasise that, “Complaints must be initiated by individual victims and police must investigate and possibly prosecute the offender, with the victim serving only as a prosecution witness”.[18] From the above analysis, it is obvious that during the colonial era, and still in Nigeria today, the victim of crime, was and still is relevant in the criminal justice process only for his testimony.[19]</p> <p>In the context of international law jurisprudence, ordinary or conventional crimes are within the national criminal justice system.[20] Therefore, the protection of the right of victims of intentional or ordinary crimes, and affording them justice are, properly situated within the confines of national governments. Hence, violations of rights of victims of crime, through intentional crimes committed by fellow citizens in their private capacities, are outside the realm of international law jurisprudence.[21]  Renewed interests in the affairs of victims of crime attracted global limelight, following the pioneering work of Marjory Fry in the early 1960s then a magistrate in England.  She had reasoned that, “victims of intentional crimes should be given the same treatment as victims of motor vehicle or work place accidents”.[22] Accordingly, her efforts drew global attention to the need for better treatment for victims of crime. As a result, in 1963, New Zealand started the first State Compensation Programme for victims of violent crimes.[23] This was followed by England with the establishment of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme in 1964, to handle the issue of compensation to victims of crime of violence.[24] Thereafter, similar schemes were introduced in other European countries, Australia and Provinces in Canada.[25]</p> <p>Majory Fry’s agitations attracted the attention of the World Society of Victimology, which met with United Nations officials in 1982 to discuss ways of ensuring that victims of crime are guaranteed protection and redress, globally.[26] After series of discussions, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 1985 adopted and implemented the</p> <p>Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power.[27] The UNO envisaged that through the Declaration interest in the protection of the rights of victims of crime would spread globally.[28] However, as would be seen shortly, interest in the issue only spread further within the leading countries of Europe and the United States of America. For instance, shortly after the Declaration, England proclaimed a Charter for the Rights for Victims, which required courts to consider restitution from the offender to their victims on a routine basis. In 1995, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act was enacted, yet still, in 2001, the Home Office in its Report, entitled, “Criminal Justice: The Way Ahead”, revealed that,”many victims felt that the rights of the accused take precedence over theirs in criminal proceedings”.[29]</p> <p>Recently, Dame Helen, the Chief Executive of Victims’ Support in England equally lamented, “We believe an entirely new way of thinking about crime is needed – one that recognises the needs of victims of crime as the responsibility of the whole community, rather than leaving people to suffer in silence while we focus on offenders”.[30] She argued rightly that, “Crime ruins lives, people suffer direct physical and financial losses, including severe, and often long-lasting emotional and psychological trauma”.[31] She affirmed that this situation is often frequently made worst by, “insensitive treatment and a lack of understanding from the agencies with which victims come into contact”.[32]  The experience narrated by Dame Hellen, it is observed, is a typical phenomenon of all victims of crime in Nigeria. For instance, at most police stations in Nigeria, their complaints are often not responded to promptly and sometimes when done at all, it is at a heavy price borne by the victim. In the USA, one of the significant achievements of Majory Fry’s agitations, it has been observed, is that, “Taxes and fines on corporate criminals are employed in services and awareness through the offices for Victims of crime (OVC)”.[33] Also the court in<em> Payne v Tennessee</em>[34] recognised and approved the right of victims to make, “victims’ impact statements” in the sentencing phase of criminal trials. This development has become an added impetus to the struggle for the redress for victims of crime in the United States.</p> <p>In 1998 the United Nations General Assembly approved the <em>Guide for Policymakers and the Handbook on Justice for Victims</em>, which was adopted in 1999,[35] to facilitate the implementation of UNGA 1985 Basic Principles.[36] This was done in furtherance of her efforts to ensure that victims of crime are properly protected. Equally in Europe, the Council of European Union in November, 1985, approved the Council of Europe Ministers’ Recommendation R (85/11) of 1985 which deals specifically on the issue of victims.[37] It is regrettable to observe that neither the African Union, through its Charter,[38] nor African countries, including Nigeria have been positively influenced in this regards as their counterparts in Europe and America, with regards to initiatiating legislative measures to cater for the interests of victims of crime.</p> <p>In Nigeria, once crime is committed against, or its commission is suspected by any individual, the individual is enjoined to report such to the police for their investigation.[39] This action by the police an obvious agency of government portrays the victim as not having been completely abandoned by the state. However, mere investigation of crimes is viewed as inadequate to carter for the rights of the victims. It is therefore advocated that special laws, boards and or commissions, that would adequately accommodate the rights of victims be established to handle their issues. Today in Nigeria, as in other African countries, it is not in doubt that there are numerous international and national non-governmental organisations, etc. whose sole task is struggling for the protection and redress for victims of abuse of power. It is ironical that the victims, who often suffer both physical and psychological harms as a result of the intentional and unlawful commissions or omissions of private citizens, who deserve more attention, are ignored. It is therefore proposed that governments, both at the federal and state levels, relevant non-governmental organisations and other groups, should re-focus on, and re-direct their attentions to the plights of victims of crime.</p> <p>By virtue of both the Constitutional and statutory provisions,[40] the Nigeria Police force, as an institution of government is vested with the arduous responsibility of, “prevention and detection of crime, apprenshion of offenders and protection of life and property” of all Nigerians. It is thus rightly affirmed that, the Nigeria police is, “structured organisationally and psychologically to protect the society from the criminal elements and other miscreant” within the society. Therefore, where there is no special legislation, as it were, for protection of the victims of crime in the Nigeria, the police should not be encumbered or obstructed, but should rather be encouraged by all, in the discharge of their duties. However, because of the apparent corruption and ineptitude of the present crop of police officers, asking Nigerians to cooperate with the police would tantamount to an uphill task. It is believed that since the police belong to the citizenry, the onus is therefore on the people to demand for the kind of police they really need; and this cannot be realised through the current abhorrence of and apathy towards the institution.[41]</p> <p>Furthermore, it is articulated that, the fact that the police have fallen short of public expectations, does not warrant the seemingly disdain and hatred with which the officers and anything that associates with them is regarded. Sometimes, this perception has caused grant of court orders that turn out to disrupt criminal investigative processes; prohibit the arrest of reasonably suspected offenders, and even set free those in police detentions unconditionally,[42] and in total disregard of the law;[43] assumingly in the pursuit of protection of the purportedly breached rights of the applicants.</p> <p>It has rightly been asserted that, “The essential purpose of human rights jurisprudence is to ensure the effective protection of certain fundamental entitlements of all human beings everywhere without distinction”.[44] Therefore, if innocent victims of crime are human beings, it is undeniable that whenever their fundamental human rights are breached by fellow private individuals, they also are entitled to be accorded adequate protection and redress. Therefore, it is strongly argued that the release on bail of reasonably suspected and  arrested criminals, without hearing from the victim, terminating police investigative processes through court orders; and the inability or unwillingness of the courts, the police, highly placed political office holders, top government officials and chief executives of government parasatals, to promptly and effectively bring perpetrators of crime to book, including grant of Presidential pardons and amnesty to jailed criminals, contribute much more to the escalation of corruption and other criminal activities in Nigeria, than the supposed  police  corruption  –  the  recent  oil  subsidy[45]  and  the  Pension‘s  fund scandals,[46] are clear examples. Events like these contribute more to the victims’ despondency and create the impression that it pays to be a criminal.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of Research Problem</strong></p> <p>Victims of crime in Africa and in Nigeria in particular from the inception of colonialism, have always been relevant only for the purpose of successful prosecution; with their needs, interests and rights accorded little or no concern by the operators of the criminal justice system. The several non-governmental organisations, civil society and other community-based groups in Nigeria are concerned with the protection and redress for the suspect, accused persons and or prisoners. The Nigeria Police as an institiution of the executive arm of government, as earlier stated, are saddled with several duties, [47] which they have performed below the public’s expectation, supposedly because of corruption, ineptitude, impunity and incompetence.[48]</p> <p>That these allegations are true are incontestable; a cursory flip through the dailies and social media will attest to this, and most unfortunately, not too long ago, an Inspector-General of police was jailed for corruption. However, a brief for the police is not contemplated here, but at the same time, it is apt to observe that often persons police reasonably suspect of crimes are prohibited from being arrested; and sometimes those already arrested and detained are ordered by courts, to be released on bail unconditionally. As a result, the criminal investigative processes are thwarted and aborted, and the complaint of the victim is abandoned,[49] and the suspected person now set free, and seemingly protected by the law, goes about unleashing other heinous crimes on the society and his victim in the initial case now left at his mercy.[50]</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>       <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <ul><li>What impact would judicial interference in criminal investigatory processes have on the victim, criminal justice system and the society as a whole?</li> <li>When criminal investigative processes are aborted through judicial fiat, is all the parties afforded justice?</li> <li>When costs are awarded against victims for allegedly breaching the rights of suspects, what message/messages do courts send to the society?</li> <li>Is there any Special Law for the protection of victims of crime in Nigeria?</li> <li>What unique rights do victims of crime possess that require protection?</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4      Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main aim of this study is to appraise the roles of the police and court in the protection and redress for victims of crime in Nigeria. While its objectives are:</p> <ul><li>To ascertain the legality and constitutionality, or otherwise, of injunctive orders against police investigative processes.</li> <li>To examine the adverse impacts of premature release on bail of suspects on the victims of crime, the criminal justice system and the society at large.</li> </ul> <p>(3)       To examine the rights of victims of crime.</p> <p>(4)        To examine comparatively the use of police powers of arrest and detention and the treatment and handling of arrested persons in United Kingdom, the United States, India and Nigeria</p> <p>(5)     To examine international, regional and national legislation on protection and   redress for adults and children victims of crime and</p> <p>(6)         To make appropriate recommendations.</p> <p><strong>1.5       Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Against the background that protection and redress for victims of crime have attracted global attention, and emphasis and focus had since the 1960s, shifted to “restitution and compensation” to victims in Europe and Americas, except Africa; and in view of the fact that everyone is a potential victim of crime, it is opined that there is urgent need to initiate measures to ameliorate the plights of victims. The research is immensely valuable to both the federal and states’ executives, and federal and states’ legislatures. The research enjoins these government functionaries to re-focus their respective roles and responsibilities towards ensuring that adequate measures are put in place to protect and redress victims of crime in Nigeria, as is in vogue in other jurisdictions.</p> <p>The legislatures in particular, are re-awakened to grasp the significance of their law making roles, and thereby come up with relevant legislation in support of the subject matter of this research. The initiative of Senator Ganiju Olarewaju Solomon, for sponsoring the “Witness Protection Bill” now before the National Assembly is commended and applauded. It is noted that the Bill when it becomes an Act, aims only at protecting citizens who volunteer useful information about perpetrators and sponsors of violence and insecurity, and not protecting the rights of victims of crime <em>per se</em>. It is prayed and hoped that the parliamentarians will insert therein adequate provisions for the protection of the rights of victims in the standpoint of the 1985 UN Declaration.</p> <p>Similarly, the executives at all the tiers of government will hereby realise the imperativeness of creating relevant commissions and boards to handle victims’ related welfare issues. Correspondingly, non-governmental organisations, civil society groups, town and village-communal groups now recognise the need to re-focus their energies and resources in fighting for the protection and redress for victims of crime. Furthermore, judges, prosecutors and defence attorneys will find the work useful, as it reminds them of their unique roles in this regard. Finally, the general public, Institutions, Human rights groups, scholars and researchers in Constitutional law, International Human Rights Law and Criminology will find the research useful as an authoritative source of material for further research.</p> <p><strong>1.6       The Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research begins with an examination of the position of the law on protection of victims of crime in Nigeria and afterwards veers into a comparative analysis of the position in Europe with particular emphasis on the activities of the Council of Ministers of European Union. The position in the United States where there is adequate legal regime on the protection and redress for victims of crime is examined as a basis for recommendations for improvement of the situation in Nigeria in particular and Africa in general. It is observed sadly that, in Africa, there are no serious legislative efforts regarding protection and redress for victims of crime as  there are in Europe and the United States; and the scanty provisions available in their primary criminal procedural rules is out of tune with reality, and the judges hardly apply them.</p>\n\nPROTECTION AND REDRESS FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROTECTION AND REDRESS FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME IN NIGERIA", "id": 82}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>IMPACT OF THE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF REPUGNANCY DOCTRINE ON THE CUSTOMARY LAWS AND CUSTOMARY PRACTICES IN NIGERIA</strong>   INTRODUCTION </p> <p>The introduction of the British Common Law, the Doctrine of Equity and the Statute of General Application by <strong>Ordinance 3 of 1863 </strong>into Nigeria did not abolish the customary law of the people. Rather, the statute introducing such English Laws expressly made provision to the effect that British established courts in Nigeria should observe and enforce the observance of the Customary Law of the people.</p> <p>However, it is instructive to state that <strong>Ordinance 4 of 1876</strong> provided for the preservation of such customary laws in clear and unambiguous terms. <strong>Section 18 of Ordinance 4 of 1876 </strong> enjoined the British established courts in the colony to enforce the observance of the customary laws of the people of the colony.</p> <p>Subsequent local legislations over the years have since continued to retain these legislation.

Njidika4 where Elias C. J. N. (as he then was) said:</p> <p>We think that, the planting of the Land with economic crops like rubber must be regarded as necessarily incidental to the use of the Land since there is no evidence that it was forbidden under the terms of the original pledge; but it is also clear, nevertheless, that the pledgee has no right to any compensation of credit for the plantations, which accrue to the pledged land on the principle of quid-quid plantatur Solo Solo Cedet.

While section 44(1) (a) requires the prompt payment of compensation thereof and section 44(1) (b) gives to any person claiming such compensation a right of access for the determination of his interest in the property and the amount of compensation to a court of law or tribunal or body having jurisdiction in that part of Nigeria.</p><p>      5.

One of such discourse is the unresolved appointment of the chief Judge of Rivers State[1]caused by the row between the Rivers State Government and the National Judicial Council. To every human being, all over the world; justice is the oxygen of a good life. Socio-political and economic existence depend on proper delivery of this invaluable commodity.<strong>1</strong></p> <p>The evolvement of the judiciary can be traced to the principle of separation of powers. John Locke and Baron de Montesquieu dominated the early formulation of the doctrine of separation of powers. In fashioning this political formulation, the renowned jurist, Locke having observed the prevailing political conditions in England in the 17th century, concluded that arbitrariness in governance was a product of concentration of all governmental powers in one authority. The diffusion of authority among different centers of decision making is the “thesis to totalitarism or absolution”.The doctrine clearly provides for the three arms of government; the executive, the legislature and the judiciary and their independence.</p> <p>The Nigerian Judiciary has in recent times come up against a bulwark of onslaught against its integrity and an erosion of its public image ranging from accusations of financial material compromise, manipulations from the political elitist class and weak agencies. Against the backdrop of recent public perceptions on the judiciary, the following are the key areas upon which this essay shall be built: separation of powers, the general process appoints of the Nigerian bench; tenure of judges and independence of the judiciary as well as the nature of judicial power.</p>\n\nA CRITICAL APPRAISAL ON THE PROCEDURE FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDICIAL OFFICERS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL APPRAISAL ON THE PROCEDURE FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDICIAL OFFICERS IN NIGERIA", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>HOLDING CHARGE SYNDROME; A CHALLENGE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The criminal justice system revolves around three cardinal institutions: the police, court and prison. These institutions are partners in our failing criminal justice system, due to some practices that are inimical to the interest of society. Thus, the incalculable harm being wrecked on the Nigerian criminal justice system by the holding charge practice cannot be justified. Holding charge which involves the bringing of a suspect before an inferior Court that lacks jurisdiction to try him or her for the primary purpose of securing a remand order, in order to look for a prima facie evidence in support of the allegation against the suspect and thereafter abandon him or her in prison under the pretext of awaiting trial, leaves one to wonder whether the presumption of innocence is tenable in Nigeria. Holding Charge Syndrome</p> <p>This is because under this practice, an accused is presumed guilty until he or she proves his innocence. Also, the crisis of congestion in our prison is the result of the holding charge practice. It is trite, that jurisdiction is the life-wire of any litigation whether civil or criminal and the base on which adjudication rest. It follows that there is obviously an anomaly in bringing a suspect for remand before a magistrate who has no power to impose penalty for the indictable offence allegedly committed by the suspect. Therefore, the practice by magistrate courts who lacked Jurisdiction in indictable offence, but goes on to remand the suspect under holding charge have been considered unconstitutional, because it is a threat to the accused person’s rights to personal liberty, dignity, and fair hearing granted by the 1999 constitution (as amended). However, some states laws have given the magistrate court the impetus to continue with this harmful practice without regard to the provisions of the grundnorm. Consequently, this research work, in chapter one will take a look at the historical inception of holding charge; chapter two will focus on the meaning of the monster called holding charge, the reason for its adoption and the illegality. Chapter three will discuss on the rights of accused persons and how holding charge have thwarted its realization. Chapter four will examine the effect of holding charge in the criminal justice administration in Nigeria. The last chapter contains observation and recommendation, mainly on abrogation of all the laws that gave magistrate courts powers to remand suspects on indictable offences even when they have no jurisdiction. Holding Charge Syndrome</p> <p>CHAPTERIZATION<br/>i.

It is the manner or form by which property devolves. Though there may not have been any law or statute enacted by a legislature for this purpose, yet each community have had their own beliefs and practices regulating same. Thus, it was held,[2] that it is the assent of the natives of a particular community to practices and customs in that community that makes such practices and customs valid[3]. Customary law embodies customs as practiced by the people which they regard as binding on them[4]. Customary succession therefore, is concerned with the way and manner recognized and accepted by the people in which properties are transferred locally according to the customs, traditions and practices of the people.</p> <div>          This seminar paper therefore is aimed at examining customary succession among the Ibo speaking peoples of Nigeria</div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>          Haven noted above the fact that succession have been since the existence of man upon the earth, it therefore means that succession in Africa and in particular among the Ibo speaking peoples of Nigeria did not begin with colonization. Thus even before the colonization of Africa, her indigenous people had their own established culture, customs, practices and way of life which regulated relationships between of these communities, including succession[5].</div> <div>          Customary law is any system of law different from common law and a law enacted by a competent legislature in Nigeria, but which is enforceable and binding within Nigeria as between the parties subject to its way[6]. Customary succession therefore, is succession that is not in accordance with the common law or a statute enacted, but in accordance with the traditions, customs and practices of the local people which are enforceable and binding between the parties which are subject to it.</div> <div>          This paper therefore the examines nature of succession as practiced according to the customs, traditions and practices of the Ibos of Anambra, Enugu, Ebonyi, Imo and Abia states, (South-Eastern states) of Nigeria, legislative and judicial interventions and their impact on these customary practices, advantages and disadvantages of customary practices if any, recommendations and conclusion.</div> <div><strong>WHAT IS SUCCESSION?</strong></div> <div>          Succession is the assumption of position or title, the right to take up position or little, or the order in which a position is taken up[7]. According to <strong>Kerridge R<strong>[8]</strong></strong>, it is concerned with the transfer or devolution of property on death[9]. Succession has been defined as <strong><em>“the order in which or the condition under which one person after another succeeds to a property, dignity, title or throne; the act or process of a person becoming beneficially entitled to a property or property interest of a deceased person<strong>[10]</strong>”.</em></strong> Succession can either be testate or intestate. Testate succession is based on the provision of a will, while intestate succession is that which is without a will. In this paper however, we are concerned with intestate succession</div> <div><strong>INTESTATE SUCCESSION</strong></div> <div>          Intestacy is a condition in which one dies without a valid will[11]. It refers to the laws of the state which provides for the inheritance of property from a person who dies without leaving a will[12]. It is the body of law that determines who is entitled to property in the absence of a valid last will and testament or other binding declarations[13].</div> <div>          Intestacy could be total or partial. It can be said to be total where there is no will at all or even if there was, it has been invalidated. On the other hand intestacy can be said to be partial in either of the following circumstances. First, where a particular gift or gifts lapse, secondly where the entire estate is not fully covered by the will or thirdly some aspects of the will have been invalidated.</div> <div><strong>LAWS GOVERNING INTESTACY IN NIGERIA</strong></div> <div>          There is no one general law on intestacy applicable throughout Nigeria. Intestate succession therefore in Nigeria is governed by different rules and laws as a result of the pluralism of family law[14]. Besides, since the issue of succession, is not on the exclusive legislative list but residual[15] it therefore means that each state of the federation apart from the customs and traditions of the different tribes and ethnic groups in Nigeria are at liberty to enact laws regulating succession. Thus is as provided by the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended)[16], only the formations, annulment and dissolution other than Islamic and customary manages that the Federal Government has legislative competence[17].</div> <div>          The first Regional Instrument on succession was enacted by the old Western Region in 1959[18]comprising of the present day Oyo, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Ekiti, Edo and Delta States.</div> <div>          Today, there are other laws governing intestate succession in Nigeria which includes:</div> <ol><li>Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999[19]</li> <li>Administration of Estates Law 1959 which is applicable to states of the old Western Region[20]</li> <li>Administration of Estates Law, Lagos State[21]</li> <li>Administration and succession (Estates of Deceased Persons) Law, 1987[22] applicable to Anambra, Enugu and Ebonyi States</li> <li>Case law[23]</li> <li>Islamic Law[24]</li> <li>Customary Law[25]</li> </ol> <div>From the above, it is clear that succession in Nigeria is governed by statute, case law and customary/Islamic law. However in this paper, we are concerned with customary succession as affected by statutes and judicial decisions with particular reference to the Ibos occupying Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, Imo and Abia states, the South-Eastern Geopolitical Zone of Nigeria.</div> <div><strong>THE NATURE OF CUSTOMARY LAW SUCCESSION</strong></div> <div>          Customary law succession is the succession that is governed by the customs, beliefs, traditions and practices of the indigenous people. Customary laws are <strong>“<em>customs that are acceptable as legal requirements or obligatory rules of conduct, practices and beliefs that are so vital and intrinsic a part of a social and economic system that they are treated as if they are laws”<strong>[26]</strong>.</em></strong></div> <div>          Accordingly, the customary law of an area or a community encapsulates all the beliefs, social institutions and religion that characterizes and are unique to that particular society[27]. Customary laws therefore, are the body of rules governing a particular group of people[28].</div> <div>          Customary succession therefore, being succession that is according to the customs, beliefs and traditions (customary laws) of the people is mainly intestate, i.e. without a will[29]. There are however very few instances where customary oral wills are made and where such declarations fulfils certain conditions they are valid and binding[30]. Apart from the fact that customary succession is basically intestate, another characteristic feature of customary succession is that there is no one general rule of customary succession among the different communities. Customary succession rule or law like customs, traditions and beliefs, it differs from community to community[31]. Therefore, we shall in this paper consider customary law succession among the Ibos of the South-Eastern Region of Nigeria.</div> <div><strong>THE IBO CUSTOMARY LAW OF SUCCESSION</strong></div> <div>          Customary succession among the Ibos is predominantly patrilineal[32]. Inheritance is therefore governed by the principle of primogeniture in the sense that the eldest son of the deceased succeeds to his estate[33]. This is known as “Okpala” or “Diokpa”[34]. The Okpala who is the eldest son automatically on the death of his father steps into the shoes of the father as the head of the family[35]. In a situation where the deceased had more than one wife, the eldest sons of each of the wives take part in the sharing of the deceased estate[36]. There are however a few communities where succession is matrilineal[37]. For instance, in Ohafia division, according to the customary law manual[38] a man’s intestate estate is inherited by his maternal relatives, their sons and daughters[39].</div> <div>          In other parts of Ibo land where succession is patrilineal and by primogeniture, the deceased eldest sons stepping into the father’s shoes as the head of the family is entitled to the compound or the immediate surroundings and any other special property/privilege the father enjoyed why he was still alive[40]. This right includes occupation of his deceased father’s dwelling house, though in practice, he may chose to live in his own house and decide which of his brothers should occupy the building or get a share of land for erecting a building[41].</div> <div>          It should however be noted and understood that although the eldest son inherits his deceased father’s real and personal property, he holds the landed property as trustee-beneficiary for his other brothers and for himself[42]. Thus he has the right of control over his deceased father’s land and must use them for the benefit of his younger brothers[43].</div> <div>          However, where the deceased is not survived by any male issues his estate is inherited by his surviving brothers of full blood, and where there is no brothers of full blood, the deceased father inherits[44].</div> <div>          In Imo State, among the Awo- Idemili people where succession is referred to as “ekpe”, land can be inherited from both lineage and non lineage source[45]. It is lineage source where the property in issue is that which had passed from proceeding generations and non-lineage source when it is otherwise[46]. The customary inheritance procedures in this community is that, while the decease eldest son inherits the deceased father’s dwelling house and compound, the youngest son inherits the mother’s hut and the backyard[47]. But these customary practices have undergone changes as a result of factors like population, literacy, civilization etc[48].</div> <div>          It should however be noted that wives and daughters does not have any right of inheritance under the Ibo Customary Succession Law to their deceased father’s movable and immovable properties[49]. According to the learned author, “personal property including wives and slaves descends to the eldest son as heir, or failing a son, to the oldest brother or male relative”[50].</div> <div>          This principle was affirmed by the Supreme Court in <strong>Nezianya v. Okagbue<strong>[51]</strong></strong> where it was held that “under the native law and custom of Onitsha, a widow’s possession of her deceased husband’s property… however long it is… does not make her owner, she cannot by efflusion of time claim the property as her own…she has however the right to occupy the building or part of it, but this is subject to good behaviour”.</div> <div>          This position was further affirmed by the Supreme Court in <strong>Nzekwu v Nzekwu<strong>[52]</strong></strong> where the court maintained that a widow’s interest in the deceased husband property/house is possessory and not proprietary and as such, she cannot dispose of it.</div> <div>          The only ground in which females can inherit under the Ibo customary law of succession is under the “Nrachi” or “Idegbe” institution[53]. Under this practice, where a man dies without a male child to inherit his estate, the daughter will remain unmarried in her father’s house with the intent of raising children in her father’s home[54]. The legal interest in the decreased father’s estate vests in her until she gives birth, and only her male children can succeed him according to the rule of primogeniture[55].</div> <div>          However, where a female dies being unmarried and not a “Idegbe” her estate is inherited by her full blood brothers or father by default; and where there is no surviving father or brothers, the half brothers will inherit her. The sisters can never inherit her[56].</div> <div>          Where the female is married and she has properties which she acquired before marriage, such reverts back to the maiden family; but movable properties acquired by the wife before manage if taken by her to her husband’s house, goes to the husband or his family on her death[57]. Properties acquired by a married woman after her marriage goes to her husband and his family on her death[58]personalities like pots, cloths etc of a deceased wife, goes to the daughters.</div> <div><strong>LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTION AS REGARDS IBO CUSTOMARY LAW OF SUCCESSION</strong></div> <div><strong>1. THE CONSTITUTION</strong></div> <div>In Nigeria, the Constitution[59] being the <strong>GRUNDNORM</strong> of all other laws has provided for inheritance/succession in the Residual List. The Constitution provides that[60] the constitution is supreme and its provision binding on all authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and any other law inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution, shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void[61].</div> <div>          Besides, section 42 of the Constitution[62] (as amended) provides for the right from freedom from discrimination. Sub-section (2)[63] of the above section confers on children born outside wedlock, freedom from discrimination and the right of inheritance under intestacy whether under statute or customary law. Thus in <strong>Salubi v Nwariakwa<strong>[64]</strong></strong> where the decease Chief T.E.A Salubi was married to Mrs. Angela Salubi under the Marriage Act in 1939 in which two children were born, namely to Appellant, Dr. T.E.A Salubi and the Respondent, Mrs. B. Nwariakwu. The deceased had two other children out of wedlock by two other women. On his death intestate in 1982 the appellant (his son) and his widow were granted Letters of Administration over the estate in 1985. Due to the age and poor health of the widow, the appellant became the sole administrator of the estate. The respondent not being satisfied with the way the estate was being administered by the appellant instituted this action.

Although the legal process involved (either in formality or requirement) varies from one jurisdiction to another, marriage is often characterized by disputes which range from divorce to custody of children, maintenance e. t. c. Marriage, as examined in this context, is limited to that conducted under statutes.</div> <div>In resolving these disputes, recourse is made to adjudication. But overtime, various shortcomings are being found for litigation. These include unnecessary delay caused by congestion of court, high cost of litigation, confrontational nature of litigation amongst others. Employing the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1970, which operates within Nigeria jurisdiction, this research presents an outlook of litigation in resolving marriage disputes and also points out its shortcomings.</div> <div>Consequent upon the shortcomings found for litigation, various alternatives to litigation are being come up with. This research, in line with resolving matrimonial disputes, focuses on examining few of these alternatives which are collaborative divorce, divorce mediation and divorce arbitration. In examining these alternatives, this research points out the advantages they have over litigation in their application to marriage disputes and these amongst others include promotion of confidentiality, cost and time saving. The challenges facing the use of these alternatives which include inadequate skills, lack of enforcement e. t. c. are also examined.</div> <div>Furthermore, ways of curbing these challenges which are put forward as recommendations are included in the latter part of this research.

The law recognizes that human beings are prone to losing their control under extreme rage and should they react violently, justice demands that account be taken of this natural tendency of theirs in inflicting punishment. The defence of provocation is available to an accused as a mitigating defence rather than an absolute one because much as the law recognizes human weakness, it does not condone human ferocity.</div> <div>This project work shall attempt a detailed examination of provocation as a defence to criminal liability largely concentrating on the Nigerian perspective.</div> <div>In order to achieve this objective, the work is divided thus:Chapter one will give a general introduction to provocation, what is a crime, elements of crime, criminal liability, the definition of provocation as defence, the defences which are open to an accused under the Nigerian criminal justice system, the historical development of the defence of provocation and also the justification for the defence of provocation. Chapter two will cover expressly the defence of provocation under the Nigerian Law, the elements that sufficiently constitute  provocation and the offences to which provocation is a defence under Nigerian Law, it will also cover an analysis of some of the Nigerian cases on the defence of provocation. Chapter three will focus on the restrictions and limitations of provocation as a defence, the rule of proportionality as a limitation to the plea of provocation, the reasonable man’s test, the issue of retreat and provocation by a third party,  Chapter four will focus on the conclusion and recommendation.</div> <div>The methodology of the research is Doctrinal, Analytical and Argumentative.

Chapter five which is the concluding part of the work contains the findings of the work and includes the necessary recommendations.<br/><br/></p><p> Table of Content </p> <p>CONTENTS<br/>COVER PAGE..................i<br/>CERTIFICATION............ii<br/>ABSTRACT......................iii<br/>DEDICATION.............................................<br/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.........................v<br/>TABLE OF CASES.................................vi<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES............................vii<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS...................viii<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS...........................ix<br/><br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0:INTRODUCTION 1<br/>1.1.0:BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY 3<br/>1.2.0:OBJECTIVE OF STUDY 5<br/>1.3.0:FOCUS OF STUDY 6<br/>1.4.0:SCOPE OF STUDY 7<br/>1.5.0:METHODOLOGY 7<br/>1.6.0:LITERATURE REVIEW 7<br/>1.7.0:DEFINITION OF TERMS 12<br/>1.8.0:CONCLUSION 15<br/><br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>LEGITIMACY<br/>2.0.0:INTRODUCTION 16<br/>2.1.0:CONCEPT OF LEGITIMACY 16<br/>2.2.0:LEGITIMACY UNDER NIGERIAN CUSTOMARY LAW 18<br/>2.3.0:LEGITIMACY UNDER ENGLISH LAW 21<br/>2.4.0:LEGITIMACY OF CHILDREN OF VOID MARRIAGE 22<br/>2.5.0:LEGITIMACY OF CHILDREN OF A VOIDABLE MARRIAGE 24<br/>2.6.0:ILLEGITIMACY 25<br/>2.7.0:DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEGITIMATE AND ILLEGITIMATE CHILD 28<br/>2.7.0:OTHER INSTANCES OF LEGITIMACY 30<br/>2.8.0: CONCLUSION 30<br/><br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>LEGITIMATION<br/>3.0.0:INTRODUCTION 32<br/>3.1.0:LEGITIMATION BY SUBSEQUENT STATUTORY LAW MARRIAGE.33<br/>3.2.0:LEGITIMATION BY SUBSEQUENT CUSTOMARY LAW MARRIAGE.36<br/>3.3.0:LEGITIMATION BY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 41<br/>3.4.0:CONCLUSION 50<br/><br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>EFFECT OF LEGITIMATION<br/>4.0.0:INTRODUCTION 51<br/>4.1.0:EFFECT OF A LEGITIMATION 51<br/>4.2.0:RIGHTS OF A LEGITIMIZED CHILD 52<br/>4.3.0:DUTIES OF A PARENT TO A LEGITIMIZED CHILD 55<br/>4.4.0:DUTIES OF A LEGITIMIZED CHILD TO THE PARENT 64<br/>4.5.0:CONSTITUTIONAL APPROACH TO LEGITIMATION 65<br/>4.6.0:CONCLUSION 67<br/><br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>GENERAL CONCLUSION<br/>5.0.0:CONCLUSION 69<br/>5.1.0:RECOMMENDATION 70<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY 73<br/>BOOKS 73.</p>\n\nA CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF LEGITIMACY AND LEGITIMATION UNDER NIGERIAN FAMILY LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF LEGITIMACY AND LEGITIMATION UNDER NIGERIAN FAMILY LAW", "id": 90}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>DUTY OF CARE: ITS IMPLICATIONS TO THE  MEDICAL PROFESSION IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Medical practice has attained sufficient status to the extent that principles of law that are relevant to Medical Practice can now be examined under the concept of Medical Law. Medical law can therefore be described as the branch</p> <p>of law dealing with Medical Practice or the Medical Profession.1</p> <p>The functions of Medical Law therefore relates to identification of  issues</p> <p>relating to or regulating the practice of Medicine 2. The essence of Medical Law or the kind of conduct required of a Medical Practitioner can be determined from the Oath of Hippocrates. This is a simple and modern declaration which a Medical practitioner makes and which he must adhere to in practice. It is meant to enable Medical and Dental Practitioners maintain a universally acceptable professional standards of practice as well as meet the</p> <p>1 Yakubu J.A, Medical Law in Nigeria, (Demyaxs Press Ltd),2002, Pg 1.</p> <p>2 (Ibid)</p> <p>1</p> <p>demands of the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria with regards to ethics</p> <p>of a professional practice 3.</p> <p>It is of importance to note that prior to the advent of the British to Nigeria, the traditional method of healing was the predominant practice. However, with the advent of the British as Nigeria’s colonial over lord, came the missionaries who not only took care of the spiritual well-being of Nigerians but also took interest in the health of the people. Maternity homes and dispensaries were</p> <p>established 4.</p> <p>It should be pointed out that our traditional medicine is becoming more recognized in Nigeria. There is no specific law regulating traditional medicine beyond the general principles relating to liability in Criminal law, the law of</p> <p>Torts and the law of Contract 5.</p> <p>The earliest indigenous medical practitioners were trained in British. Subsequently several other indigenous people travelled to various countries in</p> <p>the world for the purpose of acquiring education relating to medical practice 6</p> <p>3 (Ibid)@ p.3</p> <p>4 Ibid @ p.3</p> <p>5 Ibid @ p.3</p> <p>6 Ibid @ pg 4.</p> <p>2</p> <p>For a person to practice medicine, he must be professionally qualified through the process of University education and in accordance with the requirements of minimum standard requisite for attainment of this status. The process must be</p> <p>universally recognized &amp; accepted 7. The predominant Statute regulating</p> <p>medical practice in Nigeria is the Medical and Dental practitioner Act 8 which provides all the necessary framework for the establishment of the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria for the purpose of registration of medical practitioners and Dental Surgeons and to provide for a disciplinary tribunal for the discipline of members.</p> <p>The functions and establishment of the Dental and Medical Council of Nigeria will be discussed in the course of this Essay.</p> <p>Apart from the Medical and Dental Practitioners Act, a Medical Practitioner may also be liable criminally and may be asked to pay damages by way of civil remedy where it is discovered that the act or omission of the medical practitioner falls below expectation. Indeed in DENLOYE V MEDICAL</p> <p>PRACTITIONERS DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE9.</p> <p>7 Ibid pg 5</p> <p>8 Cap M8 Laws of Federation of Nigeria 2004.</p> <p>9 (1968) ALL N.L.R 308</p> <p>3</p> <p>The court in this case pointed out the fact that where the nature of the act or omission of a medical practitioner amount to a crime, the regular law court must determine the criminal aspect of it before liability is determined under the Medical and Dental practitioners Act with respect to misconduct or infamous conduct. Civil liability is Negligence.</p> <p>Negligence occurs when a person is said to omit to do something which a reasonable man would do when he is guided by the factors which originally regulate human conduct or when he does something which a prudent and a</p> <p>reasonable man would not do 10. It can also be defined as the breach of legal</p> <p>duty to take care which leads to damages 11.</p> <p>Liability for Medical Negligence may arise in Contract or in Tort. While the duty in Contract arises from agreement between the parties, that in Tort is independent of agreement and imposed upon the parties by the Law. The duty in Tort may also be covered by that in Contract. In most cases of Negligence against Professionals and other skilled workers, the cause of action centres</p> <p>mainly on breach of Contract. In some instances, one may also sue in tort. 12.</p> <ul><li>Aliyu V Aturu (1999) 7 NWLR pt 612 536</li> </ul> <ul><li>Okin Biscuit ltd V Osho (2004) FWLR (pt 188) 1094</li> </ul> <p>12Olusoga Olapade, Law &amp; medical practice in Nigeria, 2008 pg 107</p> <p>4</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>Duty of care can only occur when a relationship has been established with someone. In this case a doctor-patient relationship. When there is a breach of this duty, it means there is an injury which a person might have sustained at the hands of another who should have taken reasonable care not to inflict pain on the person.</p> <p>The writer has taken into cognizance that many Nigerians are affected one way or the other and legal steps are not taken to correct the wrongs, the violators of these wrongs escape liability unlike countries like America where the violators would be punished for their negligent acts. This is why the writer believes the concept of duty of care should be over-emphasized among the Medical practitioners. The effect of the breach of duty most times has stigmatized many Nigerian patients making them depressed for rest of their lives. As a result of this, this work seeks to bring an end to this attitude because so many have found themselves in this un desiring circumstances just as a result of the breach of duty from the medical practitioners.</p> <p>The liability of a Medical Practitioner covers both Criminal and Civil liability which come to play as the burden of proof. Both the Criminal and the Penal</p> <p>5</p> <p>codes which apply in the Southern &amp; Northern states of Nigeria respectively in relation to the culpability of offenders contains elaborate provisions under which cases of Medical Negligence can be prosecuted.</p> <p>However, it is obvious that the Medical practitioners owe their patients a duty of care, it is therefore expected of them to exercise that standard of care in the course of their duty.</p> <p>This work explains the nature of professional responsibility, the consequences of breach of duty, the remedies available to the victims of the breach. The work also includes the duties conferred on the patient and also the defenses available to the breach of duty.</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The general position is there is an increased rate of the breach of duty in the medical profession in our country and the objective and aim of this work is to see that the medical professionals who have defaulted in carrying out their duties to their patients must be strictly liable. Also, Nigerians should be enlightened of their rights and the need for them to seek redress once these rights have been infringed upon. It’s obvious that Negligence suits against Medical Practitioners are rare in this country compared to America &amp; Britain.</p> <p>6</p> <p>Phenomenal success will soon be achieved with the current rate of literacy, the improvement of our economic sector and also the availability of legal aid. This work also seeks to identify the reason why there is a breach of duty on the part of the medical professionals and also to examine the defences available to them after the breach.</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The focus and the limitation of the study is to examine the various Laws and Statute regulating the Ethics and the relationship between a medical practitioner and the patient.</p> <p>Also, it shall be within the focus of this project work to examine the liability of Negligence of Medical Practitioners, either they are liable in civil wrong and criminal liability.</p> <p>The main or principal Act which shall be examined in this project work is the Medical and Dental Practitioner Act cap M8 of Laws of Federation of Nigeria 2004.</p> <p>7</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This long essay focuses mainly on Duty of Care. An extensive writing will be made on the topic Duty of Care and Negligence and the consequences of breach of this duty. It also deals with the implication of the breach in the medical profession. It also calls attention to salient arrears of our law that regulates the practice of medicine in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.5.0:METHODOLOGY</p> <p>In regards to this study, materials will be drawn from sources which has been classified to primary sources and secondary sources.</p> <p>Under the primary sources, reference will be made to various textbooks on medical negligence, case books, journal and statutory enactment. Whereas, the secondary source includes the views of various scholars and articles on the concept of medical negligence.</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>This Long Essay undertakes a fresh and contemporary study of a long existing issue and for a proper establishment of this essay a plethora of authorities have been referred to. It has been noted that various authors have echoed the need</p> <p>8</p> <p>for Law to intervene whenever a breach has occurred so as to meet the needs and aspirations of the people.</p> <p>J.A Dada, in his book,13 a Nigerian author is of the view that the Legal aspects of Medical Practice in Nigeria and Medical Negligence cannot be left out. The writer of this long essay observed in his book:</p> <p>‘That a Medical Practitioner owes a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in the treatment of his patients. This duty is independent of any Contract between the Practitioner and his patient and therefore subsists regardless of whether the treatment was performed gratuitously, voluntarily or for a fee’</p> <p>From this quote the writer is made to understand that a Medical Practitioner owes a duty to exercise reasonable care regardless of whether the treatment was performed gratuitously, or for a fee. This statement is in contrast as to what a Contract means as regards a doctor-patient relationship because it says that the duty arising from the Practitioner is independent of any Contract and so therefore, if there is a breach, the Medical Practitioner will be held liable irrespective of the fact that there was no Contract.</p> <p>B.C Umerah, in his book14 is of the view that it must not be thought that a Medical Practitioner by the mere fact of the profession owes a Duty of Care to</p> <ul><li>Legal aspects of Medical Practice in Nigeria, 2002 Pg 89</li> </ul> <ul><li>Medical Practice and the Law in Nigeria, 1989 Pg 123</li> </ul> <p>9</p> <p>anyone who needs Medical aid and who can be reasonably assisted. He further said that, once a doctor undertakes to treat a patient, whether or not there is an agreement between them, a Duty of Care arises. He makes us understand here that once the Medical Practitioner undertakes to treat the patient he must exercise reasonable care in dealing with the patient.</p> <p>John Ademola Yakubu, in his book15,</p> <p>Lord Esher in HEVEN v PENDER16 stated that:</p> <p>‘Under certain circumstances one may owe a duty to another even though there is no Contract between them. If one man is near to another, or is near to the property of another, a duty lies upon him not to that which may cause personal injury to that other, or may injure his property.’</p> <p>The above principle represents the general duty of Care required at least from a consideration of the fact that the Law of Torts deals with the provision of necessary and adequate remedy where an injury has been sustained by another in circumstances not justifiable or allowed by the Law. Notwithstanding the fear that it is difficult to make a general statement defining the relations between the parties and the type of duty required in all cases, the above principles provides necessary guidance.</p> <ul><li>Medical Laws in Nigeria, 2002 Pg 33</li> </ul> <ul><li>(1883) 11 Q.B.D 503</li> </ul> <p>10</p> <p>Ibrahim Imam in his book17, he made us understand that Duty of Care has its Origin from the concept of foreseeability. Foreseeability here means that a person must not use Ordinary Care and shall in his own conduct with regard to those circumstances where he would cause danger or injury to another person. There is a duty on his part to avoid such danger.</p> <p>Kodinlinye and Aluko in their book18, in order to establish that a person has a good cause of action in Negligence, it is not sufficient for the plaintiff to show the existence of circumstances which gives rise to a rational Duty of Care to him, and he can establish this only before showing that the harm suffered by him was the reasonably forseeable consequence of the defendants conduct.</p> <p>This work provides for the Nigerian Perspective on this subject matter and its need in the system therefore, the project relied on written materials and opinions exposing the need for an urgent review of the Legal implications of the Breach of Duty in the Medical Profession.</p> <ul><li>Synoptic Guide on the Law of Torts (A handbook), 2001 pg 33</li> </ul> <ul><li>The Nigerian Law of Torts (Spectrum Law Publishing) 1996 Pg 42.</li> </ul> <p>11</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>In definitions, we must understand that every definition is as good as any other definition and every definition is as bad as any other definition.

Evidence is the means by which facts are proved excluding inferences and arguments. There are times in court when we desperately need to rely on evidence in order to prove a very vital point or issue in court. This point can be proved through the use of electronic generated documents which are believed to be in line with section 97 of the evidence act. Due to growth in technology, the use of electronic device such as computer printout, storage and communication system have risen sharply, especially in commercial and financial transactions in Nigeria and the world over which makes business communication greater in use. It would therefore be wrong for these electronic devices not to be accepted in court, if it has been valued and accepted all over the world. The thesis considers the problems posed to the admissibility of electronically generated evidence and the challenges bothering on authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of the evidence and offers solutions to the problems or challenges that electronically generated evidence is facing. The essence of the foregoing is basically to give a detailed and sufficient analysis of the subject matter. As we know tendering and taking of evidence is inevitable in court proceedings and this thesis is set to focus on the electronically generated evidence; its importance and effect in our judicial system.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>DEFINITION OF EVIDENCE</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: AN APPRAISAL OF WHAT IS EVIDENCE</p> <p>2.2.0: CLASSIFICATION OF JUDICIAL EVIDENCE</p> <p>2.3.0: RELEVANCY AND ADMISSIBILITY</p> <p>2.3.1: WHAT IS A FACT</p> <p>2.3.2: WHAT IS FACT IN ISSUE</p> <p>2.3.3: RELEVANT FACT</p> <p>2.4.0: DESCRIPTION OF AFFIDAVITS; AFFIDAVITS AND EXHIBITS</p> <p>2.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE; AN EXAMINATION.</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: EVIDENTIAL STATUS OF ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE</p> <p>3.2.0: ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE AND ITS ADMISSIBILITY</p> <p>3.3.0: ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE ADMISSIBLE WHETHER AS PRIMARY OR SECONDARY EVIDENCE<br/>3.4.0: COMPUTER GENERATED EVIDENCE</p> <p>3.4.1: ADMISSIBILITY OF COMPUTER PRINTOUT AS EVIDENCE</p> <p>3.4.2: EVIDENCE OF THINGS SEEN THROUGH TELESCOPE AND BINOCULARS</p> <p>3.4.3: TAPES, MOVIES, TELEPHONE CONVERSATION, TELEFAX AND OTHER SOUND RECORDINGS AS EVIDENCE</p> <p>3.4.4: HOW TO EXHIBIT ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE AND WEIGHT ATTACHED TO IT</p> <p>3.5.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>CHALLENGES POSED TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF ELECTRONICALLY</p> <p>GENERATED EVIDENCE</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE</p> <p>4.1.1: WAY OUT OF THE CHALLENGES</p> <p>4.2.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION.</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATIONS</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES IN JOURNAL</p> <p>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>BOOKS.</p>\n\nCRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE RELEVANCY AND ADMISSIBILITY OF ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE RELEVANCY AND ADMISSIBILITY OF ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED EVIDENCE IN NIGERIA", "id": 92}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> <strong>APPRAISAL OF TRESPASS AS A TORTIOUS ACTION UNDER THE LAW OF TORT</strong> </p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>There is no branch of law which transpires the true picture of the society more than the law of tort. The reason being that it is a branch of law that deals with the conduct of the people amongst themselves. Because of the contact people have with themselves in the environment, there are bound to be fiction which will bring about injuries or wrong whether direct or in indirect and for this reason, the law of tort is put in place to compensate persons harmed by the wrongful conduct of others.<br/>One of the major aspects of tort is Trespass. The term trespass has been used in different senses by Lawyers and laymen but the most acceptable of all is that Trespass is the unlawful interference with one`s person, land, and chattel. The law of trespass seeks to protect or compensate it`s victim and its bases is the prevention of breaches of peace. Trespass can be classified into three types namely; Trespass to Person, Trespass to Land, and Trespass to Chattel.<br/>Trespass to person is any direct and immediate interference with personal liberty which is actionable parse and it comprises of Battery, Assault, and False Imprisonment. Trespass to land is the entering upon another person`s land without permission whether forcible or not. Trespass to land can be by wrongful entry, remaining on land, placing things on land, and trespass above and beneath the surface of land. Trespass to chattel us a direct and wrongful interference in the possession of another. Conversion and Detinue come under trespass to chattel and there is no doubt that there are differences between the two even though they seem similar.<br/>This research work seeks to examine the principles of law applicable to Trespass to person, Trespass to land, and Trespass chattel which form the major classifications of Trespass with a view to enlightening the general public. Moreover, there are cases where a person may seek to justify his actions. Such justifications in law are known as defences. These defences shall be examined in the course of this research work.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>INTERVIEWS AND PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>TRESPASS TO PERSON</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: BATTERY</p> <p>2.2.0: ASSAULT</p> <p>2.3.0: FALSE IMPRISONMENT</p> <p>2.4.0: DEFENCE OF PERSON OR PROPERTY</p> <p>2.4.1: DEFENCE OF CONSENT</p> <p>2.4.2: DEFENCE OF LAWFUL ARREST</p> <p>2.5.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>TRESPASS TO LAND</p> <p>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0: TRESPASS BY WRONGFUL ENTRY</p> <p>3.2.0: TRESPASS BY REMAINING ON LAND</p> <p>3.3.0: TRESPASS BY PLACING THINGS ON LAND</p> <p>3.4.0: TRESPASS ABOVE AND BENEATH THE SURFACE OF LAND</p> <p>3.5.0: INTERFERENCE WITH POSSESSION</p> <p>3.6.0: DOES SELF-HELP CONSTITUTE A VALID DEFENCE?</p> <p>3.7.0: DEFENCE OF LICENCE</p> <p>3.7.1: DEFENCE OF JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>3.8.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>TRESPASS TO CHATTEL</p> <p>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0: TRESPASS ACTIONABLE PERSE</p> <p>4.2.0: CONVERSION</p> <p>4.2.1: CONVERSION BY TAKING</p> <p>4.2.2: CONVERSION BY USING</p> <p>4.2.3: CONVERSION BY WRONGFUL TRANSFER OF TITLE</p> <p>4.2.4: CONVERSION BY DETENTION</p> <p>4.3.0: DETINUE</p> <p>4.4.0: DEFENCE</p> <p>4.5.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION.</p>\n\nAPPRAISAL OF TRESPASS AS A TORTIOUS ACTION UNDER THE LAW OF TORT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPRAISAL OF TRESPASS AS A TORTIOUS ACTION UNDER THE LAW OF TORT", "id": 93}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>    <strong>ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN NIGERIAN COURTS: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS</strong> </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The topic “ Administration of justice in Nigerian courts, problems and prospects” seems to attract to itself the attention and inquisitiveness on the part of the common man or every believer in the Rule of law of what the writer is talking about or what he is going to upon since the mere mention of justice in our society today raises a conjecture and thereafter suffers from universally acceptable definition.</p> <p>An attempt is made in this essay to scrutinize what hampers the judicial powers vested in the courts under section 6(6)(b) of 1999 constitution which it is said shall extend to all matters between persons, or between government or authority and to any person in Nigeria, and to all actions and proceedings relating thereto, for the determination of any question as to the civil rights and obligations of that person.</p> <p>Also considered in the essay are the ‘defects’ in and/ or ‘injustices’ written into the substantive law. For instance the ouster of court’s jurisdiction, the down payment or deposit of a substantial amount of money paid into a court before a challenge to chieftaincy dispute is entertained, discrimination on the grounds of protection to the public officers of the state and the adoption of foreign culture and archaic statutes that were largely meant to nurture a colonial society among others are written into or found in the basic law of the state , then it is not possible to talk of justice under such a system. Sometimes a system fails because of procedural defects and inadequacies. When there exists structural injustice in the location of courts (for instance a poor litigant resides share, Kwara state and the Supreme courts is located in Abuja) and there is imbalance in the distribution of wealth in the society, there, the law is easily seen as instrument of oppression and a protection of the status quo.</p> <p>The above issues and some other interesting topics like the role or the part played by some agencies like the police, the Bar and the prison in the prosecution of cases will be considered in this essay and provide an avenue for the assessment of their performance in the administration of justice.</p> <p>The independence of the judiciary is not left untouched as it is a necessary adjunct to the proper administration of justice.</p> <p>The essay finally attempts to offer some useful suggestions and recommendations to arrest the ills plaguing our society today, as some stemmed from both internal and global structural ‘injustices’.

The Nigerian political history dated back to the pre-colonial era. The various  ethnic groups had one form or system of political and judicial set up that were distinct and peculiar to each ethnic group.</p> <p>This essay gives us the background of Nigeria judicial system before independent. In the Northern part of Nigeria there was well established monarchical form of government, and its judicial system was based on the shariah which was strongly influenced by Islam. The Yoruba of the south west of Nigeria equally had a monarchical form of government [based on the cultural set up of the society] and the judicial system was based on the royal court of the “Obas”. The South East had a lose form of government based  on community headship of splinter groups without a central power as it was the case in the north and south west of the country,</p> <p>While the judicial system was the same “Communal market system of adjudication”.</p> <p>The prominent judicial system in the North was the “Alkali courts” presided over by the Emirs or the Alkalis [judges] who were very versatile in shariah law. The South west had courts similar with those in the North which were based on the traditions, customs and practices of the area, these were called “kotu oba or kotu Asipa” depending on who was the presiding judge.</p> <p>This project also points out that the judiciary continued to build up its standard from this period up to when the country attained its independence in 1960.</p> <p>One can conveniently insinuate that the success of the judiciary today had been laid long time ago by founding fathers. Also this essay shed more light on what prevalent in Nigeria is the fact that which ever way a court judgment sway, it is always construed by parties on both sides as either the victory for the rule of  law[in a win case] and perversion of justice[on the losing side] but all these is human frailties. This is no way an indictment of the judges or the process of adjudication.            Thus this is an eye opener to the issues of administration of justice in Nigerian courts.</p> <p>Also this project examines definitions that are more encompassing but that do not make it to be generally acceptable to all. But few of them are considered below.</p> <p>The Black’s Law Dictionary1 defines the word “Administration” thus:-</p> <p><em>“</em>Management or performance of the executive duties of a government, institution, or business. In public law, the practical management and direction of the executive department and its agencies. A judicial action in which a court undertakes the management and distribution of property….”</p> <p>The living Webster encyclopedic dictionary of the English language defines the same word “Administration” as:-</p> <p><em>“The act of administering; direction, management; government of public affairs; the executive functions of the government; the persons, collectively, who are entrusted with such functions, and their period of being in office….”</em></p> <p>Administration is like a diamond having many facets. The facet would concentrate upon or concern ourselves with in this essay is that one that relates to justice. What then is justice? This is an arduous task, as there is no universally acceptable definition of the term or word “justice”. It varies from person to person, from author to author, from country to country e. t. c.</p> <p>According to Black’s law dictionary, justice means: “to do justice, to see justice done, to summon one to do justice”.</p> <p>While the living Webster encyclopedic dictionary defines it as:-</p> <p><em>“Equitableness, unprejudiced adjudication of conflicting interests on the on the basis of legal or moral principles lawfulness; what is rightly due; government judiciary department….”</em></p> <p>It is submitted that the former seems not to have given a satisfactory definition of what justice is. While the latter seems to have given the attributes of justice in relation to its dispensation by the judicial arm of government which is charged with the responsibility of adjudication over conflicting interests between persons, or between government and any person and resolving same based on legal and moral principles.</p> <p>Also, Daniel Webster made an interesting incursion at defining justice when he said that it is:</p> <p>“The ligament which holds civilized beings and civilized nations together”</p> <p>The above attempt attracts to itself some fundamental questions that need be resolved in the favor of the definition before it could stand the test of time. Is the ligament that of the weak or the strong? Is Nigeria a civilized nation with civilized beings? Can militarism come under a civilized nation or restricted to democratic set-up? Is it the imposition of the foreign laws on her that colonized her? Is her membership of international organization qualifying Nigeria to be a civilized nation? What if there is non-compliance with the charter to be injustice in Nigeria has subscribed to? Does that make anything done in breach of the provision of the charter to be injustice in Nigeria or to that organization? The next question is : can the interest of the society be taken into consideration when we talk of the society be taken into consideration when we talk of justice or that of individual alone? This reminds one of the concept of justice as given by an eminent jurist, Oputa  J. S. C. (As he then was)in GODWIN JOSIAH V. THE STATE  that :-</p> <p><em>“Justice is not a one- way traffic. It is not justice for the appellant only. Justice is not even, only a two-way traffic. It is justice for the appellant accused of a heinous crime of murder; it is justice for the victim, the murdered man, i.e. the deceased ‘whose blood is crying to high heavens for vengeance’; and finally it is justice for the society at large- the society whose social norms and values had been desecrated and broken by the criminal act complained of…. That justice which seeks only to protect the appellant will not be even-handed justice…. But justice sacrificed at the shrine of guilt”.</em></p><p> <strong>1.1.0:   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>Nigeria is a very large country with very high percentage of citizens many of whom goes to court to ventilate their grievances at the slightest provocation, excuse or justification. But most of them are faced with ouster clause[s], where the jurisdiction of the court is not ousted, there might be difficulty of meeting the phenomenal cost of litigation, payment of court fees, summons fees, the payment for records of proceedings including cases going on appeal, the payment of lawyers fees and disobedience to court orders, all these pit falls identified call for changes which form the inspiration for writing this project.</p><p> <strong>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <ol><li>To examine the duty which every judge or lawyer owes to the society at large in putting across proposals to change the law where appropriate in order to bring it in line with justice.</li> <li>To identify that a very great proportion of what goes on in the Nigerian law courts is the administration of justice between one citizen and another and between a citizen and the state and to these ends, to continue to maintain a delicate balance between the competing interests so that the end of justice can be properly served.</li> <li>To identify the power of the judge to punish for contempt is not only for the protection of the court of justice but also for preservation of justice and administration.</li> <li>To observe that the judge should not use his contempt powers to suppress methods of advocacy and should therefore exercise great restraints in punishing lawyers for contempt of court. After all, judges and lawyers are partners in the administration of justice.</li> <li>To observe at every available opportunity that justice delayed is justice denied.</li> <li>To determine always that a really independent judiciary depends on the intellectual calibre and the qualities of character of the bar from which the judges are drawn or appointed.</li> <li>To identify  that all the citizens of Nigeria –whether they are young or old , rich or poor, literate or illiterate, high or low, muslim or Christian, pagan or agnostic, are all equal before the law.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>This project is set to examine the problems in the administration of justice in Nigeria at large. It focuses on the problems and prospects of our judicial system. An overview is also given on how jurist and judges and foreign jurist have helped to influence or resolve the issue or problems in Nigeria.</p><p> <strong>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>This project covers a range of subject peculiar to the administration of justice in Nigeria. It covers the historical evolution of judicial system before the colonial intervention. It also covers the procedural problems in the administration of justice, Institutional problems in the administration of justice, Independence of the judiciary in all the courts in Nigeria generally. These are the aspects to be covered in this project.</p><p> <strong>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</strong> </p> <p>The research method employed for writing this project covers useful materials from both primary and secondary sources of law. The primary sources to be used are Acts of legislation, constitution of the federal Republic Of Nigeria 1999, criminal procedure code, penal code, criminal code, other primary sources are judicially decided cases and those cases from the Ombudsman as seen in some foreign countries. Secondary sources of law there are to be used include text books both from Nigerian legal system and administrative law, as well as published works on administration of justice. Other  secondary sources are well researched from the internet, journals periodicals and news papers all of which are expected to add value to the quality of the work.</p><p> 1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW </p> <p>Quite a number of authors both in the legal profession and public service have written extensively on the issue of justice, problems and prospects .some remarkable articles and publications of some of these authors will be reviewed below.

It is justice for the appellant accused of a heinous crime of murder; it is justice for the victim , the murdered man , i.e the deceased whose blood is crying for vengeance ; and finally it is justice for the society at large – the society whose social norms and values had been desecrated and broken by the criminal act complained of … That justice which seeks         only to protect the appellant will not be even-handed justice… But justice sacrificed at the shrine of guilt.</p> <p>LORD DENNING .A The Road To Justice (1955) p.4 Wrote on justice and He said justice is not something you can see. It is not the product         of his intellect but of his spirit.

This has been beneficial for international business purposes, especially in the petroleum sector and has ensured stable revenue which is then distributed amongst the individual states in the country; while some countries like the USA recognize both state and individual ownership. Associated with exploration and exploitation activities of most natural resources is environmental degradation, which puts the environment in a non-usable position. There is therefore a need to reduce the effect of these activities. With increasing Environmental damage from the international oil companies, which has not been properly addressed by the government in countries like Nigeria, individuals have began to opt for control of their resources rather than leaving them in the control of the government. This paper aims at analyzing the effect of resource ownership by the government of a state, using Nigeria as a case study and whether the Shairah rules as established in the four juristic schools of Islamic taught can avail Nigeria from the problem of resource control agitation by the people.</p> <p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0     INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2     OBJECTIVE S OF STUDY</p> <p>1.3     FOCUS OF STUDY</p> <p>1.4     SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.5     METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6     LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8    CONCLUSION</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO:</strong></p> <p>LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER SHARIAH</p> <p>2.0     INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1     STATE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIA</p> <p>2.2     INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER SHARIAH</p> <p>2.3     CONCLUSION</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE:</strong></p> <p>LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE NIGERIAN</p> <p>STATUTE</p> <p>3.0     INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1     OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES IN PRE-INDEPENDENCE NIGERIA</p> <p>3.2    OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES IN POST INDEPENDENCE NIGERIA</p> <p>3 .3   CONCLUSION</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:</strong></p> <p>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIAH AND THE NIGERIAN STATUTE</p> <p>4.0    INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1     COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF MINERALS UNDER THE SHARIAH AND NIGERIA STATUTE</p> <p>4.2    COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIAH AND NIGERIAN STATUTE</p> <p>4.3    CONCLUSION</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE:</strong></p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0   CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1   RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLE IN JOURNALS BOOKS</p> <p>CHAPTERS IN BOOKS.</p>\n\nOWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIAH AND NIGERIAN STATUTE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIAH AND NIGERIAN STATUTE", "id": 95}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT OF ARTIFICIALLY INSEMINATED CHILD TO INHERIT UNDER ISLAMIC LAW</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The advancement in Science and Technology and the quest for children led to the development and invention of a new process of human procreation, (Artificial Insemination) other than the natural way. This process involves obtaining the semen from a man to inseminate a woman in other to induce fertilization and produce a child, if Allah so wishes. Sometimes, the semen is obtained from the woman‟s husband and many a time from a donor (third party). However, the conception of a child through the medium of artificial insemination involving married couples may not generate any issue or problem with regards to paternity and right of inheritance under Islamic Law if such semen is that of the legal husband of a valid Muslim marriage. On the other hand, conception of a child through the donor‟s (third party) semen is definitely accomplished with the problems of paternity, the right of the child so conceived to inherit under the Law; and even raises doubts on the legality of the processes of artificial insemination. I cannot be able to provide in this project, adequate knowledge of the whole segments of the subject-matter as perfection belongs to Him alone (Allah), the knower of all things, but it is equally hoped that this project will go a very long way to sensitize the vast majority of our people on the issue of artificial insemination. Hence, this research among other things discussed therein, critically examines the legality of Artificial Insemination in line with the provisions of Islamic Law and also the implications of such insemination on the status of the child conceived there from as well as his right of inheritance under Islamic Law.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong></p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0 OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0 FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0 METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0 LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0 CONCLUSION</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER 2</strong></p> <p>AN OVERVIEW OF THE ISLAMIC LAW OF INHERITANCE</p> <p>2.0.0 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0   DEFINITION OF INHERITANCE</p> <p>2.2.0 INHERITANCE BEFORE THE ADVENT OF ISLAM</p> <p>2.3.0 INHERITANCE AFTER THE ADVENT OF ISLAM</p> <p>2.4.0 PRELIMINARIES/ESSENTIALS OF LEGACY DISTRIBUTION</p> <p>2.5.0 CONCLUSION</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER 3</strong></p> <p>SUCCINT ANALYSIS OF THE ISLAMIC CONCEPT OF INHERITANCE</p> <p>3.0.0 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.0 GROUNDS OF INHERITANCE</p> <p>3.1.1 BLOOD RELATIONSHIP (NASAB)</p> <p>3.1.2 MARRIAGE (NIKKAH)</p> <p>3.1.3 EMANTICIPATION OF SLAVE (WILÁ’U)</p> <p>3.1.4 MUSLIM TREASURY</p> <p>3.2.0 THE STIPULATED BENCHMARKS OF INHERITANCE</p> <p>3.2.1 DEATH OF THE PRAEPOSITUS</p> <p>3.2.2 SURVIVAL OF THE HIER</p> <p>3.2.3 RELATIONSHIP OF THE HIER TO THE DECEASED</p> <p>3.3.0 IMPEDIMENTS TO SUCCESSION</p> <p>3.4.0 CONCLUSION</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER 4</strong></p> <p>ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION; ITS LEGALITY UNDER ISLAMIC LAW</p> <p>4.0.0 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.0 DEFINITION OF ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION</p> <p>4.2.0 FORM/METHODS OF ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION</p> <p>4.2.1 HOMOLOGOUS ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION</p> <p>4.2.2 HETEROLOGOUS ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION BY DONOUR (AID)</p> <p>4.2.3 INVITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF)</p> <p>4.3.0 THE POSITION OF ISLAMIC LAW ON ARTIFICIAL  INSEMINATION</p> <p>4.4.0 STATUS OF THE CHILD AND THE RIGHT OF INHERITANCE</p> <p>4.5.0 CONCLUSION</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER 5</strong></p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0 CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0 RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS</p> <p>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>BOOKS</p> <p>PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE CONFERENCES, WORKSHOPS AND</p> <p>SEMINARS.</p>\n\nCRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT OF ARTIFICIALLY INSEMINATED CHILD TO INHERIT UNDER ISLAMIC LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT OF ARTIFICIALLY INSEMINATED CHILD TO INHERIT UNDER ISLAMIC LAW", "id": 96}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CONFESSION OF ONE OF THE ACCUSED PERSON AGAINST ANOTHER PERSON IN COMMON AND ISLAMIC LAW</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Under the two laws, confession is a statement by suspect in crime which is adverse to that person. It is a form of evidence that is acceptable because of its objectivities. Confessional statement is admissible in any proceedings as long as it is made to a person in authority and it is relevant to the matter in issue. Confession of an accused may be excluded if the person who made such statement was oppressed. The persons who can make confessions are the accused or co-defendant. Thus, a conviction could be based upon confessional statement of an accused.<br/>Confession of one of the accused person against another, in common and Islamic law does not have practicable effect because confession as a principle of law is only used in the law of criminal evidence where by the statement of an accused strictly binds him alone and not his co-defendant except if the co-defendant adopt such statement that has been made by the accused, except this, the accused confessional statement cannot be used against any other person.<br/>However, despite this similarity between the two concepts there are still areas of differences that linger on between the concepts.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS </strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p>

<p>Homosexuality is romantic or sexual attraction or behavior between members of the same sex or gender.  As an orientation, homosexuality refers to “an enduring pattern of or disposition to experience sexual, affectionate, or romantic attractions” primarily or exclusively to people of the same sex; “it also refers to an individual’s sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions, behaviours expressing them, and membership in a community of others who share them.” [1]</p> <p>Homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation, along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, within the heterosexual-homosexual continuum (with sexuality sometimes considered a fourth).  Scientific and medical understanding is that sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather a complex interplay of biological and environmental factors, especially with regard to early uterine environment.[2]  While there are those who still hold the view that homosexual activity is “unnatural” or “dysfunctional”[3] research has shown that homosexuality is an example of normal variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects.  Prejudice and discrimination against homosexual and bisexual people, however, have been shown to cause psychological harm.[4]</p> <p>The most common terms for homosexual people are lesbian for females and gay for males, though gay is also used to refer generally to both homosexual males and females.  The number of people as gay or lesbian and the proportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiences – are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons.[5]  According to major studies, 2% to 10% of people have had some form of same-sex sexual contact within their lifetime.[6]  In a 2006 study, 20% of respondents anonymously reported some homosexual feelings, although only 2-3% identified themselves as homosexual.  Homosexual behavior is also observed in many non-human animal species.[7]</p> <p>Many gay and lesbian people are in committed same-sex relationships, though only recently have census forms and political conditions facilitated their visibility and enumeration.[8]  These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects.[9]  Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred.  Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a global movement towards increased visibility, recognition and legal rights for homosexual people, including the rights to marriage and civil unions, adoption and parenting, employment, military service, equal access to health care, and the introduction of anti-bullying legislation to protect LGBT minors.</p> <p>Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death.</p> <p>In a detailed compilation of historical and ethnographic materials of Preindustrial Cultures, “strong disapproval of homosexuality was reported for 41% of 42 cultures; it was accepted or ignored by 21%, and 12% reported no such concept.  Of 70 ethnographies, 59% reported homosexuality absent or rare in frequency and 41% reported it present or not uncommon.”[10]</p> <p>In cultures influenced by Abrahamic religions, the law and the church established sodomy as a transgression against divine law or a crime against nature.  The condemnation of anal sex between males, however, predates Christian belief.  It was frequent in ancient Greece; “unnatural” can be traced back to Plato.[11]</p> <p>Many historical figures, including Socrates, Lord Byron, Edward II, and Hadrian,[12] have had terms such as gay or bisexual applied to them; some scholars, such as Michael Foucault, have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary construction of sexuality foreign to their times, though others challenge this.[13] [1] Case No. S147999 in the Supreme Court of the State of California, in re Marriage Cases Judicial Council

As a social institution, marriage is founded and governed by the social and religious norms of society. Therefore, the sanctity of marriage is a well-accepted principle in the world community. Marriage is the root of family and society. However, by looking at the types of marriage in Nigeria, therefore, unlike most European countries two marriage systems are recognized in Nigeria, namely, monogamous and polygamous. These two marriage systems differ fundamentally from character and incidents. It is therefore important to take this duality into account in any consideration of marriage laws in Nigeria in order to avoid confusion. In all cases concerning marriage, the lawyer in Nigeria must first determine the type of marriage involved before he can apply the appropriate law. However, monogamous marriage is Nigeria is the same as in England. It is marriage that Lord Pensance called voluntary union for the life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, whereas polygamous marriage can be defined as a voluntary union for life of a man with one or more wives (Cottrell, 2013). Its essential characteristic is the ability of the man to take as many women as he wants. The mere fact that he has at one time only one woman does not affect the character of the marriage as long as the capacity to take more women is preserved. Generally, there is no limit to the number of wives a husband could take under the polygamous system. It always depends on its affluence.</p> <p>Marriage is an institution that represents all the behaviors, norms, roles, expectations and values ​​associated with the legal union of a person or a union of persons who are most often of the opposite sex involving a man and a woman. This is one of the major events in life that marks the transition to mature adult life and represents a lifelong commitment of two people to each other.</p> <p>As a system, marriage is carrying out, following a series of colossal procedures as practiced and understood by the cultures of the parties concerned. Different communities recognize patterns and types of marriages according to their cultural / social worldview. Nigeria, as part of the wider African society, has been generally characterized by arranged marriages, polygamous marriages and others. Old tribal traditions disappear and more Nigerians adopt Western marriage concepts. This trend has led to an unprecedented increase in customary law marriage in Nigeria. Boateng, cited in Ardayfio-Schandorf, observed that family origins and ethnic origins that were of considerable importance in the traditional practice of marriage were replaced by love and affection between partners.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The dynamics of culture and human relations allowed researchers to observe many influences, manifestations and occurrences in marriage within Nigerian society. These manifestations and occurrences have had a significant impact on the stability of marriage in modern Nigerian society. A recent observation of people’s attitudes towards marriages in the country has revealed the alarming negative effect of these events (Animasahun and Fatile 2011). The factors that militate against the quality of marriage in Nigerian society of the 21st century have been the subject of discussions between Nigerian social psychologists, religious authorities, behavioral psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists.</p> <p>However, substantial research has reinforced cultural differences as a source of instability, conflict or dissatisfaction for couples, rather than an opportunity for transformation. Many conclude that intercultural couples are confronted with higher levels of marital challenges; Are more prone to failure; and are rooted in conflicts related to dormant allegiances of worldview, family structures and models of communication. This work explores the dynamics that promote the legal effects of customary marriage in marriages in Nigeria to determine the prospects for these marriages in the 21st century. It also shows that intercultural marriages offer opportunities for a positive transformation of the negative tendency of marriages rather than widespread opinions that present them as intrinsically problematic.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of the contemporary study was to examine the legal effects of customary law marriage in Nigeria. The specific objectives of this study are:</p> <ol><li>To define marriage, types of marriage in Nigeria.</li> </ol> <ol><li>To identify the types of customary law marriage in Nigeria and the requirement for a valid customary law marriage in Nigeria.</li> </ol> <ul><li>Examine the legal effect of customary law marriage and the effects of contacting statutory marriage with the same person and with a 3rd party.</li> </ul> <ol><li>Explore the legitimacy of children of customary law marriage, rights of women in intestate succession and the resolution of customary law marriage in Nigeria.</li> </ol> <ol><li>Make recommendations that will help solve the problems of inter-cultural marriages.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The contribution of this study to Nigerian society cannot be overemphasized. This survey aims to bridge the gap in the existing literature on customary marriages in Nigeria. Most books on the subject do not provide a sufficient theoretical framework for customary marriage.</p> <p>The study will also provide information to future spouses, families and adults who need to learn about the legal effects of customary marriage in Nigeria. The study will be useful to future researchers on the subject. It will complement the many literatures on the subject in the Library. The work will be useful to posterity. Ethnic families may want to learn strategies to deal with any threat of polygamous conflict in their marriages and life.</p> <p><strong>1.5 The Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>The study will cover the whole of Nigeria. The marriage of customary law throughout the study is seen from the point of view of the Yoruba, marrying Igbo, Efik or Hausa, etc., or vice versa. This work not only examines the concept of marriage, but takes a step forward in identifying the problems that affect customary marriage in Nigeria. It also highlights the effects of these problems as well as traces the future of customary marriage law in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Research Methodology</strong></p> <p>The methodology used in this study is the historical research method. It used primary and secondary data collection sources. Since marriage is universally recognized as the basis of group life and as a requirement for human survival, primary sources of data collection would be drawn from oral interviews of respondents as a reliable means of understanding individual perception of the subject. The legal effects of customary marriage in Nigeria have attracted the attention of a considerable body of literature.</p> <p>This study would examine relatively recent publications in books, newspaper articles and unpublished theses relevant to the study data that would be collected, organized and analyzed critically.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Marriage</strong></p> <p>The term “marriage” as well as culture does not lend itself to a universal definition. Marriage is seen as a close partnership of two different people of opposite sex who have concerted to live and work together as one entity.</p> <p><strong>Neolocal Residence</strong></p> <p>The neolocal residence is a type of conjugal residence where a couple establishes an independent domestic unit after marriage. In this type of residence, the couple does not live with their parents; Rather than they live with each other.</p> <p><strong>Matrifocal Family</strong></p> <p>The conjugal family is a family that is centered on a woman and her children. In this case, the fathers (s) of these children are present intermittently in the life of the family and occupy a secondary place. The mother of the child is not necessarily the wife of one of the children’s fathers.</p> <p><strong>Matrilocal Residence</strong></p> <p>The matrilocal residence refers to the domicile in a group whose core includes the mother of the bride. In this type of conjugal residence, the couple lives with the mother of the bride.</p> <p><strong>Patrilocal Residence</strong></p> <p>The patrilocal residence is a type of conjugal residence where the nucleus revolves around the father of the groom. A patrifocal family is a family centered on the man and family of his father.</p> <p> James A., “Marital Status and the Risk of Suicide,” American Journal of Public Health : 78-80,  2012</p> <p> Jack C.

For the next 80 days, nobody heard from or saw the federal republic of Nigeria. Even the vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, could not give any reasonable report of the president’s whereabouts. The activities of the federal executive council became suddenly shrouded and ambiguous. As expected, question about the whereabouts and status of the president began to fly at the national assembly, the judiciary and the federal executive council.<br/>The attendant issues that emanated from this situation led to a very tensed period of fierce constitutional arguments by different quarters, especially from legal practitioners, scholars, authors and most especially, the media who put up quite a show fielding all sorts of rumors and speculations.<br/>The purpose of this thesis therefore, is to critically appraise the all the constitutional issues that emanated from the Yar’Adua’s saga. In view of this, the office of the president would be critically examined, together with his powers and obligations in relation to section 144 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. Also, the obligation of the Federal Executive Council, the National Assembly and the Judiciary would be examined too.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>TABLE OF CASES</p> <p>TABLE OF STATUTES</p> <p>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY</p> <p>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>1.8.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>APPRAISAL OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2.1.0: THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.1.1.0: THE PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.1.1.1: THE VICE PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.2.1: QUALIFICATION AND NOMINATION OF THE CANDIDATES CONTESTING FOR THE OFFICE OF THESE OFFICES</p> <p>2.2.2: GROUNDS FOR THE DISQUALIFICATION OF CANDIDATE</p> <p>2.2.3: TENURE OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.2.4: PROVISION FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE TENURE OF THIS OFFICE</p> <p>2.2.5: DEATH, INCAPACITATION OF THE OF THE PRESIDENT ELECT BEFORE OATH OF OFFICE</p> <p>2.2.6: DUTIES, POWERS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT</p> <p>2.2.7: REMOVAL OF THE PRESIDENT FROM OFFICE</p> <p>2.3.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>IMPLICATIONS OF THE ABSENCE OF THE PRESIDENT FROM OFFICE</p> <p>3.1.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>3.1.1: THE ABSENCE OF PRESIDENT MUSA YAR’ADUA FROM OFFICE</p> <p>3.2.0: THE LEGISLATURE IN RESPECT OF THE OF THE YAR’ADUA’S CASE</p> <p>3.2.1: THE POSITION OF THE JUDICIARY</p> <p>3.2.2: THE POSITION OF AUTHORS AND SCHOLARS</p> <p>3.30: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>AN EXAMINATION OF THE PRESIDENT YAR’ADUA’S CASE</p> <p>4.1.0: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>4.1.1.0: PERMANENT INCAPACITY OF THE PRESIDENT</p> <p>4.1.1.1.: MEANING AND AN EXAMINATION OF PRESIDENT YAR’ADUA’S MEDICAL CONDITION</p> <p>4.2.0: THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL</p> <p>4.2.1: AT WHAT POINT DOES THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL PASSES THE RESOLUTION DECLARING THE PRESIDENT INCAPACITATED</p> <p>4.3.0: A CRITIQUE OF THE MUSA YAR’ADUA’S CASE</p> <p>4.4.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p> <p>GENERAL CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.0.0: CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS</p> <p>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET</p> <p>BOOKS</p> <p>NEWSPAPER REPORTS</p> <p>NEWSPAPER REPORT ON THE INTERNET.</p>\n\nA CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SECTION 144 OF THE 1999 CONSTITUTION: MUSA YAR’ADUA AS A CASE STUDY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SECTION 144 OF THE 1999 CONSTITUTION: MUSA YAR’ADUA AS A CASE STUDY", "id": 100}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTORY ASPECTS</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></li> </ul> <p>The concept of WILLS is of great importance. This concept originated from the Roman Law and was passed on to English Law from where the nations of the Commonwealth accepted it as part of the received English Law. Its origin lies in the fact that it was thought highly desirable to actualize the wishes of a dying person as a legal and binding obligation. This involved the person who came to make a wish which was later named the TESTATOR as well as the person(s) to carry out those wishes who came to be known as executor(s). And lastly, it involved those who had to benefit from those legacies, being simply called the beneficiaries or more technically referred to an <em>CESTIUS QUE TRUST.</em></p> <p>A Will therefore is three-pronged thus:</p> <p>TESTATOR</p> <p>BENEFICIARIES                                           EXECUTORS/TRUSTEES</p> <p>It is beyond dispute that one great concern of a property owner is that he naturally wants to know what will happen to his property when he dies. Ordinarily, he will want to provide for his family and one sure way of doing so is that his houses, farms etc should descend to them after his death. It is from a Will therefore, that the property owner’s dream will be achieved. And for the Will to be enforceable, it must be in accordance with the stipulated requirements.</p> <p><strong>1.1    THE LEGAL PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>Will making remains a popular and even necessary practice because the old law of intestate succession was felt to be unsatisfactory. To make a valid Will, a person must be in his or her right mind. A person also must be of full age, that is to say, be twenty-one years old, and must state his wishes in writing, signed by himself and attested by two witnesses, who sign their names at the foot or end of the document in his presence and in the presence  of each other. The witnesses too must be of full age and in their right mind. Thus, in an indirect way, the impartiality of the witnesses is as far as possible ensured.</p> <p>The interpretation of Wills has given rise to untold litigation, and the rules and principles that have been developed in the resultant case law fill many volumes of abstruse and intricate doctrine. The main legal problem therefore centers around the animosity that flows from different interested parties who appear to be aggrieved because of the content of the Will thereby giving rise to different interpretation of the Will.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Research has found that there are so many people eager to know more about Wills. The thirst for knowledge about Wills is on the increase. A property owner will naturally want to know what will become of his property after his demise, and ordinarily would want to cater for his remnants after his demise. This will lead to a preparation of a Will.</p> <p>It is not enough for a Will to be made because some Wills could be declared invalid based on certain inconsistencies (this will be shown in further discuss). Therefore, to have a Valid Will, one must have in mind the requisites of a Valid Will.</p> <ul><li><strong>RATIONALE AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul> <p>The importance of Wills in the life of a people cannot be overestimated. Death is an inevitable end of earthly life. We are living witnesses to the destruction of family units at the end of the patriarch’s life due to disagreement over inheritance. Homes have been broken and scattered, children and relations have become mortal enemies in their struggle to share the properties of the deceased.</p> <p>While it may be true that because of the feud and unending litigation that sometimes attend some Wills, some of the people have become scared about Wills, the overwhelming majority are thirsty for knowledge about Wills. They want to know why they ought to make Wills and their advantages over other manners of disposition of property in consideration of death.</p> <p>This research work is meant to be a guideline on how to make Wills that will stand the test of time.</p> <p><strong>1.4    SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY  </strong></p> <p>The scope of this research work is to enunciate more on Wills, and also lay down the essential factors that will make a Will valid, or invalid. These factors shall be analysed critically.         </p> <p><strong>1.5    DATA COLLECTION AND METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Data collection for the purpose of this research work is wholly from library work which comprise a search in textbooks and jurist opinion.</p> <p><strong>1.6    LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>WHAT IS A WILL?</strong></p> <p>Generally, the word “WILL” may mean an instrument, or it may mean all the testamentary document by which a testators property is disposed off, or devised.</p> <p>According to Osborne, a Will is a disposition by which the person making it (the testator) provides for the distribution or administration of (his) property after his death. It is always revocable.</p> <p>A Will according to Swinburne2 is a lawful disposition of that which any would have done after his death.</p> <p>Black Stone defines the Will as “The legal declaration of a man intention which he Wills to be performed after his death”.</p> <p>The celebrated nineteenth century English writer Jarman4 says:</p> <p>A Will is an instrument by which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his decease, and which is in its nature ambulatory and revocable during his lifetime.</p> <p>In the words of P.T. Afangideh5, a WILL is a legal instrument for the transfer of property or obligations from the testator to the beneficiaries through the medium of Executors, which transfer is ineffectual until the death of the testator. A WILL therefore, is a law, a decree, a testament made by the testator on matters touching and concerning his estate, family and future.</p> <p>WILLS according to the Blacks Law Dictionary is defined as a document by which a person gives his or her estate to be distributed upon death.</p> <p>A WILL is a creation of statute. For it to be valid, it must comply strictly with the provisions of the relevant statute. The courts are strict in the observance of statutory prescriptions on Wills.</p> <p>Scarman J. in <strong><em>Re Fuld (Deceased)</em></strong> clarifies the position succinctly as follows:</p> <p>Darkness and suspicion are common features in WILL cases: Because it is often difficult, and sometimes impossible to discover the truth, the law insists on two types of safeguards in WILL cases. The first type of safeguard is part of the substantive law – the requirements of proper form and due execution. Such requirements …are no mere technicalities. They are the first line of defence against fraud upon the death. The second type of safeguard is the second line of defence. It is invoked when there are circumstances which give rise to suspicion: it is the safeguard of strict proof. In case where no suspicion reasonably arises, the court will allow inferences, presumptions as they are sometimes called, to be drawn from the regularity of a testamentary instrument upon its face, or the fact of the execution. But if there are circumstances, whatever be their nature, which reasonably give rise to suspicion, the court must be on its guard. It must ensure that the burden of proof rests upon the party propounding the WILL: and he must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded is the last WILL of a free and capable testator”.</p> <p>Over the years, the courts had devised as indicated above by Scarman J, a long line of authorities to ensure that no fraud was perpetrated against the wishes of the testator and, in fact, the WILL was made by him voluntarily when he possessed full capacity to make it.</p> <p>In summary, a WILL will be given a working and functional definition which will graphically bring out and bear out the dictum of his Lordship in the aforementioned case thus:</p> <p>It is a testamentary and revocable document, voluntarily made, executed and witnessed according to law by a testator with sound disposing mind wherein he disposes of his property subject to any limitation imposed by law and wherein he gives such other directives as he may deem fit to his personal representatives otherwise known as his executors, who administer his estate in accordance with the wishes manifested in the WILL.</p>\n\nTHE PREREQUISITES OF A VALID WILL; A CRITICAL ANALYSIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PREREQUISITES OF A VALID WILL; A CRITICAL ANALYSIS", "id": 101}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INVESTIGATE A SURVEY ON THE AFTERCARE SERVICE AND REINTEGRATION OF EX-CONVICTS IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Laws are made in every society to regulate the behaviour of people and to ensure that individual live according to expectation of the society. However, crimes are committed in the society daily. Once convicted, criminals are imprisoned. The Nigeria prisons service is charged with the responsibility to keep convicts. It keeps custody, reform, rehabilitate and reintegrate offenders. The extent to which they have been able to achieve these objectives is the focus of this research.</p> <p>Successful re-integration starts within the prison itself. During the period of incarceration, social reintegration programmes should be designed to fully meet prisoners educational, technical, vocational, cultural and health needs while being delivered in a setting which respects dignity and human rights. The prison should therefore be used as an effective tool to equip offenders with the necessary social and educational resources which can help them desist from crime when they are released.</p> <p>According to Travis (2005) social reintegration is affected by how successfully programmes which were started in prison can be accessed, continued, practiced or completed in the community. He further stressed that there exists a wide range of treatment and reformation programs to prison offenders, like anger and aggression control program, anti-criminal thinking programes, job-rendiness training, sex offender program, drugs offender therapy. There are also myriads of industrial programs in which offenders can work while they are in prison, to provide service while gaining some of the skills they will need for re-integration into society.</p> <p>All the aforementioned laudable programmes are rarely applied because most prison inmates return home years later in worse shape than when they committed the crimes that resulted in their imprisonment. Majority of the inmates leave prison and return to society largely uneducated, unskills with severe social and medical problems, often without family support and with the stigma of a prison record hanging over them. Many experience serious socio-psychological problems after release. As ex-convicts are periodically released into the society, their systemic marginalization threaten the very society their imprisonment was meant to protect. The question is what toll does this constant release of prison inmates who have duly served their term exact on a community. What do these trends  portend for public softy?</p> <p>Aftercare services has the overall intents through effective correctional administration to reduce the high level of criminality among Nigeria lessening of prejudice against ex-prisoners in aid of their successful resettlements, to reduce the  rate of recidivism, promote entrepreneurship of ex-prisoners and the reduction of unemployment in Nigeria society. The question is, how successful has aftercare been, in its goals and objective? Another question is, what are the challenges faced by aftercare services in the reintegration of ex-prisoners?</p> <p>This research examines the realities of prisoners reintegration and proffering specific solutions to prepare inmates for release, reduce recidivism, and restore them to full citizenship, while never losing sight of the demand of public safety. The study will also examine the obstacle of reintegrating ex-convicts in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Offenders released from confinement encounter a myriad of challenges with respect of securing employment. These include personal factor such as how self-esteem, low motivation, skill deficit, lack of training, poor  academic standard, substance abuse, social factors such as negative peer influence, and absence of family support and poor employment record. These is no gainsaying that obtaining legal employment is one of the best predictions of the  post-release success of ex-prisoners. They receive little pre-release support in securing accommodation and are often unable to find suitable living arrangements. Social isolation is a core experience of may ex-prisoners who may end up homeless or with unsuitable housing.</p> <p>Drug dependent offenders are caught in a vicious circle unless the treatment they receive in prison for their addiction is maintained on their return to the community, the chances are that they will relapse and begin attending again to support their drug use; according to Burows et al, (2001) “failure for ex-prisoners to access appropriate support services in the community can result in offenders returning to prison time and time again as the cycle of  offending is perpetuated”.</p> <p>Given the fact that may convicted persons do lose their fundamental right, they are likely to maintain criminal in the real sense by recidivism many released  prisoners find it difficult to design life a new, once they know that they have lost certain rights of their own. It is debilitating effect of civil disabilities on the ex-convict the inhibits  him or her from participating actively in community life  programmes for his or her wellbeing and for the well-being of the entire community or nation.</p> <p>Prison inmates are  expected to the adaptive process of prisonisation which usually affects the prisoners in their transition as they return to the free world.</p> <p>Research has shown that prolonged incarceration and poor prison condition certainly has psychological impact on the prisoners and has dire implication for post-prison free world adjustment. Life in the prison is depriving. The pains of imprisonment can serve to impede post prison adjustment. This study set out to investigate the reasons for the failure of post-integration of ex-convict in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study is to examine the aftercare service and reintegration of ex-convicts in Nigeria, with particular reference to Akwa Ibom State specifically the objectives of the study are:</p> <ol><li>To examine the obstacles to reintegrate ex-convicted in Akwa Ibom State.</li> <li>To ascertain the state of re-information of and rehabilitation programmes in Nigeria prisons services in Akwa Ibom State.</li> </ol> <p>iii.     To ascertain the efficacy of the aftercare service in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Research Questions</strong></p> <ol><li>What are the obstacles to the reintegration of ex-convicts in Akwa Ibom State?</li> <li>What is the state of reformation/reintegration programmes in Nigeria Prison Service in Akwa Ibom State?</li> </ol> <p>iii.     How effective are the Aftercare services in Akwa Ibom State?</p> <p><strong>1.5   Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <ol><li>There is no relationship between the quality of reintegrate programmes in the prison and successful reintegration into society after discharge.</li> <li>There is no relationship between the condition of prisons and successful reintegration into society after discharge.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.6   Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The findings of this study will help other researchers to carry out a qualitative and comprehensive analysis of aftercare service in other states of the federation. The result of the study will help to further educate the academic community on Nigerian prisons service strategic roles and challenges. It will give prisoners an insight of what they will face on being released as such they could be motivated to engage in occupation and vocational training in order to make the self-reliant on discharge. It will make government to take steps in putting up a legal framework for comprehensive reform of the Nigeria prison system. The study will further assist the government to formulate crime control policy. The present policy of the government if to get criminal out of circulation by imprisonment. Less attention is paid to what happens when the convicted prisoner is released back into the society.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Scope and Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study is delimited to the aftercare unit of prison in Uyo, Eket, Ikot Ekpene, Abak and Ikot Abasi Ex-prisoners, Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) employers of labour and community leaders in Akwa Ibom State were involved in the study. This study is limited to Akwa Ibom State. They reason for choosing Akwa Ibom State includes its-proximity to the researcher, and the familiarity of the researcher with the area which facilitated the collection of data.</p> <p><strong>1.8   Definition of Key Concepts</strong></p> <p><strong>Aftercare Service:  </strong> This is a scheme intended by the Nigerian prison services for the treatment and rehabilitation of discharged prisoners. The scheme is aimed at facilitating the re-integration of ex-convicts into the society through collaboration with NGOs, Employers of labour, community leaders etc.</p> <p><strong>Crime:</strong> This is a violation of societal rules as interpreted and expressed by a criminal legal code of a particular society and are subject to sanctions by state authority.</p> <p><strong>Punishment:</strong> It is the legal imposition of a penalty as ret4ribution for an offence.</p> <p><strong>Ex-convict:</strong> It refers to a person who has been released from prison after serving his sentence. In this study, the term “ex-convict”, “expresoner” and  “ex-offender” will be used interchangeably.</p>\n\nINVESTIGATE A SURVEY ON THE AFTERCARE SERVICE AND REINTEGRATION OF EX-CONVICTS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATE A SURVEY ON THE AFTERCARE SERVICE AND REINTEGRATION OF EX-CONVICTS IN NIGERIA", "id": 102}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The pathetic circumstances of victims of crime in the world have been so worrisome that, Pino Alarcchi once said, “We must agree amongst ourselves that we want a world where there will be no hiding place for the criminals … and where there will be adequate support for their victims”. The essence of the research is vividly captured in the above prelude. Records reveal that before the state took over the provision of security for its citizenry through its official law enforcement agency – the police -, victims of crime were solely responsible for identifying those who wronged them, footing the bills of investigating their crimes and prosecuting the felons when arrested.Thus, where a crime was committed without witnesses, efforts to identify the assailant became the tasks borne by the victims unaided, as no government agencies was responsible for investigating crimes.</p> <p>Nmerole admitted that, this was the situation in the United Kingdom during the frankpledge era (a system under which each adult member was responsible for the good conduct of the others). And after the Norman Conquest in 1066, though constables were added and saddled with the tasks of guarding the city gates at night, investigating crimes and prosecuting cases still remained a private matter handled by the victims themselves. In the United States, private prosecution dominated criminal justice during the colonial era, and criminal cases were initiated by complaints of private citizens, and the responsibility to pursue the case to its logical conclusion rested primarily with the private citizen who began the process. As a result, he was required to pay the justices’ fees and hire attorney to plead the case, which situation still prevails in the common law nations.</p> <p>However, in pre-colonial Africa, according to Tamuno, “crime in most societies was viewed as an infraction against the entire community and not the individual victim”. Therefore when crime was committed, all that the victim needed to do was to alert the neighbours, and the entire members of the community, particularly members of the secret society responsible for security, would chase and apprehend the culprit; who would subsequently be tried by the elders’ council and if found guilty, “would be promptly, adequately and publicly punished”. For instance, in the Kanuri speaking area of Nigeria, “communal solidarity, rather than personal gains and successes, held sway in the sphere of defence”. As a result, “whenever and wherever an individual member of the community was attacked, the entire village would rise up in arms in defence of the victim”.</p> <p>Tamuno also confirmed that, “There was no police force, but rather it was the supernatural sanction of their religion that policed the primordial Nigerian village society”. These, “Indigenous religions had that strong moral code and supernatural sanction that were both able to keep the old village society morally clean and free from crime”. He argued that what ensured a high level of public security and public safety was that, “The people so affected  realized  that  crime  did not pay. Besides, neither the high nor the mighty in society</p> <p>could claim exemption from the sanctions in force in pre-colonial times”.Ndifon similarly affirmed that under the customary legal system, every offence had its own punishment, and “Punishment was often effectively and realistically administered to the wrongdoer”.For instance, for murder, “Punishments ranged from replacement in specie, enslavement, suicide, banishment of the wrongdoer, to payment of specific sum to the family of the deceased victim”. He maintained that, “Justice for the victim or his relatives was the ultimate aim of punishment in pre-colonial African justice system”. To him therefore, it was the introduction of the British police tradition and adoption of the alien court and legal systems in Nigeria and other African countries that abolished these pre-colonial customary legal ideals from the territories.</p> <p>According to Tamuno, “This alien government recruited its own police to enforce its laws and keep the peace of the imperial crown”.The police system, “Stressed prevention and detection of crime and punishment of the criminal, as against compensation and restitution of the victims which were the essence of the customary legal systems”.The alien police and legal systems emphasised, and still emphasise that, “Complaints must be initiated by individual victims and police must investigate and possibly prosecute the offender, with the victim serving only as a prosecution witness”. From the above analysis, it is obvious that during the colonial era, and still in Nigeria today, the victim of crime, was and still is relevant in the criminal justice process only for his testimony.</p> <p>In the context of international law jurisprudence, ordinary or conventional crimes are within the national criminal justice system.  Therefore, the protection of the right of victims of intentional or ordinary crimes, and affording them justice are, properly situated within the confines of national governments. Hence, violations of rights of victims of crime, through intentional crimes committed by fellow citizens in their private capacities, are outside the realm of international law jurisprudence.  Renewed interests in the affairs of victims of crime attracted global limelight, following the pioneering work of Marjory Fry in the early 1960s then a magistrate in England.  She had reasoned that, “victims of intentional crimes should be given the same treatment as victims of motor vehicle or work place accidents”. Accordingly, her efforts drew global attention to the need for better treatment for victims of crime. As a result, in 1963, New Zealand started the first State Compensation Programme for victims of violent crimes. This was followed by England with the establishment of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme in 1964, to handle the issue of compensation to victims of crime of violence.Thereafter, similar schemes were introduced in other European countries, Australia and Provinces in Canada.</p> <p>Majory Fry’s agitations attracted the attention of the World Society of Victimology, which met with United Nations officials in 1982 to discuss ways of ensuring that victims of crime are guaranteed protection and redress, globally. After series of discussions, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 1985 adopted and implemented the</p> <p>Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. The UNO envisaged that through the Declaration interest in the protection of the rights of victims of crime would spread globally. However, as would be seen shortly, interest in the issue only spread further within the leading countries of Europe and the United States of America. For instance, shortly after the Declaration, England proclaimed a Charter for the Rights for Victims, which required courts to consider restitution from the offender to their victims on a routine basis. In 1995, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act was enacted, yet still, in 2001, the Home Office in its Report, entitled, “Criminal Justice: The Way Ahead”, revealed that,”many victims felt that the rights of the accused take precedence over theirs in criminal proceedings”.</p> <p>Recently, Dame Helen, the Chief Executive of Victims’ Support in England equally lamented, “We believe an entirely new way of thinking about crime is needed – one that recognises the needs of victims of crime as the responsibility of the whole community, rather than leaving people to suffer in silence while we focus on offenders”. She argued rightly that, “Crime ruins lives, people suffer direct physical and financial losses, including severe, and often long-lasting emotional and psychological trauma”. She affirmed that this situation is often frequently made worst by, “insensitive treatment and a lack of understanding from the agencies with which victims come into contact”.  The experience narrated by Dame Hellen, it is observed, is a typical phenomenon of all victims of crime in Nigeria. For instance, at most police stations in Nigeria, their complaints are often not responded to promptly and sometimes when done at all, it is at a heavy price borne by the victim. In the USA, one of the significant achievements of Majory Fry’s agitations, it has been observed, is that, “Taxes and fines on corporate criminals are employed in services and awareness through the offices for Victims of crime (OVC)”. Also the court in<em> Payne v Tennessee</em>recognised and approved the right of victims to make, “victims’ impact statements” in the sentencing phase of criminal trials. This development has become an added impetus to the struggle for the redress for victims of crime in the United States.</p> <p>In 1998 the United Nations General Assembly approved the <em>Guide for Policymakers and the Handbook on Justice for Victims</em>, which was adopted in 1999 to facilitate the implementation of UNGA 1985 Basic Principles. This was done in furtherance of her efforts to ensure that victims of crime are properly protected. Equally in Europe, the Council of European Union in November, 1985, approved the Council of Europe Ministers’ Recommendation R (85/11) of 1985 which deals specifically on the issue of victims, It is regrettable to observe that neither the African Union, through its Charter, nor African countries, including Nigeria have been positively influenced in this regards as their counterparts in Europe and America, with regards to initiatiating legislative measures to cater for the interests of victims of crime.</p> <p>In Nigeria, once crime is committed against, or its commission is suspected by any individual, the individual is enjoined to report such to the police for their investigation This action by the police an obvious agency of government portrays the victim as not having been completely abandoned by the state. However, mere investigation of crimes is viewed as inadequate to carter for the rights of the victims. It is therefore advocated that special laws, boards and or commissions, that would adequately accommodate the rights of victims be established to handle their issues. Today in Nigeria, as in other African countries, it is not in doubt that there are numerous international and national non-governmental organisations, etc. whose sole task is struggling for the protection and redress for victims of abuse of power. It is ironical that the victims, who often suffer both physical and psychological harms as a result of the intentional and unlawful commissions or omissions of private citizens, who deserve more attention, are ignored. It is therefore proposed that governments, both at the federal and state levels, relevant non-governmental organisations and other groups, should re-focus on, and re-direct their attentions to the plights of victims of crime.</p> <p>By virtue of both the Constitutional and statutory provisions the Nigeria Police force, as an institution of government is vested with the arduous responsibility of, “prevention and detection of crime, apprenshion of offenders and protection of life and property” of all Nigerians. It is thus rightly affirmed that, the Nigeria police is, “structured organisationally and psychologically to protect the society from the criminal elements and other miscreant” within the society. Therefore, where there is no special legislation, as it were, for protection of the victims of crime in the Nigeria, the police should not be encumbered or obstructed, but should rather be encouraged by all, in the discharge of their duties. However, because of the apparent corruption and ineptitude of the present crop of police officers, asking Nigerians to cooperate with the police would tantamount to an uphill task. It is believed that since the police belong to the citizenry, the onus is therefore on the people to demand for the kind of police they really need; and this cannot be realised through the current abhorrence of and apathy towards the institution</p> <p>Furthermore, it is articulated that, the fact that the police have fallen short of public expectations, does not warrant the seemingly disdain and hatred with which the officers and anything that associates with them is regarded. Sometimes, this perception has caused grant of court orders that turn out to disrupt criminal investigative processes; prohibit the arrest of reasonably suspected offenders, and even set free those in police detentions unconditionally and in total disregard of the law;assumingly in the pursuit of protection of the purportedly breached rights of the applicants.</p> <p>It has rightly been asserted that, “The essential purpose of human rights jurisprudence is to ensure the effective protection of certain fundamental entitlements of all human beings everywhere without distinction”. Therefore, if innocent victims of crime are human beings, it is undeniable that whenever their fundamental human rights are breached by fellow private individuals, they also are entitled to be accorded adequate protection and redress. Therefore, it is strongly argued that the release on bail of reasonably suspected and  arrested criminals, without hearing from the victim, terminating police investigative processes through court orders; and the inability or unwillingness of the courts, the police, highly placed political office holders, top government officials and chief executives of government parasatals, to promptly and effectively bring perpetrators of crime to book, including grant of Presidential pardons and amnesty to jailed criminals, contribute much more to the escalation of corruption and other criminal activities in Nigeria, than the supposed  police  corruption  –  the  recent  oil  subsidy  and  the  Pension‘s  fund scandals are clear examples. Events like these contribute more to the victims’ despondency and create the impression that it pays to be a criminal.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of Research Problem</strong></p> <p>Victims of crime in Africa and in Nigeria in particular from the inception of colonialism, have always been relevant only for the purpose of successful prosecution; with their needs, interests and rights accorded little or no concern by the operators of the criminal justice system. The several non-governmental organisations, civil society and other community-based groups in Nigeria are concerned with the protection and redress for the suspect, accused persons and or prisoners. The Nigeria Police as an institiution of the executive arm of government, as earlier stated, are saddled with several duties which they have performed below the public’s expectation, supposedly because of corruption, ineptitude, impunity and incompetence.</p> <p>That these allegations are true are incontestable; a cursory flip through the dailies and social media will attest to this, and most unfortunately, not too long ago, an Inspector-General of police was jailed for corruption. However, a brief for the police is not contemplated here, but at the same time, it is apt to observe that often persons police reasonably suspect of crimes are prohibited from being arrested; and sometimes those already arrested and detained are ordered by courts, to be released on bail unconditionally. As a result, the criminal investigative processes are thwarted and aborted, and the complaint of the victim is abandoned and the suspected person now set free, and seemingly protected by the law, goes about unleashing other heinous crimes on the society and his victim in the initial case now left at his mercy.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>       <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <ul><li>What impact would judicial interference in criminal investigatory processes have on the victim, criminal justice system and the society as a whole?</li> <li>When criminal investigative processes are aborted through judicial fiat, is all the parties afforded justice?</li> <li>When costs are awarded against victims for allegedly breaching the rights of suspects, what message/messages do courts send to the society?</li> <li>Is there any Special Law for the protection of victims of crime in Nigeria?</li> <li>What unique rights do victims of crime possess that require protection?</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4      Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main aim of this study is to appraise the roles of the police and court in the protection and redress for victims of crime in Nigeria.

The research is immensely valuable to both the federal and states’ executives, and federal and states’ legislatures. The research enjoins these government functionaries to re-focus their respective roles and responsibilities towards ensuring that adequate measures are put in place to protect and redress victims of crime in Nigeria, as is in vogue in other jurisdictions.</p> <p>The legislatures in particular, are re-awakened to grasp the significance of their law making roles, and thereby come up with relevant legislation in support of the subject matter of this research.

In a nutshell, bail is a security for attendance in court from commencement of proceedings to judgment. In determining whether to grant or refuse bail, the determinant factors appear to depend upon the peculiar facts of every case, vis-à-vis the fundamental right of the suspect. Hence, bail is not granted as a matter of course.</p> <p>Again, Learned authors and jurists have opined that fundamental rights pre-exist existence itself, hence, should not be derogated upon except in exceptional circumstances. The foregoing dilemma will be resolved upon completion of this piece and recommendation professed. However, this research which takes a deeper look at the concept of bail and its enforcement in Nigeria will be discussed according to its chapterization as it has been subdivided to arrive at a particular goal as demanded by a particular chapter. In chapter one, we intend to discuss the historical evolution of the concept of bail, the effect of bail and the instances where bail could be granted in the Magistrate Court and High Court. Also, to be examined are the factors to be considered in granting or refusing bail. In chapter two, we intend to discuss the ideas of different authors concerning this topic under the heading, literature review. In chapter three, we will be focusing on bail and the enforcement of fundamental rights as well as its effect in Nigeria with reference to Arrest, Detention as well as Bail under the different laws. Chapter four is the concluding part of this work and also where all the necessary recommendations will be made.</p> <p><strong>1.1    Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Over the years, most suspects who might not have committed any offence or whose relation had been suspected of committing an offence have found themselves incarcerated in police detention sometimes on the premise of a holding charge. This incarceration could take many years before the actual trial (if any) would be instituted. This ugly scenario necessitated the present researcher to have an indept analysis on the concept of bail vis-à-vis the enforcement of fundamental human right with particular reference to Nigeria with a view of enlightening the Nigerian citizenry.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Objective of the Study </strong></p> <p>This study is targeted to achieve the following objectives:</p> <ul><li>The need to respect the constitutional right to bail of every suspected criminal save in compelling right other than bail.</li> <li>The need to respect court’s order as it relates to enforcement of fundamental rights other than bail.</li> <li>It is sought to create awareness on the citizens on their constitutionally guaranteed rights.</li> <li>This study is also aimed at exposing the unconstitutional practice of holding charge with a view of detaining a suspect.</li> </ul> <ul><li><strong>Significance Of The Study</strong></li> </ul> <p>It is envisaged that at the completion of this study, other researchers who may be interested in further research on the concept of bail and the enforcement of fundamental human rights would use this work as a reference material. Also, it will help inform the individual of their right to bail as guaranteed in the Nigerian Constitution. This study will educate some disgruntled officers of the Nigeria Police who insist always on collection of money as “bail fee” before granting bail to a suspected criminal.

This has constituted a problem to an easy understanding of law because law has been viewed and interpreted differently by different thinkers. Foremost in the understanding of law are issues such as correct interpretation, judicial precedence, justice and fairness, punishment and its limits, the rule of law and its preservation, legal knowledge and ignorance, and chiefly, obedience to the law for the survival of  the community. These were some of the factors that led Bentham to propose his own theory of law using Hedonistic calculus.</p> <p>Jeremy Bentham saw human nature as the seeking of pleasure and avoidance of pain. Laws therefore to him are a way to control people’s action through the fear of pain and punishment. For Jeremy Bentham, the existence of laws and morality can be explained through human nature. According to his theory of psychological hedonism, there are two main forces that drives human nature and explains why people act the way they do; pleasure and pain.</p> <p>All people tend to avoid pain and to seek out pleasure in their daily living. This view of human nature is different from that of other thinkers such as Locke who said that human nature can be explained through natural law and the social contract. Jeremy Bentham says that his view of human nature is positivistic and is not theoretical as other views of human nature and can easily be used practically for legislative and political purposes. Hedonic calculus is Bentham’s method of making decisions based upon the amount of pain and pleasured caused by the out come of decisions.</p> <p>It will also set a standard to understand the position of Bentham on his ideas of law and to see from the stand point of philosophical speculations, criticism and analysis what gains there is that can benefit from his doctrines, ideas and theories. Also, society must be organized in a way that lives and properties can be protected hence the introduction of a legal system that will checkmate and curb the excessive of some people.</p> <p>For him, it is the job of the legislators to make sure that the laws enacted promotes the greatest amount of pleasure and happiness for the greatest number of people. Since human nature is pleasure seeking and pain avoiding, it is the job of the state to use their knowledge to create laws that will maximize pleasure and minimize pain for every one. Punishment is used to control because it causes pain which people would avoid at all cost.</p> <p>This work will examine Bentham’s idea of law, from critical point of view to ascertain if Bentham’s prescription will indeed work by making people to avoid the wrong and do what is right because of the fear of pain.</p> <p>In the book <em>political thought</em> by C-L Wayper, the author tries to analyse Bentham’s idea of utility, the state and its importance. For Bentham, everything that brings happiness is good. An adherent to the principle of utility, he says “holds virtue to be a good thing by reason only of the pleasures which result from the practice of it; he esteems vice to be a bad thing by reason only of the pains which follows in its train” (Wayper, 89).</p> <p>The doctrine of utility, therefore is a hedonistic doctrine. Moving from the principle of utility, the utilitarian explanation of the state is a complete explanation in terms of an unlimited end. The state, utilitarian tells us of a group of person’s organized for the promotion and maintenance of utility, that is happiness or pleasure. This principle of utility, not any inherently improbable contracts, is all that is needed to explain why men obey the state. Bentham and the utilitarian tells us in what way the state is perculiar, it is the sole source of law, which is the most certain of the four sanctions, or overriding motives, which govern the lives of men.</p> <p>For Bentham, the state is primarily a law-making body. (Wayper, 94). A group of persons organized for the promotion and maintenance of happiness, and acting through law to that end. Law is a command and restraints, and as such is opposed to liberty, its great task is to reconcile interests so as to regulate the motive of self interest that it shall operate, even against its will, towards the production of the greatest happiness. This is done by attaching artificial pains, or punishment to certain actions of a particular kind which would not be conducive to the general happiness.</p> <p>Furthermore, because law is a command, it must be the command of a supreme authority. Indeed, it is only when such an authority is habitually obeyed that Bentham is prepared to admit the existence of civil society.</p> <p>In the book <em>history of western philosophy, </em>Betrand Russel spoke of Bentham that he wished to establish a code of laws and more generally, a social system which would automatically make men virtuous. Bentham maintained that what is good is pleasure or happiness, he used these words as synonyms and what is bad is pains. Therefore one state of affairs is better than another if it involves a greater balance of pleasure over pain, or a smaller balance of pain over pleasure of all possible states of affairs, that one is best that is that which involves the greatest balance of pleasure over pain (Russel, 741).</p> <p>Bentham held not only that the good is happiness in general but also that each individual always pursue what he believes to be his own happiness. The business of the legislator, therefore, is the produce harmony between public and private interest. It is to the interest of the public that I should abstain from theft, but it is not my interest except where there is an effective criminal law. Thus, the criminal law is a method of making the interest of the individual coincide with these of the community; that is its justification. Men are to be punished by the criminal law in order to prevent crime, not because we hate the criminal. It is more important that the punishment should be certain than that it should be severe. In Bentham’s day, in England, many quite minor offences were subject to the death penalty, with the result that juries often refund to convict because they thought the penalty is excessive. Bentham advocated abolition of the death penalty for all but the mitigated in this respect, finally Bentham says civil law should have four aims; subsistence, abundance, security and equality (Russel, 742).</p> <p>In the book, <em>A History of political theory</em> the authors Sabine and Thorson gave an indepth analysis of Bentham’s theory of law. They opine that the greatest happiness, as Bentham believed, placed in the hands of skillful legislator a practically universal instrument, with it, we can “rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reason and law” (Sabine and Thorson, 617). This provides the theory of basic human nature, both its valuation and its motivations, which Bentham supposed to be applicable at all times and all places. The legislator needs to know only the special circumstances of time and place that have produced peculiar customs and habits and he can then control behaviour by allocating pains and penalties to produce the must desirable results.</p> <p>The only limitations upon the method which Bentham recognized were psychological and ethical fixing on the one hand what the law can do and on the others, what it is wisely try to do. Bentham’s jurisprudence consisted in the systematic application to all branches of the law, civil and criminal, and to the procedural law and the organisation of the judicial system. In the field of criminal law the principle of utility provided, as Bentham believed, a natural method of arriving at a rational theory of penalties (Sabine and Thorson, 618-619). The technical method starts from the assumption that crime “deserves” punishment, but the concept of desert is essentially indefinable except in terms of existing practices and ideas. The natural method, on the contrary, starts from the principle that punishment is always an evil, since it causes pain, and is justified only in so far as it either prevents a greater future evil or repairs an evil already done. The rule that a law must be judged by the incidence of its effect on human beings, and so far as possible on assignable individuals, was a sound liberal principle and this was part of Bentham’s jurisprudence.</p> <p>In the book <em>The Enduring Questions: Main problems in philosophy, </em>Maduine Rader devoted a section to the principle of morals and legislation. The author focuses on Bentham’s utilitarianism and his idea of law. He started with the idea that nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure (Rader, 567). It further tries to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. They govern us in all we do, in al we say, in all we think. The principle of utility recognizes the subjection and assumes it for the foundation of that system, the object of which is to rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reasons and of</p>\n\nA CRITIQUE OF JEREMY BENTHAM’S IDEA OF LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITIQUE OF JEREMY BENTHAM’S IDEA OF LAW", "id": 105}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AN EXAMINATION OF LAWS AND  PROCEDURES REGULATING TRADE DISPUTE  IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0.0:   INTRODUCTION TO STUDY</p> <p>Industrial harmony is very important both at the public and private sectors because of the negative impact of disputes in the labour sector. Trade dispute, when it occurs could be a very serious issue especially when it is allowed to degenerate into an industrial action. Few trade disputes get reported but the ones that are recorded help the government to get a proper analysis for the evaluation and policy purposes. Though quite a large number of disputes occur without resort to strike, however they are equally as disruptive as cessation of work.</p> <p>Since government is the largest employer of labour, it has from time to time enacted different laws curb to the incidence of trade disputes between employers and their workers in Nigeria.</p> <p>Trade dispute has been defined by the Act as any disagreement between employers and workers, workers and workers which is connected to the employment, non employment or terms of employment or physical</p> <p>1</p> <p>condition of work of any person1. It must be noted that before any dispute can be termed a trade dispute, there must be in existence proper parties and the subject matter must be related to the employment, non employment or terms of employment or physical condition of work of any person2.</p> <p>This shows that the parties and subject of a trade dispute must be clearly defined in order to fully understand what kind of dispute constitutes a trade dispute. The first attempt made by the government to regulate trade dispute was the Trade Disputes (Arbitration and Inquiry) (Lagos) Ordinance, 19413 and Trade Dispute (Arbitration and Inquiry) (Federal Application) Ordinance, 19574. However, these attempts turned out to be unsuccessful because of some defects in them which eventually shorten their life span and new legislation were enacted, these are the Trade Dispute (Emergency Provisions) Decree of 19685 and the Trade Dispute (Emergency Provisions) (Amendment) (Decree No 2) of 19696.</p> <p>These two Decrees were enacted to correct the defects in the first two ordinances they were effective in some aspect but they were designated to</p> <ul><li>Trade Dispute Act 1978 S.47 (1)</li> </ul> <ul><li>NNB V.

The Decree had some inherent defects which were to be regulated by the Trade Dispute Act, 1976 which till today remains the major machinery for the settlement of trade disputes and its amendment the Trade Dispute (Amendment) Decree No. 47 of 19928.</p> <p>The Trade Dispute Act, 1976 has provided different procedures for setting trade disputes when they occur, the Act provides for ways in which the parties may attempt the settlement themselves and ways in which a 3rd party may be appointed to help in the settlement processes. It also provides for ways in which the parties may take the dispute to the court for proper adjudication.</p> <p>Examination of the laws and procedures for the regulation of trade disputes is the focus of this study and recommendations made where necessary for a better way of resolving trade disputes.</p> <p>1.1.0:   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <ul><li>Because they were a temporary war time measures which outlived its usefulness with the cessation of hostilities</li> </ul> <ul><li>M.O Akanbi (2001) JLSS Vol.1 No.1, pg 69</li> </ul> <p>3</p> <p>In any ideal industrial relations, great emphasis is placed on the attainment of industrial harmony in order to create a conducive environment for the realization of individual and organization goals and objectives. However, it would appear that conflict is a common phenomenon in any human setting and when it exists, it creates human and industrial problems, which adversely affect the attainment of industrial peace.</p> <p>Since conflict in any work situation is almost inevitable because as labour and management relates, there are bound to be frictions which results from differences in interest and aspirations as both the employer and employee most times have divergent interest on issues touching on wages, conditions of work, terms of employment e.t.c and resolving these dispute requires compromise, concession and a game of give and take between disputing parties.</p> <p>4</p> <p>1.2.0:   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>This work is intended to make an analysis of the Trade dispute resolution Mechanism of the Trade Dispute Act 1990 as well as a comparative study of Trade Dispute Decree 1992 alongside the constitution.

It was pointed out that malicious prosecution is an abuse of the process of the court by wrongfully setting the law in motion on a criminal charge. It is the malicious institution of unsuccessful criminal or bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings against another without reasonable or probable cause. This tort balances competing principles, namely freedom that every person should have in bringing criminals to justice and the need for restraining false accusations against innocent persons. Malicious prosecution is an abuse of the process of the court by wrongfully setting the law in motion on a criminal charge.

The general objective of the study is to determine the present state of the law on Asset Management of bank and the right of shareholders. The research is interdisciplinary in scope and addresses both legal and socio-economic issues. To ascertain information for this research work, doctrinaire research methodology was used, while the secondary data element of empirical research where data from Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) was used as source of information to illustrate the work. The findings stated that the right of shareholders depended largely on provisions in  a corporation charter and by-law; that shareholders in a corporation are shielded from personal liability for debts and obligations of the corporation, and also, that the consolidation programme were necessitated by the need to strengthen the banks, thereby playing pivotal roles in driving development across the sector of the economy. The study recommended adequate practices of banking laws and regulations within the industry, risk – focused and rule based regulatory framework, strict enforcement of corporate governance principles in banking, expeditions process for rendition of returns by banks and other financial institutions through – efass and finally the revision and updating of relevant laws for effective corporate governance and ensuring greater transparency and accountability in the implementation of banking laws and regulations.</p> <div> <ol><li><strong>      BACKGROUND TO STUDY</strong></li> </ol></div> <p>Investors who purchase corporate stocks enjoy a number of rights pertaining to their ownership the rights of shareholders depends largely on provisions in a corporation charter and by- laws.

It is a source of wealth to those who have it and the mother of all properties. In other words, virtually all the basic needs of human existence are land dependent. In view of the importance and usefulness of land to man and his development as well as the development of his society, every person generally desires to acquire and own a portion of land to achieve the various ends for which the land is meant. Therefore, to make land in Nigeria available to all and to ensure that land is acquired and put to a proper use for the needed development, governments during and after colonial period enacted laws to govern the use or administration of land in Nigeria.<br/>Before the arrival of the colonial masters, there were customary laws which governed the administration of land in Nigeria. These customary laws varied from one locality to another because of the differences in customs of the people. This accounted for the multiplicity of land laws in Nigeria prior to the promulgation of the Land Use Act of 1978. These laws were applied in each region to regulate land in the region.<br/>Notwithstanding the existence of laws regulating land, the problems of land tenure and land administration persisted both in the Northern and Southern Nigeria. There were new problems such as land racketeering and speculations. Exorbitant compensations were demanded by landowners whenever the government acquired land for development. Thus, acquisition of land by government or individuals was becoming almost impossible in Nigeria. In fact, one of the major factors that was said to be a stumbling block against efficient implementation of the Second Development Plan 1975-1980, was lack of land for development project. To break this barrier and monopolies of landlords, the Federal Military Government set up some panels to consider how best to solve the problems associated with land tenure and administration in Nigeria. The report of one of these panels i.e., the Land Use Panel of 1977 eventually formed the basis of the Land Use Act No. 6 of 1978.<br/>The purpose of this essay therefore, is to critically examine the Land Use Act of 1978 to see the extent to which it has enhanced the administration of land in Nigeria. In this connection, reforms and innovations introduced by the Act to improve the administration of land are critically examined. Bearing in mind that every being has its scar, the Act is not without shortcomings. In this regard, this study further beams its search lights in figuring out the inherent problems of the Act. Finally, this work makes recommendations on how to improve the Act in view of the recent proposal by Government to review the Act.</p>\n\nTHE LAND USE ACT OF 1978: APPRAISAL, PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE LAND USE ACT OF 1978: APPRAISAL, PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS", "id": 111}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>The bulk majority of the tax evasion and tax avoidance is caused by inadequate machineries and lack of skilled personal in administrative tax bodies as well as the legal framework upon which their relationship rest. This result in many problems of the tax collection in Nigeria. It is in this regard that the topic of this dissertation entitled “A Legal Examination of the Role of Taxation in Revenue Generation and Economic Development in Nigeria” was chosen. This study is to present, explore and analyze the nature and extent of tax legal provisions relating to the role of taxation in revenue generation and economic development in Nigeria. It will also present how they are maintained, practiced, adhered to and suggest some ways and means of improving the present state of affairs. The study is composed of five Chapters. Thus, Chapter one dealt with the General Introduction, Background, Statement of Problems, Aims and Objectives, Scope of the study, Significance of the study, Research Methodology, Literature Review and Organizational layout. Chapter two discussed on Examination of Taxing power in the Federal Republic of Nigeria under the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (As amended), and the brief history of Income Taxation in Nigeria. Chapter three is the bedrock of the whole work that discussed the role of taxation in the economic development of Nigeria with its legal perspectives. Chapter four discussed on significance of Taxation in Nigeria; Nigerian Economic Situation and Tax as incentive for economic growth. Chapter five which is the last chapter discussed on Summery, Findings and Recommendations that my hopefully be help in solving the problems.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Tax is one of the sources of revenue for the government.1 This is so because for the achievement of aims, goals and objectives, an organization will need to have enough funds at its disposal. This importance assumes an accelerated dimension in the face of the present economic recession in Nigeria.2</p> <p>Therefore, tax system is one of the most powerful means available to the government to stimulate and guide its economic and social development. In the life of any nation, taxation is an indispensable tool employed by the government for the promotion of their overall economic and social objectives. The crucial role that taxation plays in the development of Nigerian economy cannot be over emphasized.3 Though revenue generation seems to be the primary goal of the government when it levies taxes, however it not the only purpose of the government in levying taxes, but produces economic need for the government.</p> <p>For instance, when investment, production, consumption and so on, begin to rise or fall dangerously, a change in the tax structure can stop or reverse the undesired trend. It is in recognition of this crucial role of taxation in a country‟s economy that the United State Supreme Court has this to say in the case of Nichols v. Ames</p> <p>“Taxation is one great power upon which the National fabric is base. It is necessary to the existence and prosperity of a nation. It is in the air she breathes. For natural men, it is not only the power to destroy…”</p> <p>Taxation provides the main impetus for formulation and implementation of an optimal fiscal strategic policy. To this end state governments in Nigeria play and carry out important roles and responsibilities, for examples apart from Local governments State governments are the second tier of governments closest to the people. These governments coupled with other responsibilities they are saddled with they provides the people with social services, and to do this effectively they need to generate enough funds.</p>\n\nA LEGAL EXAMINATION OF THE ROLE OF TAXATION IN REVENUE GENERATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A LEGAL EXAMINATION OF THE ROLE OF TAXATION IN REVENUE GENERATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 112}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This thesis entitled, “An Appraisal of the Ascertainment of Applicable Law of Torts in Conflict of Laws” aimed at ascertaining the applicable law of torts in conflict of laws situation in Nigeria by examining various rules that have been perfected to take care of such processes based on choice of law approach, among the various rules. Traditionally, most of the rules governing the ascertainment of applicable law of tort in conflict of</p> <p>laws were more theoretical in nature, based mainly on the application of the Lex Fori, Lex Loci deliciti, the proper law of the tort, characterization, and modern theories. Thus, against this backdrop, the objective of this research is to identify the major aspects of torts in the conflict of laws that formed the core of choice of law, with particular reference to Nigeria and to further identify challenges involved there in. However, a major finding of this research is that there are certain areas of conflict of laws where the application of the rule in Phillips vs. Eyre (as the prevailing choice of law rule in Nigeria) is unsuitable to the Nigerian circumstances. It is noted that the rules in Phillip vs. Eyre and Boys vs Chaplin were designed or rather adopted when human interactions, productions, means of communication and science and technology were not advanced as today. In the comparative evaluation of the rules in the commonwealth countries and in America, the writer laid more emphasis on the view point that have practical relevance to each jurisdiction in order to satisfy the yearnings of a balanced determination of conflicts emanating from frictions arising out of the natural contact between individuals and interests. Obviously, the statement of problem of this thesis therefore suggested that there is uncertainty of the applicability of law of tort in conflict of laws situation in Nigeria. In other words, where there is a case of tort involving foreign element in Nigeria, the court in Nigeria is faced with the problem of which law is applicable? For example, is it the forum law or the foreign law of torts that will apply? This uncertainty is caused by the fact that there are several factors to be considered in order to arrive at a choice of the applicable law. It is the existence of this problem that motivated this work. On this note, the researcher concluded by recommending (among others) that, the Nigerian legislatures, both the National Assembly and States Assemblies, should enact a law that will take care of jurisdiction and ascertainment of applicable law when the cause or matter has a foreign element. The sources of information relied upon here are doctrinal method of acquiring data and information was used, thereby, combining several documents, ranging from text books, journals, statutes and other relevant treaties to accomplish this work.</p> <p><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria, as well as other jurisdictions, for example, United States of America, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ghana, South Africa, East Africa, just to mention but a few, there are many laws that are applicable to various subject matters or business. For example, we have criminal law, constitutional law, commercial law, law of evidence, company law etc. Conflict of law is one of such laws in the country that is taught just like it is taught in any of the countries we mentioned above.</p> <p>Conflict of laws unlike the other kind of laws we mentioned above, is an aspect of international law. In other words, the laws we mentioned above are principally considered as municipal laws or local laws. Conflict of laws is a stoke of international law. In other words, it is a subsidiary of the international law. This is why it is called private international law.</p> <p>Conflict of laws comes into play or becomes applicable when the issue of jurisdiction is in question. For example, if Mr. Z enters into contract for hiring of Mr. Y’s Peugeot station wagon to carry persons from Zaria to Lagos, on reaching Jeba, the car tumbled and as a result three persons out of the seven persons in the car died. Four other persons sustained serious injuries and they were rushed to Jeba General Hospital and given first aid treatment. They were later taken to Lagos their hometown. Some few days after they were taken to Lagos, their injuries worsened and consequently they died also. The driver and the hirer of the car were sued in Lagos by heirs of the deceased persons for compensation under the Fatal Accident Law of Lagos.</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE ASCERTAINMENT OF APPLICABLE LAW OF TORTS IN CONFLICT OF LAWS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF THE ASCERTAINMENT OF APPLICABLE LAW OF TORTS IN CONFLICT OF LAWS", "id": 113}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This dissertation employs the doctrinal method of research to appraise the doctrine of Self defence as one of the fundamental principles of International law, and as one of the exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force. To this end, this dissertation centers on Article 51 of the United Nations Charter which provides for the right of self defence in International law. The dissertation contends that the provisions of Article 51 have generated some controversies among scholars of International law. These controversies have tended to obscure the scope of self defence in International law. The major problem of this research is that it is not clear whether Article 51 has abrogated or preserved the doctrine of anticipatory Self defence in Customary International law. This problem has been complicated by the use of the phrases ‘inherent right of individual or collective self defence’ and ‘armed attack’ in Article 51. The question therefore is that ‘does international law expect a State to do nothing where it is a target of an imminent attack’? The objective of this dissertation therefore is to examine the relationship between Article 51 and rules of customary International Law, and the circumstances in which the right of self defence can be exercised. The dissertation makes some findings by submitting that the doctrine of preemptive Self defence is contrary to Articles 2(4) and 51 of the Charter which prohibits unilateral use of force. Furthermore, both Article 51 and customary international law provide different rules for the exercise of the right of self defence .The writer suggests that there is urgent need for an amendment of Article 51 to bring it in line with current global challenges to global security. The phrase ‘armed attack’ should be well defined and the concept of collective self defence should be deleted from Article 51.</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The doctrine of self-defence is one of the fundamental principles of International law.1 The doctrine of self defence is common to all systems of law, and generally, as a legal concept, the function and scope of Self-defence vary with the level of development of each legal system. Thus, International law which is characterized by lack of specialized machinery for the enforcement of International law and protection of the rights of member states has vested the individual member states the right to use force for the protection of certain essential rights.</p> <p>However, as International law advances, as its processes of enforcement and protection become more effective, the tendency is to allocate duty of protection to a centralized authority such as the United Nations Security Council, and to restrict the right of unilateral action by individual member states. However, no matter how effective the means of protection afforded by the centralized authority is, it will be necessary, for the protection of certain essential rights, and interests of the state to invest the states with the right of self defence until the enforcement machinery of the United Nations (UN) comes to their aid. It is difficult to envisage a legal system in which the prohibition of recourse to force has no exception in the form of the doctrine of self-defence. This is the justification of Self-defence in International law.</p> <p>In the United Nations system characterized by a decentralized machinery of its legal system, the enforcement of International law and the protection of rights recognized by International law is, traditionally, a task delegated to the individual members, the sovereign states. Naturally, the right of self-defence in international law features as the basic and fundamental right of every member state. Within the last fifty years, international community has moved towards a degree of centralization hitherto unknown; and with that development the prohibition of individual use of force has come pari pasu. Thus, the need to define the right of self-defence with some precision arises from this development, for, as the main exception to the general prohibition of force, the right of self-defence if left undefined and unregulated could virtually deny the prohibition on the use of force any real meaning.</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE OF SELF-DEFENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF THE DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE OF SELF-DEFENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW", "id": 114}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>A company has over time proven to be a very viable form of business, the company has grown tremendously in size and number of shareholders base making it necessary that a few people be selected to manage the company on behalf of the investors since all of them Laws are put in place to put a check on these managers to prevent corporate abuse and ensure that the company is managed with due care and skill to the benefit of the investors. This research has shown that the government lacks the will and determination for the prompt implementation of its laws despite all the efforts made in providing the law, there are also some loopholes can through which fraudulent and dishonest persons can take advantage of for their own personal gains thereby defeating the very essence of the laws which are investors protection. An examination of some of the laws provided to protect investors in Nigeria shows their inadequacies and the fact that it has become a mere academic exercise, ink on paper and is quite different from what is obtainable in practice. Doctrinal method of research was used in this research referring to statutory laws, textbooks, journals, newspapers and internet materials. The findings were that; there is the lack of will by the regulatory bodies to implement the law, company meetings have been provided as an important tool for investors’ protection in Nigeria but that has been circumvented through late delivery of the notice of meetings or inefficiency of the postal system, the Companies and Allied Matters Act did not provide for qualifications for people to be appointed as members of the audit committee and the inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company and also in a bid for the provision of Section 63 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act to provide for division of powers among the board of directors and the shareholders it ended up bringing in terms as’ good faith’ and ‘due diligence’ which are subjective terms. It is therefore recommended that; The regulatory bodies should ensure prompt implementation of its laws and policies; it should be mandatory that companies should use the message alerts and emails in addition to the traditional form of notice to inform share holders of any company meeting; The Companies and Allied Matters Act should provide for people to be appointed as members of the audit committee should be people with knowledge in accounting, company law and vast experience and section 63(4)of the Companies and Allied Matters Act should be Expunged. In conclusion it can be said that investors’ protection does not lie on the Government alone but on all stakeholders, it lies on the investors sought to be protected to be vigilant, exercise all their rights provided by law and for the regulatory bodies to live up to their role and enforce the provisions of the law when there is any violation.</p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>An investor is a person who puts money into financial schemes, shares, or property with the expectation of making a profit.1An investor is someone who commits capital in order to gain financial returns or a person who commits money to investment products with the expectation of financial return. An investor is a person, company, or Organization who has money invested in a venture with a hope of returns especially one that holds stock in publicly owned corporation. Generally, the primary concern of an investor is to minimize risk while maximizing return. An investor can be a shareholder or a creditor. A person who buys shares or owns shares in a company becomes an investor in that company and a person, company or organization that lends money or supplies goods on credit to a company becomes a creditor of that company.</p> <p>The company is a dominant feature in every facet of the Nigerian economy from banking to oil and gas, health to recreation, construction to agriculture just to mention a few. In every company there are investors. Gone are the days when sole proprietorship was the most preferable form of business wherein the capitalists invested and earned profits out of the business for themselves. Though sole proprietorships still exist, they are not the most common forms of business today. Taste of the consumers have changed, technology has advanced manifold and production at large scale. To meet these needs the company form of business came into existence to accommodate the shift from traditional goods to capital goods and technological products which require huge amount of labour and capital, supply which was not possible for a person or handful of persons to readily make available by the sole proprietorship.</p> <p>The company is a means whereby the wealth of innumerable individuals has been concentrated into huge aggregates and whereby control over this wealth has been surrendered to a unified direction. The power attendant upon such concentration has brought forth princes of industry whose position in the community is yet to be defined. The surrender of control over their wealth by the investors has effectively broken the old property relationships and has raised the problem of defining these relationships anew. The direction of industry by persons other than those who have ventured their wealth has raised the question of the motive of such direction and the effective distribution of the returns from business enterprise.</p>\n\nAN EXAMINATION OF INVESTORS’ PROTECTION UNDER NIGERIAN LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"

entitled ‘AN APPRAISAL OF THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW RELATING TO DOMICILE IN NIGERIA’, is aimed at examining the legal framework of the law relating to the concept of Domicile in Nigeria. However, in the course of this research, the finding of the researcher is that there is a gaping hole in the application of the rules of Domicile especially that of Domicile of Choice in inter-state situation like Nigeria. For instance, according to the traditional concept, the rule of Domicile is to the effect that, to acquire a Domicile of choice, a person must satisfy, amongst others, a principal condition that he must have an intention of remaining in a country or place permanently or at least, indefinitely. This is not practically possible or feasible in Nigeria. Nigeria is a country made up of many States with various ethnic flavors where there is a high mobility of persons as a result of inter-marriages, work and search for ‘greener pastures’. The need to address this unsuitable circumstance constitutes the justification for this research. In the light of this, therefore, the objective of this research is to identify the challenges of the present practice to make viable recommendation as a way forward to addressing the challenges identified. In the final analysis, this research work is concluded by recommending, amongst others, that there should be a consideration of habitual residence as a requirement for acquisition of Domicile of choice rather than intention to reside permanently in a place. The research methodology relied upon will be doctrinal and the sources of information include relevant text materials, statutes, judicial decisions, journals and internet sources.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The concept of Domicile had its evolution from the 13th Century Italy as a result of the teachings and commentaries of a group of jurists known as the Post-glossators. The Post-glossators were distinguished jurists attached to the Law schools of Bologna, Padua, Peruggia and Pavia in Italy. Pre-eminent amongst these jurists was Bartolus Sassoferato, successive Professor of Law at Bologna, Pisa and Peruggia who may aptly be described as the „Father of Private International Law‟ or what is usually referred to as Conflicts of Law.1 The Post-glossators originated a theory called „Statute theory‟ and by this theory, they interpreted each statute in any local territory in order to ascertain its object and thus, its rightful sphere of application. To this end, they classified each law that concerns a person or thing, into three categories namely, real, personal or mixed law. A real statute is one whose principal object is to regulate things; a personal statute is one that chiefly concerns persons whereas a mixed statute concerns acts such as the formation of contract. According to the Post-glossators, real statutes are essentially territorial. Their application is restricted to the territory of the enacting sovereign. Personal statutes, on the otherhand, applies only to persons domiciled within the territorial jurisdiction of the enacting Sovereign, but they remain so applicable even within the jurisdiction of another Sovereign‟s territory.2 The distinction drawn by the Post-glossators between real and personal statutes led to the universal recognition that question affecting the status of a person should be govern constantly by one and the same law, irrespective of where he may happen to be or where the facts giving rise to the questions affecting him may have occurred.3 This indeed set the stage for the questions affecting status of a person to be determined by the law of the domicile of the person involved. Until the turn of the 19th Century, Domicile was universally recognized as the basis for the determination of the personal law. According to Cheshire, the principles of domicile had no rival for over five Hundred years.4 However, beginning from 1804 when the French Civil Code first adopted the test of Nationality as the basis for the determination of the personal law, the pride of place that domicile had hitherto enjoyed began to be considerably weakened. In present times, it has fallen out of favour with many legal systems.5 Despite this, in England and a great number of the commonwealth countries including Nigeria, Domicile have continued to be the basis for the determination of the personal law. For instance, in Molekwu Vs Molekwu,6 the Court of Appeal defined personal law as “the law of the deceased that was prevailing or predominant in the area or locality of the deceased.” Indeed, over the years, Domicile has become strictly a common law concept.</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW RELATING TO DOMICILE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW RELATING TO DOMICILE IN NIGERIA", "id": 117}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>In recent times there has been a renaissance of the Islamic heritage in the consciousness of the adherents of the Islamic faith and this has sought expression in their quest to conduct their affairs in accordance with Islamic injunctions. This has become noticeable in areas where Islam is the predominant religion in northern Nigeria. In the past decade, there has been a renewed focus on the Islamic law system, with twelve(12) of the nations thirty six states adopting it in public proclamations. The focal point of this research is a critical assessment of the likening of Islamic law to customary law in relation to the case in focus- <em>Alkamawa v Bello &amp;anor</em>and with a unanimous voice, the Supreme court in its full Constitution categorically and clearly brought to rest the point that Islamic law is not in similitude with customary law. Its uniqueness and distinction from customary law was succinctly enunciated on the account of the fact that it has no particularity with any tribe. It is more universal than tribal. And as though intensive and extensive x-ray was made clear. With no few instances, this research examines various reasons why Islamic law cannot be fairly and squarely regarded as customary law. The methodology of this work is a critical analysis of the subject and mode of collecting data for the richness and accuracy of this work is built within statutes, case laws, textbooks, articles, internet researches etc. In furtherance, and on a note of finality, conclusions and recommendations were made to the effect that the fact that other religions are not freely at operation in the country, therefore, the wings of Islamic law and its accompanying operations in the northern region of Nigeria should be clipped.</p>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF ISLAMIC LAW AS CUSTOMARY LAW VIZ A VIZ THE SUPREME COURT RULING IN ALKAMAWA V BELLO AND ANOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF ISLAMIC LAW AS CUSTOMARY LAW VIZ A VIZ THE SUPREME COURT RULING IN ALKAMAWA V BELLO AND ANOR", "id": 118}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Insider trading has been understood to the act of dealing in unpublished price sensitive information and it is seen to go against the principle of equal access to information.

All human livelihoods and activities are directly or indirectly dependent on land at varying thresholds yet land is a limited somewhat scare resource with both artificial and natural usage barriers which has resulted in various shades of competition for its utilization and in recent times has become fiercer largely due to increasing human and animal population. Farmers and Herdsmen conflict has removed the most preponderant resource use conflict in Nigeria. This research work encompasses the relationship between farmers and cattle herdsmen in Nigeria; America and other African sub-region. The basis of this study borders on the conflict that has arisen between the farmers and herdsmen, the different methods that can be used for its resolution and how the law comes into play to restore normalcy in their relationship in order to ensure agricultural sustainability in the country. For the purpose of this research, the methods of data collection adopted are references, statute books, text books, articles, journals, and newspaper and internet materials on the subject matter.</p>\n\nFARMERS AND HERDSMEN CLASHES; BOLSTERING AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FARMERS AND HERDSMEN CLASHES; BOLSTERING AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF LAW", "id": 120}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Legal academics study the law extensively, but the great bulk of this research dwells upon the analysis of particular laws or doctrines as judged by standards of justice or individual liberty or simple positive formalism.

The now-flourishing law and economics movement has stepped into this void, but even much of that movement’s research has focused on particularized doctrines and micro-level theoretical analyses of efficiency rather than empirical studies of the structural features that conduce to growth. There remains a relative paucity of academic legal research on the big picture – what particular laws and legal institutions are conducive to the overall economic welfare of society.</p>\n\nLAW AND ECONOMIC GROWTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LAW AND ECONOMIC GROWTH", "id": 121}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The internal security of lives and property in Nigeria is the paramount duty of designated security agencies such as the Nigeria Police Force. Policing can therefore be viewed as the provision of security and the maintenance of peace. To secure a large Federation of Nigeria with about 170 million population and 36 States and Federal Capital Territory of Abuja obviously will not be an easy task. The security agencies are therefore encumbered with enormous threats to national security and other factors which affect effective and efficient performance of maintaining the peace and securing lives and property. There have been clamor recently for state policing in order for the police force to be more efficient. This is without its own flaws. The pertinent question to ask at this stage will be: What is the concept and scope of state policing in Nigeria? What is the constitutional and statutory structure and functions of the Nigeria Police Force? What are the challenges of national security faced by the Nigerian state? What are the factors that militate against policing in the maintenance of national security? What are the laws and policies governing state policing? How will policing of the federating states help in solving the problems faced by the Nigeria Police Force? A critical review of the extant law and policies on policing the Federation of Nigeria by this researcher looked at the adequacy or otherwise of the law and policies in place and the extent it has helped the security agencies to carry out the mandate of securing the federation. The study also looked at the call from some quarters for state police, its relevance and implications, its advantages and disadvantages. Based on the critical review, the researcher pointed out areas of law and policies that require improvement and recommended the way forward for better policing of the Federation of Nigeria.</p>\n\nPOLICING THE FEDERATING STATES OF NIGERIA: A CRITIQUE OF THE LAW AND POLICIES INVOLVED<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " POLICING THE FEDERATING STATES OF NIGERIA: A CRITIQUE OF THE LAW AND POLICIES INVOLVED", "id": 122}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research study borders on examining the discriminations that women in Igboland face as regards the acquisition of property and inheritance of same upon death of their husband or father. It is a settled fact that women would grievously suffer from various inequalities and discrimination. So the Supreme Court in the case of <em>ukeje v ukeje</em> held that any customary law which says or tends to suggest that a female child cannot inherit the property of her father is not only unconstitutional but also null and void.In an attempt to identify the problems of gender discrimination of women’s right to inheritance under Igbo customary law are due to some factors which include non-codification of customary laws,illiteracy,limitating the right of women in and out of marriage due to obnoxious custom. The research is an attempt to identify those laws that discriminate against women from inheritance within the Igbo customary law which the law intends to wipe our through effective and legal means.This will be done by a critical analysis of the celebrated case of <em>ukeje v ukeje</em> and other legislative enactments and Judicial decisions, information gathered from researches and authors. The findings are that with the recent judicial decisions and our legislations,these obnoxious custom can be scrapped out entirely in Igboland. In achieving this,the researcher adopted doctrinal and approach. It relies on primary and secondary sources of gathering material l. Therefore, This work recommend the need for free legal services and advice as regards property rights should be made available to women in Anambra State to enable them protect and enforce their property rights. This could be achieved by targeting strategic places like churches, markets and rural areas which have large population of women who are not educated. Also there is need for improvement and enforcement of our laws on women’s right to inheritance. Recommendations are made and if followed will help liberate women from the shackles of property rights deprivation.</p>\n\nREVISITING THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT CASE OF UKEJE V UKEJE VIS A VIZ IGBO CUSTOMARY LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " REVISITING THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT CASE OF UKEJE V UKEJE VIS A VIZ IGBO CUSTOMARY LAW", "id": 123}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Men and women are entitled to the full protection of their rights because they are human beings. At its most basic level, ‘human rights’ are safeguarded prerogative granted because a person is alive. A right is therefore a claim to something (by the right of the holder) that can be exercised and enforced under a set of grounds or justification without interference from others. The question of the ‘universal’ or relative character of the rights declared in the major instruments of the human rights movement has been a source of debate and advocacy. The contests between these positions took on renewed vigour as the human movement slowly developed and reneged on making specific provision on gender issues, significant development emerged over the decades between claims related with cultural relativism on one hand, and universalism on the other hand, as they relate to gender in different territories. The international human rights literature has conceptualized the problem of discrimination of women as involving self-determination. This research considers discrimination as resulting from creation, maintenance and perpetuation of structures of inequality against women as opposed to men. It also argues that the Nigerian government and human rights activists, by being more responsive to the international regimes of human rights, do not pay sufficient attention to indigenous philosophies, traditions and socio-cultural factors which hamper the effective actualization of rights to all human beings . In Africa, the treaty that cursorily provides for the protection of reproductive and sexual rights is the African Charter on Human and People’s rights and the protocol to the African charter situates sexual health and rights within the recognition of women’s reproductive rights as human rights. The adoption of the protocol signified a renewed commitment to the advancement of women’s rights as human rights in African region and reinforces international law on women’s equality.</p>\n\nTHE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF WOMEN’S RIGHTS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF WOMEN’S RIGHTS IN NIGERIA", "id": 124}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study is aimed at studying the customary land laws and tenurial practices of the communities of the Nigerian Lower Benue River valley. These communities are the Idomas and the Tivs of Benue state, and the Alagos, Eggon, Mada, and Gwandara peoples of Nasarawa State. The methodology adopted was a survey approach which incorporated primary data captured through questionnaire and interviews. The work has shown that in the area of study, all the land were acquired originally by settlement on virgin land. All the communities studied, except Alago, recognise inheritance as a means of acquiring land. All land in Alago community is held purely communally and not by families. In Alagoland a member of the community can be dispossessed of his portion of land for misbehaviour. In all the communities studied, the main mode of obtaining land by family members, is through allocation to adult males. In Tiv community, the allocation is on the basis of stirps (mothers’ portions). Partition is unknown among the communities studied. Pledge is recognized in all the communities studied, except among the Madas and the Gwandaras, who only recognize pledge of economic trees. When a pledgee or a customary tenant leaves the land in Idomaland and in Tivland, he can come back to the land to reap economic trees he planted on the land. Thus, the principle of <em>quic quid plantatur solo solo cedit </em>does not apply in Tiv and Idoma communities. In the other communities, the matter is not as clear cut; it will be subject to negotiations or prior agreement. Customary tenancy is recognized in all the communities studied except Alago. Alienation is by consultation and consent of family members and the head of the family or community. All the communities studied do not recognize long usage or adverse possession as bestowing title on a stranger. All the communities studied recognize the role of the family head, who must be a male member of the family. He must be consulted in every land transaction, but his refusal to consent does not nullify the transaction. In all the communities studied, women cannot head a family and are not entitled to portions of land. The conclusion from this work is that the land law and tenure practices of the six communities studied differ slightly from one another, but differ significantly from those recognized among the Yoruba custom, which is the most researched of all communities in Nigeria. Most of the concepts of customary land law among the Yorubas do not apply to the communities studied. It is recommended that women should head families and should be entitled to portions of land to avoid discrimination outlawed by the 1999 Constitution. The Alago communal holding custom should be dismantled to allow for development. The principle of quic quid plantatur should apply in Benue and Tiv communities so that former tenants and pledgees do not encumber the land they have left.</p> <p>[- 7 -]</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Customary land tenure practices are the accepted rules of practices in particular communities in terms of the customs, customary laws and norms which guide how land is used that avoid friction among the people. The communities in this study are agrarian area in the middle belt of Nigeria where land is primarily used for farming. These communities are the Idomas and the Tivs of Benue State, and the Alagos, Eggons, Madas and Gwandaras of Nasarawa State.

Another reason for studying customary land law in Nigeria at the present time is because the provisions of the Act are not known in the rural areas and even in the urban and sub-urban areas where the provisions of the Act are known, tjhey are not appreciated.

The study was designed to investigate whether the customary laws in the communities are the same with those of the more researched communities in Nigeria. The second aim is to investigate whether the customary laws and practices with regard to land differ among the communities <em>inter se.</em> There are other ethnic tribes in the two States (Benue and Nasarawa), such as the Igedes in Benue State and the Ebirra Koto, Yeskwa, Afor and Gwari in Nasarawa State. However, the communities selected for this study are the more prominent ones occupying a continuous block of land, broken only by River Benue.</p> <p><strong>1.1 HISTORY AND SOCIOLOGY OF THE COMMUNITIES COVERED BY</strong></p> <p><strong>THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Law, particularly customary laws , reflect the history and sociological</p> <p>nature of the people.

This would make most of this work concentrated on women. Women in Nigeria like their counter parts the world over, suffer domestic violence irrespective of age, class, religion, or social status.</p> <p>      Physical violence in particular is very common among intimate partners in both developed and developing countries.

The provision in section 42 of Nigeria constitution, guarantees all Nigeria including women, the right from discrimination on basis sex. Section 34 also guarantees every citizen the right to dignity of human person which in it subsection (a) it forbids torture and inhuman or degrading treatments, subsection (b) it forbids the subjection of anybody to slavery or servitude yet violence against women continues unabated, unchecked and this has been blamed on the loopholes in our laws, some of which undermine the provision for equality in the constitution.</p> <p>In our society, many women are violently treated by their intimate partners while they suffer in silence. In some cases, domestic violence leads to the death of these women. This should not be allowed to continue because women are crucial to the growth and development of any nation and the world at large. They are homemakers, custodians of social, cultural and fundamental values of the society; and permanent change is often best achieved through them. Full community development is impossible without their understanding, cooperation and effective participation. Considering all these, women deserve better treatment but opposite are usually the case. Wife battery affects the physical and psychological wellbeing of the abused women and even that of their children. It is on this premise that this paper discusses the meaning of domestic violence against women, types of intimate partner violence, effects of these types of violence on abused women and their children. This paper also discusses causes and management of domestic violence against women. In conclusion recommendations were made to eradicate this menace from the society.</p>\n\nVIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN NIGERIA EXPERIENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN NIGERIA EXPERIENCE", "id": 126}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 chose certain rights to protect under chapter IV and termed them as Fundamental Rights. These rights are chosen to be protected not only by the Constitution, but also by the African Charter on Human and Peoples „Right. Whenever there are breaches of these fundamental rights, the law provides a procedure for their enforcement, which is the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2009. The basic objective of the 2009 Rules is to facilitate enforcement procedure by removing some of the impediments in 1979 rule. Unfortunately it is clear that the procedure for enforcement of Fundamental Rights is still bedeviled by delay. Many applications alleging serious human rights violations are routinely struck out or dismissed. However, the pertinent question is: to what extent are the human rights provision in these legal instruments realized or enforced? It is worthy of note that there are equally other important impediments in the realization of the objective of Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2009, such as the distinction between main claim and ancillary claim in the Nigerian fundamental rights, because litigants are cautious of whether or not their claim will succeed because of this distinction. This research examines the problem of delay associated with the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2009 This dissertation made an in depth analysis of the rules and considered to what extent it achieved its objective in order to enhance a robust human right regime. To achieve a close –to- accurate‟ if not accurate result, the research embarked on a field work. To this end, both doctrinal and empirical method of research is used. This research found out that the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2009, though has brought tremendous changes in the field of human rights protection (e.g the abolishment of locus standi and leave, is still faced with some major setback like the issue of principal and ancillary claim in the enforcement of fundamental rights and the jurisdiction of the National Industrial Court which is not clear in the rule. The work recommend that Courts should do away with the dichotomy between principal and ancillary and the definition of courts in the Rule should include the National Industrial Court.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Fundamental Rights are rights derived from natural or fundamental or constitutional law1. They are rights which remain in the realm of domestic law, which are recognized, entrenched and guaranteed in the constitution of a country or any other legal instrument such as the African Charter on Human and People‟s Rights. Fundamental Human Rights are also described as rights which are inalienable and guaranteed to every person.</p> <p>The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the African Charter on Human and Peoples‟ Right guarantee fundamental human rights. These Fundamental Human Rights are not privileges in the sense that they could be withdrawn at the whims and caprices of the government of the day. They are rights which the executive and legislature are enjoined to respect and the judiciary to protect. However, there are instances where these guaranteed rights are violated either by the law enforcement agents or in quasi-judicial proceedings2</p> <p>Furthermore, where there are breaches of these rights, the appropriate means to secure the enforcement of the victims‟ fundamental right is paramount. It is against this background that the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules was enacted. On 29th May, 1999, a new constitution came into being. Some judicial opinions3 were of the view that the Fundamental Rights ( Enforcement Procedure ) Rules1979 was dead pursuant to section 42(3) which provides who to make rules for the practice and procedure for the High court towards the enforcement of the provision of Chapter IV. For effective enforcement of the rights guaranteed under the 1999 Constitution, the 2009 Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules was enacted, It was signed In November 11,2009 by the then Chief Justice IdrisLegboKutigi and came into force with immediate effect replacing the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure)Rules 1979.</p> <p>The purpose of the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules is to facilitate the enforcement of fundamental rights. The Rules provide for redress where there is a violation or even apprehension of likely violation of these rights. The fundamental rights are provided in Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution and Chapter 1 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples‟ Rights. Where the violation has occasioned injury which could be compensated in financial terms, courts are duty bound to make orders of reparation in monetary terms if applied for and proved.</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS UNDER THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE) RULES 2009 IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS UNDER THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE) RULES 2009 IN NIGERIA", "id": 127}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>One of the goals of Nigeria Agricultural Development policy is to achieve for the nation enough food sufficient for the consumption and utterly reduce the rate of dependency on imported foods, with the view of ensuring adequate and affordable food for all. This research work is aimed at evaluating food sufficiency situation in Nigeria looking at the intervals between 1991-2016. This research reveals that there is a shortfall in locally produced food. Taking into account the total population of Nigeria to 3.2% whereas the ratio of domestically produced food has been reduced to 1% which is an indication that the demand for food is far reached and higher than the supply for such food.some of the identifiable factor responsible for this include,inconsistency in government policies, corruption, environmental degradation and unsuitable agricultural produce, therefore this research reveals that Nigeria solely depends to a great extent on imported food. Finally this study equally reveals various government policies, institutions and legal framework on achieving food sufficiency in Nigeria.This research work adopted analytical and comparative approaches in the analysis of relevant materials to the research contained in Nigeria and other international legislations, decided cases, journals, articles, newspapers and magazines including other relevant internet sources.

While the exact scope of human rights may be in dispute, the researcher has no doubt that any discussion which has the possibility of enhancing the quality of man’s existence on earth must be related to the rights of man.<br/>It could be correctly asserted that there has been concern for human rights since antiquity through the various stages of socio-economic formations upto the modern era. In the study of human rights, one encounters relevant legal acts, constitutions, statutes and international instruments, various terms and notions other than human rights. These include fundamental rights fundamental freedoms, civil liberties and civil rights, individual and collective human rights as well as people’s rights1. It is also relevant to mention that the activities of man’s right from birth to his death are directed by an incessant desire and search for justice and ceaseless efforts to avoid injustice.<br/>Thus, as would be seen hereunder, the issue of human rights and National Security has become contentious question of concern. This is not unconnected with the fact that Human right claims at times directly or indirectly affect the national security of the area where the agitation is made. The two dominant players in the arena being the state and individual (citizens) often times overlook the necessity of striking a balance between protection and enforcement of Human rights and the maintenance or promotion of National Security. This failure to strike a balance at times lead to suppression of human rights to the detriment of the citizens in one hand, and inordinate claims of rights which could become a threat to National security on the other hand.<br/>From time immemorial, the state has been placed with the task of promoting the inalienable rights of its citizens and as well as protecting and safe guarding National security. From the state of nature, when might was right to the emergence of a civilized Society and submission of absolute power to the state, man has been the cause of human rights abuses and National Insecurities. A good instance could be seen in aspect of domination and assertion of liberation from dominance as evidenced in outbreak of civil wars.<br/>Attempt is made in defining the relevant terms “National Security” has been defined to mean freedom from fear, risk, danger, vulnerability or susceptibility. Because self – preservation or survival is regarded as the first law in nature, security logically becomes a primary consideration of any Government. It is small wonder then that Section 14 (1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria unambiguously prescribes that “the security and welfare of the people shall be a primary purpose of government”. Thus, conceptualized national security is a collective or public good that governments try to provide for all their citizens, regardless of the quantum of resources which individuals and communities contribute through taxation and regardless of the fortunes and performance of others who may be described as “free-riders” those who enjoy the benefits of collective goods but pay little or nothing for them.3<br/>National security is also used in its widest sense to include not only the measures relating to the preservation of the country’s physical entity,<br/>But also the preservation of the country’s political stability, it’s economic and national interests, and the general protection of the safety and well – being of it’s citizen. Government’s constitutional responsibility for guaranteeing the security and welfare of its people necessarily entails discharging certain obligations under municipal law and international law.<br/>Domestically, this obligation calls for the making of laws, rules and regulations aimed at ensuring peace, order, safely of lives and property as well as good governance of the country. Internationally, government is obligated to observe international law, which protects the lives of citizens and promotes their welfare.<br/>A comprehensive conceptualization of the notion of national security distinguishes between two contending viewpoints. One is the conventional security Doctrine which perceives national security as being associated with the protection and defence of the irreducible minimum of a states vital interests or core values such as the preservation of political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state interests or values which can only be maintained by military prowess4. That is why in classical terms, military might is considered the principal instrument for guaranteeing national security. It is pertinent to indicate that Section 217 (2) 5 deals with the “Armed Forces” of the Federation, composed of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force while the “Security Forces” or the “Security Machinery” in Nigeria other than the Armed Forces include the office of the National Security Adviser; and the Prison Service.<br/>As is well known in performing their constitutional functions, the security agencies may incorporate or coordinate the activities of other bodies such as the Fire Service, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the Nigeria Police, the State Security Service (SSS), the National Intelligence Agency, (NIA), Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Custom Service (CS) etc.<br/> 6. Appeal No. CA/A/245/M/2005 <br/>Consequently, it should be noted that the work also discusses in details how National Security overrides individual rights in protection of human right as was buttressed in the case of ALHAJI MUJAHID DOKUBO-ASARI V STATE 6. Where the learned counsel for the respondent contended that “where national security is threatened or there is the real likelihood of it being threatened, human rights or individual rights of those responsible takes second place. Human rights or individual rights must be suspended until the national security can be protected or well taken care of”.<br/>At the end of this work, the researcher would be able to say with certainty whether National Security should override the individual’s human rights and also how it affects most rights known as the fundamental rights<br/>of a Nigerian citizen as enshrined in chapter Iv of the 1999 Constitution. <br/> 1.1    DEFINITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS <br/>        As a preambular remark, Human Rights stricti sensu cannot be construed as Fundamental Human Rights. Human Rights have a vast applicability and are not limited to territorial borders of a state while Fundamental Rights are applicable within a particular country and is more particularistic than Human Rights.<br/> 7. Yewens V Noakes (1890) 6 Q. B. D. 530 at 532<br/>        Thus, following the definition of Human Right in discourse, it is to be noted that there is no unanimity in the definition of human rights by both legal and political writers. According to THESIGER l.J,7 “definitions are proverbially dangerous”. This contention agrees with the Latin maxim “Omnis definitio in Lege periculosa” - which means that all definition in law are dangerous.<br/>The idea behind such contention is premised on the fact that every definition is distilled from the perspective of learning and experience of the author.<br/>        However, many writers and jurists had fashioned out some useful definitions, which have satisfied to an extent the search for a workable definition respecting the concept.<br/>        Human rights are rights that belong to every human being they are attributes of a person as a human being.<br/>        According to CRANSTON, “Human rights are something of which no one may be deprived without a great affront to justice. There are certain deeds, which should never be done, certain freedoms, which should never be done, certain freedoms that should never be invaded, something that are suppressive sacred.<br/>        DOWRICK, defines human rights as’, “Those claims made by men, for themselves, or on behalf of other men, supported by some theory which concentrates on the humanity of man, on man as a human being, a member of human kind.<br/>Sowrick’s thought though shrouded in ambiguity can be linked to the philosophy of natural laws, which in its time was politically motivated, in spite of its religious and ethnical colourations. The developing capitalist class of the early 19th century waged their war against feudalism on the banner of the ideas of natural law, which also centers on the humanity of man.<br/>        According to OSITA EZE,<br/>“Human rights represents demands or claims which individuals or groups make on society, some of which are   protected by law and have become part of Lex Lata while others remain aspirations to be attained in future10.<br/>        Another constitutional law jurist, Sir IVOR JENNINGS saw human rights as “rights which are commonly recognized as essential for effective social life and which, being considered to be inherent in the idea of justice, should be protected…exactly what they depend upon the state of opinion and the organization of the society”.<br/>        A learned author 11 in his book introduction to International Human Rights and Humanitarian Laws defined Human rights as “those rights, which are inherent in our nature and without which no society is viable and able to survive”.<br/>With regards to the definition, this researcher, without trepidation, defines “Human right as standardized rights with moral and civil contents, recognized universally as appertaining to humans, necessary for an ordered civilized relations, recognized and protected by law for the betterment of the society.<br/>        Definitions of human rights may be in exhaustive, and need not be amplified in its entirety in this work. However, this takes us to paragraph one of the preambles to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which in defining Human Rights states, “…Recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of members of the family is the foundation for freedom, justice and peace in the world”.<br/>        Taking a critical look at the definitions canvassed above, certain common ingredients are palpable. One is that Human rights are quintessentially universal in nature. All human beings everywhere by virtue of being human possess them. This smacks of the fact that Human Rights standard are internationally applicable regardless of cultural or religious difference. In so saying, this researcher acts ex abundanti cautela, not ignoring the concept of “cultural relativity”. The concept of cultural relativity opines that some human rights provisions are recognized and enforced in some areas because of certain cultural peculiarities inherent therein, which has bearing to the values of that society.<br/>        Another important factor is that Human Rights focuses on Rights and freedom of the individual with emphasis on the corresponding obligations of the states. These obligations can be active in nature, entailing an obligation to provide something or allocate resources, or passive as in where the obligation is to refrain from taking action.<br/>        Finally, they are based on mankind’s increasing demand for a life in which the inherent and worth of each person receives equal respect and protection through some may be limited only for legitimate purposes. Our attempts so far at ascribing meaning to Human Rights takes us to another aspect of this chapter, the impact and development of Human Right.<br/> IMPACT AND DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS <br/>Since the adoption of the universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, there has been a continuing concern for the protection of certain basic rights, which a man is entitled to enjoy by the mere fact that he is a human being. The concept of human right is as old as human society and was evolved, to a large extent as an instrument of revolt against tyrannical Government. Thus, there is no doubt that the history of humankind is marked by efforts to ensure respect for the dignity of human beings. The concept of the Human Right was introduced and developed by thinkers from cultural and religious traditions. An important tradition to the promotion of this idea was made by statesmen and lawyers. Written norms establishing protection of the rights of individuals were gradually inscribed in the national laws.<br/>In discussing this sub-head, a good start is the historical perspective of human rights development. In his book, Prof. Osita Eze opined that concern for human rights held it’s root from the time of the Greek city states through the various stages of socio-economic formations. This was seen in the political economy of the ancient states as exemplified in the struggle between the privileged and the oppressed. Thus, under the slave society, the individual was seen as a chalet. Under feudalism, the labourers or serfs were seen as inferior breed of human species and as such were subjected to a degrading and hard labour to satisfy the needs of the overlords. However some progress were made under capitalism since the idea of liberal democracy allowed to some extents, the exercise of political and civil rights. The impact of such freedom was not pronounced because the ruling class by its effective control of the means of production and by dominating the political, legal and other areas of the superstructure determined the limits of human rights evolution and protection.<br/>As the society progressed, the European and Arabian contact with Africans and its consequential colonialism had a definite impact on humans and their rights in terms of values embodied in their laws and customs. This was a great pathway to the evolution, impact and development of human rights conception in Nigeria. The missionaries fanned the ambers of it’s protection as the churches took it upon themselves to examine the content of the divine laws, frowning at human sacrifices and killing of twins which were fragrant violations to right to life and dignity of human persons. Even though the colonial constitution has some human rights provisions, therein, and courts do administer same, colonialism was instrically a contradiction to human rights. The domination and exploitation of the natural resources of the colonized states deprived the people of the material means to ensure effective promotion and protection of human rights.<br/>The Declaration of 1948 is one of the most important milestones in mankind’s effort that actually impacted development of human rights amongst the people. It prescribed and defined the responsibilities and obligations of states to citizens rights or charter, describing it as the rights of the individual vis-à-vis that of the state.<br/>The charter of the United Nations expressed the determination of member States “to re affirm faith in fundamental Human Rights, in the dignity and worth of human person, in the equal rights of men and women…”<br/>Although considered universal, the Declaration has in its fifty years of implementation faced the inevitable challenges of establishing a balance between the enjoyment of rights by citizens and the demands of national security on the other hand. Hence in every country there seem to have arisen specific dilemma or challenges peculiar to individual states in their compliance with the tenets of the Declaration.<br/>As seen above, the evolution of the international Human Rights Convention and treaties is one of the most remarkable features of the development of human rights since 1945. Though progress had been made mainly through treaties. In Nigeria, the Willinks Commission set up in 1958 by the British Colonial Government to look into the demands of minorities recommended the adoption of some of the norms of the 1948 universal Declaration of Human Rights into the Nigerian Constitution as a panacea for fear expressed by the minorities in the country. These norms were adopted and introduced into Chapter V of the Independence Constitution of 1960 as fundamental rights. The above rights were subsequently entrenched in the 1963, 1978, 1989 and 1999 constitutions of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.<br/>Following the discussion above, the researcher of this work comments that:<br/>Given that human rights are seen as on universal affair, and conceding the fact that the Vienna declaration confirms expressively in paragraph 1 that “The Universal nature of these right and freedom is beyond question. Why has our constitution safeguarded only a particular class of right leaving others unprotected? Does it not amount to a breach of international obligation expressed in the Maxim pacta sunt servandi, considering that Nigeria ratified the Vienna Declaration? This dichotomy baffles the researcher as the economic and social rights, which are non justitiable is the sub stratum upon which other rights can be well founded.<br/> SUMMARY OF THE IMPACT<br/>          Human Right has made significant impact on both national and international law. In the National level, the following impacts are evident.<br/>The modification of court rules to specifically cover the enforcement of human rights. An example in point is the Fundamental Human Right Enforcement Procedure Rules 1979.<br/>The formation of Human right organizations and commissions.<br/>The transition of Government from Military to Civil rule was engineered by Human Rights promotion and protection.<br/>Human right has influenced the bench of the judiciary by evincing in some judges radical and pragmatic drives in deciding matters between the state and citizens interse.<br/>In the International arena, focus is not restricted on the state as the sole subject of international law as hitherto contended, but individuals are now seen as subject of international law.<br/>        Equally, claims of title to territory cannot be made without some consideration to the right of the inhabitants of that territory (self determination).<br/>        Human right influence limits the sovereignty of states, since the treatment of an individual by a state is seen as a matter of international concern and not to be left exclusively for national or domestic jurisdiction especially during military and autocratic regimes.<br/> CLASSES OF RIGHTS<br/>Jurisprudentially, only a right recognized and protected by the legal system can be considered as right striti sensu.<br/>According to AYOOLA JSC<br/>“There are various classes of rights. There are proprietary rights and non-proprietary rights. There are rights protected by private law as well as rights protected by public. A person who is elected to an office acquires a right protected by public law to assume that office. It is a right law to assume that office. It is a right which only persons elected have and which a person not elected does not have…”12<br/>         These rights are generally grouped under five sub-headings: civil, political, social, economic and cultural. <br/>        Civil and political rights are often reformed to as (1st generational rights). They are basically individual right. This 1st generation of rights require government as well as individuals to abstain from unduly interfering with the liberty of person. The civil and political rights include the right to self determination, the right to life, freedom from torture and in human treatment, freedom from slavery and forced labour, the rights to liberty and security, freedom of movement and choice of residence, right to fair trial, right to privacy, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of opinion and expression, the right of assembly, freedom of association, the right to marry and found a family, the right to participate in ones government either directly or through freely elected representatives, the right to nationality and equality before  the law.<br/>The above-mentioned rights are the justiciable rights in Nigeria as same are guaranteed by chapter IV of the constitution.<br/>        Another important classes of rights include social, economic, and cultural rights, which are considered as 2nd generation rights. These rights were fuelled by the consciousness occasioned by the influence of capitalism. They are collective rights because they are best appreciated in the relationship of individuals in the society. They are expensive, requiring expenditure, infrastructure and forward planning. They include the right to work, the right to just conditions of work, the right to fair remuneration,  the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to organize, form and join trade unions, right to collective bargaining, right to equal pay for equal work, right to social security, right to property, right to participate in cultural life and enjoy the benefits of scientific progress. These rights are found in chapter two of the constitution of Nigeria and are non-justiciable except the right to property13, which found way into the category of fundamental rights in the 1999 constitution.<br/>The 3rd generation rights pertain to group and solidarity rights. The African charter awakening, resulting in group consciousness fanned the ambers of this right. Examples of these rights are the right to self determination (no domination), minority rights, right to good development, right to free disposal of natural wealth and resources and right to good environment.<br/> OMMENT: The quest for Ibos to return to Biafra, and the quest for better environment and right to development by the OGONIS is a good example of a third generation right.<br/>        The classification of rights as herein discussed is academic, with no much effort in practice except for enforceability. This assertion is a truism and the court had held in NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY V. I.GP ACCRA14 that “All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent”. Thus, equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation, promotion and protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. In the last resort, they are exercisable within a societal context and impose obligations on the state and the agencies as well as on the individuals not to derogate from these rights and freedom.<br/> THE IDEA OF NATIONAL SECURITY <br/>The Nigerian leaders have always tended to define national security narrowly. Instead of adopting comprehensive national strategic goals that are very capable of uniting the country’s economic development of the nation, national security has always been defined in practical terms to include those who are not in government or oppose government policy.<br/>However, the purpose of national security is to safeguard national values. And the most fundamental value of any nation is survival, self preservation and self-perpetuation. In this regard therefore, the national security goal of Nigeria has always been to expel external aggression and<br/>contain internal up heavals. Under such paradigm, the state military power was the primary focus. But while the rest of the world has now come to recognize economic imbalances, environmental issues, terrorism and weapons proliferation, international health, international migration, natural<br/> resources and shifting demographics as part of the national security equation, Nigeria continues to stick to tired model of national security.15<br/>National security once meant military power. It was later expanded to include International economics; however, according to Mathews (1989), “global developments now suggest the need for another analogous, broadening definition of national security to include resource, environmental and demographics issues”. And indeed, no national state can afford to ignore environmental degradation”. In the Niger Delta region of Nigeria for example, the ongoing agitation and melee is not just as a result of political marginalization, theft and institutional corruption. It is also a consequences of environmental degradation which manifest itself in air and water borne diseases.16 <br/>More so, there is a false sense of safety in Nigeria when it comes to international terrorism. There are no official policies to thwart terrorism.<br/>There are no official policies to dislodge terrorist organizations. Infact, neither the security nor intelligence organizations have had cause to address the issue of international terrorism on Nigeria’s soil. The time has come for a change in attitude, priority and policies especially since Nigeria is already home to several Islamic and Christian fundamentalist groups that are waiting for the opportune time to wreck havoc. By virtue of her position as the “giant of Africa”, Nigeria invariably becomes the object of untold and unwarranted intension from nation-states and extra judicial organizations. That there has not been terrorist incidence does not presuppose safety and security.<br/>Moreover, there are several ethnic groups when feel abandoned and slighted and are open to the belief that “terrorism is the weapon of the weak”. In the Niger Delta and in most of Nigeria, abject poverty is rampant. David Palmer, quoted in Martha Crenshaw’s “Terrorism in context” (1995) suggested that “isolation and poverty” breed terrorism. The recent killings, Wanton destruction of property and the taking of hostages in the riverine areas of Nigeria is the sign of things to come.<br/>The Nigerian security and intelligence agencies are seldom discussed in political arena. Therefore, their successes and failures are shrouded in secrecy. Even so, it could be assumed that there has been more failure than successes. Why for instance, have these agencies not been able to imbed some of their members in the inner circle of these responsible for fanning religious and ethnic conflicts? The federal government must give security and intelligence services a new mandate to combat both local and international terrorism. <br/>The age of associating national security with just external military aggression is over. Terrorism is at the top of “modern” national security. Nigeria cannot pretend it is not home to a network of terrorist. She cannot assume she will never experience a calamity in the magnitude of what happened to the United State on September 11, 2001. Consequently, the time has come for Nigeria to redefine “national security” to include not just military projection, but also environmental security, economic well-being, international health and demographics, and good governance.<br/>According to TORULAGHA (2004), national security must also include “…good governance…Anything short of the totality of good governance minimizes the meaning of national security…unfortunately, in Nigeria and in most states in Africa, the leaders do not seem to realize the importance of good governance and transparency”. It is unfortunate that<br/>Nigeria, for much of its existence as a nation-state, has not been blessed with good governance and transparency, for we have plethora of instances ranging from the violation of human rights, violation of the constitution of Nigeria, violation of court orders by these in power (etc) 18<br/>However, following the sub-heading in discourse, it follows that the discussion would be incomplete without relating it to human right. National security or state security is one of such grounds for limiting the exercise of human rights. The above could be interpreted to include such epithets as public defence, public order, or public peace, (etc). It means any act which appears to be a threat to the peaceful existence of the society, for instance, war, either civil or external wars, unlawful riots which pose a threat to the property, public or private and a threat to public order (etc).<br/>National security as defined above falls within those sets of factors that limit human rights on the sole grounds of the interest of the generality of the society or social good. The rationale for limiting human rights on grounds of social good or interest of other individuals was succinctly put by Lord Denning in the following words:<br/>“The freedom of the just man is worth little to him if he could be preyed upon by the murderer or thief. Every society must have the means to protect itself from marauders. It must have power, to arrest, search and imprison those who break the law so long as those powers are properly exercised, they are themselves the safeguards of freedom”.19<br/> The above statement of the learned jurist is important because apart from approving the need for limitations on human rights, he also suggests that such limitations would only be meaningful and serve their purpose if the powers conferred on any authority to limit human rights is properly exercised within and under the law and not arbitrarily exercised.<br/>Meanwhile, it is common knowledge that authorities vested with such powers to limit human rights more often than not violate these rights hiding under the cloak of such legal factors as National Security, National interest, social good, (etc). It is the intention of the researcher to appraise some of such violations of human rights by the authorities for example, government for selfish reason but purporting to be acting in the interest of the security of the nation.<br/>It is also important to mention at this point that the sanction given to human rights involves a conflict of interest and a balancing of such interest of the individual on the one hand and that of the state on the other hand.<br/>The idea of National Interest or National Security as a limit on human rights is given legal validity in Nigeria by the constitution of Nigeria20, The 1979 Constitution to be precisely provides in section 34, 35, 36, 37 and 38 of the Constitution that “Nothing shall invalidate any law that is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society in the interest of defence, public safety, public order, public morality and public health.21<br/>It is worthy to note that the underlining principle behind the above provisions of Section 41 could be termed National Interest, National Security on social good on the one hand and that of the State on the other hand.<br/>The idea of National interest or National Security as a limit on human right is given legal validity in Nigeria by the 1999 Constitution. The Constitution provides in Section 45(1) as follows:<br/>“Nothing in sections 37,38,39,40 and 41 of this constitution shall invalidate any law that is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society (a) in the interest of defence, public safety, public order, public morality and public health.<br/>It should be noted that the underlining principle behind the above provisions could be termed National Interest National Security or social good.<br/>More so, the Decree No.2 of 1984, makes provision for a valid limitation on human rights on grounds of State Security, for instance, the Decree provides as follows:<br/>“If the vice president is satisfied that any person is or recently has been concerned with acts prejudicial to State Security or has contributed to the economic adversity of the nation, or in the preparation or instigation of such acts and that by reason thereof, it is necessary to exercise control over him, he may by order in writing direct that such person be detained in civil prison or police station or such other place specified by him, and it shall be the duty of the person or persons in chart of such place or places, if an order made in respect of any person is delivered to him, to keep that person in custody until the Order is revoked”.<br/>       A critical evaluation of the above provision of the Decree No. 2 would reveal that the powers conferred on the Vice president to detain citizens is rather too wide and stands the threat of being violated or abused to the detriment of the individual, for instance, provisions like:<br/>If the vice president is satisfied” is rather too wide and unreasonable and susceptible to abuse by the vice president if he so wishes since it lies within his personal satisfaction or judgment to determine what acts are prejudicial to State Security and therefore who should be detained, once the vice president is satisfied and purports to act under the above provisions he can detain any citizen without question.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL SECURITY:  A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE NIGERIAN PERSPECTIVE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HUMAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL SECURITY:  A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE NIGERIAN PERSPECTIVE", "id": 131}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF ELECTION LAWS IN NIGERIA</b><br/> The electoral process is a total process that includes registration of voters, identifying the political parties to be voted for, voting, counting of votes, and declaration of election results. This process is the foundation of civil societies. A strong civil society is vital and needed to serve as the bedrock of a stable democracy. It represents the reservoir of resources -- political, economic, cultural, and moral -- to complement and, when necessary, to check the power of the state. A dynamic and diverse civil society directly stimulates social and political participation, increasing the involvement and commitment of citizens and promoting an appreciation of the obligations, as well as the rights, of citizenship. By providing many potential avenues for political, economic and social expression, a society with a rich associational life gives people a stronger stake in the social order. This in turn, creates a climate within which mutual respect, tolerance, negotiation, and compromise actually make sense, and flourish.<br/>Nigeria claims to be democratic and seeks to prove that under the banner of representation and multi-party political systems. Elections are used as a means by which representatives and policies are decided. The choice between political parties or individual candidates is made through elections. It should be noted that the public function implies elections. This electoral process is the peaceful transfer of power and legitimate exercise of authority. It demands active, broad-based citizen participation. It is the election that actually determines who shall wield power for a number of years as specified by the constitution. An electoral system may be defined as a process in which the mode of coming to power or the change of government is decided in a particular country at a given time.This paper is going to examine the development of several election laws that has been developed and the progression of the laws.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>1.3.0 FOCUS OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4.0 SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5.0 METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0 LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0 CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK OF ELECTORAL LAW IN NIGERIA<br/>2.O.O.INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0.

The Black’s law dictionary defines election as the process of selecting a person to occupy a position or office, usually a public office. 1<br/>Another definition is the one which defines election as the act of selecting someone or something; the exercise of deliberate choice. 2Election is the cornerstone of democracy and it is essentially a contest for the votes of adult members of the society by aspirants to political office. It is worthy of note however that the concept of elections is quite recent in the history of man as it can be traced to the emergence of democratic government. Professor W. Phillips in his book, power and choice; an introduction to political science said:<br/>'In the long swing of the history , elections with broad mass participation are rather new. Such elections originated with democratic government, which means that they came along at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth. Today, elections are<br/>widespread around the world, even though a number of world’s states are not democracies' 3<br/> 1  Blacks' Law Dictionary, Seventh ed. p.536<br/>2  WordWeb Dictionary (Electronic Dictionary)<br/>3  Prof. W. Phillips Shivelly,Power and Choice;An Introduction to Political Science(Us Mc Graw,2003)p.253<br/> From the foregoing , it is clear that elections and democracy are intertwined ,it is therefore appropriate to touch on democracy which can be defined as a form of representative government based on the consent of the people. Jimmy carter, former president of United States said<br/>Democracy is like the experience of life itself-always changing, infinite in its variety, sometimes turbulent<br/>and all the more valuable for being tested 4<br/>The principal medium for translating the people’s consent into government authority is the holding of free and fair elections. However, history has shown that it is usually difficult to hold free and fair elections, even the united states, which is the model for other democracies was faulted in the year 2000, when the elections that led to the victory of president bush was alleged to be marred by irregularities in the state of Florida. In Nwachukwu vs. Eneogwe;it was held that :<br/>Once an election is found, substantially, not to be free and electorate, either by violence or intimidation, has not been allowed freely to cast their votes, the election where such has occurred, ought to, and must be<br/>nullified and a fresh one conducted 5<br/>Nigeria has had its fair share of electoral disputes, the presidential and governorship elections of 1999, 2003 and 2007 were reported to be marred by irregularities in vote tabulation and reporting of results by both foreign and local observers.<br/>Electoral law is that branch of law that seeks to regulate the electoral system which ranges from voters’ registration, political parties registration to collation of results. According to<br/>4  Jimmy Carter ,Former President of the United State<br/>5  Nwachukwu v Eneogwe(1999)4NWLR(Pt600)629; Ojukwu v Onwudiwe (1984)1SCNLR247<br/> Wikipedia, electoral law is a branch of constitutional law which regulates the electoral process.<br/>In this study, the focus will be on Nigeria’s electoral law which has grown a lot from its pre independence period. Nigeria is on the eve of another election which if successful will mark its third uninterrupted transition of power since the last military intervention in 1999. Premised on this, the importance of electoral law in Nigeria cannot be over emphasised. The Nigerian electoral law can be traced back to 1922, with the introduction of the ‘elective principle’ by the then governor-general , Sir Hugh Clifford who in the constitution of 1922 which was named after him made provisions for the election of four representatives to represent the Lagos and Calabar region, however, only male adults were allowed to vote. This ‘elective principle’ is very crucial in the discussion of Nigerian electoral law because it gave room for the formation of political parties which although not like the contemporary<br/>political parties, served its purpose back then. 6 The 1946 constitution by Sir Arthur Richard did not alter the ‘elective principle’ of 1922, this position changed in 1951 when Sir Macpherson became the governor-general, there were more electoral seats and the people were better represented in the colonial government. The Nigerian electoral law and system has since evolved as both legal and institutional framework are put in place to regulate the system and targeted towards ensuring free and fair elections.<br/> 6  Bon Nwakanma SAN and Ngozi Olehi ,Laws Governing Elections and Election Petitions,.p. I,2<br/> 1.1.0:BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/> Nigeria’s electoral development is closely tied to its political experience. Pre-colonial and colonial era did not offer any notable contribution in this regard. Nigeria is a nation of more than 300 ethnic groups and each had a distinct system of operation before the arrival of the British colonial masters through which security and welfare of tribesmen were organized. It was clearly different from the colonial package of political governance of the southern and northern protectorates which were amalgamated in 1914 to become what stands today as Nigeria.<br/>Upon the amalgamation of the southern and northern protectorates in 1914, Lord Lugard became the first governor-general of Nigeria. The white colonial masters were in charge of all the arms of government but from 1922 when Sir Hugh Clifford became the governor-general, an elective principle was introduced whereby four out of forty-six member legislative council made up of twenty-seven unofficial and nineteen official members, this was significant because it was the first of its kind. The elective principle expanded and developed all through the pre-independence times with the various constitutional provisions that came after the Richard’s Constitution .<br/>After independence, Nigeria’s electoral system became more expansive and sophisticated. Various institutions were established to guide and regulate the electioneering process, alongside these institutions, various laws were being promulgated to oversee the electoral process.With a population of over 120million and many expatriate communities across the globe, the largest economy in west Africa, and great political importance in the region ,the African continent , and the global stage, events which affect the future and stability of Nigeria affects the entire world .Nigeria being a democratic state especially since recent times, has to have elections from time to time so as to decide who rules the affairs of the nation and who represents the various ethnics in decision making from the local to the national level. The success of the election to the outlined posts is important not just to the citizens but also to the world in general.<br/>Nigeria faces a major challenge when it comes to holding of elections that are free and fair. The most free and fair and peacefully conducted elections were those in 1959, 1979, and 1993 and the most chaotic, violent and disputed were those in 1964 and 1983. It is also noteworthy that Nigeria has had its fair share of political instability as a result of military intervention at different times in her political history at different times since her independence in 1960.the 2007 election was not without its shortcomings too, in fact, premised on the outcome of the 2007 elections and the reactions of the candidates and citizens which sprung the agitation for a change in the electoral law, the late president Umaru Yar’adua set up an electoral reform committee. However, this is not the first time of such committee or panel at different points in the Nigerian electoral history, various committees have been formed to revise the regulating the electoral system.<br/>From the days of the Clifford’s constitution’s elective principle to the present day, legal and institutional framework has been put in place to regulate the electoral process. Such institutions established include NEC ,FEDECO and now we have INEC. The constitution also provides for election tribunals that hear cases bordering on electoral disputes. On this groundwork, one can say the Nigerian electoral system and electoral law has come a long way notwithstanding the shortcomings.<br/>1.2.0:OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY<br/> The broad objective of this study is to appreciate Nigeria’s political dynamism in relation to her electoral development with special focus on the challenges of the electoral system and different provisions made so as to solve existing problems and forestall future ones, the lapses of such provisions made and suggestions on what can be done to rectify such lapses.<br/>1.3.0:FOCUS OF THE STUDY<br/> In order to meet the broad objectives of this study , I will focus on the following specific objectives:<br/>•    To critically study the historical background of elections in Nigeria with a view to understanding and appreciating the legal and constitutional framework put in place to regulate the electoral process from past times to the present times.<br/>•    Highlight the challenges facing the electoral system and the laws and suggest ways to which the electoral laws and system can be more reliable than what we have today.<br/>1.4.0:SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/> This study covers from the colonial period from post colonial period i.e. 1922 to the present day. The post colonial period is very important in this study because 1922 marked the beginning of electoral process with the introduction of elective principle by Sir Hugh Clifford. The study will also cover the various electoral process ranging from voter’s registration to party systems, this will be done with the view of making the research a diligent one. The study will also talk about electoral disputes making use of important cases which serve as major authorities in the present day electoral law.<br/>1.5.0:METHODOLOGY<br/> The system of method followed in this study is the use of secondary data such as resource materials from the internet, textbooks, law journals, newspapers and law reports .<br/>1.6.0:LITERATURE REVIEW<br/> This sub-chapter reviews the books consulted in the course of this study. One of such books consulted in the course of this study is 'Electoral Law and Practice in Nigeria' by Aderemi Olatubora. The author discourses electoral law in Nigeria in the light of past and present electoral statutes. The first chapter of the book introduces the legal and institutional framework for elections. It considers the function of state independent Electoral Commissions, the limits of the powers of INEC to make bye-laws or Subsidiary Legislations. The chapter also deals with important pre election matters and several other issues on which may turn the much desired victory of a party to an election matter.<br/>Chapter three of the book deals comprehensively with the statutory and constitutional grounds of election through the cases. Here, the learned author has been able to demonstrate clearly that, except the complaint in an election petition is based on any of or a combination of the statutory grounds of non qualification of a successful candidate, invalidity of election as a result of corrupt practices or non compliance with provision of the electoral act, unlawful exclusion of the petitioner from election and the constitutional ground that the successful candidate has not been duly elected, such a complaint will not qualify as an election petition properly so called.<br/>Another book consulted in the course of this study is Laws governing elections and election petitions by Nwakanma SAN, co authored with Ngozi Elehi, this book touches on several election issues and the progression of Nigerian Election Law.<br/>Chapter eleven is devoted to the necessity of requesting for further and better particulars by a party to an election petition where the pleading of the opposing party is vague and general in nature. The author, through the cases , demonstrates that failure to give further and better particulars, when required and ordered , could deprive the party so required to furnish such better and further particulars the opportunity to lead evidence in proof of such averments that are general in nature with the drastic consequences that where the substance of the petition is hinged on the impeached averments, the entire petition may be declared incompetent. This position is amply demonstrated by the case of PRP v INEC referred to.<br/>In chapter twelve, the learned author highlights the procedural necessity of consolidation of election petitions brought by different persons and or entities against the same election return. With high degree of clarity of thought and through the cases, he gives some practical instances when the need for consolidation may arise and concludes this chapter with some notes on the procedure for the withdrawal of election petition. While the latter chapter focuses on the parties in election petition,who can be a petitioner, who should be a respondent, consequences of non-joinder of necessary parties and such other topics relating with the way election petition proceeding is conducted in relation to the parties involved.<br/>On the whole the authors of this book through up to date information assiduously assembled presents a reliable literature on electoral law. They examine the qualifications for positions in Nigeria , the intricacies of conduct of elections and electoral offences in such depths that makes the understanding of electoral law in Nigeria easy.<br/>1.7.0:DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/> With a view to having a better understanding of this study, certain words have to be well defined, these words are words that will occur from time to time in this study and are also of great importance in electoral law. These words are as explained below;<br/>Democracy: democracy is a political form of government in which governing power is derived from the people by consensus (consensus democracy), by direct referendum(direct democracy) or by means of elected representative of the people(representative democracy). Even though there is no specific, universally accepted definition of 'democracy', equality and development have been identified as important characteristics of democracy since ancient<br/>times. 7 Abraham Lincoln defined democracy as 'the government of the people by the people and for the people' 8. Its origin can be traced to the Greek and then democracy meant rule by the people. The majority rule is often described as a characteristics feature of democracy, but without governmental or constitutional protections of individual liberties, it is possible for a minority of individuals to be oppressed by the tyranny of the majority. An essential process in representative democracies is competitive elections that are both substantially and<br/>procedurally. <br/>Another major concept that needs to be defined is election, election is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. Elections<br/>have been the usual mechanism by which representative democracy operates since the 17th century . It has also been defined as an organised event at which somebody is chosen by vote<br/>for something, especially a public office 10. Election can also be defined as a procedure that allows members of an organisation or community to chose representatives who will positions of authority within it. The most important elections select the leaders of local, state and national governments. The chance to decide who will govern t these levels serves as an opportunity for the public to make choices about the policies, programmes and future directions of government action. In Nigeria,election is done/held periodically, earlier in<br/>7  'Democracy Conference'.

This practice may be explained by the fact that though Western civilization and culture have permeated Nigerian society, most people, even the most sophisticated understandably regard themselves as bound by the customary law of their place of origin. The Nigerian Marriage Act has given validity to this practice by enabling who are married under Customary Law to marry each other under the statute.<br/>Some legal questions arise from this practice. It is uncertain whether the statutory marriage supersedes, for all intent and purposes, the previous customary-law marriage, or if the customary law marriage is merely put into abeyance to retrieve after the subsequent statutory marriage has come to an end. There is also the question of whether both marriages co-exist.<br/>The purpose of this project will be to examine all this questions and the position of such marriages and the associated problems in Nigeria.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>1.3.0FOCUS OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4.0SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5.0METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.7.0CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>GLOBAL CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE EXAMINED<br/>2.0.0INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE<br/>2.2.0CONSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE UNDER NIGERIAN LAW<br/>2.2.1CONSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE UNDER CUSTOMARY LAW<br/>2.2.2CONSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE UNDER STATUTORY LAW<br/>3.3.0LEGAL EFFECT OF MARRIAGE IN NIGERIAN<br/>2.4.0CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA: ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS<br/>3.0.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0 DEFINITION OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE<br/>3.2.0 REASONS FOR DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE<br/>3.3.0 IMPLICATION AND EFFECT OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE<br/>3.4.0 PROBLEMS OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>3.5.0 TERMINATION OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>3.6.0 CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>PROSPECT OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.0.0INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0ADVANTAGES OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.1.1SOCIAL BENEFITS OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.1.2ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.1.3JUDICIAL BENEFITS OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.2.0CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY ARTICLES IN JOURNALS ARTICLES ON INTERNET BOOKS <br/>NEWSPAPER REPORT ON THE INTERNET PAPERS PRESENTED AT CONFERENCE, WORKSHOP AND SEMINAR.<br/><br/>\n\nDOUBLE DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA (ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DOUBLE DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA (ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS)", "id": 133}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN APPRAISAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The traditional focus of International Law has been upon the rights and obligations of states while International Criminal Law regulates the conduct of individuals and also punishes those who commit heinous and barbaric crimes against others. The most prevalent of these crimes include genocide, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity.<br/>After the end of World War II, the Allies tried Nazi leaders responsible for the massacre to demonstrate that such would not be permitted in future. In the absence of a permanent criminal court, ad hoc tribunals were established. Unfortunately, in the succeeding years, the world sustained atrocities without having recourse to any permanent global mechanism for the prevention and punishment of such crimes.<br/>Consequently, a treaty establishing the International Criminal Court was adopted in Rome on July 17, 1998 at the Rome Conference. The court came into being on 1 July, 2002 as that was the date its founding treaty, the Rome Statute entered into force and it can only prosecute crimes committed after that date.<br/>Despite the courts various achievements, it still faces some challenges. These include the refusal of the United States to ratify its treaty, the non-cooperation of states that are not parties, lack of universal ratification of the Rome Statute and a host of others. In spite of all these, the International Criminal Court promises a lot because it seeks to deter other war criminals from committing inhumane crimes against others. The court is widely acknowledged as the missing link in the international legal system.<br/>On the whole, this long essay seeks to examine the International Criminal Court, tracing its evolution from the post-World War II era to the establishment of<br/>International Criminal Tribunals. The Courts achievements and also the challenges undermining its successes will be discussed.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>AN EXAMINATION OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: INTERNATIONAL CRIMES<br/>2.2.0: EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS<br/>2.2.1.0: INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL (IMT)<br/>2.2.1.1: INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL FOR THE FAR EAST (IMTFE)<br/>2.2.1.2: INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY)<br/>2.2.1.3: INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA (ICTR)<br/>2.2.1.4: SPECIAL COURT FOR SIERRA LEONE<br/>2.2.1.5: SPECIAL TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON<br/>2.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>AN OVERVIEW OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION <br/>3.1.0: THE ROME STATUTE<br/>3.2.0: JURISDICTION OF THE COURT <br/>3.2.1.0: TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION<br/>3.2.1.1: TEMPORAL JURISDICTION<br/>3.2.1.2: COMPLEMENTARITY<br/>3.3.0: MEMBERSHIP<br/>3.4.0: STRUCTURE<br/>3.4.1.0: THE PRESIDENCY<br/>3.4.1.1: JUDICIAL DIVISIONS<br/>3.4.1.2: OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR <br/>3.4.1.3: THE REGISTRY<br/>3.5.0: PROCEDURES OF THE COURT<br/>3.5.1.0: RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED<br/>3.5.1.1: PARTICIPATION OF VICTIMS<br/>3.5.1.2: REPARATION FOR VICTIMS<br/>3.6.0: CO-OPERATION BY STATES THAT ARE NOT PARTIES TO ROME STATUTE<br/>3.7.0: INVESTIGATIONS BY THE COURT<br/>3.7.1.0: UGANDA<br/>3.7.1.1.: DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO<br/>3.7.1.2: CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC<br/>3.7.1.3: SUDAN<br/>3.7.1.4: KENYA<br/>3.8.0: THE COURT AND THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW<br/>3.9.0: DOMESTICATION OF ROME STATUTE IN NIGERIA <br/>3.10.0: THE COURTS CONTRIBUTION TO INTERNATIONAL LAW <br/>3.11.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES OF THE COURT<br/>4.1.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.2.0: ACHIEVEMENTS<br/>4.3.0: CHALLENGES<br/>4.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>GENERAL CONCLUSION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5:1.0: RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS<br/>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET<br/>BOOKS<br/>NEWSPAPER REPORTS<br/><br/>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT", "id": 134}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>JUSTIFICATION FOR AND THE ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UNDER HUMAN RIGHTS LAW</b></p><p><b>Abstract</b></p><p>The legal infliction of death as a penalty for violating criminal law has been in existence from time immemorial, people have been put to death for various forms of wrong doings and methods of execution have included crucifixion, stoning, drowning, burning at stake, impaling and beheading. Today capital punishment is typically accomplished by lethal gas or injection, electrocution, hanging or shooting.<br/>The human right proponents see death penalties as a violation of the right to life and human dignity as such countries that are becoming more democratic are eager to abolish it. The trend in most industrialized nations has been to first stop executing prisoners and then substitute long terms of imprisonment for death as the most severe of criminal penalties, about 90 nation have abolished death penalties and an almost equal number of nations, (most of which are developing countries in which Nigeria is included) have retained it<br/>This thesis considers the argument for and against death penalty in relation to human rights, the argument against this concept goes beyond the Human Right Parlance, as there are other arguments like; the propensity to condemn and execute innocent citizens, the non-deterrent effect of capital punishment, the arbitrary use of the concept against the poor, the discriminately application of the concept on the basis of race, and the lesser argument that proclaims that capital punishment is cruel and inhuman. All these argument have not been reckoned with by anti-abolitionist, as some of them have come up with other modes of executions that they believe are more humane and less cruel, the sole aim of this is to kill the argument of cruel and inhuman treatment<br/>The retributive nature of the human race would rather love that a murderer be necessarily paid back in His own coin, this is believed to be the anti-abolitionist main reason for insisting on the retention of death penalty. If the cost of executing an innocent person and abolishing the concept of death penalty is compared, it would be discovered that, it is more beneficial to abolish the use of death penalty than to lose valuable citizens to wrongful executions. Moreover, countries that have substituted life sentence for death penalty are not worse off than countries that have retained it.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.2.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.4.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.5.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.6.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND HUMAN RIGHT LAW<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.1FORMS OF PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.2COMPENSATION<br/>2.1.3INCARCERATION<br/>2.1.4CORPORAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.5BANISHMENT<br/>2.1.6CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.7OTHER APPROACHES<br/>2.2.0: HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.2.1: MODES OF EXECUTION<br/>2.2.2CRUCIFIXION<br/>2.2.3STONING<br/>2.2.4HANGING<br/>2.2.5: SHOOTING OR FIRING SQUAD<br/>2.2.6: GAS CHAMBER OR LETHAL GAS MODE OF EXECUTION <br/>2.2.7: ELECTROCUTION<br/>2.3.0: WORLD WIDE ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.4.0: HISTORY OF HUMAN RIGHTS<br/>2.5.0: CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND RIGHT TO LIFE<br/>2.6.0: CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND RIGHT TO HUMAN DIGNITY<br/>2.7.0: CONCLUSION <br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>JUSTIFICATIONS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND ITS ABOLITION<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: JUSTIFICATIONS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>3.1.1JUST PUNISHMENT<br/>3.1.2DETERRENCE<br/>3.1.3INCAPACITATION<br/>3.2.0ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>3.2.1PROPENSITY TO CONDEMN INNOCENT DEFENDANTS<br/>3.2.2DISCRIMINATLY APPLICATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE<br/>3.2.3ARBITRARY APPLICATION AGAINST THE POOR<br/>3.2.4 COMPARING COST TO BENEFITS<br/>3.3.0FLAWS IN ARGUMENTS FOR ABOLITION<br/>3.3.1RACIAL BIAS<br/>3.3.2RISK TO THE INNOCENT<br/>3.4.0FLAWS IN THE ARGUMENTS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>3.4.1CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>A COMPARISON OF THE NIGERIAN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT TO THAT OF OTHER SELECTED COUNTRIES<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0 THE NIGERIAN AND U.S.A CAPITAL PUNISHMENT COMPARED<br/>4.2.0 THE NIGERIAN AND AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT COMPARED<br/>4.3.0NIGERIAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT COMPARED<br/>4.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0 RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS<br/>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET<br/>BOOKS<br/>CHAPTERS IN BOOKS<br/><br/></p>\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR AND THE ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UNDER HUMAN RIGHTS LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " JUSTIFICATION FOR AND THE ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UNDER HUMAN RIGHTS LAW", "id": 135}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>SEPARATION OF POWER AMONG VARIOUS ORGANS OF GOVERNMENT AND ITS IMPACT ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>The doctrine of “the separation of powers as usually understood is derived from Montesquieu, whose elaboration of it was based on a study of Lock’s writings and as imperfect understanding of the eighteenth century English Constitution. Montesquieu was concerned with the preservation of political liberty. “Political liberty” is to be found he says, “only when there is no abuse of power”. But constant experience shows its that every mans invested with power is liable to abuse it, and to carry his authority as far as it will go … To prevent this abuse, it is necessary from the nature of things that one power should be a check on another… when the legislature and executive powers are united in the same person or body… there can be no liberty … Again, there is no liberty if the judicial power is not separated from the legislative and the executive… There would be as end of everything if the same person or body whether if the nobles or of the people, were to exercise three powers”.<br/>The question whether the separation of powers (i.e. the distribution of the various powers of government among different organs) in so far as is practicable, is desirable, and (if so) to what extent, is a problem of political theory and must be distinguished from the question which alone concerns the constitutional lawyer namely, whether and to what extent such a separation actually exist in any given constitution (Hood Phillips and Jackson 2001:12).<br/>Thus, according to the doctrine, a person or body must not exercise more than one of the powers of government, one arm of government must not control or interfere with the others and one arm of government must not exercise the function of the other. This is because as has been observed Blackstone:<br/>In all tyrannical government, the supreme magistrates, or the right both of making and of enforcing the laws is vested in one and the same man or one and the same body of men; and wherever these two powers are united together, there can be no public liberty.<br/> Madison believes that:<br/>… There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body of magistrates or if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.<br/>Up till 1960, Nigeria was under colonial rule and the concept of separation of powers was in operation to a very limited extent because of the overriding authority of the colonial masters. After independence, the 1960 and 1963 parliamentary constitution operated the British concept of separation of powers whereby power was shared between the judiciary on one side, and the parliament and the executive on the other; the latter being as integral though distinct offshoot of the former.<br/>Under the 1979, 1989 and 1999 Presidential Constitutions, there has a grater separation in a manner similar to that of the United States of America. Under all these constitutions section 4 vested Legislative powers in the National Assembly and Houses of Assembly; section 5 vested executive powers on the President and Governors, and the powers may subject to other constitutional provisions or laws made by the National Assembly, be exercised by them directly or through the Vice-President, Ministers or Officers of the Public service; and by virtue of section 6, judicial powers were vested in the courts established by the constitution (Mowoe, 2005: 24).<br/>According to Professor Abiola Ojo:<br/>… a complete separation of powers is neither practicable nor desirable for effective government. What the doctrine can be taken to mean is the prevention of tyranny by the conferment of too much power on anyone, person or body and the check of the power by another.<br/>The courts have continuously pronounced on the importance of this concept. In Lakanmi and others v. Attorney General of Western State, the court noted, inter-alai:<br/>We must here revert once again to the separation of powers, which the learned, Attorney General himself did not dispute, still represents the structure of our system of government. In the absence of anything to the contrary it has to be admitted that the structure of our constitution is based on separation of powers- the Legislative, the Executive and the Judiciary. Our constitution clearly follows the model of the American Constitution. In the distribution of powers the courts are vested with the exclusive right to determine justifiable controversies between citizens and the state…<br/>In Senator Adesanya v. President of Nigeria, it was decided inter-alia by majority of the Judges of the Supreme Court that the courts have no power to challenge as Act of the legislature except in certain circumstances. For example, when civil rights are violated according to Bello JSC, in that case, upon the construction of section 6(6)(b) of the 1979 constitution, which confers judicial powers in the courts, standing will only be accorded a plaintiff who shows that his civil rights and obligations have been or die in danger of being violated or adversely affected by the act complained of.<br/>In governor of Kaduna State v. House of Assembly Kaduna State the Kaduna State Governor challenged the amendment of some provisions in the Local Government Edict (now Local Government Amendment Law) by the Legislature on the grounds that is violated section 4 and 5 of the 1979 Constitution. He sought a declaration that the amendments were void because they encroached upon his executive powers. The court declared some of the amendments void and some unconstitutional and held inter-alia that the doctrine of separation of powers is enshrined in the 1979 Constitution. It is therefore the responsibility of the legislature to make laws, and the executive to execute laws made by the legislature…<br/>In Attorney General of Bendel State v. Attorney General of the Federation and 22 others, the court held inter-alia, that by virtue of section 4(8) of the 1979 Constitution, the courts of law in Nigeria have the power and duty to see to it that there is no infraction of the exercise of legislative power, whether substantive or procedural, as laid in the constitution. If there is such infraction, the courts have the power to declare any legislation passed pursuant to it unconstitutional and invalid.<br/>There is no doubt as to the need to separate the exercise of judicial organ from the executive and legislative organs.  Nevertheless, the point should be noted that the separated organs are far more expensive to run than the fused system. In the final analysis the success of either form of government depends largely on the goodwill of the people to make it work (Agbede, 1993: 39).<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>A common belief among Political Science scholars (Mill, 1958:230; Almond, 1970, Riggs, 1967, Oyovbaire, 1987), is that for liberty and freedom to be maintained, and to ensure justice and equity, there should be a separation of powers among the three branches of government, namely the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature. This system of government, it is argued, would provide a safeguard against the concentration of too much power in a single authority. While stressing that tyranny results when power of all the three branches of government are accumulated in the same hands Montesquieu, (1976:4) suggested that to preserve political liberty, the Constitution should ensure that the power of one branch of government should not be exercised by the same person(s) which possess the power of another branch. This situation, he concluded, would be destructive to liberty. This doctrine of separation of power is reflected in the Constitution of most countries of the world. For instance, in democratic countries, we often have constitutional provisions like; all legislative powers should be vested in the legislature; the executive powers in the presidency, and all judicial powers in an independent judiciary (Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, Part 11, Section 4,5 and 6). In some system of government, however, especially those operating the Cabinet model like Great Britain, (Norton, and Hayward, 1986) it is impossible to achieve complete separation of powers as envisaged above because by definition, the Executive or the Cabinet consists of the leaders of the political party or coalitions which won the majority of seats in the Parliament. But even in this kind of political arrangement, the Cabinet is responsible to the Parliament and can, indeed, be voted out of office by the Parliament. This implies that some kind of difference between the Executive and the Legislature is recognized and maintained. Moreover, the Judicial branch is separated more distinctly and carefully from the more political branches (Executive and the Legislature) in order to ideally ensure the highest degree of judicial independence and impartiality.<br/>1.3    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>          This study is guided by the following research questions<br/>Does the separation of power have any impact on the national development?<br/>Does separation of power help to balance the political system of the country?<br/>Does separation of power brings about political liberty in the country?  <br/>Does separation of power help to regulate the power exercise by each arm of government in Nigeria?<br/>Do they constitute a hindrance or catalyst for economic development in the country?<br/>What are the appropriate patterns of relation between the legislators and their constituencies, and how have these aided economic development in the respective constituencies?<br/>How has the legislation passed by the House of Assembly impacted on the lives of the people of the state?<br/>To what extent is the level of economic development in the country dependent on the roles of the state legislators?<br/>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The main aims or objectives of this study are:<br/>The examine the extent to which separation of power have helped in National Development.<br/>Determine the extent to which the legislature could be a basic institution for the translation of the masses preferences like provision of basic health facilities, roads, employment, etc into public policy through appropriate legislation, etc.<br/>Provide enough exposition on the wider issues of democracy and good governance.<br/>Specifically determine whether the pace of economic development in Nigeria can at any time be attributed to the separation of power in the country.<br/>Recommend ways through which the activities of the legislature, executive and judiciary can be strengthened in order to obtain an enduring democracy in the country.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The decision to embark on this work was anchored on a number of factors. First and foremost is the fact that Nigeria, after a prolonged period of military rule became a democratic nation on May 29, 1999. Its government, at all levels, was revamped and revitalized through competitive elections to serve the peculiar needs of democracy. With the return of democracy, there is the need to carry out some reflections on the nation’s political experience. Naturally, a state like Edo, which as we pointed out earlier is a poor agrarian community that has experimented with democracy at various times in the past, provides a good case study.<br/>The emphasis on the Legislative arm of government is borne out of the fact that the prolonged military rule has adversely affected its operations much more than any other arm of government. For instance, it experiences intermittent disruptions. Its operations are always suspended each time there is military intervention. The legislative process was changed from the Parliamentary System during the First Republic (1960-1966) to Presidentialism in subsequent Republics (Coleman, 1986; Oyovbaire and Olagunju, 1996).<br/>This development complicated matters. While under the Parliamentary System a member of the Parliament could serve as a Cabinet Minister, the Presidential System does not permit such dual roles. The confusion arising from these changes and from the constant punctuation of the legislative process is, without doubt, a cause for concern. This is more so as the Legislature which represents a core pillar of an enduring democracy is, according to Elaigwu (2000:1) primarily responsible for law-making, deciding on major public policy issues, checking the activities of the executive and judicial arms of government.<br/>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>As pointed out, the Separation of Power is the major focus of this study. Similarly, the study covers all the past periods of democratic experiments in the State - from 1979 -1982; 1991-1993, with more emphasis on the Fourth Republican Legislature (1999 – 2003).<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Separation of power: <br/>Judiciary: <br/>Executive: <br/>Doctrine:<br/>Agrarian:<br/>Institution:<br/><br/>\n\nSEPARATION OF POWER AMONG VARIOUS ORGANS OF GOVERNMENT AND ITS IMPACT ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SEPARATION OF POWER AMONG VARIOUS ORGANS OF GOVERNMENT AND ITS IMPACT ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT", "id": 136}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>UNITED NATIONS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA</b><br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Chapter One<br/>Background to the Outbreak of Civil War in Liberia<br/>Chapter Two<br/>The Limitation of ECOWAS and OAU Instrument of Conflict Resolution<br/>Chapter Three<br/>The United Nations Intervention in the Liberian Conflict<br/>Chapter Four<br/>The United Nations Agenda In Resolving The Liberian Conflict<br/>Chapter Five<br/>Conclusion<br/>Bibliography<br/>Introduction<br/>Liberia became independent on duly 26, 1847 as a small republic of immigrant Americans on the coast traditionally called the “Grain Coast”. Thus it is considered the oldest African independent State except Ethiopia. Liberia is the only state in Sub-Sahara Africa that was never subject to colonial rule1.<br/>Before the immigration, which led to the creation of Liberia, the largely forested area now covered by the Liberia state was people by various Ethnic groups that form the overwhelming majority of the population today. Monrovia was founded in 1822 by black America colonists sent by the American colonization society. Monrovia and other settlements founded by the American colonization society were never ruled by the U.S government.<br/>The American Liberia fought war for nearly a century with indigenous people, whom they called “Aborigines or Tribesmen”. Among the America Liberians there was a power struggle between the “Mulatoes” or people of partly white birth, of whom president Roberts and Tubman was the leading members and those of pure African dissent2.<br/>In 1944 William U.S. Tubman (1895-1971) a lawyer and senator, became president. He held office for 27 years. President Tubman made considerable progress towards reducing the legal and effective discrimination between America Liberians and “Tribesmen”. Political rights were extended to the latter. But under Tubman the supreme power of America Liberia of their few Aristocratic families, and of the True Wig Party (TWP was left unchanged). There were very few tribe ministers under him.<br/>Tubman died in Britain on July 23 1971 he was strongly anti Communist, though he allowed the opening of relations with the USSR in 1956.<br/>On the death of Tubman, Vice President William Tolbert automatically succeeded him. He was re-elected in 1975 and 1979. But announced that he would not stand again in 1983. President Tolbert frequently showed concern for the ordinary people. Among the many official slogans which were a distinguishing features of his regime was “Mat to Mattresses”3.<br/>In 1979 Dr Tolbert showed the fairness and sense of justice for which he has come to be reputed by refusing to grant reprieve to two men of top America Liberian elite, son of true Wig Party (TWP) Chairman James Anderson and of former Vice President Yancy Sentenced to death.<br/>From 1977 the close relations between Liberia and Sierra Leone were strengthened by the Mano River Union, under which major projects were agreed on to develop closer link. In 1975 Joined the new Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS). A Liberian Dr A Romeo Horton was managing Director of ECOWAS fund.<br/>Relations with other countries were little changed under President Tolbert close relations with the U.S.A were illustrated by the big reception given to president carter on his visit in May 1978.<br/>The 1970 was one such period of economic difficulty it was also a decade that witnessed the initiation of a national discussion of issues of social justice and equality and of the imperatives of democracy. Inquiring opposition groups emerged to engage the government. . The leadership of President Tolbert (1971 – 80) was problematic oscillating between a disposition to change and the maintenance of the status quo. A political vacuum was created.<br/>On April 12 1980, a military coup was staged under the leadership of Samuel Doe, and for the first time the indigenous groups were in power. President Doe filled his ranks with people from his own ethnic group, the Krahns4.<br/>Given the unprecedented nature of the coup and the excesses of its violence, as well as the unwillingness of the conservative elements of the old order to accept change, there were many observers who concluded that the act was revolutionary and that a profound social transformation would be sent in train. Others asserted that Liberia has experienced de-colonization from “black colonialism”. The meaning of this admittedly historic event was that the way was now clear for the replacement of settler minority rule by indigenous majority rule.5<br/>But such a hopeful prospect was not to be, Liberia was too heavy with history to conform to what has proven to be simplistic assumption about it politics and society. Following a period of initial uncertainty by an inexperience military government and it civilian political enablers (the movement for justice in Africa (MOJA) and people progressive party (PPP).<br/>The process of sorting out the imperative of a return to civilian rule was soon under way. Largely in response to pressure from the U.S government which was bankrolling the military regime in keeping with America Cold War requirement, a new constitution was drafted, approved through referendum, and under it election was held on the 15th October 19856. There is ample documentation that the elections were rigged and that the incumbent military leader, Doe, who was declared the winner of the presidency actually stole the election.<br/>With the elections fraud endorsed by the American administration on the protest that such was the way of Africa politics.7.<br/>Deep disappointment set in. General Quinwonkpa attempted his coup and its failure cost him his life, Brutal and massive repression ensued Liberia of Wimba Origin bore the brunt of Does brutality because of the slaine General Quinwonkpa’s country of origin8. <br/>On December 24 1989 a small group of rebels attacked the border town of Butuo in Nimba County as a first step towards the overthrow of the Doe government. The rebels were the National patriotic front of Liberia (NPFL) headed by Charles Taylor.<br/>United Nations And Conflict Management Of The Civil War In Liberia<br/><br/>\n\nUNITED NATIONS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " UNITED NATIONS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA", "id": 137}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A HOLISTIC APPRAISAL OF THE CONCEPT OF TRUST UNDER THE NIGERIAN JURISPRUDENCE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>According to some authors, the meaning of trust as a legal concept is traceable to the moral connotation of the term which eventually informed its jurisprudential basis. Literally, trust means confidence reposed in others. It was this moral obligation that was eventually developed into a legal concept by the English chancery court and it became part of the Nigerian legal jurisprudence through statutory enactments, its administration regulated by established principles of equity and statutes. In medieval times, trust was widely employed as a means of transferring estates from one person to another for the benefit of a third party. The transferor is variously known as settlor, feoffor or testator, while the person (or persons) for whom the trust is created is called feofee or beneficiary. In the same vein, the person in whose care the settlor entrusts the estate is known as the trustee.<br/>It is instructive to note that the office of the trustee is very vital for the smooth administration of the trust. This is so because the estate is vested in the trustee who holds such property in accordance with the terms of the trust for the benefit of the beneficiary. A person may be expressly appointed trustee by an instrument or through some other means recognized by law. The equitable principle that â€œequity does not want for a trustee is to the effect that considerable importance is attached to the office of a trustee in the trust administration. Even in situations where the instrument fails to appoint one, a trustee can be appointed by the court or through statutory powers.<br/>This long essay seeks to examine the powers of a trustee vis-a-vis its operational regime under the Nigerian legal system. As a general rule a trustee must be capable of holding and disposing of property in his capacity. He must be competent to deal with the estate as required by the trust instrument for the beneficiary benefit. He must not be under any disability by nature or by law. He must be amenable to the jurisdiction of the court and be capable of the business. He must disclose any situation which might result in a conflict between his personal interest and his job as a trustee. A trustee must ascertain the validity of his appointment and understand the terms and nature of the trust.<br/>In our clime, experience has shown that in the course of carrying out their assignments, trustees have come up against a lot of challenges and limitations despite statutory provisions relating to the exercise of their powers. Some of these challenges have to do with our customary and religious beliefs which result many a time in unending litigation.<br/>Essentially, this essay will discourse trust holistically. In pursuance of this objective, this work will be divided into five chapters. Chapter one will deal with the general introduction to the topic which will include the historical evolution of trust and its reception into the Nigerian legal jurisprudence. Aims and objectives, importance of study, scope of study, research methodology, and literature review as well as meaning of trust and parties to a trust will be discoursed in this chapter. Chapter two will examine the relationship between trust and other legal concepts, classification, capacity, and the essentials of trust will be discoursed. Chapter three will focus on the seemingly simple but complex duties and powers of trustees. Chapter four will deal with remedies for breach of trust and liabilities. In closing, chapter five of this long essay will make recommendations, suggestions and propositions on how to improve the administration of trust in Nigeria.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: MEANING OF TRUST<br/>1.8.0: PARTIES TO A TRUST<br/>1.9.0: APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEES<br/>1.0.1: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>THE CONCEPT OF TRUST UNDER THE NIGERIAN LEGAL SYSTEM<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: TRUST AND OTHER LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS<br/>2.2.0: TRUST AND CONTRACT<br/>2.3.0: TRUST AND BAILMENT<br/>2.4.0: TRUST AND THE OFFICE OF PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES<br/>2.5.0: TRUST AND AGENCY<br/>2.6.0: CLASSIFICATION OF TRUSTS<br/>2.7.0: PRIVATE AND PUBLIC TRUST<br/>2.8.0: EXPRESS AND IMPLIED TRUST<br/>2.9.0: COMPLETELY AND INCOMPLETELY CONSTITUTED TRUST<br/>2.0.1: RESULTING TRUSTS<br/>2.0.2: CONSTRUCTIVE TRUSTS<br/>2.0.3: TRUST OF PERFECT AND IMPERFECT OBLIGATIONS<br/>2.0.4: EXECUTED AND EXECUTORY <br/>2.0.5: CREATION OF TRUST<br/>2.0.6: CAPACITY TO CREATE A TRUST<br/>2.0.7: INFANTS AND MINORS<br/>2.0.8: PERONS SUFFERING FROM MENTALIN CAPACITY<br/>3.2.0.9: MARRIED WOMEN<br/>2.0.0.1: CORPORATE BODIES<br/>2.0.0.2: ESSENTIALS OF TRUSTS<br/>2.0.0.3: CERTAINTY OF WORDS<br/>2.0.0.4: CERTAINTY OF SUBJECT MATTER<br/>2.0.0.5: CERTAINTY OF OBJECT<br/>2.0.0.6: EFFECT OF UNCERTAINTY<br/>2.0.0.7: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>EXAMINATION OF THE DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE TRUSTEES<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: ANALYSIS OF DUTY AS A CONCEPT<br/>3.2.0: GENERAL DUTIES<br/>3.3.0: FIDUCIARY DUTIES<br/>3.4.0: ANALYSIS OF POWER AS A CONCEPT<br/>3.5.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>BREACH TRUST AND ITS REMEDIES<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF TRUST<br/>4.2.0: REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF TRUST<br/>4.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.0.1: RECOMMENDATIONS<br/><br/>\n\nA HOLISTIC APPRAISAL OF THE CONCEPT OF TRUST UNDER THE NIGERIAN JURISPRUDENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A HOLISTIC APPRAISAL OF THE CONCEPT OF TRUST UNDER THE NIGERIAN JURISPRUDENCE", "id": 138}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN APPRAISAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The traditional focus of International Law has been upon the rights and obligations of states while International Criminal Law regulates the conduct of individuals and also punishes those who commit heinous and barbaric crimes against others. The most prevalent of these crimes include genocide, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity.<br/>After the end of World War II, the Allies tried Nazi leaders responsible for the massacre to demonstrate that such would not be permitted in future. In the absence of a permanent criminal court, ad hoc tribunals were established. Unfortunately, in the succeeding years, the world sustained atrocities without having recourse to any permanent global mechanism for the prevention and punishment of such crimes.<br/>Consequently, a treaty establishing the International Criminal Court was adopted in Rome on July 17, 1998 at the Rome Conference. The court came into being on 1 July, 2002 as that was the date its founding treaty, the Rome Statute entered into force and it can only prosecute crimes committed after that date.<br/>Despite the courts various achievements, it still faces some challenges. These include the refusal of the United States to ratify its treaty, the non-cooperation of states that are not parties, lack of universal ratification of the Rome Statute and a host of others. In spite of all these, the International Criminal Court promises a lot because it seeks to deter other war criminals from committing inhumane crimes against others. The court is widely acknowledged as the missing link in the international legal system.<br/>On the whole, this long essay seeks to examine the International Criminal Court, tracing its evolution from the post-World War II era to the establishment of<br/>International Criminal Tribunals. The Courts achievements and also the challenges undermining its successes will be discussed.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>AN EXAMINATION OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: INTERNATIONAL CRIMES<br/>2.2.0: EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS<br/>2.2.1.0: INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL (IMT)<br/>2.2.1.1: INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL FOR THE FAR EAST (IMTFE)<br/>2.2.1.2: INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY)<br/>2.2.1.3: INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA (ICTR)<br/>2.2.1.4: SPECIAL COURT FOR SIERRA LEONE<br/>2.2.1.5: SPECIAL TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON<br/>2.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>AN OVERVIEW OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION <br/>3.1.0: THE ROME STATUTE<br/>3.2.0: JURISDICTION OF THE COURT <br/>3.2.1.0: TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION<br/>3.2.1.1: TEMPORAL JURISDICTION<br/>3.2.1.2: COMPLEMENTARITY<br/>3.3.0: MEMBERSHIP<br/>3.4.0: STRUCTURE<br/>3.4.1.0: THE PRESIDENCY<br/>3.4.1.1: JUDICIAL DIVISIONS<br/>3.4.1.2: OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR <br/>3.4.1.3: THE REGISTRY<br/>3.5.0: PROCEDURES OF THE COURT<br/>3.5.1.0: RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED<br/>3.5.1.1: PARTICIPATION OF VICTIMS<br/>3.5.1.2: REPARATION FOR VICTIMS<br/>3.6.0: CO-OPERATION BY STATES THAT ARE NOT PARTIES TO ROME STATUTE<br/>3.7.0: INVESTIGATIONS BY THE COURT<br/>3.7.1.0: UGANDA<br/>3.7.1.1.: DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO<br/>3.7.1.2: CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC<br/>3.7.1.3: SUDAN<br/>3.7.1.4: KENYA<br/>3.8.0: THE COURT AND THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW<br/>3.9.0: DOMESTICATION OF ROME STATUTE IN NIGERIA <br/>3.10.0: THE COURTS CONTRIBUTION TO INTERNATIONAL LAW <br/>3.11.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES OF THE COURT<br/>4.1.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.2.0: ACHIEVEMENTS<br/>4.3.0: CHALLENGES<br/>4.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>GENERAL CONCLUSION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5:1.0: RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS<br/>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET<br/>BOOKS<br/>NEWSPAPER REPORTS<br/><br/>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT", "id": 139}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CORROBORATION UNDER THE NIGERIAN LAW OF EVIDENCE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>There is no law that says the plaintiff or the prosecution must bring a million witnesses or evidence to court before he can succeed in his case. A court can convict on a single witness. A case is not decided by the numbers of witnesses, single credible convincing evidence is enough to convict in a case but there are some exceptions. The exceptions refer to by this learned mean the circumstances where corroboration will be required before any judge can decide his case. Although a judge can convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice but he must warn himself before given such conviction in fact he is advised to seek corroborating evidence before convicting an accused because failure to do so can lead to the setting aside of his judgment on appeal.<br/>Generally, corroboration cuts a niche for itself, it is used both in criminal and civil cases. It will also state the position of judges on the issue of corroboration and various decisions of court on different issues arising from corroboration. In law, corroboration, though popular yet controversial virtually under all legal system this is due to the influence and interpretation of the provisions of the Evidence Act and the criminal and penal codes (on corroboration of evidence) by judges. The desirability of corroboration as a requirement in certain criminal and civil cases under the Nigerian law of evidence and the hope of examine it critically under our legal system is the core focus of this study. This work will therefore elucidate the meaning of corroboration in Nigeria and Canada generally, the role of judges in deciding both civil and criminal cases and various statutory provisions in respect of corroboration of evidence in Nigeria relying largely on both primary and secondary source of law of evidence in Nigeria.<br/>Table of Content<br/> CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>PRINCIPLE OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF CORROBORATION IN NIGERIA.<br/>2.2.0: MEANING / DEFINITION OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.3.0: NATURE OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.4.0 EVIDENCE REQUIRING CORROBORATION<br/>2.5.0 CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>RULES/ FORMS OF CORROBORATION.<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION.<br/>3.1.0: FORMS OF CORROBORATION<br/>3.1.1.0: CORROBORATION AS A MATTER OF LAW.<br/>3.1.1.1 CORROBORATION AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE.V<br/>3.2.1.1: CUMULATIVE CORROBORATION<br/>3.2.1.2: IDENTIFICATION CASES AND CORROBORATION<br/>3.3.0: CORROBORATION UNDER THE COMMON LAW<br/>3.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>INCIDENCES OF CORROBORATION<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: CORROBORATION IN CIVIL CASES<br/>4.2.0: CORROBORATION IN CRIMINAL CASES<br/>4.3.0: ROLE OF JUDGES AND JURY IN CORROBORATION<br/>4.4.0: PROBLEMS OF CORROBORATION<br/>4.5.0: SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM<br/>4.6.0 CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0 RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/> TABLE OF CASES<br/> NIGERIA<br/> Anthony Enahoro v R (1965) NWLR 265 @ 280 <br/>Alli v Alli [1965]3 All ER 48<br/>Brighty v Pearson (1938)4 All ER 127<br/>Bakobah v Yauri N.A Police (1970) 107 NNLR<br/>Davis v DPP [1954] AC 378 <br/>Emmanuel Ugwumba v State [1993] 5 NWLR 660 <br/>Hamid Musa &amp; or v YahayaKefasYerima&amp; Anor [1997]7 NWLR 27.SC <br/>Johnson Erelau v I.R (1959)WRNLR 77 (Fsc) <br/>MaukaOgbodu v State [1936]5 NWLR C.A<br/>R v Makanjuola [1995]3 All ER 73 @ 731j-733g<br/>R v Spencer (HL) (1987) AC 128, (1973)2 WLR 24 <br/>R v Salami Ogunubi (1932)11 NLR<br/>R v Francis Kufi (1969) WNLR<br/>Stephen Emoga v State (1997)9 NWLR 25 SC<br/>  UNITED KINGDOM <br/> Hill v Willson (1873)8 ch App 880<br/>R v Christie [1914] A.C 545<br/>R v Longstaff (1977) Crim L R 216<br/>R v Sauder (1961)46 Cr APP R 60<br/>Nicola v Penny (1950)2 KB 466<br/>R v Mildwinter (1971)55 Cr App R 523<br/>R v Marks (1963) Crim L R 370<br/>R v Chance [1988] QB 732<br/>Thomas v Jones (QBD) (1920)2KB 399<br/>R v Hills (1987)86 Cr App R 26<br/>R v Redpath (1962)46 Cr App R 319,321<br/>R v Chauhan (1918)7 E Cr App R 232<br/>R v Whitehead [1929]1 K.B 99 @ 102<br/>R v O”connor [1980] Crim L.R 43 C.A<br/>R v Turnbull [1977] QB 224 [1976]3 All ER 549 C.A<br/>    TABLE OF STATUES <br/>ENGLAND<br/> Sexual Offence Act 1956<br/>Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984<br/>Road Traffic Act 1984<br/>Perjury Act 1911<br/> Civil Evidence Act 1963<br/>Criminal Justice Act 1988<br/> NIGERIA<br/> The Evidence Act  1945, Cap 112 LFN•<br/> LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS<br/> ALL ER :All England Report<br/> K.B :      King’s Bench<br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/> 1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>  Corroboration is evidence tending to confirm some fact of which other evidence is given. As a matter of common sense, the more corroboration is present the easier it is to prove a fact and from this point of view a judge will always look for corroborating evidence.<br/>Corroboration according to Osborn’s Concise Dictionary1 means independent evidence which implicate a person accused of a crime by connecting him with it, or an evidence which confirms in some fact particularly not only that the crime has been committed but also that the accused actually committed the crime. According to Oxford Dictionary2 corroboration mean evidence given to further support or strength existing evidence.<br/>Corroboration according to the Evidence Ac3t refers to an independent statement made by other witness which proves the truth of the first evidence. It is also refer to as the requirement in some jurisdiction such as Scotland that any evidence adduced be backed up by at least one other source.<br/>¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬____________________________________________________________<br/> 2nd edition vol.11 1963 by Horny Oxford University Sheila bone<br/>Evidence act 1945 cap 112L.F.N1990<br/> Corroboration is a mandatory requirement under certain circumstances, in the sense that no matter how convincing the evidence requiring corroboration is, the party relying on that evidence will fail unless he adduces corroboration.<br/>Corroboration is therefore called for where there is need order to ascertain that such evidence can be relied upon to convict the accused person. Corroboration is a ground for the admissibility of certain evidence for the purpose of conviction and if the corroborating evidence is not the same with the existing evidence an accused can not be convicted upon such existing evidence. This essay shall examine the various incidence where corroboration must or might be required to be taken before there can be a conviction, corroboration under common law , Nigerian law. It shall also examine the position of judges and statutory authorities and will also analyses various issues arising from corroboration. This project is basically directed toward analyzing corroboration as known under the Nigerian law of evidence. There shall also be an insight into various circumstances as when, where and why corroboration is required. <br/>1.1.0:BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>The reason for venturing into this topic is based on personal interest in the concept “Corroboration” and the desire to shed more light on it by analyzing it critically. This work is therefore based on the analysis of corroboration under the Nigerian law of evidence. It analysis shall include discussion on the nature of corroboration, effect of corroboration and instances where corroboration will or must be required among others.<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>The main objective of this essay is to critically analysis corroboration under the Nigerian law of evidence in order to shed light on the concept of corroboration under the our legal system.  Furthermore, the essay tends to highlight circumstances where corroboration may or must be required. It will also show the effect of corroboration on a piece of evidence, natures of corroboration, the position of judges in corroboration issues and examine the provision of the Evidence Act on corroboration.

This is so because of the tremendous contributions which workers can make to national growth and development, as well as the general well-being of the nation’s citizenry. Labour law has a vital role to play in the mobilization of the work force for national growth. The major players in employment are essentially-the employer and the employee and whenever there is a contractual relationship between these two parties, the binding contract naturally brings about rights and duties which must be complied with. Their respective rights and duties have to be analyzed wholly in contractual terms. In many civilize countries, a case study of Nigerian, it has been observed from historical antecedents, a structured favor to employers over and above the employees liability arose. As much as it is an undisputed fact that employers reserve the right to dismiss alongside other rights, employees also have rights which they can also exercise. But in most circumstances, due to ignorance of many employees, the opportunity to challenge such unlawful acts of the employers elude them. Efforts has been made in this research projects to identify these problems, their causes and also solutions have been suggested in the concluding chapter for a need to reform the whole set up as it affects labor law and practice in Nigeria.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE:INTRODUCTION- MEANING AND SCOPE, FORMATION, HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF LIABILITY<br/>1.1            Meaning and Scope of Contract Of Employment<br/>1.2            Formation of contract of employment<br/>1.3            Terms of a contract of employment<br/>1.4            Historical background of employer’s liability<br/>1.5            Basis Of The Employer’s liability<br/> CHAPTER TWO:DUTIES OF THE EMPLOYER AND RIGHTS OF THE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE<br/> 2.1        Source of the Employers Duties<br/>2.2        The common Law Duties<br/>2.2.1     Duties to make available proper tools and plants for<br/>work<br/>2.2.2     Safe place of work<br/>2.2.3     Safe and secure system of work and supervision<br/>2.2.4     Competent staff with reasonably competent fellow Employee’s<br/>2.3        The statutory duties<br/>2.3.1     Adequate training of workers<br/>2.3.2     Paymentof wages<br/>2.3.3     Provision of safe sanitary system and humane conditions of work<br/>2.3.4     Annual holiday with pay<br/>2.3.5     Sick leave<br/>2.3.6     Employee’s compensation<br/>2.3.7     Vicarious liability<br/>2.4        Rights of the employer and employee in a contract of employment<br/> CHAPTER THREE:LIABILITIES OF THE EMPLOYER AND REMEDIES OF THE EMPLOYEE<br/> <br/>3.1        Contractual breach and employer’s liability<br/>3.2        Remedies provided by the contract to the aggrieved employee<br/>3.3        Remedies provided by the law to the aggrieved employee<br/> CHAPTER FOUR:summary,conclusion and<br/>recommendation<br/>bibliography<br/>TABLE OF CASES<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION-MEANING AND SCOPE, FORMATION, HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF LIABILITY.<br/>1.1    Meaning and Scope of Contract of Employment <br/>           The contract of employment is a specie of contract, and is Therefore governed by general principles of the law of contract, consensusad item, Being a kind of simple contract, contract of employment must also satisfy the elements of a valid contract. The vitiating factors are also applicable to it. What distinguishes a contract of employment from a simple contract, which chitty defines as a promise or a set of promises which the law will enforce1, is the degree of control that one party has over the other party2. Also, a contract of employment relates to a relationship that exists between two or more persons for the performance of services, while one person is employed by the other. Where as, a contract relates to a relationship that exist between two or more persons in any transaction, generally.<br/>       Traditional statements of what constitute a contract of employment, place most emphasis on the power of the employer to control the work of the employee in contrast to a contract with an independent contractor.In Chadwick v. pioneer private telephone Ltd, contract of employment was defined thus: contract of services implies an obligation to serve and it comprises some degree of control by the master”3. It must howeverbe noted that there is no comprehensive definition, only conflicting criteria’s. A contract of employment can be defined as a contract entered in to by two parties whereby one party submits himself to the service of the other for some considerations in most cases salary and wages. An attempt has, however been made in the sphere of labor Legislation in Nigeria4 at defining a contract of employment as;<br/>’’Any agreement whether oral or written, express or implied, whereby one person agrees to employ another as a worker and that other person agrees to serve the employer as a worker.”<br/>It is a contract of service and not for service, what differentiates them is the fact that in a contract of service, a man (employee), places his labor at the disposal of another, resulting in a relationship between the to parties. Where as, a contract for services involve a situation where a man who operates an independent business agrees to do labor or carry out a task or tasks for the person of another. In past times, the contract of employment was known as and called a relationship of ‘’ master and servant”. <br/>Since employment relationship strictly represents subordination of an individual as a worker to an employer, which relationship could be described as a dependent labor relationship, Mr. Y’s house keeper, gate keeper, driver or chauffeur is his employee, that a laundry man or a t-axi driver is an independent contractor5.<br/>Thus, for a contract of employment to be distinguished from a contract for service, the parties involved must avail themselves of the statutory rights under it. That is, it must be shown that a relationship of employer and employee or master and servant exists between them. Thus, there must be terms agreed by both parties for this will be the sole principle which will guide their acts and conducts during the subsistence of the employment. As held by the court in SMITH V. GENERAL MOTOR CAB. CO6, where the claim for the existence of such relationship between the parties fails.<br/> As must have been noted, a contract of service involves two separate legal categories of persons namely – an Employer, master, hirer, or recruiter, and an Employee. WHO IS AN EMPLOYER ?: Although this has no précise meaning in law;<br/>       ’’An employer is any person who has entered in to contract of employment to employ any other person as a worker her for himself or for the services of any other person and includes the agents, manager, or factor of that first mentioned person and the personal representatives of a deceased employer.”7<br/>An employer can also be defined as; ’’The entrepreneur who engages a worker under a dependent labor relationship and has control over that worker to the extent that such worker could be referred to as an employee’’. Also, an employer is ’’Any person who employs or engages labour or the service of another person under contract of service’’.Theemployer could be an individual, a partner, a corporate body or even a state (the Government).8<br/>WHO IS AN EMPLOYEE?<br/>       Any person who has entered in to or works under a contract with an employer whether the contract is for manual labor or clerical work or express or implied or oral or written, and whether it is a contract of service or a contract personally to execute any work or labor but does not include…………… persons exercising administrative, executive, technical or professional functions as public officer or otherwise.”9<br/>To identify an employer or servant then, the essential question is ’’ was his contract a contract of service within the meaning which an ordinary person would give to the word?”. In CASSIDY v. MINISTER OF HEALTH10Bomerell,l.jgave the view that, if the answer is YES, then such a person will be regarded as an employee. In ADEYEMO v. OYO STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISION,11 the plaintiff who was a deputy accountant Generalloyo state public service was held to be a servant or employee. Employee and servant have been used interchangeably by authors also, various Nigerian statutes have defined who a servant is by using words like workers, employee or workman.<br/>1.2 Formation of Contract of Employment<br/>The existence of binding relationship between the employer and the employee arises out of contract, as essential elements for the formation of  a contract of employment or service between an employer and employee upon which their rights and obligations depends are generally same as conditions in ordinary or simple contact. This legal relationship therefore presupposes the voluntary consent of the parties to its creation expressed through the process of hiring within limitation imposed only by the general law of contract or statutory regulation. The terms are often not negotiable by the individual employee except in some cases where remuneration is negotiable, depending on the professional skills required by the employer. As such,  the rights and dutiesof the master and servant are essentially the products of free bargaining  between the parties,  as they have liberty to decide  the terms and conditions of  service.<br/> Beside the element of voluntariness, there is also the presumption of equality between the parties but professor Odumosu has described this presumption of equality between the parties as a ’’Fiction’’.12 Also, AdeogunA.A commented on the presumption of equality and voluntariness of bargaining power between the master and the servant, as he noted that, ’’… the so-called bargaining power of the individual worker is of little importance in practice……”13<br/>       The basic conceptual frame work for the individual employment relationship is provided by contract, and as such, the employment relationship created must of necessity satisfy all the essential features of a valid contract. There must be offer, acceptance, requisite capacity of parties, consideration, intention to give the agreement legal efficacy and no element vitiate the contract. With regard to capacity, the parties must have requisite legal capacity to enter the employment relationship, Generally, the capacity of infants, women, and persons of unsound mind are limited in some ways.<br/>TERMS OF A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT<br/>       The terms of the contract of employment can be derived from the individual contract itself, collective agreement and legislations.Besides this, the terms of a contract also depends largely on the intention of the parties, as they are free to agree upon the contents or terms of their employment relationship. The terms of contract relates to those statements, express or implied, by which the employer and the employee intend to guide their employment relationship. The term defines the rights and duties of obligations and liabilities arising from the relationship. As stated above, there are express or implied terms . The express terms include: Hours of work14 travel to work,15wages and control of wages. The Implied obligation of employer include: To pay wages,16To treat employee with due respect; provision of work for the employee; Safety of the employee at work; Provision of references; To indenify the employee.17.<br/>Some implied duties of the employee include: The duty of obedience; 18 Dutyto exercise skills and reasonable care;19   duty to render honest and faithful service; Avoid secret profit and personal gain; competition.Avoid misuse of confidential information.20<br/>       The contractual terms may be oral or written, but important contents of a contract ofemployment are as a matter of practice and prudence, made in writing and the terms documented properly.[6]<br/>1.       Chitty, general principles of contracts (24thED) london: sweet&amp;Maxwell,1977<br/>2.       R.K salman, A critical analysis of rights of employer&amp; employee under the Nigeria contract of employment<br/>3.       (1914) ALL E.R. 522 at 535<br/>4.       Nigerian Labour Act, No 1974, Section 91 (1)<br/> 5.

Trade dispute, when it occurs could be a very serious issue especially when it is allowed to degenerate into an industrial action. Few trade disputes get reported but the ones that are recorded help the government to get a proper analysis for the evaluation and policy purposes. Though quite a large number of disputes occurs without resort to strike, however they are equally as disruptive as cessation of work.[1]<br/>Since government is the largest employer of labour, it has from time to time enacted different laws to curb the incidents of trade disputes between employers and their workers in Nigeria.<br/>[2]Trade dispute has been defined by the Act as any disagreement between employers and workers, workers and workers which is connected to the employment, non employment or terms of employment or physical condition of work of any person.  It must be noted that before any dispute can be termed a trade dispute, there must be in existence proper parties and the subject matter must be related to the employment, non employment or terms of employment or physical condition of work of any person23[3].<br/>This shows that the parties and subject of a trade dispute must be clearly defined in order to fully understand what kind of dispute constitutes a trade dispute. The first attempt made by the government to regulate trade dispute was the Trade Disputes (Arbitration and Inquiry) (Lagos) Ordinance, 1941 and Trade Dispute (Arbitration and Inquiry) (Federal Application) Ordinance, 1957.  However, these attempts turned out to be unsuccessful because of some defects in them which eventually shortened their life span and new legislation were enacted, These are the Trade Dispute (Emergency Provision) Decree of 1968 and the Trade Dispute (Emergency Provision) (Amendment) (Decree No 2) of 1969.<br/>These two Decrees were enacted to correct the defects in the first two Ordinances they were effective in some aspect but they were designated to last for a short time. The Decree had some inherent defects which were to be regulated by the Trade Disputes Act, 1976 which till today remains the major machinery for the settlement of trade disputes and its amendment the Trade Dispute (Amendment) Decree No. 47 of 1992.<br/>The Trade Disputes Act, 1976 has provided different procedures for settling trade disputes when they occur, the Act provides for ways in which the parties may attempt the settlement themselves and ways in which a 3rd party may be appointed to help in the settlement processes.3 It also provides for ways in which the parties may take the dispute to the court for proper adjudication.<br/>[4]Examination of the laws and procedures for the regulation of trade disputes is the focus of this study and recommendation made where necessary for a better way of resolving trade disputes.<br/> 1.1.0: Background to the study<br/>In any ideal industrial relations, great emphasis is placed on the attainment of industrial harmony in order to create a conducive environment for the realization of individual and organizational goals and objective.  However, it would appear that conflict is a common phenomenon in any human setting and when it exists, it creates human and industrial problems, which adversely affect the attainment of industrial peace.<br/>Since conflict in any work situation is almost inevitable because as labour and management relates, there are bound to be frictions which result from differences in interest and aspirations as both the employer and employee most times have divergent interest on issues touching on wages, conditions of work, terms of employment etc and resolving these dispute receives compromise, concession and a game of give and take between disputing parties.<br/>1.3              Definition of terms<br/>“Trade Dispute” is any disagreement between employers and workers or worker and workers which is connected to the employment, non employment or terms of employment or physical condition of work of any person.4[5]<br/>“Strike” has been defined by the Act as the cessation of work  by a body of employed persons acting in combination, or by concerted refusal under a common understanding of any number of employed persons to continue to work for an employer in consequence of a dispute, done as means of competing with their employers or any person or body of persons employed, to aid other workers in compelling their employer or any person or body of employed persons to accept or not  to accept terms of employment and physical condition of work<br/>          In Tramp shipping corporation v. Greewish marine Inc. “The court of Appeal in united kingdom adopted the following definition of strike: ‘a concerted stoppage of work by men done … With a view to improve their wages or condition of employment or giving vent to a grievance or making a protest about something or others supporting or sympathizing with other workmen in such endeavour. This definition accords with the definition under the Trade Dispute Act, 1976. Refusal to continue to work include a refusal to work at usual speed and efficiency.<br/>“Lockout” is an action in which employees physically “takeover” the company premises either by locking out the management staff, thus denying them access to exit from the premises.<br/>          It is also defined by the Act as the closing of a place of work or, the suspension of work, or the refusal by an employer to continue to employ any number of persons employed by him, in consequence of a dispute with a view to compelling the workers to accept terms of employment”.<br/>“Collective bargaining” has been defined as the process of arriving or attempting to arrive at a collective agreement.<br/>Collective Agreement is any agreement in writing relating to the terms of employment and physical condition of work, between an employer group of employers or one or more organization representing the employers on one part and one or more organization representing the workers on the other hand.<br/>          In this work, unless the context requires otherwise, the following expression have the meaning assigned to them here under:-<br/>“Party” mean any parties to trade dispute or any of the parties to a trade matter lying before a court or N.I.C.<br/>“N.I.C” means the National Industrial Court.<br/>“I.A.P.” Means Industrial Arbitration Panel,<br/>“The Tribunal” means the industrial arbitration tribunal.<br/>“Court” means the conventional court listed in section 6(5) 1999 constitution.<br/>“The decree”       Means the Trade Dispute (Amendment) Decree No. 47 of 1992.<br/>“Laws”      Means the laws regulating trade disputes in Nigeria as covered in this book.<br/>“The Act” Means the Trade Dispute Act, Cap 432, LFN 1990.<br/>“Dispute” means Trade Dispute<br/>“Minister” mean the minister for employment labout and productivity of the federation.<br/>“Condition of work” means the physical condition under which a workman, works such as appertain to matters of safety and physical comfort at the place of work.<br/>[1]  Trade Dispute Act 1978 S.47 (1)<br/>  2 NNB V.

This progressive undeniable dynamism in human nature has made it quit vital that man must be creative and not just that, but also innovative to satisfy his ever increasing unsuitable wants, thereby prompting some legal installation to this effect. This piece of work is propelled toward examining the creative work of man vis-Ã -vis the way he can be protected against any undue and unwarranted encroachment on his creative ability and the possible bodies vested with authority to look into the issue and the likely way it could be remedied if peradventure his interest was breach. Chapter one of this work is gives an insight into the significance of the study and concept of copyright, tracing its antecedence and developmental phases it has passed through till date, Chapter two would be dwelling predominantly on the work to be protected, those eligible to be protected and how they can arrived at it. Also to be considered is the aspect of authorship and ownership of copyright, terms of copyright the exception to copyright and how it can be effectively transferred in the Nigeria context. <br/>Chapter three, will dwell essentially on the administration of copyright in Nigeria centering more on the duties of the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) and other regulatory bodies like Phonographic Performance Limited, Performing Musician and Artist of Nigeria, Performing and Broadcasting Rights of Author/Composer and publisher MRS and many others including inspectors who would be considered as forces behind the curtain seen to a hitch free inventory society like ours. It is difficult to have an absolute crime free society, thus chapter four will be considering the infringement that copyright works are subjected to and the likely cure to the injury she might sustain in that process in form of remedies. Lastly, chapter five would be offering recommendation which might turn out to be invariable, as the conclusion ushers in, collecting in a statement or to the whole piece as the curtain falls.

Separation of powers allows typical division of branches of government  into a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. It can be contrasted with the fusion or combination of powers like in the case of a parliamentary system, where the executive and legislature sometimes parts of the judiciary are unified, for the purpose of governance. Separation of powers as underlining principle of governance vests legislative power of the Federal Government in the National Assembly. It provides thus: The legislative power of the Federal Republic of Nigeria shall be vested in a National Assembly for the Federation which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representative.1<br/>The National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a bicameral legislature established under section 4 of the Nigerian Constitution. It consists of a Senate and a 360-member House of Representatives. The body, modeled after the federal Congress of the United States, is supposed to guarantee equal representation of the states irrespective of size in the Senate and proportional representation of population in the House. The National Assembly, like many other organs of government has functions such law making, checking  of other organs of government, especially the executive, representation etc. the mechanism in which the legislature uses in sanctioning the executive when there is any misconduct is the impeachment process.<br/>The Impeachment process has become a topical issue on the Constitutional development of Nigeria. The starting point was the impeachment of Alhaji Balarabe Musa former Governor of Kaduna State2. It has been contained that impeachment has been so much abused by the State Assemblies who do it without recourse to laid down Constitutional measures.[1]                                                             <br/>           No proceeding or determination of the panel or of the House of Assembly or any matter relating to such proceedings or determination shall be entrained or questioned in any Court. This provision ousted the jurisdiction of the Court in matter relating to impeachment embarked upon by the Legislature.<br/>Impeachment rarely occurs therefore the term is often misunderstood. [2]The word impeachment derives its root from a latin expression to be caught or entrapped. Thus impeachment as a Constitutional process is not designed as a weapon of political oppression, suppression or harassment of a President or Governor whose face the Legislature does not want to behold any longer in the power.<br/> However, impeachment when used appropriately will put the government of the day on its toes, thereby making such government responsible and accountable.<br/>Impeachment was first employed in the Nigerian history during the second republic in the case of Balarabe Musa, former Governor of Kaduna State. Since then impeachment process has become a topical issue in Nigeria’s Constitutional development.<br/>The purpose of impeachment has been abused by the Legislature, who use impeachment as a tool of oppression and intimidation for those in impeachment proceeding is worth nothing. A proper study of these impeachment proceeding has shown the legality or otherwise.<br/>1.2 Statement Of The Problem<br/>In Nigeria Constitutional history, there have been four Constitutions. These are the 1960, 1963, 1979 and the 1999 Constitution respectively. Although there existed and still existing provisions from the removal of executive office holders like the President.<br/>This power vested on the legislature, which is sacred, aimed at checking abuse of office by President, Vice President, Governors and Deputy Governors, was unfortunately turned to an instrument of political vendetta to embarrass, intimidate, and hoodwink the executive (Enyia,2009). This impeachment saga in Nigeria is replete only with the removal of Governors of the Federating States and some Chairmen at the Local Government level in some States.<br/>The process of impeachment of different political office holders is clearly stated in different sections of the constitution depending on the nature of office. Hence, breach of procedures is usually one of the major challenge confronting the role of the legislature in this process.   The discretion in using this tool of impeachment is very much within the discretion of the legislature in this case the state or national of assembly. This exercise of this discretion is implicit in the wording of Section 188 (2) (b) stating, “that the holder of such office is guilty of gross misconduct in the performance of the functions of his office”. The term ‘gross misconduct’ is defined in Section 188 (11) as, “a grave violation or breach of the provisions of this Constitution or a misconduct of such nature as amounts in the opinion in the House of Assembly to gross misconduct”. This in itself is a very subjective test and in the absence of further definition in the constitution reliance is placed on the general dictionary definition of the term and what obtains in Employment law where the term is commonly used in contracts of employment. Gross misconduct can be defined as an unacceptable and wrong act by someone in a position of authority and responsibility. Reliance is once again placed on the three principles established in the U.S.A that gross misconduct can be established. It is respectfully submitted that without these three ingredients, the Impeachment proceedings cannot be effective. Corruption in its sense is a major challenging factor to the legislatures in delivery this responsibility due to personal interest.  <br/>1.3. Objective Of Study<br/>The main objective of this study is to determine the roles of Legislature in impeachment proceedings under the 1999 Constitution.. The role of the legislature will be considered on impeachment proceedings, the loopholes of such proceedings and make recommendations to curb the lapses created by these loopholes. This research work will examine the problems arising from the Constitutional provisions dealings on impeachment of elected Officials in Nigeria. This study will also consider the Legislative arm of government as a mechanism to checking  and investigating Officials alleged of partaking on corruption while in office through the principle of checks and balances.<br/>1.4 Methodology<br/>The research work will employ a library based methodology as emphases will be laid on primary sources to include; relevant statues, legislations, Reported Judicial Authorities etc. The Secondary data will be obtain from materials such as  Newspapers, articles by Legal authors, Internet resources, seminar papers, Textbooks. These will in no doubt give an holistic approach to achieving the objectives of the study.<br/>1.5 Significance Of The Study<br/>The findings of this study when concluded will be useful to the following categories of people:<br/>(i)               Executive arm of government: They would be aware of the need of avoiding certain official misconduct both at state and federal level in other to avoid being impeached.<br/>(ii)            State and National Assembly: as members of the law making bodies, it will help them to realize the responsibility they are committed to, by delivering their responsibility with all amount of diligence.<br/>(iii)       prospective public office holders: this study will act as guide to all intending public office to enable them understand the do and don’ts of public offices to enable them apply  caution and avoid impeachment.<br/>1.6 Scope Of The Study<br/>This long essay is limited to the role the legislature performs during impeachment proceedings. This research work would be confirmed to the definition of impeachment historical perspective, the roles of the three arms of Government on impeachment matters. The Constitutional provision and role of Courts of record, i.e. High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court on impeachment matters and cases will be delved into in order to compare and analyze the decision of the Courts.<br/>Nevertheless, it may incidentally refer to some other related areas as deemed<br/>necessary, likewise statutory and judicial authorities will be made reference to, in order to achieve the aim of the study.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE ROLE OF LEGISLATURE IN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING UNDER THE 1999 CONSTITUTION OF NIGERIA  FACULTY OF LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF LEGISLATURE IN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING UNDER THE 1999 CONSTITUTION OF NIGERIA  FACULTY OF LAW", "id": 144}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>APPLICABILITY OF NATURAL LAW PRINCIPLES TO THE LAW OF NEGLIGENCE IN NIGERIA</b><br/>  The essence of creation of man in any environment is to interact, relate and have dealings with each other, in these relationships, certain level of moral standards is expected to be maintained which has necessitated the need for a guiding of conduct.<br/>Hence, the introduction of the law which is regarded as rules, and principles set out in order to streamline the activities of man with each other.<br/>Natural law theory emphasizes that, law has a divine or supernatural origin and for human laws to be legally valid, they must conform to nature of man and dictates of reason. Human laws should stand or fall according to the dictates of the latter, just as the sun is ordained to rise from the the east.<br/>Also, as it is unavoidable that a man should interact with one another , the law of Negligence presumes the existence of a duty of care towards each other, it is however of no doubt that acts and omissions are bound to arise from such interactions which may result into unforeseen damages especially , when negligence is involved.<br/>Thus, in the course of this work, effort will be geared towards focusing on how the natural law can be embedded into the modern law of negligence i.e the law as it is and the law as it ought to be.

Today capital punishment is typically accomplished by lethal gas or injection, electrocution, hanging or shooting.<br/>The human right proponents see death penalties as a violation of the right to life and human dignity as such countries that are becoming more democratic are eager to abolish it. The trend in most industrialized nations has been to first stop executing prisoners and then substitute long terms of imprisonment for death as the most severe of criminal penalties, about 90 nation have abolished death penalties and an almost equal number of nations, (most of which are developing countries in which Nigeria is included) have retained it<br/>This thesis considers the argument for and against death penalty in relation to human rights, the argument against this concept goes beyond the Human Right Parlance, as there are other arguments like; the propensity to condemn and execute innocent citizens, the non-deterrent effect of capital punishment, the arbitrary use of the concept against the poor, the discriminately application of the concept on the basis of race, and the lesser argument that proclaims that capital punishment is cruel and inhuman. All these argument have not been reckoned with by anti-abolitionist, as some of them have come up with other modes of executions that they believe are more humane and less cruel, the sole aim of this is to kill the argument of cruel and inhuman treatment<br/>The retributive nature of the human race would rather love that a murderer be necessarily paid back in His own coin, this is believed to be the anti-abolitionist main reason for insisting on the retention of death penalty. If the cost of executing an innocent person and abolishing the concept of death penalty is compared, it would be discovered that, it is more beneficial to abolish the use of death penalty than to lose valuable citizens to wrongful executions. Moreover, countries that have substituted life sentence for death penalty are not worse off than countries that have retained it.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.2.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.4.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.5.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.6.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND HUMAN RIGHT LAW<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.1FORMS OF PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.2COMPENSATION<br/>2.1.3INCARCERATION<br/>2.1.4CORPORAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.5BANISHMENT<br/>2.1.6CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.1.7OTHER APPROACHES<br/>2.2.0: HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.2.1: MODES OF EXECUTION<br/>2.2.2CRUCIFIXION<br/>2.2.3STONING<br/>2.2.4HANGING<br/>2.2.5: SHOOTING OR FIRING SQUAD<br/>2.2.6: GAS CHAMBER OR LETHAL GAS MODE OF EXECUTION <br/>2.2.7: ELECTROCUTION<br/>2.3.0: WORLD WIDE ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>2.4.0: HISTORY OF HUMAN RIGHTS<br/>2.5.0: CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND RIGHT TO LIFE<br/>2.6.0: CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND RIGHT TO HUMAN DIGNITY<br/>2.7.0: CONCLUSION <br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>JUSTIFICATIONS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND ITS ABOLITION<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: JUSTIFICATIONS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>3.1.1JUST PUNISHMENT<br/>3.1.2DETERRENCE<br/>3.1.3INCAPACITATION<br/>3.2.0ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>3.2.1PROPENSITY TO CONDEMN INNOCENT DEFENDANTS<br/>3.2.2DISCRIMINATLY APPLICATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE<br/>3.2.3ARBITRARY APPLICATION AGAINST THE POOR<br/>3.2.4 COMPARING COST TO BENEFITS<br/>3.3.0FLAWS IN ARGUMENTS FOR ABOLITION<br/>3.3.1RACIAL BIAS<br/>3.3.2RISK TO THE INNOCENT<br/>3.4.0FLAWS IN THE ARGUMENTS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT<br/>3.4.1CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>A COMPARISON OF THE NIGERIAN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT TO THAT OF OTHER SELECTED COUNTRIES<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0 THE NIGERIAN AND U.S.A CAPITAL PUNISHMENT COMPARED<br/>4.2.0 THE NIGERIAN AND AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT COMPARED<br/>4.3.0NIGERIAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT COMPARED<br/>4.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0 RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>ARTICLES IN JOURNALS<br/>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET<br/>BOOKS<br/>CHAPTERS IN BOOKS<br/><br/> \n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR AND THE ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UNDER HUMAN RIGHTS LAW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " JUSTIFICATION FOR AND THE ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UNDER HUMAN RIGHTS LAW", "id": 146}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>NIGERIA ROLES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN AFRICA.

This is an area of 922,200 square kilometers (356,000 square miles). To travel from the west to the east is a distance of 1,120 kilometers (700 miles) from the south to north of the country about 1,040 kilometers (650 miles). It is bounded in the north by the Sahara Desert and in the south by the Gulf of Guinea, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean.<br/>Seen on a map, Nigeria can best be described as an approximately square expanse of vast territory divided into three unequal parts by a rough letter Y, which is formed by the confluence of that majestic African river, the Niger, with its chief tributary, the Benue, on its coastward journey to the Atlantic Ocean, into which it merges in the mangrove forests that line the intricate network of the Niger Delta.2<br/>Nigeria, being the most populous country in Africa, has been described as “the giant of Africa, benevolent hegemony”, etc. Nigeria with a population of approximately 150 million divided among three hundred and fifty ethnic groups practicing the two dominant monotheistic religions of Islam and Christianity and with a few still devoted to their African gods.3<br/>Nigeria is also phenomenally endowed country with billions of barrels of crude petroleum and huge gas deposits, one of the largest in the world, abundant agricultural land and sunshine, untapped solid mineral of all kinds, coal rivers that are harnessed for hydro-electricity and above al, a virile and highly sophisticated and educated people.<br/>Nigeria is indeed a land inhabited by a people of varied ethnic origin and culture, whose ancestors settled in the area that is now known as Nigeria in successive waves over many centuries. Among the chief ethnic groups that occupy Nigeria are the Hausa, Yoruba, Ibo, Kanuri, Fulani, Ibibio, Tiv, Ijaw, Edo, Efik, Nupe, Urhobo, Ekoi, Borgu and a host of other smaller groups each with its own tongue and specific cultural practices. However, underlying the diversity of the various group/peoples of Nigeria, is the deep current of cultural unity characteristic of all black Africa.<br/>At the north, east and west borders of Nigeria are Nigeria, Cameroon/Chad and Benin Republic respectively.<br/>Aggressive coastal erosion and flooding of the coastal villages and towns, a ravaging gully and bad land erosion of the eastern region characterized the land mass. There is aggressive desert encroachment from the north due to climatic changes and human activities (such as deforestation from fuel wood and overgrazing).<br/>There is frequent flooding when rivers overflow their banks. Reservoir flooding is also a common occurrence. Besides, Nigeria gained independence in October 1st 1960. Since the first coup d’ et al in 1966, the country has been unstable, with so many coups.<br/>However, Nigeria was divided into four main geographical zones: Zone 1 is along the coast where rainfall mostly of swamps. The area is served by many rivers and creeks. Rainfall is high and spread over about eight (8) months in the year; Zone 2 is the forest region where rainfall is also heavy and the vegetation is made up mostly of the thick forest; Zone 3 is the semi-Savanna Zone which lies between the forest Zone and; Zone 4 the true Savanna Zone, in the north. Here the main geographical features are grassland and the low incidence of rainfall. The Sahara desert is not far away.<br/>It is important to note at this juncture, however, the special position which the River Niger has held in the country. It is not surprising that the country has taken its name from the river. We must note that the river is unlikely to have taken its name from the colour, black or niger, used to describe Simeon of the period of the Apostles (Acts 13:1), or from the Afro-Americans carried across the Atlantic as human cargoes.4<br/>It was once suggested that the river had been called Nigeir or Nigir from the second century and derived from the Latin word “black”. Other suggestions have been that Nijer was the name given by an African community to the river, or that the Greek word for river is Naghar.<br/>Whatever the root of the word “Niger”, it is sufficient for us to note that the word Nigeria was first used to describe the country by a British Lady, Flora Shaw.<br/>Needless to say, the peoples of Nigeria have a history which stretches far back into the past; in the Savannah Lands and plains north and west of the river Nigeri, the Kanuri, Hausa, Fulani, Borgu, Nupe, Jukun and Yoruba people evolved well organized states of varying size, while the powerful Benin state lay in the forest lands immediately west of the Niger, and the Ibos, the Efiks and the people of the Niger Delta occupied the eastern bank of the Niger in political units of varied nature and size.<br/>Nigeria Roles In The Development Of International Of International Organization In Africa.

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</b><br/> Most countries have conferred the power/ownership of their resources on their government, not allowing individuals to lay claim to them. This has been beneficial for international business purposes, especially in the petroleum sector and has ensured stable revenue which is then distributed amongst the individual states in the country; while some countries like the USA recognize both state and individual ownership. Associated with exploration and exploitation activities of most natural resources is environmental degradation, which puts the environment in a non-usable position. There is therefore a need to reduce the effect of these activities. With increasing Environmental damage from the international oil companies, which has not been properly addressed by the government in countries like Nigeria, individuals have began to opt for control of their resources rather than leaving them in the control of the government. This paper aims at analyzing the effect of resource ownership by the government of a state, using Nigeria as a case study and whether the Shairah rules as established in the four juristic schools of Islamic taught can avail Nigeria from the problem of resource control agitation by the people.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVE S OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER TWO:<br/>LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER SHARIAH<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION <br/>2.1.0: STATE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIA<br/>2.2.0: INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER SHARIAH<br/>2.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER THREE:<br/>LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE NIGERIAN STATUTE<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES IN PRE-INDEPENDENCE NIGERIA<br/>3.2.0: OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES IN POST INDEPENDENCE NIGERIA<br/>3 .3.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER FOUR:<br/>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIAH AND THE NIGERIAN STATUTE<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF MINERALS UNDER THE SHARIAH AND NIGERIA STATUTE <br/>4.2.0: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIAH AND NIGERIAN STATUTE<br/>4.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER FIVE: <br/>GENERAL CONCLUSION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0: RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>ARTICLE IN JOURNALS BOOKS<br/>CHAPTERS IN BOOKS<br/><br/>\n\nOWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES UNDER THE SHARIAH AND NIGERIAN STATUTE.

It was in pursuance of this aim that both the various state and local government edicts and the for the schedule of the 1979 constitution of Nigeria assigned functions to local governments. These functions were divided into provisions of social services and economic development of the local government area.<br/>However, it is glaring that there were criticism on the mocks – operandi of the staff employed to run its affairs. The criticism ranged from discontinuity, improper policy implementation, misplaced priority, reluctant to changes in its environment, bribery corruption, red tapism and inefficiency.<br/>These malfunction and indeed the merit impediment to the smooth running of our local management services include the issues of misappropriation of funds generated which in effect, militate against the full discharging of the responsibilities of Enugu North local government area in particular and other local government in general.<br/>Based on the above problem, the Enugu North local government area which was created for effective and qualitative rural transformation has not faired efficiently in the accomplishment of these objectives, which includes provision of basic need and infrastructural changes.<br/>The autonomy granted to the local government has retarded the efforts of the local government service commission in bringing uniformity in the employment procedures in the local governments. The issue of mint was not therefore given a favourable consideration as it ought to be. It was based on political compensation, fancily ties, god-fatherism and local patrotism. One therefore wonders how a square peg could be put in a round hole.<br/>In consideration of all these problems planning the Enugu North local government and all the other local government in the country, the need for this study should not be over emphasized.<br/>The Impact Of Revenue Generation On Local Government Administration In Nigeria (A Case Study Of Enugu North L.G.A.

This progressive undeniable dynamism in human nature has made it quit vital that man must be creative and not just that, but also innovative to satisfy his ever increasing unsuitable wants, thereby prompting some legal installation to this effect. This piece of work is propelled toward examining the creative work of man vis-Ã -vis the way he can be protected against any undue and unwarranted encroachment on his creative ability and the possible bodies vested with authority to look into the issue and the likely way it could be remedied if peradventure his interest was breach. Chapter one of this work is gives an insight into the significance of the study and concept of copyright, tracing its antecedence and developmental phases it has passed through till date, Chapter two would be dwelling predominantly on the work to be protected, those eligible to be protected and how they can arrived at it. Also to be considered is the aspect of authorship and ownership of copyright, terms of copyright the exception to copyright and how it can be effectively transferred in the Nigeria context. <br/>Chapter three, will dwell essentially on the administration of copyright in Nigeria centering more on the duties of the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) and other regulatory bodies like Phonographic Performance Limited, Performing Musician and Artist of Nigeria, Performing and Broadcasting Rights of Author/Composer and publisher MRS and many others including inspectors who would be considered as forces behind the curtain seen to a hitch free inventory society like ours. It is difficult to have an absolute crime free society, thus chapter four will be considering the infringement that copyright works are subjected to and the likely cure to the injury she might sustain in that process in form of remedies. Lastly, chapter five would be offering recommendation which might turn out to be invariable, as the conclusion ushers in, collecting in a statement or to the whole piece as the curtain falls.

It is a state of discord caused by the actual or perceived opposition of needs, values and interests.1 It exist whenever incompatible activities occur. An activity that is incompatible with another is one that prevents, blocks or interferes with the occurrence or effectiveness of the second activity.<br/>The incompatibility or differences may exist in reality or may only be perceived by the parties involved. Nonetheless, the opposing actions and the hostile emotions are very real hallmark between people in all kind of human relationship and in al social settings. As a result of the wide range of potential differences between people, the absence of conflict usually signals the absence of meaningful interaction2. A conflict can be as small as a perceived disagreement or as large as war. It can originate in the person, between two or more people or between two or more groups. Conflict by itself is neither good nor bad but the manner in which conflict is handled determines whether it is constructive or destructive.<br/>A conflict is different from competition and cooperation because in competitive situations, the two or more individuals or parties have mutually inconsistent goals as either party tries to reach its goals, it undermine the attempt of the others to reach theirs. Therefore, competitive situations will by their nature cause conflict. Conflict can also occur in cooperative situation, in which two or more individuals or parties have consistent goals because the manner in which one party tries to reach its goal may undermine the other individual or party.3<br/>A clash of interests, values, action or directions often sparks a conflict and conflict is also seen as the existence of the clash. The world ‘conflict’ is applicable from the instant the clash occurs. Even when it is described as a potential conflict, it is implying that there is already conflict of direction even though a clash has not occurred. As a result, conflict can occur whenever there is interaction. Leo Otoide describe this situation in the international system thus:<br/>When states interact there is competition for power and prestige and in the process, the international system elicits a picture of perpetual conflict, of survival of the fittest, where the desire for power and influence determines the attitudes of states and the course of events.4<br/>Conflict occurs in different levels. The first is interpersonal conflict. Interpersonal conflict is when two people have incompatible needs; goals, or approaches in their relationship.5 Communication breakdown is often an important source of interpersonal conflict and learning communication skills is valuable in preventing and resolving such difficulties. At the same time, very real differences occur between people that cannot be resolved by any amount of improved communication. Personality conflict refers to very strong differences in motives, values or styles in dealing with people that are not resolvable. For instance, if both parties in a relationship have a high need for power and both want to be dominant in the relationship, there is no way for both to be satisfied, and a power struggle ensures common tactics used in interpersonal power struggles includes the exaggerated used of reward and punishments, deception and evasion, threats and emotional blackmail and flattery or integration. Unresolved power conflict usually recycles and escalates to the point of relationship breakdown and termination.<br/>Conflict Management In Africa: The Role Of The Civil Society<br/><br/> \n\nCONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA: THE ROLE OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA: THE ROLE OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY", "id": 153}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>WIDOWHOOD PRACTICE IN NIGERIA</b><br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.1 General Introduction <br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>2.0 Overview of Widowhood Practice in Nigeria<br/>2.1 South-South Nigeria – Edo/Rivers States <br/>2.2 South-East Nigeria – Anambra/Imo States <br/>2.3 South-West Nigeria – Ondo State<br/>2.4 North-Central Nigeria – Benue<br/>2.5 North-West Nigeria – Kano<br/>2.6 North-East Nigeria - Bauchi<br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>3.0 Health Implications of widowhood Practices<br/>3.1 Economic effects of widowhood<br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>Widows Rights and Inheritance <br/>4.1 Customary Law <br/>4.2 Common Law<br/>4.3 Sharia Law<br/>4.4 Widows’ Inheritance<br/>4.5 Treatment of Widowers<br/>4.6 Review of Legislative Interventions<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>5.1 Recommendation (The Way Forward)<br/>5.2 Conclusion<br/>Schedule<br/>TABLE OF LEGISLATION<br/>1.

Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery.<br/>Introduction<br/>Discrimination against women is defined by Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women 1979 (referred to as the 1979 Convention) as “any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.”1 Discrimination then is symptomatic of any situation where patterns of structural inequality are maintained by rules, norms and procedures which dictate a subordinate role for women in all spheres of society. The movements calling for an end to all forms of discrimination against women emphasize the need for a radical re-definition of the process and content of economic, social and political development and stress the need for a holistic orientation which acknowledges the vital role of women in development and engineers their integration into development planning and process as equal partners with men. For this purpose, it is argued that legal and substantive protection at the domestic, regional and international levels must be coordinated for more meaningful enhancement of both the status and situation of women.<br/>Discrimination against women in particular societies takes different forms, and thus requires the utilization of differential strategies in different historical epochs and societies.<br/>Discrimination against women will continue to be a problem until all the factors responsible for its existence, maintenance and institutionalization are understood and eradicated.<br/>Widowhood has also been defined as the state of mourning the loss of one’s husband or wife through death3. The stress of this phenomenon is as real as those of loneliness and divorce. Widowhood is thus seen as a life event with wide range of consequences. For instance, widowhood is known to be responsible for the poor health status of widows and widowers, with minimal long-term consequences and is also associated with intense grief and angry expressions, especially among more widows than the divorced (when) compared.4 This is possibly because of deprivation following loss of spousal intimacy through death. It can thus be concluded that widowhood by implication is a stressful life event demanding practicable support systems.<br/><br/>\n\nWIDOWHOOD PRACTICE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WIDOWHOOD PRACTICE IN NIGERIA", "id": 154}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>WOMEN IN POLITICS (A REVIEW OF COMMON AND ISLAMIC LAW PROVISION)</b><br/>Issue of gender equality (men and women) are equal in all ranks, which also includes politics, which is aimed at women rather than men, these debates degenerate and disintegrate into discordant posturing, grandstanding, sweeping, generalizations and misrepresentation.

March, 1978 has generated more controversy than any piece of legislation of its kind. The sore point of this enactment is the consent requirement provided under the Act especially Sections 21 and 22 therein.<br/>Ever since the consent requirement of the Land Use Act made its first debut in our courts for interpretation in the case of Savannah Bank V. Ajilo(1989) 1 NWLR(pt.97) 305, much juristic ink has been expended in debate for or against the usefulness of the provisions. Judges, in their duty of interpreting the provision have sung incoherent and discordant notes on the issue. Some writers too, have tried to either show support for its relevance or call for its repeal or amendment.<br/>However, the convergent point in this contentious issue of the consent requirement is the retrogression and retardation, which the requirement, has continued to inflict on the socio-economic life and development of the country. This project work x-rayed the difficulties associated with, and incidental to the strict implementation of the consent requirement with their attendant legal, socio-economic and developmental dysfunction. Moreover it reviewed the current Amendment Bill before the National Assembly while unattended areas were highlighted, which, if not taken care of, may resonate another call in no distant future for a further amendment.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT        <br/>Chapter One: SYSTEM OF LAND TENURE IN NIGERIA        <br/>    BEFORE THE LAND USE ACT, 1978.        <br/>1.1    Introduction        <br/>1.2    Customary Land Tenure        <br/>1.3Land Holding under the Received English Law        <br/>1.4    The Consent Requirement in Retrospect<br/>1.4.1    Meaning and Nature of consent Requirement    <br/>1.4.2    Consent Requirement in Retrospect    <br/>Chapter Two: THE LAND USE ACT, 1978.    <br/>2.1    Historical Review    <br/>2.2    Objectives of the Act viz a viz the consent requirement    <br/>2.3    Scope of the Consent Requirement under the Act    <br/>2.4    Analysis of the Consent Provisions on:<br/>2.4.1    Sale of Land    <br/>2.4.2    Mortgages    <br/>2.4.3    Leases    <br/>2.4.4  Devolution of Interest in Land    <br/>Chapter Three: THE CONSENT REQUIREMENT- A CRITICAL VIEW<br/>3.1    Legal effects    <br/>3.2    Socio-economic effects    <br/>3.3    Implementation problems    <br/>3.4    Other consequences    <br/> <br/>Chapter Four: THE NEED FOR REFORM<br/>4.1    A review of the Amendment Bill, 2009 before the National<br/>    Assembly    <br/>4.2    Suggested Reforms    <br/>4.3    Conclusion    <br/>Bibliography.<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS<br/> <br/><br/>J.C.A    Justice of the Court of Appeal of Nigeria<br/>Anor    Another<br/>C.A    Court of Appeal<br/>J.S.C    Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria<br/>L.U.A    Land Use Act, 1978<br/>N.W.L.R.    Nigeria Weekly Law Report<br/>W.A.C.A.    West African Court of Appeal<br/>S.C.    Supreme Court of Nigeria<br/>S    Section<br/>Ss    Sections<br/>All E.R.    All England Law Reports<br/>N.R.N.L.R.    Northern Region of Nigeria Law Report<br/>N.L.R.    Nigeria Law Report<br/>Ors    Others<br/>S.C.N.J.    Supreme Court of Nigeria Judgments<br/>Supra    Above cited<br/>V.    Versus (and)<br/>ANLR    All Nigeria Law Reports<br/>P    Page<br/>Pt    Part<br/>Op.cit    Cited opposite (in the book cited earlier)<br/>F.S.C    Federal Supreme Court of Nigeria<br/>Ibid    in the same place<br/>TABLE OF STATUTES<br/>Interpretation Act, Cap 89, LFN, 1958.<br/>Land &amp; Native Rights Act NO 1, 1916 &amp; 1918.

It is not an overstatement to say that without land there would be no human existence. This is because it is from land that man gets items very<br/>essential for his survival such as food, fuel, clothing, shelter, medication and others1<br/>In the words of Omotola,<br/>“Every person requires land for his support, preservation<br/>and, self actualization within the general ideals of the society. Land is the foundation of shelter, food and employment. Man lives on land during his life and upon his demise, his remains are kept in it permanently. Even where the remains are cremated, the ashes eventually settle on land. It is therefore crucial to the existence of the individual and the society. It is inseparable from the concept of the society. Man has been aptly described as a land animal.”2<br/>Global recognition of the relevance of land to the life of man can be gleaned<br/>from the proceedings at the United Nations conference on Human settlement<br/>(Habitat II), 1996, where many countries committed themselves to<br/> “promoting optimal use of productive land in urban and rural areas and protecting fragile ecosystems and environmentally vulnerable areas from the negative impacts of human settlements, inter alia, through developing and supporting the implementation of improved land management practices that deal comprehensively with potentially competing land requirements for agriculture, industry,<br/> 1    Datong, P.Z.: “The role of State Government in the Implementation of the Land Use Act in The Land Use Act Administration and Policy Implication (ed.) by Olayide Adigun, Unilag Press, 1991, P.64.<br/>2    Omotola, J.A. (Prof.) Law and Land Rights: Whither Nigeria,Uinlag, Akoka, Inaugural lecture series<br/> 1988 P.6<br/> transport urban development, green space, protected areas and other vital needs.”3<br/>It is this importance of land to man and the society that influenced the state intrusion into property legislation in order to ensure adequate and efficient management technique for the benefits of the greatest number of the members of the society.<br/>The Land Use Act which is the umbrella statute, under which the consent requirement is to be critically analyzed in this work, was promulgated by the Obasanjo administration in 1978 to address this importance of land to mankind, and therefore provide viable management options to land administration in Nigeria. This salient fact is borne out of the preamble to the Act. Consequently, section one of the Act vests ownership of all land within the territory of a state in the Governor of the state who will in turn administer such land for the benefit of all Nigerians.<br/>As an incidence of the vesting of the radical title in the Governor, sections 7, 15(b) 21, 22, 23(1), 24(b), and 34(7) provide for the Governor’s consent (or LG’s approval in relevant cases) to be sought and obtained before a holder of a right of occupancy can alienate his whole or part of his right thereof by way of assignment, transfer of possession, sublease or otherwise howsoever. These provisions have attracted a lot of comments and criticisms from various learned authors and the law courts with a near<br/>3    See Declaration of United Nations Conference on Human settlements available at www. un. Org/Conference/habitat II<br/> unanimous call for their amendments to suit, in practicality, the noble intendments of the Act.<br/>This, no doubt has evoked my interest to delve into this contentions area of the Act with a view to critically appraise this thorny issue of the consent requirement. However, I must concede that this project work is not the first on this issue. It is, in fact, a part of a continuing discourse on land management and reforms in Nigeria. But this critical appraisal may be regarded as a bold attempt on the issue, coming after the Amendment Bill might have been presented before the National Assembly. It is intended therefore, to in addition, highlight those areas of the consent requirement which seems to have been ignored by the Bill, while urging the national assembly to expeditiously save Nigerians from the stranglehold of this consent requirement of the Land Use Act.<br/> SYSTEM OF LAND TENURE IN NIGERIA BEFORE THE LAND USE<br/>ACT, 1978<br/> 1.1    INTRODUCTION<br/>It is necessary to understand the antecedents that have led to the current<br/>state of land administration and the agitation for reforms. Hence, the essence of this chapter is to review the system of land tenure in Nigeria before the Act in 1978.<br/>Land is one of the three major factors of production; capital, Labour and land. It is a generally held belief that the use and control of land as a productive asset requires the establishment of a legal and institutional framework for land management. But that framework has exercised very little influence in Nigeria on the way property rights to land have developed over the years. This is largely due to strong feelings which the subject of land evokes. The reasons for this are not far fetched. First, the supply of land is virtually fixed yet it is required to provide security (either productive, investment or both) in such forms as food shelter as well as a base for the rapid transformation of the Nigerian economy. Secondly, land management in Nigeria comprises a multitude of irregular units in the ownership use and management by different individuals, corporate bodies and even the state. The major decision taken by these groups have implications<br/> not only for the other groups but also society at large. Thirdly land is the focus of much wealth, power and status. Indeed, the current concern in the use of land as a vehicle for investment gain as well as a hedge against inflation under condition of economic turbulence, points to the centrality of land in present day Nigeria, and more importantly how it is managed.<br/>In considering this topic, I shall first discus the customary land tenure, that is to say, the practice before the coming of the British Colonialists to Nigeria. This will be followed by the system operational with the colonialisation of Nigeria. The chapter will be capped with an examination of the consent requirements in the stages of land management developments afore-mentioned. It is intended that this chapter will serve as a basis for the discussion of the existing land use management policy, the land use Act of 1978 under chapter two.<br/>1.2    CUSTOMARY LAND TENURE<br/>Land in its most legalistic of senses is under customary law owned not by<br/>man but by his creator. This is an overriding principle guiding all types of customary land tenure in Nigeria.4 Men merely have use and occupation thereof and any abuse must be remedied by propitiatory sacrifices.<br/>1.

According to the Eleshi of Odogbolu3,<br/>“Land belongs to the vast family of which many are dead, a few are living, and countless others still unborn”<br/>However,  the  prevailing  view  seems  to  be  that  land  belongs  to  the<br/>community and as such, the decision of the Privy Council in Amodu Tijani V.<br/>Secretary of Southern Nigeria4, that land belongs to the community, the village<br/>or family and never to the individual was widely accepted as substantially true.<br/>The meaning of land belonging to the family or community as interpreted<br/>by Dr. Musa G. Yakubu5  is to the effect that, it does not mean that all the<br/>members possess and use the land at the same time, for the same purpose and<br/>equally.  The  true  meaning  is  that  individual  members  of  these  families  or<br/>communities have certain rights, claims, powers, privileges and immunities in<br/>and over the land. No member shall be denied of profits that accrued from it or<br/>the privilege of participating in the management of the land. The whole idea, as<br/>professor Oluyede6 succinctly put it, is that,<br/>“group ownership in African context is an unrestricted right of the individual in the group to what is held to be the common asset<br/>Of land; the right of all in the group to claim<br/>2.    Craigwell-Handy. The Religions significance of Land, RAS, (1939) P. 114 cited in Adedipe, Olawoye &amp; Okediran, op.cit<br/>3.    Before the West African Land Committee; 1908<br/>4.    (1921) 2 A.C. 399.<br/>5.    A former Dean of Law, ABU, Zaria- A paper presented on “Principles of property Law”<br/>6.    Oluyede: Modern Nigeria Law, Evans Bros (Nigeria) P.12<br/> support from the group’s land and the tacit understanding that absolute ownership is vested in the community as a whole”<br/>Although there is no uniform system of customary laws operating throughout Nigeria, there are as many systems of customary law as there are ethnic groups and within an ethnic area there are may be variations, not in essence but in detain, in respect of the particular localities of the area. Nevertheless a careful examination of the various systems reveals some common characteristics7. Land, as a community or family property, is entrusted in the hands of the headman, chief or traditional ruler8a (in the case of communal land) and the family head8b (in the case of family land), who exercises the powers of control and management of such land on behalf of the community or family as the case may be. The same corporate theory of land management is<br/>applicable to both. It is to be taken therefore, that references to the family head is applicable to the community chief, and references to principal members of a family is equally references to the various family heads that make up a village or community, and vice-versa.<br/> 7. Olawoye, C.O. (1974), Title to Land in Nigeria, Evans Brothers Ltd, London .<br/>8a. Per viscount Haldane in Ahmodu Tijani .V. Secretary of Southern Nigeria (supra) P. 404. 8b. Ibid<br/> Although the chief or headman of the community in the exercise of his powers is sometimes described as a trustee, he is not strictly speaking a trustee in the English sense. This is because the title to the land is not vested in him, but remains vested in the community as a corporate entity. That’s not withstanding, the head or chief of the community as the community’s alter ego is the proper person to exercise the ownership rights, of the community subject to the individual rights of members9. Hence any outright alienation of land by the family without the active participation of the head is void as was established in the Ghanaian case of Agbole V. Sappor10 and adopted in the Nigerian case of Ekpendu V. Erika11. The same principle has been restated by the Supreme Court in Odekilekun V. Hassan12, where it was held that sale of communal or family land by the head of the community without the consent of the principal members of the family is voidable at the instance of the family or community. In that case, the Supreme Court drew a distinction between sales by community head in a representative capacity and one in his personal capacity. In the case of his sale for and on behalf of the community without the requisite consent of the members, the sale is voidable while a sale in his personal capacity is void, the principle being ‘nemo dat quod non habet’.<br/> 9.    Nwabueze, B.O: Nigerian Land Law, (1982) Nwamife publishers P. 151<br/>10.    (1947) 12 WACA 187<br/>11.    (1959) 4 FSC 79<br/>12.    (1997) 12 NWLR (pt. 531) 56.<br/> It has been submitted that the court will rarely interfere with the rights of the family head in the management of family property, he must not, however, abuse such power13. The powers are traditionally given to him to be used for the benefit of the family as a whole as well as himself. Therefore, if he treats the family property as his personal property, he is wittingly abusing his powers. Thus in Lopez V. Lopez14, the court noted as follows:<br/>When there has been a persistent refusal by the<br/>head of the family or some members of the family<br/>to allow other members of the family to enjoy<br/>their rights under native law and custom in<br/>family land, the courts have exercised and<br/>will continue to exercise its undoubted right<br/>to make such orders as will ensure that members<br/>of the family shall enjoy their rights, and if such<br/>rights cannot be ensured without partitioning<br/>the land, to order a partition”<br/>Accordingly, in the celebrated case of Archibong Vs Archibong15, certain beach<br/>land  belonging  to  the  community  of  Duke-Town  in  calabar  has  been<br/>compulsorily acquired by the government and $3,000 paid as compensation.<br/>The money was given to Rev. Effiong as the representative of the community.<br/>Rev. Effiong called the meeting of the community at which he brought out the<br/>sum of $1,579 as compensation paid for the community land. Two other sub-<br/>family members of the community were not included in the meeting that took<br/> 13.    Ndukwe O, Comparative Analysis of Nigerian Customary Law, UNICAL Press, Calabar, Nigeria, (1999).

It was held that the first defendant<br/>was liable to render an account and to pay over whatever might be found due<br/>thereon. The court equally observed that the requirement of consultation is a<br/>requirement of law and not just a matter of convenience to be observed or<br/>disregarded16.  Again,  even  family  property  allotted  to  members  cannot  be<br/>alienated to any other persons without the consent of the family. Craig, J.S.C in<br/>Alao V. Ajam17 put it thus<br/>“A members of the family is not permitted to introduce a stranger into the family by the back door, nor is he permitted to fetter the reversionary interest due to the family by a complex commercialization of the simple possession granted to him”<br/>Hence, alienation of family property by any member without the consent of the<br/>family head is void abinitio18.<br/>At this juncture, it is pertinent to consider briefly the land tenure in the<br/>Northern states of Nigeria under the Islamic law of the Maliki School which is<br/>applicable in Nigeria. Land is regarded as a gift of Allah (God) while each<br/>person has usufructuary rights. Under the Islamic Land tenure law in Nigeria,<br/>land  can  be  divided  into  three  legal  categories-occupied,  unoccupied  and<br/>common land19.<br/>16.See also Kosoko V. Kosoko (1937) 13 NLR 131 17. (1989) 6 S.C.N.J. 243.<br/>18.See Ogunmefun V. Ogunmefun (1931) 10 N.L.R 82 19..Mamman, A.B; Land management in Nigeria, P. 97<br/> Occupied land is that land which is under use and which basic tenet is that the occupier in free to deal with the land as he likes, subject to not causing any injury to members of the public and subject to acquisition for public purpose. Thus, he can sell, pledge or loan and enter into tenancy agreements without the consent of the Emir or ruler or any authority. Unoccupied land, on the other hand, can be sub-divided into two; land close to the emirate capital and/or other towns and those far away from the capital or town. The Emir is the main land manager. Thus one cannot occupy any land in towns or in their vicinity without first obtaining the consent of the Emir. But once allocated, the person to who it is allocated became the absolute owner. According to Yakubu20, this means that the occupier has a title against all persons and he is free to use it the way he likes but cannot alienate it to a total stranger without the consent of the Emir.<br/>However, Land which is far away from the town is free for all persons or a ‘no man’s Land’ where any person can acquire land by clearing, cultivating, building or planting or economic tress etc, without the consent of any authority. A third variant of land category, whether occupied or unoccupied land, is the waqf or common land which an Emir can declare such land as common or public land. Mostly land gained from war, cession and treaty were excluded. They include land used for markets, praying grounds or grazing land.<br/> 20.Yakubu, M.G. (1985): Land Law in Nigeria, Macmillan, London<br/> In situations were such land were occupied, the occupier was given another piece of land somewhere and compensation, where required, was paid. It should be noted that Islamic Law doe not recognize holding of land for a fixed tenure, at the expiration of which rights in the land lapse. Again the Emirs had no proprietary rights to land and were, therefore, not land owners. They had rights over inhabitants as district from rights over land21.<br/>1.3    LAND HOLDING UNDER THE RECEIVED ENGLISH LAW<br/>One of the impacts of colonization is that it imported into the country the<br/>English common Law, the doctrines of equity and the statutes of general application in relation to land law that were in force England on the 1st day of January, 190022. Some of these statutes are: the Real property Act, 1845, statute of frauds, 1877, the Wills Act, 1837, the limitations Act, 1833 and 1877, the partition Act, 1868, the conveyancing Act, 1881, the settled Land Act, 1882 and the Land Transfer Act, 1887. Accordingly, the English common Law rules relating to tenures, disposition of real property, estates, inheritance, perpetuities and a number of others became applicable in Nigeria. The same could be said of the doctrine of the equity, which included the construction of Wills, institution and settlement of Land, legal and equitable estates and interests in Land and the doctrines of notice.<br/> 21.Yakubu; Op. cit<br/>22.  See S.45 Interpretation Act, cap 89, repealed by Act of 1964, No 1.<br/> In a nutshell, colonization brought about the substitution of ownership of Land with such concepts as rights, interest, possession and occupation23.<br/>The Received English Land Law is based on the doctrines of tenure and estate24. By the doctrine of tenure, all Lands in England belong to the crown. The doctrine of estate on the other hand concedes to the individual the right of seisin or what is known in common phraseology as possession which he holds either directly or indirectly of the crown as a tenant. It is of two types; freehold and Non-freehold. The freehold estate is subdivided into fee-simple estate, life estate and fee-tail or estate-entail. The fee-simple estate is the largest possible interest in Land received into Nigerian Law, and which, theoretically in England, does not amount to absolute ownership25. It denotes inheritance by any manner of successor, - brother, wife etc, and for as long as it has successors from generation to generation26. The life estate is an estate whose duration is measured by the life of the tenant or the life of another person. It may be created by express limitation or by operation of law. It is expressly created where, for example, Land is limited in favour of X for life or where in the alternative it is limited in favour of X for the life of Y.<br/>23.    Amiko and Amidu; Women and Land Rights Reforms in Nigeria, a paper presented at the 5th FIG Regional conference in Accra, Ghana, March 8-11, 2006; available at www. oauife.edu.ng/articles. (accessed on 01-06-2010)<br/>24.    Nwabueze, B.O; Op. Cit, P. 75<br/>25.    Amiko &amp; Amidu; Op. cit, P.5.<br/>26.    Egwummuo, J.N; Principles and practice of Land Law , (1999) P. 82<br/> In the first instance, the estate is measured by the life of X, and in the second place by the life of Y by way of an estate per autre vie (that is, in the life of a person other than the tenant). The fee-tail or Estate-entail is where the right of inheritance is limited to the specified descendants of the original tenant or grantee, and the estate reverts to the grantor on failure of the descendant entitled to inherit it.<br/>Any estate whose duration is fixed or ascertainable at inception (during the grant) is called a Non-free hold estate. It does not matter that it is stated to be for a million years, once it is known or can be ascertained at the beginning, the date on which the estate will end, the estate is said to be non-freehold. In modern Land Law, the only surviving non-freehold estate is the leasehold. It now includes subleases or assignments.<br/>As a result of the application of the received English Land Law in Nigeria, between 1900 and 1978, Nigeria had the problem of applying two types of tenure to our land system. Nigerians were allowed, however, to decide which tenure to apply during land transactions. The situation gave rise to property legislations which regulated the allocation and use of Land in Nigeria. The effects of these legislations as well as communal tenure on alienation, with particular emphasis on the requirement of consent, will form the nucleus of the next discussion.<br/> 1.4    THE CONSENT REQUIREMENT IN RETROSPECT<br/>1.4.1    MEANING AND NATURE OF CONSENT REQUIREMENT<br/>The  word  ‘consent’  has  been  defined  as  ‘agreement,  approval  or<br/>permission as to some act or purpose, esp. given voluntarily by a competent person; legally effective assent’.27 Under the Nigeria Land tenure, the word represents a legal necessity for the validity of an alienation of Land. It denotes the approval of a person(s) recognized by the Law to give such approval, and the absence of which may void a transaction in Land at which such approval is expected to be obtained, or at least make the transaction voidable, depending on the status of the approving authority.<br/>Consent is often but not always preceded by consultation. In Etim V. Butt28, Niki Tobi, JCA (as he then was) put the relationship in the following<br/>way:<br/> 27.    Garner, B.A (Ed) Black’s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.) P. 323<br/>28.    (1997) 11 NWLR (pt. 527), P. 71<br/> “In human behaviour and human conduct, consultation comes before consent. As a matter of fact, it is consultation which generally gives<br/>rise to or results in consent. While consultation may not invariably result in consent, it generally comes<br/>first before consent. There are, however, instances where there is no consultation but parties give their consent on the conclusion of the act,<br/>which shall have been subject, or the subject<br/>of consultation. If the consultee gives his consent without the act of consultation following from the consulter, the act of consultation becomes<br/>spent or otiose”.<br/> The requirement about consent is designed to protect the interest of the<br/>person(s) with allordial little to the Land, and especially in a community, to<br/>ensure that the interest of the unborn generations will not be easily defeated<br/>without full discussion by all the members concerned. It is therefore prohibitive<br/>and inhibiting in nature.<br/>Consent could, however, be a standing or general one covering not just<br/>one but all transactions of a particular type, as for example the granting of<br/>leases29, or it may be implied from conduct, as where the members have held<br/>out the chief to the grantee or purchaser as having<br/> 29.  Adewujui V. Ishola (1958) W.R.N.L.R 110; Foko V. Foko (1965) N.M.L.R.5<br/> authority to conclude the transaction in question30, or where a member, knowing of a proposed deal, did nothing to express his objection31. Be that as it may, the overriding principle is that alienation of Land without the requisite consent has a far-reaching legal consequences on the property, be it family’s, community’s, or otherwise.<br/> 1.4.2  THE CONSENT REQUIREMENT IN RETROSPECT<br/>The requirement of consent for alienation of Land either by sale, transfer, lease, mortgage or otherwise howsoever is not the peculiarity of the Land Use Act. The requirement in one form or another has featured in older laws. Also, it is not the prerogative of enacted legislations. Under the customary Law, the consents of the family head and the principal members are required for the alienation of family Land. The principle was established in Ekpendu V. Erika (supra), and adopted in a long line of decided cases. It is to the effect that alienation of family Land without the consent of the family head first had and obtained is void ab initio. But where the alienation is done without the consent of a principal member of the family, the transaction is only voidable at the instance of the member or members whose consent where not obtained.<br/> 30.    Secretary, L.T.C.V Soule (1939) 15 N.L.R. 72<br/>31.    Olowu V. Desalu (1955) 14 WACA 662<br/> It should be borne in mind that the objective of the customary Law is to preserve the family Land for the family. In the eyes of customary Law, Land is sacrosanct and therefore virtually inalienable. The consent requirement therefore is to serve as an encumbrance on family Land to guard against arbitrary and unrestricted alienation. But it is noteworthy the point that customary Law makes a distinction between absolute and non-absolute aleination32. Absolute alienation such as outright sale or gift is aimed at achieving a conversion from communal or family ownership to individual ownership. This requires consent. But non-absolute alienation such as a conditional lease, mortgage or pledge passes only a possessory right to the transferee, while the ownership remains with the transferor. This type of transaction, strictly speaking, would not require consent since the right passed is redeemable at any time by any member of the family. On such redemption, ownership reverts to the family33.<br/>The old English Mortmain and charitable uses Act of 188834 requires the consent of the crown for any foreign company to acquire Land from a private citizen. It is suggested that the restriction was necessary to discourage indiscriminate acquisition of Land by foreign companies and to protect thee private citizen from unguided alienation of his valued possession.<br/> 32.    Nwabueze, B.O; Op. cit, P.38<br/>33.    Kwino V. Ampong (1952) 14 WACA 250<br/>34.    Section 8<br/> However, if a foreign company somehow succeeds in acquiring Land without<br/>the requisite consent, a private citizen, including the grantor, has no standing to<br/>raise objection. It is only the crown to whom the Land illegally acquired is<br/>forfeited, that can sue for forfeiture.<br/>The Land and Native Rights Act No. 1 of 1916, modified by the Act No.<br/>18 of 191835, provide as follows<br/>“3. All native lands, and rights over the same, are hereby declared to be under the control and subject to the disposition of the Governor and shall be held and administered for the use and common benefit of the natives<br/>of Northern Nigeria; and no title to the occupation and of any such lands shall be valid without the consent of the<br/>Governor”.<br/> “4. The Governor, in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by this proclamation with respect to any land, shall have regard to the native laws and customs existing in the district in which such Land is situated”.<br/> 35.  Section 3 &amp; 4.<br/> Sir  P.  Girouard36   explained  the  term  ‘native  Land”,  at  page  27  of  his<br/>memoranda as follows:<br/>“If land were nationalized and alienation in fee simple made impossible, they would, for the time being, be best described, in my opinion as ‘native land, the description national Land which might suggest itself,<br/>being today, for obvious reasons, a misnomer. As the native or national lands would include the land requirement of their government, there would appear to be no necessity for<br/>the term ‘crown lands”.<br/> Other powers granted the governor by the Land and Native Rights Act include:<br/>(a)    To grant rights of occupancy to ‘natives’ as well as ‘non-natives’.<br/>(b)    To demand and revise rents for such grants<br/>(c)    To render null and void any attempted alienation by an occupier of his right of occupancy without the governor’s consent.<br/>(d)    To revoke the grants to occupiers for ‘good cause’ shown.<br/>The Land and Native Rights Act of 1916 (with later amendments)<br/> 36. Elias, T.O Nigerian Land Law (4th Ed) Sweet and Maxwell, London, 1971, P. 31.<br/> was refurbished into the Land Tenure Law of 1962 whose influence on the enactment of the Land use Act is so remarkable that it may not be an overstatement to say that the Land use Act of 1978 is a mere shadow of the Land tenure Law of 1962.<br/>Section 5 of the Land Tenure Law of 1962 places the management, control and disposition of Land in the North under the minister for Land, who holds and administer all lands for the use and common benefit of the ‘natives’, and by section 11 of the Law, “no title to occupation and use of any such lands by a non-natives is valid without the consent of the ministers”. A ‘non-native’ by the tenor of the Law is a person whose father is not a member of any tribe indigenous to each state in Northern Nigeria.<br/>Again, a holder of a statutory right of occupancy cannot alienate without the minister’s consent. In Solanke V Abed and Anor37, a holder of a statutory right of occupancy leased same to a tenant without the minister’s prior consent.<br/>He attempted to eject the tenant on the ground that the lease was illegal for lack of consent. The tenant sued the Landlord for trespass, claiming damages. The court found for the plaintiff. It was held that the lease was void but not illegal, and that the Landlord cannot rely on his own wrongful act to claim that the<br/> 37.  (1962) N.R.N.L.R. 92<br/> contract was unenforceable.<br/>Section 6(ii) (c) of the State Land Act of 1916 prohibits subleasing of<br/>state land or any part of it without the governor’s written consent. Thus in Sam<br/>Warri Esi V.J.A Moruku38, the plaintiff who held a lease of crown Land under<br/>the state Land Act sublet part of the premises to the defendant. The plaintiff<br/>later sued for arrears of rent. The court held that the sublease was illegal and<br/>therefore cannot be enforced. The learned judge observed that the covenant not<br/>to  assign  without  the  governor’s  consent  was  a  covenant  designed  by  the<br/>legislature for the management and disposal of crown (State) lands in which the<br/>whole public have an interest.<br/>State Land was defined under section 2 of the Act to mean;<br/>“All public lands in the federation which are for the time being vested in<br/>the president on behalf or for the benefit of the federal republic…. and all lands heretofore held or hereafter acquired by any authority of the federation for any purpose…”<br/> 38.  (1940) 15 NLR 116<br/> The court further observed that the reasons for these statutory restrictions<br/>to assign, sublet or otherwise part with possession of Land, were that it was<br/>undesirable from the Landlord’s point of view that the Land should fall into the<br/>lands of a person of no substance or of doubtful character.  Where the Landlord<br/>was the state itself, it had power to enact positive prohibitions.<br/>In the same vein, the Native Lands Acquisition Act (No 32 of 1917) that<br/>regulated the acquisition of land by aliens from the people of the southern<br/>provinces provided as follows39<br/>“3 (a) No alien shall acquire any interest or right in or over any land within the protectorate from a native except under an instrument which had received the approval in writing of the Governor.<br/>(b)    Any instrument, which has not received the approval of the Governor as required by the section shall be null an void.<br/>4.    Where any interest or right in or over any Land has been acquired by an alien from a native with the approval in writing of the governor …, such interest or right shall not<br/> 39.    Sections 3 &amp; 4<br/> (a)    be transferred to any other alien without the approval in writing of the Governor40.<br/>The Native Lands Acquisition Act of 1917 was later re-enacted as the Native Lands Acquisition Law of 1952 for the West and Midwestern Nigeria and the Acquisition of Land by Aliens Law, 1956 in the Eastern States. These regional enactments carried over the consent requirement restrictions of their precursor. It was argued that the restrictions were necessary to protect the then unsophisticated natives from being lured by the attraction of cash in undertaking unguided and indiscriminate alienation of their valuable heritage.<br/>From the foregoing, copious evidence has been adduced to prove that the consent requirement has a long history of restrictive, prohibitive, even discriminating Land management, disposition and acquisition policy. As commented by Justice T.O. Elias on the Native Land Acquisition Act of 1917, that<br/>“ the government has pursued a policy of restricting alienation of Land in the formed southern provinces only to dealings among the peoples themselves”41<br/>40.    This provision was repealed in the 1938 amendment of the Act such that an alien can transfer his interest to another alien without the consent. This new position was established in the case of Eyamba &amp; Ors V. Koure (1937) 3 WACA 186.<br/>41.    Elias, T.O; Op. Cit, P. 31<br/> It has been submitted that the consent requirement of the customary Land Law is a built-in mechanism for discouraging alienation of family Land since the objective of customary Land law is the retaining of family Land to the family. The question that begs for answer is, is the consent requirement of the Land use Act a strange bed fellow in its new environment or a mere pedant vestige of older enactment that serves no useful purpose in its present garb? This question become poignant when the restrictive nature and prohibitive origin of consent requirement are juxtaposed with the liberal objectives of the<br/>Land Use Act of “streamlining and simplifying the management and ownership of Land in the country and assisting the citizen irrespective of his social status to own a place where he and his family will live a secured and peaceful life.”<br/>It has been canvassed that the consent clause gives the Governor the required effective supervisory control of all land in the territory. This argument, as cogent as it may seem, cannot stand erect before the prohibitive and inhibiting effect of the requirement in the realization of the well-intended objectives of the Land use Act.<br/>Be that as it may, it is worth bearing in mind that even in old enactments such as the Native Land Acquisition Act, 1917 (as amended), the consent requirement was discarded when its restriction was adjudged unnecessary, as<br/> when the interest of an alien was being transferred to another alien42. Under such a situation, the consent of the Governor will not be required as it will be time wasting and economically inexpedient to the alien who might be leaving the country for good.<br/>From the totality of what I have posited so far, it is incontestable to deduce that the requirement of consent in Land transaction is as old as the society itself; though with little modifications here and there to suit the circumstances of each locality and the intentions of the authority. The next chapter will be devoted to the Land use Act, 1978 with respect to the consent requirement provisions thereof.<br/>42.    Eyamba V.

This process is the foundation of civil societies. A strong civil society is vital and needed to serve as the bedrock of a stable democracy. It represents the reservoir of resources -- political, economic, cultural, and moral -- to complement and, when necessary, to check the power of the state. A dynamic and diverse civil society directly stimulates social and political participation, increasing the involvement and commitment of citizens and promoting an appreciation of the obligations, as well as the rights, of citizenship. By providing many potential avenues for political, economic and social expression, a society with a rich associational life gives people a stronger stake in the social order. This in turn, creates a climate within which mutual respect, tolerance, negotiation, and compromise actually make sense, and flourish.<br/>Nigeria claims to be democratic and seeks to prove that under the banner of representation and multi-party political systems. Elections are used as a means by which representatives and policies are decided. The choice between political parties or individual candidates is made through elections. It should be noted that the public function implies elections. This electoral process is the peaceful transfer of power and legitimate exercise of authority. It demands active, broad-based citizen participation. It is the election that actually determines who shall wield power for a number of years as specified by the constitution. An electoral system may be defined as a process in which the mode of coming to power or the change of government is decided in a particular country at a given time.This paper is going to examine the development of several election laws that has been developed and the progression of the laws.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>1.3.0 FOCUS OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4.0 SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5.0 METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0 LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.8.0 CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK OF ELECTORAL LAW IN NIGERIA<br/>2.O.O.INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0.

Therefore, it is most pertinent to examine the meaning of law from the different schools. For instance the natural school lead by Thomus Acquina, he sees law as what is fair, just, right and good. The historical school postulate, that law should be rooted in the people and reflects the common consciousness.

Although the legal process involved (either in formality or requirement) varies from one jurisdiction to another, marriage is often characterized by disputes which range from divorce to custody of children, maintenance e. t. c. Marriage, as examined in this context, is limited to that conducted under statutes.<br/>In resolving these disputes, recourse is made to adjudication. But overtime, various shortcomings are being found for litigation. These include unnecessary delay caused by congestion of court, high cost of litigation, confrontational nature of litigation amongst others. Employing the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1970, which operates within Nigeria jurisdiction, this research presents an outlook of litigation in resolving marriage disputes and also points out its shortcomings.<br/>Consequent upon the shortcomings found for litigation, various alternatives to litigation are being come up with. This research, in line with resolving matrimonial disputes, focuses on examining few of these alternatives which are collaborative divorce, divorce mediation and divorce arbitration. In examining these alternatives, this research points out the advantages they have over litigation in their application to marriage disputes and these amongst others include promotion of confidentiality, cost and time saving. The challenges facing the use of these alternatives which include inadequate skills, lack of enforcement e. t. c. are also examined.<br/>Furthermore, ways of curbing these challenges which are put forward as recommendations are included in the latter part of this research.

A court can convict on a single witness. A case is not decided by the numbers of witnesses, single credible convincing evidence is enough to convict in a case but there are some exceptions. The exceptions refer to by this learned mean the circumstances where corroboration will be required before any judge can decide his case. Although a judge can convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice but he must warn himself before given such conviction in fact he is advised to seek corroborating evidence before convicting an accused because failure to do so can lead to the setting aside of his judgment on appeal.<br/>Generally, corroboration cuts a niche for itself, it is used both in criminal and civil cases. It will also state the position of judges on the issue of corroboration and various decisions of court on different issues arising from corroboration. In law, corroboration, though popular yet controversial virtually under all legal system this is due to the influence and interpretation of the provisions of the Evidence Act and the criminal and penal codes (on corroboration of evidence) by judges. The desirability of corroboration as a requirement in certain criminal and civil cases under the Nigerian law of evidence and the hope of examine it critically under our legal system is the core focus of this study. This work will therefore elucidate the meaning of corroboration in Nigeria and Canada generally, the role of judges in deciding both civil and criminal cases and various statutory provisions in respect of corroboration of evidence in Nigeria relying largely on both primary and secondary source of law of evidence in Nigeria.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>PRINCIPLE OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF CORROBORATION IN NIGERIA.<br/>2.2.0: MEANING / DEFINITION OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.3.0: NATURE OF CORROBORATION<br/>2.4.0 EVIDENCE REQUIRING CORROBORATION<br/>2.5.0 CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>RULES/ FORMS OF CORROBORATION.<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION.<br/>3.1.0: FORMS OF CORROBORATION<br/>3.1.1.0: CORROBORATION AS A MATTER OF LAW.<br/>3.1.1.1 CORROBORATION AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE.V<br/>3.2.1.1: CUMULATIVE CORROBORATION<br/>3.2.1.2: IDENTIFICATION CASES AND CORROBORATION<br/>3.3.0: CORROBORATION UNDER THE COMMON LAW<br/>3.4.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>INCIDENCES OF CORROBORATION<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: CORROBORATION IN CIVIL CASES<br/>4.2.0: CORROBORATION IN CRIMINAL CASES<br/>4.3.0: ROLE OF JUDGES AND JURY IN CORROBORATION<br/>4.4.0: PROBLEMS OF CORROBORATION<br/>4.5.0: SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM<br/>4.6.0 CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0 RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/><br/>\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CORROBORATION UNDER THE NIGERIAN LAW OF EVIDENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CORROBORATION UNDER THE NIGERIAN LAW OF EVIDENCE", "id": 161}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CRITICAL APPRAISAL ON OPINION EVIDENCE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Generally, where a court is faced with the problem of determining a suit before it, such can only be solved after making an enquiry into the relevant facts of the evidence put before it by the parties, drawing inferences from those facts, and listening to arguments of parties to the case or of their counsel.

It is however evident in practical reality, due to the application of certain concepts like Judicial Review, Checks and balances amongst others and the evolution of the idea of case law and stare decisis that the law interpretation duty of the Judiciary and the legislative duty of law making appear overlapping. This seeming power usurpation on the part of the judiciary has been a subject of great debate for centuries. While some opine that the functioning of the judges is simply reflective of law interpretation others reason that judges are intruding into legislative business and accuse judges of judicial activism and a seemingly more objective school project that effective judicial functioning is inevitably linked to legislative functioning.

This practice may be explained by the fact that though Western civilization and culture have permeated Nigerian society, most people, even the most sophisticated understandably regard themselves as bound by the customary law of their place of origin. The Nigerian Marriage Act has given validity to this practice by enabling who are married under Customary Law to marry each other under the statute.<br/>Some legal questions arise from this practice. It is uncertain whether the statutory marriage supersedes, for all intent and purposes, the previous customary-law marriage, or if the customary law marriage is merely put into abeyance to retrieve after the subsequent statutory marriage has come to an end. There is also the question of whether both marriages co-exist.<br/>The purpose of this project will be to examine all this questions and the position of such marriages and the associated problems in Nigeria.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>1.3.0FOCUS OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4.0SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5.0METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.7.0CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>GLOBAL CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE EXAMINED<br/>2.0.0INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE<br/>2.2.0CONSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE UNDER NIGERIAN LAW<br/>2.2.1CONSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE UNDER CUSTOMARY LAW<br/>2.2.2CONSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE UNDER STATUTORY LAW<br/>3.3.0LEGAL EFFECT OF MARRIAGE IN NIGERIAN<br/>2.4.0CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA: ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS<br/>3.0.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0 DEFINITION OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE<br/>3.2.0 REASONS FOR DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE<br/>3.3.0 IMPLICATION AND EFFECT OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE<br/>3.4.0 PROBLEMS OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>3.5.0 TERMINATION OF DOUBLE- DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>3.6.0 CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>PROSPECT OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.0.0INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0ADVANTAGES OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.1.1SOCIAL BENEFITS OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.1.2ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.1.3JUDICIAL BENEFITS OF DOUBLE-DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>4.2.0CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.0.0CONCLUSION<br/>5.1.0RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY ARTICLES IN JOURNALS ARTICLES ON INTERNET BOOKS <br/>NEWSPAPER REPORT ON THE INTERNET PAPERS PRESENTED AT CONFERENCE, WORKSHOP AND SEMINAR.<br/><br/>\n\nDOUBLE DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA (ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DOUBLE DECKER MARRIAGE IN NIGERIA (ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS)", "id": 164}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EGBASE V ORIAREGHAN (1985) EFFECT OF NON EST FACTUM ON CONTRACT</b><br/>Man is by nature a social animal. An individual who is unsocial naturally and not accidentally is either beneath our notice or more than human. <br/>Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of the society, is either a beast or a god.1<br/>This quote by Aristotle poignantly points out the fact that interactions with ourselves as human beings is a must, and the need for this interactions often lead to the necessity of an agreement based on a contract. However, owing to human foibles, there are times when this<br/>agreement is different from the intention either party had as regards the contract.<br/>This study therefore examines the effect that law, especially the doctrine of NON EST FACTUM has on a contract.<br/>It further examines the principle of MISTAKE which is a precursor to NON EST FACTUM, the effect of consent, which is central to the world of contracts and most especially the plea of NON EST FACTUM.<br/>It also takes a look at its applicability in criminal cases and whether or not the plea itself can be used as a sword or a shield by either party.<br/>Finally, this essay gives recommendations as to how the plea of NON EST FACTUM can be improved upon.<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.0: BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>1.2.0: OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.3.0: FOCUS OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4.0: SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5.0: METHODOLOGY<br/>1.6.0: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.7.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 2<br/>DOCTRINE OF MISTAKE<br/>2.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>2.1.0: MEANING AND EFFECT OF MISTAKE IN LAW<br/>2.2.0: COMMON MISTAKE<br/>2.3.0: MUTUAL MISTAKE<br/>2.4.0: UNILATERAL MISTAKE<br/>2.5.0: MISTAKE IN EQUITY<br/>2.6.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 3<br/>SCOPE OF NON EST FACTUM<br/>3.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>3.1.0: NON EST FACTUM AND THE ILLITERATE<br/>3.1.1: NON EST FACTUM AND THE OLD<br/>3.1.2: NON EST FACTUM QAND THE INSANE PEOPLE<br/>3.1.3: NON EST FACTUM AND INFANTS<br/>3.2.0: APPLICABILITY OF THE PRINCIPLE TO CRIMINAL MATTERS IN NIGERIA<br/>3.3.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 4<br/>DOCUMENTS MISTAKENLY SIGNED<br/>4.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>4.1.0: CHARACTER AND CONTENT<br/>4.2.0: NEGLIGENCE<br/>4.3.0: PLEA OF NON EST FACTUM<br/>4.0: THE NIGERIAN SITUATION (EGBASE V ORIAREGAN)<br/>4.5.0: CONCLUSION<br/>CHAPTER 5<br/>GENERAL CONCLUSION<br/>5.0.0: CONCLUSION<br/>5.2.0: RECOMMENDATION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET<br/>BOOKS<br/> CHAPTER 1<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/> 1.0.0: INTRODUCTION<br/>Every contract springs from a legally enforceable agreement between the parties. According to Okany M.C.,2<br/>First there must be an agreement between the parties. The parties<br/>must be certain as to the terms of their agreement.<br/>Stating further, he said;<br/>A contract must of necessity involve two parties…3<br/>Of the two parties, there must be an offeror; while the other party will be the offeree. It can therefore be inferred that for a contract to come into fruition, there must be an offer, an acceptance and a consideration which must move from the promise.<br/>Therefore, according to Sagay4:<br/> For a contract to exist there has to be an offer by one party to another and an acceptance by the person to whom the offer is addressed5.<br/>Succinctly captured by Okany he posited:<br/>One of the parties will make an offer and the other will indicate its acceptance. Secondly, there must exist an obligation which is reciprocated by the other party to the contract. The parties to the contract are obliged to perform their respective promises or<br/>obligation under the contract.<br/>An offer is then defined as<br/> ___________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Okany M.C., Nigerian Commercial Law,( Africana-Fep Publishers, Onitsha 1992) P. 39<br/>Ibid. P 41<br/>4Sagay I.E. Nigerian Law Of Contract (2nd Ed Spectrum Law Books, Ibadan 2000) P. 8<br/>5 Ibid. P. 8<br/> A definite undertaking or promise made by one party with the intention that it shall become binding on the party making it as<br/>soon as it is accepted by the party to whom it is addressed.  It<br/>must therefore be precise and unequivocal6.<br/> An acceptance can be seen from the view point of an agreement to receive that which is offered. This view point is supported by Tobi J.C.A. in Orient Bank V Bilante Int’l Ltd7 when he said:<br/>Putting it in another language, acceptance is the act of compliance<br/>on the part of the offeree with the terms of the offeror.<br/> The third party of this contract trinity is consideration, which in simple language is an exchange of anything which is of value in the eye of the law. The basic feature of this doctrine is reciprocity.<br/> However, even though the above explained terms are sine qua non in the law of contract, seemingly much more important is the idea of the meeting of the minds, generally referred to by the Latin phrase Consensus Ad Idem<br/> If either or both the parties to the contract err in the understanding of any of the terms, (much more; essential terms), of the contract, apparently, there will not be any consensus. To have a blanket rule automatically and categorically rendering such agreements unenforceable will trigger more problems than it aims to solve by the blatant abuse of the rule with impunity.<br/> To prevent such abuse of the legal provisions, the common law has evolved some rules dealing with mistakes.<br/>One kind of Mistake that gives the courts difficulty of interpretation is that which involves a party who mistakes the kind of contract being signed. Suppose a person signs away the deed to a house, thinking that the document signed was only a guarantee for another person‟s debt<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>Nigerian Commercial Law, P. 39<br/> (1997) 8 N.W.L.R.
