These changes if not well managed will impact on visual environmental qualities of an urban area over time as a result of in-migration and industrial activities. These present significant challenges as the high influx of people into the urban centres from the rural areas to take advantage of the perceived opportunities offered by the urban centres is not met with planning and effective management strategies by government to accommodate the rapid increase. These often result in serious pressure on both the economicsupporting infrastructure and the environment. For instance, urbanization has been identified as the cause of numerous environmental problems, which include but not limited to air, water, land and noise pollution, deforestation, local climate alteration, and traffic congestions, which ranges from local to the global scale (Mba et al,2004;Zhou et al., 2004; Liu 2005; Yuan 2008; Jago-On, 2009; Ohwo, 2015).<br/>Globally, more people live in urban areas than in rural areas with 55%, 4.2 billion people of the world population residing in urban areas in 2018. In 1950, only 30% of the world’s population, 751 million people was urban and by 2050, 68% of the world’s population is projected to be urban. Africa alone account for 13% of this increase (UN DESA, 2018).<br/>The National Population Commission 1991 observed that most urban areas in Nigeria have grown beyond their environmental carrying capacities and existing infrastructure. The problems and challenges posed by the rapid rate of uncontrolled and unplanned urban growth are immense. Millions of people live in substandard and sub-human environment plagued by slum, squalors, and gross inadequate amenities. The result is manifested in growing overcrowding in homes and increasing pressure on infrastructural amenities and deterioration of the environment especially in terms of the visual quality.<br/>The consequent environmental quality can be assessed through various methods and approaches. In evaluating environmental quality, scientific/objective assessment have relied on professionally trained eyes (Crystal and Brush, 1978) while subjective interpretations have attempted to explore the ways residents or users themselves experience, perceive or judge qualities (Ebong, 1983; Chokor, 1990).<br/>The majority of studies whether objective or subjective have relied on rating scales and data are commonly analyzed using multivariate procedures (Chokor 1987, 1989; Omuta, 1988).<br/>1.2   Statement of the Problem<br/>The rapid rate of urban growth and expansion in the town which is majorly uncontrolled because of the near absence of planning authority coupled with influx of in-migrants has considerably affected the visual environmental quality of the area. According to Iyorakpo(2015) the rate of rapid urbanization taking place in an urban area will lead to the emergence of several unplanned structures, haphazard deposition of refuse, lack of drainage, inadequate housing facilities, among others. These problems associated with urbanization and other consequences of unplanned and uncontrolled urban growth are the consequent impacts are widespread in Ore which studies have not addressed.It is against this backdrop; an assessment of the visual quality of Ore is not only vital but can contribute to enhancingto enhancing urban planning and management.<br/>1.3Research Questions<br/>What are the features reducing the visual appearance and physical quality of Ore?<br/>What are the features contributing most to the visual appearance and physical quality of Ore?<br/>What are the factors responsible for the visual blight and environmental quality being face in the town?<br/>What is the pattern of variation in visual environmental quality in the town?<br/>1.4   Aim and Objectives<br/>This study is aimed at assessing the visual environmental quality of Ore, Ondo State from the view point of the people.In order to achieve this aim, the following objectives are pertinent<br/>To determine the featuresthose reduces or enhance the visual appearance and physical quality of the town.<br/>To determine which of these features contribute most in reducing visual appearance and physical environmental quality of the town.<br/>To determine the variation in visual environmental quality in the town.<br/>To examine the factors responsible for the negative visual blight and quality of the town.<br/>1.5Hypothesis<br/>H0: Thereis no significant difference in visual environmental quality between the core, middle and suburban area of the town.<br/>1.6Significance of the Study<br/>Environmental quality is at the centre of the objectives of planning and designs, since all planning and design aim to create a better environment in the interest of safety, health, aesthetics, comfort and general welfare.<br/>The findings of this research can contribute to urban and regional planning. Urban planning is a valuable force for leaders to achieve sustainable development. Hence, this study will be beneficial to planners by helping them drive constructive changes as well as provide a basis for well-informed environmental decisions that will create a livable town for the residents.<br/>This study will also be significant to developers in that it can help to address concerns of residents in terms of housing, road network, beautification, waste management and other concerns so as to deliver a more livable town.<br/>1.7Scope of the Study<br/>The scope of environmental quality assessment is very wide. However, this study is limited to the nature of visual environmental quality in Ore built-up area as perceived by the residents and its implication for environmental management. This study is thus not concerned with the professional assessment of the environment without recourse to the people who use, modify and create the environment.<br/>1.8The Study Area<br/>1.8.1 Historical Background<br/>As at 1964, Ore was a mere road junction where motorists from Lagos to the eastern part of the country stopped-over to refuel their vehicles, eat and also engage in other social activities. The surrounding land was thick forest where people mainly traders and farmers engaged in subsistence and commercial farming. This was before the civil war. During the Nigeria Civil War of 1967-1970, it was also a military base for the Nigerian troops. There was the defunct 202 infantry battalion and a small military camp at Constain which is a small settlement near Ore. From 1986 various factors have contributed to the emergence of Ore as one of themajor urban settlement in Ondo state The increase in population which has effect on the expansion of the town is due to increase in commercial activities, and most importantly the location of the town asa nodal town.<br/>The total built-up area of Ore town in 1964 was estimated to be approximately 1.2km2.This represents approximately 2 per cent of the study area of 62.2km2. Similarly, the total built-up area in 1986 and 2002 were also estimatedto be 11.3km2(18 per cent of the total land area) and 13.2km2(approximately 21.2 per cent of the total land area) respectively. The possible expansion value of the town by year 2027 was also calculated using the average rate of expansion of 1964 to 1986 and 1986 to 2002. Therefore expansion value in 2027 would be 55.33km2( Aguda et al, 2013).<br/>1.8.2   Location and Size<br/>The study area, Ore is the administrative headquarters of Odigbo Local Government area of Ondo state. It lies approximately between latitude 6043’ and 6047’ North and longitude 4051’and 4055’ East of Greenwich Meridian. It occupies a land area of about 66.2km2. Ore is a nodal town and serves as a linkage between the eastern and western parts of Nigeria and has been experiencing an unprecedented growth for the past decade both in population and in physical expansion.<br/>1.8.3    Population<br/>The population of Ore Town was not given in the 2006 population census because the National Population Commission (NPC) did not give the population of localities (settlements). Judging with the population of Odigbo Local Government Area, which was put at 230,351 (NPC, 2006), it is estimated that about 60% of the population of the local government live in Ore due to its strategic location and commercial function being a nodal town. Thus in 2006, about 138,211 lived in Ore. When an arithmetic projection based on conservative growth rate of 3% from 2006 to 2017, the current population of Ore Town is about 183,821<br/>1.8.4 Climate and Vegetation<br/>The total annual rainfall is between 1500-2000mm. The temperature varies from 210C to 290C throughout the year with an average value of 250C.<br/>1.8.5 Socio-Economic Activities<br/>The economic activities in the study area are highly influenced by the nodal nature of the town. These economic activities can be classified into primary, secondary and tertiary activities. Primary economic activities mainly include farming, hunting, lumbering. Secondary activities include cottage industries scattered all over the place such as sawmill, hotel services, and furniture industries. Major tertiary activities here include services such as banking, marketing etc. In addition, Ore provides enabling environment for the growth of retail and social services as a result of the links it has with other regions (Ondo, Benin City, Okitipupa and Sagamu). <br/><br/>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF VISUAL ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITIES IN ORE, ONDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF VISUAL ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITIES IN ORE, ONDO STATE", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study examines the operational traffic characteristics of Kano-Nguru rail transport service in northern part of Nigeria. The Kano-Nguru train service remained operational even when train operation along the major railway corridors were short down due to industrial crisis faced by the Nigerian Railway Corporation between 2005-2010. Data used were derived from both primary and secondary sources. The primary data focused on the train passengers and railway staff in the study area in order to capture their view on the train operations. Passengers were systematically selected and a sample size of 172 was used and this represented the total number of questionnaires that were administered for the study. The study adopted the use of descriptive method of data analysis. The findings of this study reveals that 68.6% of the train passengers were traders, while 89% of the passengers opined that the train transport fare was relatively cheap. The study further indicates that majority of the passengers agreed that the train was always punctual at departure. The findings shows that year 2007 recorded the highest frequency of trips representing 18.5% of the total trips between 2007-2013 while 2010 recorded the list frequency of trips representing 10.3% of the total trips between 2007-2013. The findings also indicates that between 2007-2013 the total quantity of freight transported is 4086 metric tons. Similarly, the haulage of cows for the period under investigation was 4,644 cows, while 26,496 passengers were transported. Generally, there is need to upgrade the existing facilities at the railway terminals and inside the train so as to attract more passengers and increase revenue to the Nigerian government.</p> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong>    <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Rail transport is a means of conveyance of passengers and goods by way of wheeled vehicles running on rail tracks in contrast to road transport, where vehicles merely run on a prepared surface. Rail coaches are also directionally guided by the tracks on which they run (Wolmar, 2009). A track usually consists of steel rails installed on sleepers, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. However, other variations are also possible, such as slab track where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface (Skempton, 2002).</p> <p>According to American Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association (AREMA) (2003) a train is a connected series of rail vehicles that move along a purposely constructed track. Propulsion for the train is provided by a separate locomotive or from individual motors in self-propelled multiple units. Most trains carry a revenue load, although non-revenue cars exist for the railway's own use, such as for maintenance-of-way purposes. The engine driver controls the locomotive or other power cars.</p> <p>The earliest evidence of a railway was a 6-kilometre (3.7 m) Diolkos wagon way, which transported boats across the Corinthisthmus in Greece during the 6th century BC. Trucks pushed by slaves ran in grooves in limestone, which provided the track element. The Diolkos ran for over 600 years (Lewis, 2009). Railways began reappearing in Europe after the Dark Ages. The earliest known record of a railway in Europe from this period is a stained-glass window in the Minster of Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany, dating from around 1350 (Hylton, 2007).</p> <p>Clearly, a virile railway system plays a significant role in the sectoral development and overall growth of any economy. It opens up regions, hinterlands and rural areas by facilitating agricultural development as well as facilitates the growth of cottage/large scale industries. It also attracts residential, commercial, educational and recreational settlements and developments around its corridor. It is in this context that rail transport mode is seen as the mainframe or pivot around which an integrated national transport system should be built with other modes complementing</p>\n\nOPERATIONAL TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF RAILWAY TRANSPORT SERVICE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OPERATIONAL TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF RAILWAY TRANSPORT SERVICE", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><br/> ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The study examined the effects of drainage networks on floods in Calabar metropolis, Nigeria. The rapid increase in urbanization without corresponding infrastructures in the city of Calabar has led to increased incidences of flood as the available drainage channels cannot contend with the volume of storm water. In view of this, the study established gauging stations for the measurement of drainage run off using measuring steel tape. And the volume of flood water was measured using stop watch method (Velocity of flow) and copies of questionnaire were administered to 400 households proportionally to the seven sample units. In view of the study objectives, it determine the relationship between drainage width and depth and floods. In addition, varied descriptive statistics tools were used to give a spot on assessment and understanding of the variables of interest. In view of the response of the gauging and physical measurement, it was established that Calabar experience heavy rainfall due to poor drainage facilities The result revealed that about 47% of the respondents said flood occur every year in their zone and 41.75% said it occurred most parts of the year. The frequency of flood is compounded with it’s intensity as over 59% of the sampled population agreed that flood of the sampled population agreed that flood intensity is very high in Calabar. The result further showed that the factors of flood occurrence in the study area is linked to heavy rainfall (26.3%), inadequate drainage channel (22%) poor physical planning (15.5%) among others. On the perceived causes of inadequate drainage channel, the result indicated that abuse of land use plans (28.7%) was a major factor followed by poor monitoring and evaluation of project (21.5%). the study also revealed that the drainage were very narrow and shallows as shown in frequent floods in the city. The incessant flood often leads to water inundating compounds (64.5%), preventing people from going out (11.25%), distortion of the scenic beauty of the environment (6.25%), landslide (4.75%). Based on these findings, the study recommended that since Calabar is located in a tropical zone characterized by heavy rainfall the government should take proactive measure to mitigate storm water. The present drainage systems should be cleared with shovel by the people on a regular basis to allow for a free flow of storm water. State department of town planning should live up to their bidding by ensuring total compliance to urban ordinance to forestall incessant floods and destruction of properties in the city of Calabar.</em></p> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Cities the world over are the dominating forces in the organization of human population.</p> <p>As the world most crowded places, cities continue to show increase in urban population. This increase leads to a growing urbanization trend. Duru and Nnaji (2008) defined urbanization as the increase in the population of cities in proportion to the region‟s rural population.</p> <p>Urbanization is the outcome of social, economic and political developments that lead to concentration and growth of large cities, changes in land use and transformation from rural to metropolitan pattern of organization and governance. Rapid growth of towns and cities has been common feature of the developing world (Aderamo, 2008).</p> <p>Although urbanization is the driving force for modernization, economic growth and development, there is increasing concern about the effects of expanding cities, principally on human health, livelihoods and the environment. The implications of rapid urbanization and demographic trends for employment, food security, water supply, shelter and sanitation, especially the disposal of wastes (solid and liquid) that the cities produce are staggering (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, 1992). The process of urbanization is believed to be connected with levels of development and some assert that, for a country to develop there is the need for an increased level of industrialization as it is generally accepted that there cannot be urbanization without rapid economic growth (Tettey, 2005). The pattern of urbanization in developing countries, particularly Africa, however, is creating some concern that it may be generating a lot of development problems in the process of its growth.</p>                                                          \n\nEFFECTIVENESS OF DRAINAGE NETWORKS ON FLOODS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTIVENESS OF DRAINAGE NETWORKS ON FLOODS", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Agriculture in Nigeria is mainly dependent on rainfall which is variable in nature. Therefore, the need to have a full knowledge of its pattern and trend is pertinent in order to achieve food sufficiency. This study examined the effect of precipitation effectiveness indices: Onset date, cessation date, length of rainy season and occurrence of pentad dry spells (5, 10 and ≤15) days on the yield of millet, sorghum, rice and maize in Sokoto State, between 1993 and 2008. Walter‟s 1967 method was used to derive the selected precipitation effectiveness indices while dry spell parameters, was derived in pentads. Crop yield data in (ton/ha) and the selected precipitation effectiveness indices wereharmonised using log10 method. Trendline and linear trendline equations where fitted to show the direction of change. While simple correlation was used to analyse the relationship between crop yield and the selected precipitation indices. Furthermore, regression analysis was used to determine to what extent the selected precipitation effectiveness indices influence the yield of the selected crops. The findings revealed that the trend of these precipitation effectiveness indices are characterized by marked “noises” and variability.</p> <p>Additionally, onset dates of rainfall are arriving earlier while cessation dates are arriving latter. Consequently the length of rainy season is increasing. Dry spells of 5 days is common while dry spell incidents of 10 days and ≤15 consecutive days is decreasing. Similarly rice and maize yield are increasing, due to early onset date of rains. The regression summary shows that the selected precipitation effectiveness indices account for only 52.1%, 50.4%, 52.1% and 68% of yield variation in maize, millet, rice and sorghum respectively. The study therefore, recommends government support for farmers to increase the cultivation of rice and maize in the study area, and the introduction of more crop varieties that are tolerant to dry spells of 5 consecutive days.</p> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The limit to the productive capacity of land resources are set by climate, as climatic variability constitutes a major constraint to agricultural production especially in developing countries. However, adequate knowledge of climatic parameters minimizes climatic constraint to food production (Farajzedah et.al., 2012).</p> <p>The world population is projected to continue increasing well into the present century. The primary question is whether and how global food production may be increased to provide for the population expansion. It will be necessary to increase current level of food production more than proportional to the population growth so as to meet human demand in food production. The major source of water available either for agriculture or for human consumption is the rain that falls on the Earth Surface. Subsequently, the primary source for agricultural production for most of the world is rainfall. Hence, a detailed knowledge of the rainfall at a place is an important prerequisite for agricultural planning and management. More so, for rain-fed agriculture, rainfall is the single most important Argo-meteorological variable influencing crop production in the tropics (Ravindran, 2010).</p> <p>The most important characteristics of rainfall are, Onset Date (OD), Cessation Date (CD), Length of Rainy Season (LRS), Mean Annual Precipitation (MAR), Hydrological Ratio (HR), number of Rainy Days (RD), Rainfall Intensity (RI), Specific Water Consumption (SWC), rainfall in months of the growing season (May, June, July, August and September), Seasonality Index (SI), Index of Replicability, and Pentad Dry Spells. </p>                                                         \n\nEFFECT OF PRECIPITATION EFFECTIVENESS INDICES ON THE YIELD OF SOME SELECTED CEREAL CROPS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF PRECIPITATION EFFECTIVENESS INDICES ON THE YIELD OF SOME SELECTED CEREAL CROPS", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Child labour participation is inimical, contrary to the Rights of the Child, and threatens holistic child development, the families, State and the nation at large. This study assesses the demographic and socio-economic consequences of child labour in Anambra State, Nigeria. The objectives were to examine the type of work engaged in by the children, determine the factors responsible for child labour practices, identify the condition of work, assess the demographic and socio-economic consequences of child labour and lastly ascertain the specific possible impact of child labour on future workforce in the state. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the sampled areas in the study area as well as the respondents. A total of 400 children aged between 04-17 years, who are involved in laborious activities were administered a structured questionnaires to collect data. In addition, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather information from child labourers employers. The data wasanalysed using computer SPSS software 19 version. The results are presented using tables and chats.The results indicated that 53.0% of the child labourers are males, child labour participation is found to be higher among older children aged 11-17 years than those aged 4-10. More than half of child labourersare from large household size of 5-9 persons. Out of the entire child labourers, 42.5% are indigenes of Anambra State and 35.0% from Ebonyi State, while the remaining hails from the other surrounding States. Educational status of child labourers shows that 56.5% are in school, while 43.5% are out of school, public school children are the most affected as 77.0% are in public schools, with 66.0% in primary school levels. Out of the entire sampled respondent, 174 (43.5%) are out of school, out of which 95.4% dropped out from school, while 4.6% have never been to school before. Poverty of parents accounted for the major reasons for child‟s school drop outs. About 73.5% of the child labourers work between 4-6 days a week. Most of the children (71.8%) spend more than 7 hours at work. On the working condition of the respondents, the study found that 50.0% of the child labourers work on temporal basis and the remaining work on either contract or permanent basis, 72.5% starts work at age between 4-10 years, the highest earned monthly income by the children is between ₦ 2001-₦ 2500, 64.5% eats twice daily. The study found that 83.5% of the child labourers have encountered various types of dangers relating to the type of work they do. For instance as much as 42.5% have been physically assaulted, more worrisome is the fact that 44.0% and 20.0% have participated in social vices of such as alcohol drinking and drug abuse respectively, while 51.0% suffers from low self-esteem and 25.0% from alienation from friends/family/relation and as much as 87.0% have encountered health related challenges. The finding generally shows that household poverty which is caused by child‟s parent‟s low educational attainment and low occupational status accounted for the major reason why children joins labourious activities either to complement the family income or to pay school fees. The study therefore concludes that for child labour incidence to be curbed there is the need to empower parents with education and soft loans to enhance their business since majority of the parents are involved in various types of businesses, this expected to go a long way in reducing household poverty in the state. There is also the need to introduce a free and compulsory primary and secondary education for children of school going ages in the state as it will help to motivate the children to concentrate in school rather than combining school attendance with work due to the need to complement the school fees, which results to, reduced attendance, grade repetitions and the subsequent school withdrawal.</p> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>According to the Child Right's Act 2003, passed into law in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja, a child is a person who has not attained the age of eighteen years. On the other hand, labour according to Macmillan dictionary connotes the aggregate of all human physical and mental effort used in creation of goods and services. Put together, the concept of Child Labour has probably been in existence almost as long as the history of mankind and connotes all economic activities carried out by children regardless of their occupational status (Oloko, 1997). It includes both works that are permissible under the International Labour Organization's (ILO) conventions and that which is not (International Labour Organization-International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour) (ILO-IPEC, 2002). According to United Nation Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) (2007) Child labour is essentially understood as encompassing monetary or non-monetary activities which are mentally or physically, morally or socially hazardous for children below 15 years.</p> <p>Across countries and societies, various forms of child labour exists these forms range from trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, child domestic labour and illicit activities. Other forms include street hawking, waste pickers, company labourers, apprentices, babysitting, barrow pushers and commercial drivers/ conductors/ touts, water vendors, farm workers, house maids, gardeners, cleaners, and other artisans. Some of which are done on contract basis, whereas, some are considered as free services to guardians or relatives who in return pays back in cash or kind to the child or the child‟s parent all of which are hazardous to child overall development (Oloko, 1997)..</p>                                                          \n\nDEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF CHILD LABOUR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF CHILD LABOUR", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The rural poor are really non-beneficiaries of the enormous development efforts of the past three decades. This study is aimed at assessing community participation in rural development projects in Sapele LGA, Delta state. Data were generated from both primary and secondary sources. The study adopted a multi-stage sampling technique of which first, among the five districts, four were purposively selected while second stage, the communities in each district were arranged alphabetically and every third community systematically selected. The study made use of 381 samples which were proportionately distributed according to population size among the selected four districts. The study made use of descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. The descriptive method involved the use of mean, percentages and frequency distribution for the summarization of the data. The Pearson Chi square analytical technique adopted to test level of significant relationship that exist between community participation and project planning process and implementation or result has a p-value of 0.0001 which shows a significant relationship. The findings also revealed that 60% of the respondents agreed that community participation is an effective tool for rural development projects. The study also established that community participation is an important element for speedy socioeconomic advancement of the rural communities. It is recommended therefore that beneficiaries of any rural development project should be mobilized and sensitized to benefit of community participation in Sapele LGA and rural projects generally, selflessness and service to humanity should be fostered by traditional authorities and NGO focusing on women should be deliberately organized to channel women empowerment and participation.</p> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Rural development from a general point of view is the process of improving the</p> <p>quality of life and economic wellbeing of people living in relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas (Moseley, 2003) which are also known as rural areas. However, despite strategies put in place in form of projects provided for rural people, many do not benefit because of their non-involvement in the project planning process and implementation hence, the emphasis on community participation in rural development project.</p> <p>Rural development is more realistic when people participate in the process of infrastructure provision because at the heart of rural development projects are infrastructures and for the overall goals and objectives to be met, the principle for effective community participation must be adapted (Idachaba and Bankole, 2006).</p> <p>Community participation as a development approach for rural socioeconomic development is an alternative to the top – down approach which has failed to yield the desired result because rural dwellers who are target beneficiaries were not carried along initially (Bankole, 2007). The term has been conceptualized in different ways in the literature as either public, people or citizen participation, however they all have the same focus, which is rural development (Oakley, 1991 and Afolayan, 2008). Participation is all about inclusiveness, social justice and common good which shows that rural development is community based when people in communities determine their needs and aspiration. </p>                                                          \n\nASSESSMENT OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The phenomenon of road traffic crash along Abuja-lokoja highway has been a source of concern in view of the loss of life and its socio-economic consequence. This study examined the causes of road traffic accidents along Abuja-Lokoja highway using a survey questionnaire and secondary data obtained from the Federal road safety corps (FRSC) Kogi State and Federal Capital Territory ( FCT) sector commands covering the period 2003 to 2012. A total of 120 copies questionnaires were administered to commercial drivers in seven (7) motor parks. However, only 98 copies were successfully retrieved and considered appropriate for the analysis. The data generated were analysed using descriptive statistic and trend analysis. The result of the analysis shows that human related factors are mainly responsible for majority of the accident in the study area. Similarly, cars and buses are vehicle types that are frequently involved in accident on the road. Also majority of the accidents on the road occur during the daytime especially from 6am to 6pm. To address these problems, FRSC and other government organisations involved in road management should improve their effort at sensitizing the public especially the drivers on the need for safety behaviour while driving. Also regular monitoring patrol by Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and Vehicle Inspection Officers (VIO) with the objective of checking the excesses of drivers along the route should be a daily exercise.</em></p> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Transportation has liberated man and makes him more mobile, his increasing reliance on vehicular movement has conferred great facilities on him and his activities. The greatest culprit of all the modes of transport is road of which traffic crash is the most disturbing repercussion of its use (Sumaila, 2013). Globally, the phenomenon of Road Traffic Crash (RTC) is one of the leading causes of death. Annually, at least 1.2 million people die and 50 million are injured in RTC, a scale of death comparable to malaria and tuberculosis (World Health Organisation (WHO) 2005). More than 85% of these casualties occur in the low and middle income countries. Road traffic crash imposes a huge burden on developing countries amounting to 1-2% of GNP in most countries. This estimate takes account of only the direct economic cost mainly lost to productivity, rather than the full social costs often recognized by industrialized countries, its effect among the poor can be unequal. In low and middle income countries, poor people like pedestrian, cyclists and motorcyclists are usually vulnerable to RTC. They are of particular risks from the greater variety and intensity of traffic mix and the lack of separation from other road users. In Kenya, pedestrians and passengers in mass transit accounted for 80% of all fatalities and in Mumbai (India), 78% of road fatalities were pedestrians (WHO, 2005)</p>                                                          \n\nANALYSIS OF ROAD TRAFFIC CRASH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF ROAD TRAFFIC CRASH", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>Solid waste management has become the greatest problem facing many urban and semi-urban areas in Nigeria. The management of solid wastes in recent time has become a very big challenge. The problem of waste generation, handling and disposal has reached a disturbing level in Nigerian urban centers. The study analyzed domestic solid waste management strategies in Tunga, Chanchaga Local Government, Niger State, Nigeria. This was achieved through characterizing the types of domestic solid wastes generated in the study area, examining the domestic solid waste management strategies employed in the study area, identifying the key players in domestic solid waste management in the study area, examining the frequency of waste generated and waste disposed and ascertaining the effectiveness of the domestic solid waste management strategies employed in the study area. The primary data used in this study was obtained by direct field observations, questionnaire administration, oral interviews, images and photos of the study area. 327 out of 2040 households were sampled. The research questions were answered using tables of frequencies and percentages, bar and pie charts, Chi Square and Kruskal Wallis tests. The results showed that the kinds of domestic solid wastes generated in the study area were mainly organic, paper, plastic, old and rusted metals and textile wastes. The domestic solid waste management strategies in place were burning, open dumping and burying, with open dumping being the most common domestic solid waste management strategy practiced in the study area (about 72%). The key players involved in the management of solid wastes were the government and individual households. The daily generation of waste (about 74%) exceeded the daily disposal of wastes (about 49%) in the study area. 63% of the respondents reported that burning of domestic solid waste is effective, 84% reported that burying domestic solid wastes is effective while 14% reported that open dumping of domestic solid wastes is effective. The Chi Square analysis showed a significant difference between the frequency of wastes generated and waste disposed in the study area with an alpha value of 0.01, while the Kruskal Wallis H test showed no significant difference in the effectiveness of the domestic solid waste management strategies in the study area </em>(α=0.646)<em>. The findings of this study showed that the methods of waste management adopted in</em> <em>the study area do not conform to sustainable waste management practices. This implies that much attention has not been given to domestic solid waste management in the study area. The study thus recommended Public Enlightenment and Education on issues of waste management and a better public awareness strategy on the subject matter, Increase in Waste Collection Frequency and the adoption of composting as a method of waste management since majority of the domestic solid waste generated is organic in nature.</em></p> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Waste  management  is  a  global  environmental  challenging  issue  that  is  severe</p> <p>especially in developing countries where increased urbanization, poor planning and lack of adequate resources contribute to the poor state of Municipal Solid waste management (Mwanthi <em>et al,</em> 1997).

However, its unbalance and unmanaged used make it scarce. This study analyzes the Domestic Water Demand and Supply in Ilorin metropolis, Kwara State. Focuses on the analysis of the sources of water resource in Ilorin, assessing factors affecting water demand and supply and their relationship. The methodology involve the use of questionnaires and interview method to gather necessary information from the state water Board and result gathered from the study area. The study was carried out through the use of structured questionnaire which was administered. Two hundred and fifty (250) questionnaires were filled correctly. On the part of water Board questionnaire were correctly filled and returned. Random sampling was employed. The questionnaires were used to solicit information from a sample of respondents. The analytic techniques involve both the descriptive and inferential statistics such as frequency distribution, sample percentage and correlation analysis. Therefore it was deduced from the analysis that consumption and supply are 124.0 liters and 190.2 liters respectively per person per day. The conclusion from the result of correlation coefficient (1.9996) that there exists very high positive linear relationship between the household water demand and water supplied by the kwara State Water Board. The women and children are particularly vulnerable when water is short supply. Bursting of pipe, poor management, topography of an area, water wastage coupled with bias in water supply have been some of the factors influencing water supply. The study recommends that there should be concerted effort by both water users 9demand) and supplier to control water wastage so as to achieve the goal.</p> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Water is essential to life and its supply, consumption and spatial distribution are closely</p> <p>associated with economic growth and the development of society. Apart from air, water is indispensable to life it is a foundation for human prosperity because adequate and high quality water supplies provide a basis for the growth and development of human social, economic and culture of people (Ward, 1975, Young, 2006). The importance of water to man cannot be overemphasized, it holds the most important benefit to man‟s sustenance beside shelter, food and clothing (Ajadi, 1996)</p> <p>According to Amin and Mahmud, (2011) it is recognized all over the world that water is a vital resource to human existence and that is a major factor in commanding the progress of civilization.</p> <p>Water is essential in sustaining quality of life on earth, the sustainability of socially sensitive goods such as water depends on effective and efficient use of available water resources. Amin and Mahmud, (2011) also reported that the extensive use of water has increased globally and the efficacy of supply side measure is questionable owing to drastic increase in population, technological advancement and economic growth; the demand for water supplies is continuously increasing, numerous researchers have emphasized on water demand management rather than the supply side management. The water demand study in relation to water supply enables us to estimate how much the increase in demand for water supplies.</p> <p>Water demand is the quantity that the treatment plant produce in order to meet all water needs in the community. Water demand includes water delivered to the system to meet the need of consumers, water supply for fire fighting and system flushing. On the other hand water supply refers to system for the collection, transmission, treatment, storage and distribution of water Admassu M.

As a result of this, the present study therefore aimed at analysing the spatio-temporal pattern of waterborne diseases, using Kwara State as a case study. Primary and secondary data were obtained from questionnaire survey, Focus Group Discussions, interviews and published and unpublished works. Multi-stage sampling method was adopted in this study. Four stage sampling method was adopted in the selection of sample size. National Population Commission (1991) estimated that the mean household for each settlement in Kwara State (as at 1991 population census) was 4.7 for the selected settlements. In all, a total of 353 households were sampled across the three senatorial districts. Kwara South Senatorial district has the highest number of households of 127, while Kwara North and Central Senatorial districts have 118 and 108 respectively. Data from FGDs, in-depth interviews, questionnaire and other sources were subjected to test the stated hypotheses using t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Correlation Analysis. Thus, t-test was used to establish the relationship in the mean sex perception of waterborne diseases in the study area. With tcal =</p> <p>3.6732 &gt; t0.05, ¥ = 1.96 and 0.0341 &lt; 0.05,there was a significant difference in the mean sex perception of waterborne diseases examined in the study area. Similarly, ANOVA was used</p> <p>to establish the relationship in the mean perception of waterborne diseases among other socio-demographic variables such as age, income and educational qualification in the study area. The result showed that, there is a significant relationship between the examined waterborne diseases and socio-demographic variables in the study area, as fcal = 4.765 &gt;</p> <p>f0.05,(3,559) = 2.62 and 0.0356 &lt; 0.05. Descriptive Statistics was equally used to determine the Perception on the Prevalence of the six waterborne diseases across the three senatorial</p> <p>districts of the study area. The result showed that there is no difference in the prevalence and occurrence of waterborne diseases in Kwara state. Lastly, Correlation Analysis was also used to establish the relationship in the prevalence and occurrence of waterborne diseases in the senatorial districts of the study area. The result showed that in Kwara North, there is prevalence of waterborne diseases, than in Kwara South and Central. This trend may be associated to the level of self-help in Kwara South and availability of water infrastructure at Kwara Central, being the seat of government. The study concluded that, available potable water in the study is not adequate, and the few that are available are dysfunctional as the value of p-value of .008 &lt; 0.05 level of significance at a correlation level of 0.530 at 22 df.. This may be closely related to the challenges of retardiness of socio-economic sector, which has led to inaccessibility to safe water . In the light of the above, the study recommended that prioritization of potable water, early tracking of waterborne diseases, efficient socio-economic programmes and relevant environmental education are necessary are imperative in curtailing the menace of waterborne diseases not only in the study area, but Nigeria as a whole.</p> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY.</strong></p> <p>Waterborne diseases are a major health issue, because of the burden they place on man. Waterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water (Wikipedia, free Online). According to this school of thought, waterborne diseases may result from bathing, washing, drinking, in the preparation of food or the consumption of food thus affected. Thus waterborne diseases can be described as all illnesses that results from having contact with or drinking contaminated water. According to World Health Organization-WHO (2012a), 88.0% of all infectious diseases worldwide and 90.0% of all infectious diseases in developing countries are water-related.</p>                                                          \n\nSPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF THE PREVALENCE OF WATERBORNE DISEASES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF THE PREVALENCE OF WATERBORNE DISEASES", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:center\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style='font-size:14.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>AN\r\nASSESSMENT OF THE PERCEPTION OF LOCAL FARMERS ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN IDO LOCAL\r\nGOVT AREA OF OYO STATE</span></b><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";mso-fareast-font-family:\r\nCalibri;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'></span></b></p>\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Introduction</strong></p> <p>Climate change is one of the greatest contemporary environmental challenges and is global in dimension.  The rising incidences of extreme climatic events associated with climate change are giving the greatest of the concerns. Even for skeptics,  events such as prolonged dry seasons, long rainfall durations and excessively long Harmattan periods are worrying.  More and more people are getting to ask about what can be done to minimize the impact of the change. </p> <p>  The Inter-government Panel on climate change (IPPC, 2007) defined climate change as statistically significant variations in climate that persist for an extended period, typically decades or longer. It includes shifts in the frequency and magnitude of sporadic weather events as well as the slow continuous rise in global mean surface temperature.</p> <p>Climate change is a change in climate that is attributable directly or indirectly to human activities. It affects the atmospheric conditions of the earth thereby leading to global warming. According to Raymond and Victoria (2008), climate change has the potential to affect all natural systems thereby becoming a threat to human development and survival socially, politically and economically. Interest in this issue has motivated a substantial body of research on climate cha- nge and agriculture over the past decade (Fischer, et al., 2002; Darwin, 2004; Lobell, et al., 2008; Nelson, et al. 2009). Climate change is expected to influence crop production, hydrologic balances, input supplies and other components of agricultural systems. However, the changes occur due to variation in different climatic parameters such as cloud cover, precipitation, temperature and increase in Green House Gases (GHG's) emission through human activities. Adverse impacts of climate change in Nigeria include frequent drought, increased rural-urban migration, increased biodiversity loss, depletion of wild and other natural resource base, changes in vegetation types, increased health risk and the spread of infectious diseases and changing livelihood systems (Abaje and Giwa, 2007; Hassan and Nhemachena, 2008).</p> <p>Of Nigeria's 923,768km2 land size, 34% is occupied by crops, 23% by grassland and 16% by forests, approximately 13% is rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and the remaining 14% fall under other uses according to Ajayi (2009). Also, small scale farm holdings predominate in Nigeria, accounting for about 94% of the agricultural output (Ajayi, 2009). Agriculture employs over 70% of the population, contributes about 41% of GDP, accounts for 5% total export and provides 88% of non-oil earnings. Besides, almost all sectors of agriculture which are crop production, livestock farming, pastoralism, fishery etc. depend on climate whose variability have meant that local farmers who implement their regular annual farm business plans risk total failure due to climate change effects (Ozor et al, 2010). The conditions emanating from climate change are bound to compromise agricultural productions (crop, livestock, forest and fishery resources), nutritional and health statuses, trading in agricultural commodities, human settlements especially of agricultural communities, tourism and recreation among others (Tologbonse, et al. 2010) Nigeria like all the countries of sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (IPCC, 2007). Despite the fact that efforts have been made towards fighting climate change from scientific views, research and policies directed towards indigenous knowledge and perception are highly needed. Understanding of local perception is useful in assessing the true implications of changing climate. Therefore there is the need to gain as much information as possible, and learn the positions of rural farmers and their needs, about what they know about climate change, in order to offer adaptation practices that meet these needs.</p> <p>Climate change is a major challenge to agricultural development in Africa and the world at large. Ziervogel, et al. 2006 noted that climate change, which is attributable to natural climate cycle and human activities, has adversely affected agricultural productivity in Africa, making Agriculture one of the sectors most vulnerable to climate change impact in Africa, as observed by Falaki et al 2013, the impact of climate is more where agriculture is rain fed and essential for the daily existence such in Nigeria.Zoellick 2009 stated that, as the planet warms, rainfall patterns shift, and extreme events such as drought, floods and forest fires become more frequent. This results in poor and unpredictable yields, thereby making farmers more vulnerable, particularly in Africa (UNFCCC, 2007). Across Nigeria, millions of people are already experiencing changing seasonal patterns of rainfall and increased heat. Climate therefore determines to a large extent availability of water which impacts health and ultimately the level of poverty among Nigerians. Agriculture places heavy burden on the environment in the process of providing humanity with food and fiber while climate is the primary determinant of agricultural productivity. Given the fundamental role of agriculture in human welfare, concern has been expressed by federal agencies and others regarding the potential effects of climate change on agricultural productivity.                                                                                                  </p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Climate change is a serious challenge to socio economic developments even in the developed countries of the world. In Nigeria and other parts of Africa, agriculture occupies a critical position particularly in food production and generation of employment. A significant proportion of actors in the agricultural sectors are however, likely to have little or no idea about climate change because of their level of awareness Thus although they suffer more of the impact of climate change, they probably do not know the depth of what is happening to the system. There is therefore a need to gain an understanding of farmers’ perception of climate change so that they can be appropriately targeted in climate change response actions. </p> <p>Human perception of environmental issues have been broadly categorized as cognitive (related to knowledge and understanding), affective (related to feelings, attitudes and emotions), behavioural (related to changes in behaviour of the viewer) and physiological (biological or physical effects on the observer's body) Zube, et al, 1982.</p> <p>However, perception decides over resource allocation, without perceiving the risk adequately all other determents seem meaningless. The effects of climate change leads to land degradation which reduces the quality and productivity and manifest throughout the country while in the southern part of Nigeria, the problem is coastal erosion and flooding, in the Sahelian zone of north, the most pronounced climate changed related reforms of land degradation are wind erosion and related sand dune formation, drought and desertification, sheet erosion which results to the complete removal of arable land is Nigeria's biggest threat to agriculture especially in the sandy soils regions of south-eastern Nigeria.</p> <p>Perception determines the social mental picture of climate change. But a number of other variables like socio-demographic and socio-economic factors or ideological orientations, awareness level, information source influence perception and the mental picture of climate change (Sjoberg, 1995; Stedman, 2004). But the extent to which these factors influence perception of climate change particularly among local farmers have not received adequate attention in the literature and thus remains a subject of research focus.</p> <p>Fundamentally, the location, size and characteristic relief of Nigeria give rise to a variety of climates ranging from tropical rainforest climate along the coast to the Sahel climate in the Northern part of the country, each being different in its annual precipitation, sunshine and other climate elements (Adejuwom, 2004). In spite of this Nigeria is yet to put in place an agency that would negotiate and co-ordinate the nation’s climate change activities (Agwu, <em>et al., </em>2011). Farmers in trying to come to terms with climate change have developed strategies for adaptation and mitigation of its effects. Some of these measures include cover cropping, early planting, prompt weeding, regulated use of agro-chemicals and use of tolerant varieties (DelPHE, 2010). However, previous adaptive measures used by farmers become rapidly obsolete and ineffective due to the pace at which adverse climate events take place (Enete<em>et al., </em>2011). Action Aid (2008) reports that farmers in the Southeastern part of Nigeria have continued to complain of reduction in farm output arising from the uncertainty of rainfall patterns, increased erosion resulting from heavy down pour which simultaneously destroy the fertility and at times washing away of plants and human settlements. The unfortunate aspect of the climate change dilemma in Nigeria is that most of the farmers do not understand or appreciate their contributions to climate change devastations. This is more so among rural farmers who still engage in traditional forms of slash and burn system of farming (Agwu<em>et al., </em>2011). Evidence abounds in climate change literature that farmers are aware that the climate has changed and that this change has affected negatively their output (Enete<em>et al., </em>2011) but what they do not seem to appreciate is how their farming activities drive climate change. It is, therefore, important to investigate how farmers, who are major environmental stakeholders, perceive the issue of climate change, what types of changes they have observed in the past and how they have coped with them. Answers to these and other several related questions constitute the purpose of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Research Questions</strong></p> <p><strong>1. </strong>What level of knowledge do local farmers have about climate change and what actions do they take?</p> <p>2.

Its headquarters are in the town of Ido, it is situated along Ibadan-Eruwa road. It is located between Latitude 6' 45' and 9' 45' North of the Equator and Longitude 2' 30' and 9' 45' East of Greenwich Meridian. The Local Government was created during the second republic on May 29, 1989 and it shares boundary with Oluyole Local Government, Ibarapa East Local Government, Akinyele Local Government, Ibadan North West Local Government, Ibadan South West Local Government, Ibadan North Local Government areas of Oyo state and Odeda Local Government in Ogun state. It was among the five in Ibadan district before it was cancelled in 1956, other four local Governments that were in existence at that time were Mapo, Akinyele, Ona-ara, and Olode-Olojumo.</p> <p>It has an area of 986km2 and a population of 103,261 using a growth rate of 3.2% from 2006 census, it has population density of 116 persons by square kilometer. Like most cities in Southern Nigeria, Ido is characterized by two distinct seasons: the dry and the rainy season. It enjoys abundant rainfall of over 1800mm annually and the south-westerly winds blow most of the year.</p> <p>The people are predominantly Yorubas and the area is blessed with fertile land, which is suitable for agriculture. The main occupation of the people is farming mainly food and cash crops such as cassava, maize, yam, vegetable, timber, cocoa, oil palm and kolanut, there are also large hectares of grassland which are suitable for animal rearing, vast forest reserves and rivers. The Local Government is a block under the Ibadan/Ibarapa agricultural zone of the Oyo state Agricultural Programme (OYSADEP). The people of Ido are mainly small scale farmers with significant proportion of the farmers engaging in secondary occupation such as hunting, trading, artisan, civil service jobs, food processing. There are also some industries located within the Local Government Area,these include the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Nigeria Wire and Cable, Nigeria Mining Corporation and Cassava Processing Industry. The Local Government area has 75 primary schools, 33 secondary schools made up of 18 junior secondary school and 15 senior secondary school.</p>                                                           \n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE PERCEPTION OF LOCAL FARMERS ON CLIMATE CHANGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PERCEPTION OF LOCAL FARMERS ON CLIMATE CHANGE", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>                                                              INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Urban areas are the engines of economic growth as well as location for complex network of activities essential to basin human function of living and working (Mattingly, 1995). The lure of employment and the perception of improved quality of life in the cities are major socio-economic pull factors (Harris &amp; Todaro, 1970; World Bank, 2007).</p> <p>The huge increase in urban population amounts to a crisis of unprecedented magnitude in urban shelter provision, space for commerce and industry, quality health care and a conducive environment. Every year, the world’s urban population is increasing by about 70million, equivalent to seven new megacities. These people need to be provided with shelter, employment and urban services. People deserve the right to enjoy a living space that is clean and maintained making it easy to agree that the clean-up of urban areas is essential to building a lasting community. The way an area looks has an impact on who moves there, how long they stay, and ultimately decides the future of that neighbourhood. Picking up trash, maintaining the landscape, and the demolition of abandoned buildings could inspire residents to work together to rebuild their community. For neighbourhoods that have lost their appeal as destinations of choice, a community clean up may be what is needed in order to revitalize the area.  (September 5, 2013 by Malcolm Johnson).</p> <p>Urban beautification starts by identifying the cosmetic changes that can be made in a specific neighborhood then working with the residents to make community improvements. Organizing specific days for residents to pick up trash or to engage in some sort of area refurbishment is crucial to creating a better place to live. Furthermore, public officials share part of this responsibility as well, and should make policy initiatives to improve the regions they represent.  By putting in place programs to repair streets, sidewalks, and demolish abandoned buildings, policy makers can contribute to rebuilding a community. In order to make sure an area that has been rehabbed remains in the best condition, lawmakers also have a duty to enforce ordinances that will ensure the maintenance and cleanliness of a neighborhood.  </p> <p>In addition to gaining a nicer living space, beautification may cause residents to have an increased sense of pride in where they live. While there is no quick fix to the many problems that are present in urban areas, a person who lives in a clean environment may be more optimistic about the future. Living in a place that is constantly improving might just inspire individuals to do the same within themselves. The Neighborhood Beautification Program was designed to engage communities to beautify underutilized spaces in each of the City’s wards. This program complements the City's increased efforts to clean and revitalize overlooked City owned spaces. </p> <p>Urban areas in the developing world are under constant pressure of a growing population. Cities, metropolis and mega cities are now emerging as centers of domestic and international investments in an era of economic reforms, liberalization and globalization. This has created opportunities for technologists and planning professionals to guide and develop the process of planned development and monument. One of the main objectives of town planning is creation a conducive environment that is functional, efficient and visually satisfying for living, working, recreation and worship. However, many of today’s urban structures were never planned, for instance, Ibadan city, was built at a time when planning awareness was substantially different from today.</p> <p>According to Agbola (1987:89), Ibadan as a city was either not planned successfully or not planned at all. A large part of the city seems to be unplanned and dominated by the trading activities. Those who engaged in trading activities occupy an open spaces or shops along major roads in other to display their goods. Sometimes they cover front of a residential building along the road to shops while some other cases, the traders display goods very close to the road setbacks. For those who occupy open spaces, container, umbrellas serves as their shops in which they display their goods. In other words, standard for physical development in Oyo state are easily flouted and usually “there is no approval for change of use of open sites for utilities and services” (Agbola 2009).</p> <p>Urban beautification refers to a program that protects and seeks to restore the beaty inherent in a targeted environment, in this case of urban centre. Most developing countries in the world engage in urban beautification of cities whose state has deteriorated or decayed, in order to enhance the quality of the environment and for the purpose of bringing out nature’s beauty. There are various forms of urban beautification, among which are creation of car parks, the provision of proper refuse dump for dirt in order to avoid littering, construction of bridges to enhance transportation, construction of walkways, sculpture decoration, ornamentation and greening of the environment and many more. The underlying purpose of carrying out these projects are to give a facelift to parts of the cities, that is, development and to make the immediate environment attractive for investors, among others (Bilgili BC and Gokyer E 2012).</p> <p>In the case of Nigeria, the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), that was ruling some state of the federation then before changing to All Progressive Congress (APC) in the last general election of 2015, was carrying out beautification projects as part of its political agenda. This is to bring about a face lift to the states they govern, in terms of planting greens (flowers, trees) and expanding old major roads to enhance movement in the respective states and the country.</p> <p>Therefore, these two forms of urban beautification are of paramount importance to the present study on Ibadan urban. However, just a few portion of the state capital was covered.</p> <p>In the case of Ibadan region, that is, the pattern of urban beautification differs in the entire metropolis. Places like Eleyele, Onireke, Aleshiloye, Gate, uch, Mokola, Challenge are more of road expansion project, then, Ring-Road, Gate, Dugbe, Bodija, Toll Gate and Akinyemi that features the planting of greens.</p> <p>Whatever the case, before any form of beautification could be implemented, certain structures would have been demolished. Consequently, social and economic activitives would have been impacted negatively among others. Therefore, containers, kiosks or any other structure that are built in open spaces close to the road were subject to demolition. In Ibadan urban, more than 400 structures, including residential buildings that encroached on roads and illegal structures built by dwellers and traders were demolished in designated commercial parts of the city.The presence study is therefore to verify the perception of Ibadan metropolis dwellers on urban beautification programmes in Ibadan metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There are many problems facing most urban centers, among which are the growth of illegal unauthorized structures; that is structures that flout principle of the standard offset backs to roads, high tension power-lines and unauthorized conversion of approved use of land to different use(s) that’s encroached on open spaces. These are compounded by growing population size and increase of social and economic activities. Ibadan metropolis, as a commercial nerve center of Nigeria and as an area experiencing high rate of urbanization is lacking in terms of adequate</p> <p>physical layout adnd planning. In the recent past, Ibadan was classified as one of the dirtiest cities in the world, due to the shabby environmental situation of the largest city, south of the Sahara. (Kumuyi 2005).</p> <p>However, Oyo state Government took interest in urban beautification in order to transform the city into a better shape. This resulted in the demolition of illegal structures along selected road. The spilt-over effect is the displacement of traders that occupied the illegal shops and spaces along the roads. The present study is therefore to examine the forms of urban beautification that are implemented in Ibadan urban and the way the dwellers perceived it. These are examined in terms of changes in the rate of security, road accessibility, loss of buildings/shops, damaged acquired by individuals to the city.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to assess the perception on urban beautification programs in Ibadan metropolis.

It will help to bring about the better management and maintenance of Ibadan city cleanliness and beauty.</p> <p><strong>1.7 STUDY AREA</strong></p> <p><strong>1.7.1 GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION</strong></p> <p>Ibadan is said to be the largest indigenous urban city in Africa, south of the Sahara (Mabogunje, 1968). The city has a total human population of 2,550,593 (National Population Census, 2006). Ibadan is located at latitude of 7° 25' N of the equator and longitude of 3° 54' E and approximately 145 kilometres north of Lagos. The city is directly connected to many towns in Nigeria and its rural hinterland by a system of roads, railways and air routes. It is located near the forest-grassland boundary of South-western Nigeria. The need to develop housing to meet the need of the rising population has led to the occupancy of floodplains. It was established by Lagelu after the destruction of the first settlement near Awotan in the Ido Local Government Area (Mabogunje, 1968). This is shown in figure 1.1 below.</p> <p>Ibadan city the capital of Oyo state of Nigeria can be describe as a traditional city as a result of certain characteristics it possesses- a central market, a remarkable social structure and the rather unusual pattern of urban – rural migration. The city is the second fastest growing city in Nigeria after Lagos and the largest indigenous urban centers in Africa. It has a sound network which connects many towns in Nigeria – roads, railways and air routes. Most traders from Lagos to the northern state through Abeokuta and Sagamu meet in Ibadan before proceeding to their destinations.</p> <p><strong>1.7.2 LAND USE PATTERN OF IBADAN</strong></p> <p>Ibadan an indigenous city grew organically without due consideration for effective physical planning. Ibadan is characterized by both planned and unplanned growth. The unplanned sector of the city is in the south eastern part which is predominantly inhabited by the indigenes. This area constitutes about 60% of the spatial coverage. The non-indigenous sector is a mixture of planned and area. The planned areas have experienced varied degrees of planned growth. The growth of the city is a jig saw affair which is not coordinated within a master plan. It is yet to produce its development plan. The only tool used for controlling development is lay out plan which is even called “adopted layout” as a result of land use degree of 1978.</p> <p>The pattern of urban land use shows that the largest use of land is still for residential purposes which occupy about 51.39% of the total land in the metropolitan area. Industrial use of land account for only 14.34% (Muili 2005). The core area are mostly characterized by residential land use inhabited largely by the indigenous Ibadan population and early non- Yoruba migrants and a number of newer suburbs. The core area –Beere Labiran, Oje etc, where proceed of compound disintegration called growth by fusion may still be observed today (Mabogunje 1968). Commercial activities in Ibadan can be found in Gbagi-Dugbe axis, Gate-Iwo road axis, etc. Dugbe is central business district of Ibadan.</p> <p><strong>1.7.3 Socio-Economic Characteristics of Ibadan</strong></p> <p>Traditionally, the occupation of the Ibadan people is trading and crafting. The favorite climate condition encourages farming, so also the natural features of sending and swampy soil. The farming suburb stretched over considerable distance into the surrounding country sides. Apart from farming, others are self-employed in various occupations such as carpentry, motor mechanics, driving, printing, hairdressing, barbing etc.</p> <p>Trading has played a paramount role in the development of Ibadan and thereby increasing population which eventually led to high standard of living. The administrative influence of Ibadan to more than half of the entire Yoruba speaking people of Nigeria, due to their strong influence to invade and subdue other settlers for many years. The locational advantage of the city has made it that prominence as favorable center for political, commercial, educational industrial and social activities. The scale of activities created a job opportunity and consequently influence people into the city as such, responsible for a great population and large extend in size.</p> <p>However, Ibadan is well acquainted with many commercial and merchants banks, administrative offices, and research establishment.</p> <p><strong>1.7.4 Population Distribution of Ibadan Metropolis</strong></p> <p>Ibadan metropolis has a population of 2,550,590mllion according to2006 population census (NPC 2007) at 4.4% annual growth rate. The population is more concerned with the number of females in the study area, because more females dominate the trading activities in the study area. The breakdown of the population in the study area is as shown in Table 1.11</p>                                                          \n\nPERCEPTION OF URBAN BEAUTIFICATION PROGRAM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PERCEPTION OF URBAN BEAUTIFICATION PROGRAM", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>     1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Rain is liquid water in form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then precipitated that is, become heavy enough to fall under gravity (Mordurch, 1995; Sala and Lauenroth, 1982). Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation. Rainfall is a determinant factor of many natural occurrences. Vegetation distribution and type of land masses are as a result of rainfall (Ronen and Avinoam, 1999;Tielborger and Kadmon,2000; Shukla et al, 1990). Animals breeding periods synchronize with rainfall periods (Radford and Du plessis 2003). Crop planting, yields and harvests are influenced by rainfall and are practiced in accordance with their respective enabling seasons to ensure improved productivity (Laux et al, 2010; Mudita et al, 2008;Omokhafe and Emuedo 2006). Similarly, the gaseous content of the soil composition from time to time is much affected by rainfall (Lee et al, 2002).</p> <p>Rainfall trend is the significant change in the spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall. Rainfall trend in other words can be said to be the general tendency, movement, or direction and pattern in which rainfall takes. In the global scene for example, rainfall trend analyses, on  different spatial and temporal scales, has been of great concern during the past century because of the attention given to global climate change from the scientific community: they indicate a small positive global trend, even though large areas are instead characterized by negative trends (IPCC, 1996). Murphy and Timbal (2007) reported that most of the rainfall decline (61%) has occurred in autumn (March–May) in southeastern Australia. A similar rainfall decline occurred in the southwest of Western Australia around 1970 that has many common features with the southeastern Australia decline. However, in the regional level Nicholson (2000) observed that one of the most important contrasts in rainfall is the multi-decadal persistence of anomalies over northern Africa. Nicholson and Grist (2001) had identified several changes in the general atmospheric circulation that have accompanied the shift to drier conditions in West African Sahel. Rotstayn and Lohmann (2002) showed a prominent feature is the drying of the Sahel in North Africa and suggest that the indirect effects of anthropogenic sulfate may have contributed to the Sahelian drying trend (Akinremi et al 2001).</p> <p>Rainfall variability on the other hand is the degree to which rainfall amounts vary across an area or through time. Variability of rainfall can be used to characterize the climate of a region. Rainfall in Nigeria is subjected to wide variability both in time and space. This variability has assumed a more pronounced dimension as a result of climate change. According to Chidozie et al, rainfall variability increases from the northwest to the southwest, while between-year (yearly) rainfall variability increases from the north central to the southeast. This study further confirms that rainfall variability over time follows a spatial trend within a certain arbitrary boundary (Laux et al, 2010, Mudita et al 2008).</p> <p>The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rain bands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of the mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climate can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough or inter-tropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes (Laux et al, 2010, Mudita et al 2008). The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across Eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics.</p> <p>Rainfall characteristics in Nigeria have been examined for dominant trend notably by Olaniran (1990, 1992) and by Olaniran and summer (1989, 1990). They showed that there has been a progressive early retreat of rainfall over the whole country, and consistent with this pattern, they reported a significant decline of rainfall frequency in September and October which, respectively coincide with the end of the rainy season in the northern and central parts of the country. The pattern of rainfall in northern Nigeria is highly variable in spatial and temporal dimensions with inter-annual variability of between 15 and 20% (Oladipo, 1993). As a result of the large inter-annual variability of rainfall, it often results in climate hazards, especially floods and severe and droughts with their devastating effects on food production and associated calamities and sufferings (Oladipo, 1993; Okorie, 2003; Adejuwon, 2004). Rainfall is one of the key climatic resources of Nigeria. Crops and animals derived their water resources largely from rainfall. It is considered as the main determinant of the types of crops that can be grown in the area and also the period of cultivation of such crops and the farming systems that can be practiced.</p> <p>1.2       <strong>THE STATEMENT PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>            Variations in rainfall trends are still burning issues in the research frontiers. Global warming and climate change have been identified as the major factors influencing rainfall trend and variability. Climate change in particular constitute a major menace to rainfall patterns which will directly or indirectly affects the ecosystems. According to the Department of Ecology 2015, state of Washington, climate change leads to rising levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere have warmed the Earth and are causing wide-ranging impacts, including rising sea levels; melting snow and ice; more extreme heat events, fires and drought; and more extreme storms, rainfall and floods.</p> <p>Furthermore, scientists project that variation in rainfall trends will continue to accelerate, posing significant risks to human health, our forests, agriculture, freshwater supplies, coastlines, and other natural resources that are vital to a country’s economy, environment, and quality of life. This is because so many system are tied to climate, a change in climate can affect many related aspects of where and how people, plants and animals live, such as food production, availability and use of water, and health risks. In addition, a change in the usual timing of rains or temperatures can affect when plants bloom and set fruit, when insects hatch or when streams are their fullest. This can affect historically synchronized pollination of crops, food for migrating birds, spawning of fish, water supplies for drinking and irrigation, forest health, and more (Todd et al 2001; Dominic et al 2004; Adams &amp; Faure 1997).</p> <p><strong>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>            Climate change and global warming has increased at an alarming rate as a result of anthropogenic factors such as urbanization. Therefore study is relevant because it will assist researchers to understand the future consequences of rainfall variation due to climate change. This is because climate change has been linked to the climate, which in turn would affect where and how people make a living, how the flora and fauna species would thrive, how food would be produced which would be influenced by availability of water. Studies has shown that both plant and animal require a specific amount of water for their existence, excess or inadequate supply of water could lead to their demise. Carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere at an accelerated rate and also the depletion of the ozone layer which has caused the earth’s surface to be heated up.</p> <p>1.4       <strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in rainfall over Ibadan from 1982 to 2011.

Ibadan is directly connected to many towns in Nigeria by a system of roads, railways and air routes. The physical setting of the city consists of ridges of hills that run approximately in northwest - southeast direction. The largest of these ridges lies in the central part of the city and contains such peaks as Mapo, Mokola and Aremo. These hills range in elevation from 160 to 275 meters above sea level and thus affords the vistor a panoramic view of the city.</p> <p><strong>Figure 1: Study Area: Ibadan, Oyo State. </strong></p> <p>1.6.2<strong>    Climate          </strong></p> <p>            Ibadan has a tropical wet and dry climate, with a lengthy wet season and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Ibadan’s wet season runs from March through October, though August sees somewhat of a lull in precipitation. This lull nearly divides the wet season into two different wet seasons. The remaining months form the city’s dry season. Like a good portion of West Africa, Ibadan experiences the Harmattan between the months of November and February. The tropical rainfall regime experienced in Ibadan is bi-modal, convectional and follows the apparent movement of the sun while both length of rainy season and the yearly total rainfall, decreases with increasing distance from the equator. August is the coldest month and coinciding with the August break while in December-January, the months are noted for the dusty and cold harmattan winds conveyed from the Sahara by the north- east trade winds.</p>                                                          \n\nRAINFALL TRENDS AND VARIABILITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RAINFALL TRENDS AND VARIABILITY", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study examines the domestic water supply and consumption in Ibadan north east local government area of Oyo state, Nigeria.

It is a basic necessity of life for both plants and animals. Mankind cannot, in fact, survive without water as even the human body is made up of about 70% water.Water resources are becoming increasingly scarce in many parts of the world due to development, increased demand, climate change and resulting drought and explosive population growth. The availability of a reliable and clean supply of water is one of the most important determinants of our health. WHO explains that diseases related to drinking-water contamination represent a major burden on human health and the interventions to improve the quality of drinking-water provide significant benefits to health.</p> <p>Water is the only substance that exists naturally on Earth in all three physical states of matter, gas, liquid, and solid, and it is always on the move among them. The Earth has oceans of liquid water and Polar Regions covered by solid water. Energy from the sun is absorbed by liquid water in oceans, lakes, and rivers and gains enough energy for some of it to evaporate and enter the atmosphere as an invisible gas, water vapour. As the water vapour rises in the atmosphere it cools and condenses into tiny liquid droplets that scatter light and become visible as clouds. Under the proper conditions, these droplets further combine and become heavy enough to precipitate (fall out) as drops of liquid or, or if the air is cold enough, flakes of solid, thus returning to the surface of the Earth to continue this cycle of water between its condensed and vapour phases..</p> <p>The hydrologic cycle is a conceptual model that describes the storage and movement of water between the biosphere, athmosphere, lithosphere, and the hydrosphere. Water on our planet can be stored in any one of the following major reservoirs: atmosphere, oceans, lakes, rivers, soils, glaciers, snowfields, and groundwater. Water moves from one reservoir to another by way of processes like evaporation, condensation, precipitation, deposition, runoff, infiltration, sublimation, transpiration, melting and groundwater flow. The oceans supply most of the evaporated water found in the atmosphere. Of this evaporated water, only 91% of it is returned to the oceans basins by way of precipitation. The remaining 9% is transported to areas over landmasses where climatological factors induce the formation of precipitation. The resulting imbalance between rates of evaporation and precipitation over land and ocean is corrected by runoff and groundwater flow to the oceans.</p> <p>Water resources are becoming increasingly scarce in many parts of the world due to development, increased demand, climate change and resulting drought and explosive population growth. The availability of a reliable and clean supply of water is one of the most important determinants of our health. Thus, water use (demand) is a function of availability (supply).</p> <p>Water use falls into several major classes, each of which is associated with certain quantity and quality requirements. These classes include water for drinking and cooking, waste disposal, crop production, aquaculture, livestock, industrial use, recreational use, navigational use, and ecological values such as survival of natural lake, riverine or wetland communities. The quantity of water used within each of these classes is influenced mainly by variables such as climate and precipitation. The proportion of total water used for any specific purpose is controlled by socioeconomic conditions, tradition, culture and water availability. Agriculture based economies, such as Nigeria's, shall require up to 80% of available water for agriculture, and 10% each for industrial and domestic purposes.</p> <p>In an urban setting, the water used to generate electricity may be used for irrigation down a river. The same water might be used yet again as it is withdrawn for a public water supply or an industry. Only a few uses actually consume water. Irrigated agriculture, for example, consumes 55% of the water it uses. The consumptive nature of irrigation, therefore, limits many simultaneous users of the same resource. Municipal facilities such as cities consume 21% of water they withdraw. In contrast, industry which withdraws very large quantities of water, consumes only about 3% of that water. Although the quality of water returned to the system may change. Unless unacceptable changes in quality occur, many industrial users could benefit from the same water resource. The human needs about 2-10 litres of water per day for normal physiological functions, depending on climate and workload. About 1 litre of water is provided by daily food consumption. The total water consumption per capita per day is determined by a number of factors, such as availability, quality, cost, income, size of family, cultural habits, standard of living, ways and means of water distribution and climate (World Bank Water Research Team, 1993).  </p> <p>Water supply system is the collection, transmission, treatment, storage, and distribution of water for homes, commercial establishments, industry, and irrigation, as well as for such public needs as fire fighting and street flushing. Of all municipal services, provision of potable water is perhaps the most vital. People depend on water for drinking, cooking, washing, carrying away wastes, and other domestic needs. Water supply systems must also meet requirements for public, commercial, and industrial activities. In all cases, the water must fulfil both quality and quantity requirements. Water was an important factor in the location of the earliest settled communities, and the evolution of public water supply systems is tied directly to the growth of cities. In the development of water resources beyond their natural condition in rivers, lakes, and springs, the digging of shallow wells was probably the earliest innovation. As the need for water increased and tools were developed, wells were made deeper. Brick-lined wells were built by city dwellers in the Indus River basin as early as 2500bce, and wells almost 500 metres (more than 1,600 feet) deep are known to have been used in ancient China</p> <p>Public water supply started in Nigeria early in the twentieth century in a few towns managed at the lowest administrative level. Amongst the early beneficiaries were Lagos, Calabar, Kano, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Ijebu Ode (Ogun State) and Enugu. The schemes were maintained with revenue from water sales with virtually no operational subvention from government. With the creation of regional governments in the early 1950s the financial and technical responsibilities for developing new water schemes were taken over by the regional governments who also assigned supervisory high level manpower to oversee operations and maintenance. The regions were slow to set up independent bodies to develop, operate and manage the water supply. The first water corporation was formed in the western region in 1966 which took over all the assets and liabilities, including the existing staff. The staffs of the Water Division of the Ministry of Works were also transferred to the new corporation. The next corporations were formed in the 1970s. Today, all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory have water boards/corporations or public utilities boards managing their public water supply. Their efforts are supplemented, in many cases, by local governments who supply water to small villages in their areas of jurisdiction.</p> <p><strong>1.2    AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>         The aim of the study is to examine the domestic water supply and consumption in Ibadan north-east local government area. The specific objectives are to:</p> <p>1.      Determine the quantity of water used in different household</p> <p>2.      Access the challenges facing water supply for residents in the area and proffer solution.</p> <p>3.      Examine the relationship between socio-economic characteristics and pattern of water consumption in the area</p> <p><strong>1.3   RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <ol><li>There is no significant relationship between household size and quantity of water consumed.</li> <li>There is no significant relationship between income and quantity of water consumed</li> </ol> <p>3.      There is no significant relationship between distance to water source and the amount of water consumed.</p> <p><strong>1.4   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>It has been estimated that about 80 % of all the diseases in the developing countries are related to unsafe water supply and inadequate sanitation. Lack of access to improved sanitation and safe water supply is a global crisis. The effects of inadequate water supply are more visible and prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. The fast growth of the study area has contributed to the high demand of water supply and consumption within it. A lot of residents are dependent on boreholes and wells for their water supply. This study will examine the domestic water supply and consumption in Ibadan north east local government and the problems and solutions of water supply for the people of the area.  </p> <p>.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SOURCES OF DATA</strong></p> <p>There are two basic sources of data, the primary source and the secondary source.  This research depended mainly on the primary source of data. This was done through the administration of questionnaire.</p> <p><strong> 1.5.1 PRIMARY SOURCE</strong></p> <p>The primary source will be obtained from the distribution of questionnaires to the various respondents within the community. The questionnaires instrument of which will include multi choice question that will be administered to random household across the different wards in the local government. This study applied a cross sectional survey research design and the use of a structured open ended and close ended is used for data collection. This study was conducted among the dwellers in Ibadan north east local government and basically among household heads of different households in the community. A total number of 240 questionnaires were administered in Ibadan north east local government area. All the questionnaires were purposively administered among twenty (20) household held drawn from each ward. Ibadan north east local government have a total of twelve (12) wards and all the wards has an equal questionnaire of twenty (20) each. The questionnaire is divided into 2 main sections. The first section which deals with the socio-economic characteristics of the respondent which include questions like Age, sex, religion, marital status, household size, occupation, monthly income etc. The second section deals with questions on water supply and consumption pattern in their various households. Questions which include their major source of household water supply distance to the source of water, quality of water used in the household and other relevant questions pertinent to the study. The interviews were administered among the dwellers that showed interest. No incentive was offered to the participant.  </p> <p><strong>  1.5.2 SECONDARY DATA</strong></p> <p>      Data from secondary source was obtained from journals and data from previous researches. Others sources of information were from test materials, archives, past projects and literature, article related to the study. Secondary data was also collected from local government secretariat, which will be used in the research in order to get the accurate information about the study area.</p> <p><strong>1.6 METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p>    Theuse of both descriptive and chi-square method of data analysis were applied for the analysis of the data. For the purpose of making comparison among the variables (i.e, socio-economic characteristics, age, sex, occupation etc), descriptive statistics were used in the analysis. This are used to summarize bulky data for easy understanding. Among these are, the simple frequencies and percentages, mean, and standard deviation etc. the results generated from the analysis are presented in tables and figures to discuss the data and information on various issues addressed by the research objectives. Chi square a statistical test which was used to establish the dependency of a factor on another factor with the aim of determining if there is a significant relationship between the tested factors was used to test for hypothesis..   </p> <p><strong>1.7   STUDY AREA</strong></p> <p>The Ibadan north east local government was created on the 27th August 1991 by an administration of former head of state General Ibrahim Badamosi Babaginda.

Students are expected to select ;One of Literature-in-English, History, Geography or Religious Studies as the core subject. Geography has also been grouped as part of the body of elective subjects. Therefore, every student will be expected to select three of those subjects depending on the choice of career up to the end of the second year and may drop one of the non-compulsory subjects out of the nine subjects in the last year of the senior high school course. The geography curriculum has special feature which include:</p> <p>a.       The provision of a geography curriculum that is based on the choice of suitable and relevant themes,units, contents, teaching materials, sstudents’ activitiies, teaching aids and evaluation.</p> <p>b.      The reductionn in the scope and content of the subject matter of senior secondary school geography without loosing the high quality required at that level.</p> <p>c.       The inclusion of innovative elements into the teaching of syllabus through the emphasis placed on ther practical geography throughout the 3-year course and the introduction of geographic principles, concepts and skills that are relevant to current trends in the discipline and useful for solving environmental problems.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Education is noted as an instrument of change by different experts and professionals in the field of education. Education has been defined in various ways to emphasize different aspect of this crucial concept.  According to Obafemi Awolowo “education is that process of physical and mental culture whereby a man’s personality is developed to the fullest.  Also, Alfred North White says that “education is not just the acquisition of the art of the utilization of knowledge.  This is the concept of education for functional living within one’s milieu, the art of utilizing knowledge for one’s benefit and for the betterment of the society.</p> <p>Educational activities in Nigeria were first carried out informally.  This was known as indigenous education where the aim was to transmit the cultural heritage of the society through generations).  After which is the Islamic education which came to Nigeria around the 14th century following the arrival of Islamic Religion. The arrival of the Europeans in 1842 (the arrival of the Wesley Missionary Society) was the beginning of Western Education.  The western education later-on metamorphosed or led to Nigeria developing her own educational system that suits it.  This subsequently brought about the 6-3-3-4 system of education (though there were others before it i.e. 7-5-3 system) which was developed in 1969 (the 1969 National curriculum conference), which implies six (6) years of primary school, three (3) years of  junior secondary, three (3) years of senior secondary’ and at least four (4) years of tertiary education.</p> <p>Secondary education is defined as “education beyond the elementary grades or primary school”, it could also be said as the education provided by a high school or college preparatory school.  In the 6-3-3-4 system, the emphasis for us here is of the second -3- level, which is the senior secondary level, in which geography is offered or taken during the 3 years duration.  The subjects in the senior secondary are Maths, English, a major Nigerian language and other electives depending on the students area of interest or department (commercial, arts and sciences), in which geography is included.</p> <p>According to the National Policy on Education (N.P.E, 2004:7a), one of the national objectives states.</p> <p>“The training of the mind and understanding of the world around us”.</p> <p>Therefore, it is believed that perhaps geography as a school subject can achieve this stated objective.</p> <p>Geography is the physical – social science which describes, maps, and seeks to explain the inter-relationship between man and his physical environs.  On the one hand, it deals with the natural setting or physical environs in which man live (some of the elements of the physical environs are the surface or the topography of the earth, soil, rocks and minerals climate, land and water bodies, native plant and animal life, and location on the earth’s surface).</p> <p>From the afore mentioned it can be seen that the teaching and learning of Geography as a subject is alsobeing influenced by various factors in secondary schools and is faced with diverse problems.  These factors could be external factors, cultural, social, political and economic etc which operate differentially from place to place and from time to time, which are relative and not absolute.  Specifically, some of these factors include: inadequate staffing, lack of suitable texts, unqualified teachers, shortage of qualified teachers, lack of fund to schools, poor students perception of the subject and poor methods of teaching amongst others.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of problem</strong></p> <p>Despite the nature and importance of geography to the society, there is still a persistent worrisome poor performance of students in geography. For this reason, this study attempts to identify the factors affecting students’ performance in geography examinations in Nigerian secondary schools. </p> <p><strong>1.3       Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>This research work is basically to identify Geography teachers and students’ perception of factors affecting students’ performance in geography examinations. The purpose of the study will include: </p> <p>(1)               To access socio-economic background and its effect on performance of students in geography examinations in senior secondary schools.</p> <p>(2)               To evaluate the extent to which teacher qualification and training affect students’ performance in geography examinations in senior secondary schools.</p> <p>(3)               To access the extent to which students’ perception of geography affects their performance in geography examinations.</p> <p>(4)               To examine the extent to which inadequate teaching and learning materials affect students’ performance in geography examinations.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Research questions</strong></p> <p>1.                  Does the socio economic background of the students affect the performance of students in geography examinations in Secondary schools?</p> <p>2.                  How do (To what extent) teacher qualification and training affect the performance of students in geography examinations in secondary schools?</p> <p>3.                  How does students’ perception of geography affect their performance in geography examinations in secondary schools?</p> <p>4.                  How does inadequate provision of textbooks affect students’ performance in geography examinations in senior secondary schools?</p> <p><strong>1.5       Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>1.         There is no significant relationship between socio-economic background and performance of students in geography examinations in secondary schools.</p> <p>2.         There is no significant relationship between teachers qualification and training and the performance of students in geography examinations in secondary schools.</p> <p>3.         There is no significant relationship between students perception of geography and their performance in geography examinations in secondary schools .</p> <p><strong>1.6       Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>This study will contribute to the findings in the literature on the factors affecting students performance in geography examinations and benefit the students, teachers, parents, curriculum developers, government, and the society at large in the following ways: by informing the government on the need to provide schools with adequate infrastructure, enlighten the teachers on how to better appreciate their work and help in moulding their students understanding of the subject, the need for parents to provide books for their children/wards in helping to mould their knowledge of geography. And also informing the curriculum developers into looking into the actual period of teaching and learning of geography in order to bring it to a good standard, as well as coming up with adequate timing for the subject.</p> <p>Also it will inform policy makers and geography teachers on the factors responsible for students’ performance in geography examinations in secondary schools.   It may also provide a guide for students (as too the relevance of geography to future careers, and other relevant professions)</p> <p><strong>1.7 Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>This is limited to accessing geography teachers and students perception of factors that affect students’ poor performance in geography examinations in public secondary schools in Lagos Mainland (Yaba Local Government Area), in Lagos State. </p>                                                          \n\nGEOGRAPHY TEACHERS AND STUDENTS PERCEPTION OF FACTORS AFFECTING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN GEOGRAPHY EXAMINATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GEOGRAPHY TEACHERS AND STUDENTS PERCEPTION OF FACTORS AFFECTING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN GEOGRAPHY EXAMINATION", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <p><em>ABSTRACT</em></p> <p><em>This research is aimed at investigating into the socio-economic effect of population growth in Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State.

In chapter four socio-economic effect of growth in population causes by early marriage and moral practice as perpetrated by the young ones. Chapter five shown the summary of findings, recommendations and possible conclusion were drawn, that from investigation increase in population cause unemployment, social vices, famine and starvation.</em></p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Erawn (1977) defines the concept of population as the number of people living in one geographical area at a particular time. The study of population is as old as the world itself. The need to study demography or population can never be over-emphasized. The question of population gives rise to population census which is inevitable for social, economic and political planning in a country.</p> <p>In the same vein, Alades (1984) says that population refers to a group of people inhabiting geographical location. The trend of Nigerian population since 1963 was about 55.7 millions people as time changes so also thins including population continue to change, that is after the census of 1973 figure, which brought the population figure of Nigeria to 120 million people. Out of the total number, over 75% of the population resides in the rural area. Agricultural activities takes place while the remaining 25% of the population lives in the urban centres. Within the time frame right from when Nigeria attained independence rapid population growth is caused by early marriage, immoral practice as encouraged by young people and purely which dragged so many young girls into such prostitution thereby contributing to increase in population growth. Such population growth affect the labour force. Christianity and Islam, the two major religions abhor population control methods like sex education, the use of contraceptive etc. they inadvertently encourage increase in population. They did not understand the medical devices used in controlling unwanted pregnancies thereby leading to the increase in population by these group.</p> <p>Large population is synonymous with the expansion of local market. By expansion of local market we means, increase in demand for goods and services in the country. This is as a result of the fact that large number of people constitute consumers.</p> <p>Increase in demand for goods and services will lead to increase in production and that is a good omen to the country’s economic development. A country that has large population will also have more people that are working if other things being equal. These people that are gainfully employed and are potential contributors to the economic development of the country. The more they are the better for the country. As the population of a country continues to increase, so will the number of skill and talented people continue to diversify in all parts of the country.</p> <p>It is in the light development that this study attempt to examine the socio-economic effect of population rate in Nigeria using Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State as a study.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>In the course of this research work, the researcher encountered some problems. Some of these problems are:</p> <p>-       There was no enough time for the researcher to go round the whole local government because the researcher combined academic work with the research.</p> <p>-       There was no enough money for the researcher to produce much questionnaire to circulate the whole village in the local government (Dekina).</p> <p>-       Another problem was that of the respondents; some of them were not ready to respond appropriately for the fear of one thing or the other as they thought it will have negative implication on them.</p> <p>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Population as earlier discuss could be described as the total number of people living in a particular geographical area at a particular period of time.</p> <p>In determining the total number of inhabitant in a particular place, population census is used.</p> <p>Population census could be defined as the counting of all the people in the country by the government at regular period of time usually every ten (10) years.</p> <p>Population census is of great importance to economic, political, socio-cultural planning of the country, reliable and detailed data on the size, required for both planning and research purposes. Population census is the major source or benchmark for data collection population is of great importance to the development of the country.</p> <p>In the first place, good economic planning is one of the importance of population census enable the government to make plan for the economic growth and development of a country. This is so because census gives information such as the number of people in each occupation such information enable the government to make plan on how to allocate amenities such as school, hospitals, roads, pipe-borne water, electricity etc. to different localities in Nigeria.</p> <p>It also enable the government to know the most appropriate place to establish different type of industry. Political representative is very essential to population growth and national planning. This is because political constituencies are determined by national planning on the basis of the size of population growth. Information such as this, aids the country to determine its population policy. For example, the government of India adopted the policy of birth control measure when it became clear that the population of India was growing too rapidly.</p> <p>Many developed countries assist the underdeveloped countries in providing such as idea the size of the population. Aids donors will normally not give the same account. The importance of countries at the United Nations Organization with other world assemblies depends on a large extent on the population which it has within the organization of Africa. Population consideration is of important for the above plan. Conclusively, population census is needed and is of important to national planning for political reasons and for effective creation of state, local government, provision of social amenities, public utilizes and  for location of industries and the host of others.</p> <p>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The research is unique because it is the first study carried out on the socio-economic effect of rapid population growth in Nigeria and the people in Dekina Local Government Area. This has advantage of creating awareness in the society as a result of continuous increase in population as it affect them. This is also important as it open widely the eyes of the people to look into the result on continuous increase in population from various perspectives and to look for means of solving the problem.</p> <p>This study is a model attempt to document the factors that lead to the continuous increase in population in the area, since there is tendency for scholars to take further step into the investigation.</p> <p>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work is strictly limited to Dekina Local Government Area due to some reasons beyond t on the researcher’s control. This work would have been conducted on the whole State but for some certain reasons such as financial predicament, transportation, and feeding etc. This financial constraint exhibited itself in the area of not enough questionnaires to cover the whole State. Despite this, transportation and bad road network were among of the problems.</p> <p>1.6    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>The hypotheses upon which this project work is based is stated below:</p> <p>1.   Continuous increase in population brings about unemployment?</p> <p>2.   Contain culture and tradition of the people contribute to the continuous increase in population which in turn bring about social problem?</p> <p>3.   Early marriage lead to continuous in population.</p> <p>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>Socio: According to Oxford Advanced Learners, Dictionary, socio simply means combining form connected with society or the study of society.</p> <p>Economics: According to Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, economics is the study of how society organizes its money, trade and industry.</p> <p>Socio-Economic: according to Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, Socio-economic is based on a combination of social and economic conditions.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>                                                         \n\nSOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECT OF POPULATION GROWTH IN NIGERIA: A STUDY OF DEKINA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF KOGI STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECT OF POPULATION GROWTH IN NIGERIA: A STUDY OF DEKINA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF KOGI STATE", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0      INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Solar radiation (a renewable energy resource) has direct impact on energy generation in addition to agriculture and water resources. The energy resource was observed to be affected by climate changes induced by CO2 emissions (Pan et al., 2004). With enormous solar potential across Nigeria, a moderate seasonal effect of climate change can have significant socio-economic impacts; change of solar radiation in future climate is thus of considerable interest (Pan et al., 2004).</p> <p>High resolution reliable projections of 21st century climate change are of great importance to assess related impacts on renewable energy resources (directly on solar energy and indirectly on wind and hydro power), human activities and natural ecosystem over the country. African countries are shown to be among the most vulnerable to climatic changes expected for the next decades of the 21st century due to increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2007; Mariotti et al., 2011).</p> <p>Furthermore, among African regions, West Africa is found as one of the world most exposed to the negative effects of climate variability (Tchotchou and Kamga, 2010). In Nigeria, Climate change is the latest challenge to sustainable human development and is leading to more frequent and more severe climate-related impacts that may deter efforts to achieve the country’s development objectives, including the targets of the Nigeria Vision 20:2020 and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) NEST and Tegler, 2011; NASPA-CCN, 2011; the challenges being multifaceted (social, economic, environmental), its impact on infrastructure will be significant because infrastructure provides a critical platform for the effective functioning of the Nigerian economy (NEST and Tegler, 2011).</p> <p>Climate change is also expected to negatively affect the already limited electrical power supply through impacts on the existing hydroelectric and thermal generation; service interruption is also expected to result from damage to transmission lines and substation equipment impacted by sea level rise, flash floods, and other extreme weather events (NASPA-CCN, 2011). Climate change was discussed in (Li et al., 2012) to have effect on weather parameters (wind speed, solar radiation, precipitation, mean temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures etc.) that constitute the renewable resources.</p> <p>Several authors have also shown that potential climatic changes due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gases might affect the availability of renewable resources in West Africa in the future. However, changes (increase or decrease) in resource potentials resulting from climate change consequences may affect power generation from renewable energy resources and can consequently affect the potential contribution to future electricity output.</p> <p>There is also the tendency of a reduction or increase in magnitude of the several weather parameters (global solar radiation, dry-bulb temperature (mean, maximum and minimum), relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speeds) that contribute to building comforts (through heat gain and loss in buildings) in the advent of a changing climate (Ohunakin et al., 2013).</p> <p>However, study of the physical mechanisms underlying climate variability and the quantification of the relative contributions of each of the driving factors; require long time series of observations. The long range of observed data is a disability in West Africa because of the relatively few observation stations, and most times, poor quality of available data; these necessitate the use of climate models whose outputs constitute consistent datasets of atmospheric variables.</p> <p>Climate models (global and regional circulation models) are thus the primary tools that aid in our understanding of the many processes that govern the climate systems (Pal et al., 2007). A number of simulations have been carried out using Global Circulation Models (GCMs).</p> <p>Climate models with GCMs have been found to have difficulties reproducing various atmospheric variables of interest and thus generating unrealistic outputs (some examples are in the results as given in the following: Community Climate Model version 3-CCM3 in the work of (Jenkins and Mikovitz, 2003); Laboratoire de Me´te´orologie Dynamique (LMD) GCM and also the Centre for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere (COLA) GCM as reviewed in the work of (Tchotchou and Kamga, 2010).</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The sun is the source of most energy on the earth and is a primary factor in determining the thermal environment of a locality. The challenge about technical consideration on the effect of solar radiation could be as a result of incompetency of the engineers that may not be able to make estimates of solar radiation intensity and know how to make simple solar radiation measurements. It could also be that the instruments that are used for solar radiation measurement are not accurate thereby leading to a false result. More also, inability to understand the thermal effects of solar radiation and knowing how to control or utilize them. Finally, the several researches has been carried out on the effect of solar energy but not even a single research has been carried out on the technical consideration of the effect of solar radiation in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main aim of the study is to examine technical consideration of the effect of solar radiation. Other specific objectives of the study include;</p> <p>1.          to determine the extent to which technical radiation affects solar radiation in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.          to determine the impact of technical consideration on solar radiation in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.          to determine the factors affecting technical consideration on solar radiation in Nigeria.</p> <p>4.          to proffer possible solutions to the problems.</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS               </strong></p> <p>1.          What is the extent to which technical radiation affects solar radiation in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.          What is the impact of technical consideration on solar radiation in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.          What are the factors affecting technical consideration on solar radiation in Nigeria?</p> <p>4.          to proffer possible solutions to the problems.</p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study on the technical consideration of the effect of solar radiation will be of immense benefit to the entire Nigeria in the sense that it will enable the solar technical engineers to be well equipped in order for them to be able to handle challenges of any sorts that has to do with solar radiation. The study will also educate the government to be fully aware of the kind of people they employ into this sector for the benefit of the citizens in the country. Finally, the study will contribute to the body of existing literature and knowledge to this field of studies and basis for further research.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The study on consideration of the effect of solar radiation is limited to Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7   LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p><strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

However, the <em>rea</em>l petroleum reservoir, is a composition of layers with unique interlayer characteristics. The individual layers are usually separated from each other by an interface which could be either permeable or impermeable. Pressure behavior in this kind of vertically heterogeneous system is not necessarily like that of a single layered system and seldom reveals more than the average properties of the entire system. It is against this backdrop that this study became necessary.  Well completion in such systems would be more instructive, enabling better reservoir and production engineering practice if detailed layer information is available at it prime. The petroleum industry is however interested in accurately calculating the pressure losses that occur for multiphase flow in the tubing and pipelines. Accurate predictions of pressure losses in pipes would enable proper design. Also, pressure determination in a production system in the petroleum industry is very important as it helps in the effective production of oil and gas from the reservoir but of all, the most important is the determination of flowing bottom-hole pressure as its knowledge helps in the determination of so many parameters needed for efficient production and also to avert early depletion of the reservoir. Its knowledge can also be used to prevent formation damage which could be caused by early sand production in the reservoir. Surface pressures often can be converted to bottom-hole values if adequate information is available about the wellbore system.</p> <p><strong>1.1.1 WHAT IS BOTTOM HOLE FLOWING PRESSURE</strong></p> <p>The pressure at the bottom of a working oil, water, or gas well (the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 1979). The pressure measured in a well at or near the depth of the producing formation. For well-test purposes, it is often desirable to refer the pressure to a datum level chosen at a reference depth by calculating the pressure that would occur if the pressure measurement were made at the datum level rather than at the actual depth of the gauge</p> <p>(Schlumberger oilfield glossary). A knowledge of this pressure is fundamental in determining the most efficient methods of recovery and the most efficient lifting procedure, yet there is less information about these pressures than about any other part of the general problem of producing oil (Millikan and Sidwell, 1930). As earlier said, the bottom-hole pressure can be determined from surface pressures like the well head pressure if adequate information is available about the production system which can be easily gotten from well testing operations (Economides, 1979). Since the well head pressure and parameters are easily gotten from pressure transient analysis whose success depends on the accurate measurement or estimation of bottom-hole pressure (Omohimoria and Ayodele, 2013), it is therefore desirable and necessary to obtain the bottom-hole pressure from these data. This will be carried out in order to further highlight the advantages which is associated with having adequate knowledge about the bottom-hole pressure of a reservoir.</p> <p><strong>1.1.2 TYPICAL FLOW REGIMES</strong></p> <p> At certain position and time in the reservoir different flow behaviors are usually encountered in the reservoir. This gives rise to different flow regimes. Flow regimes are usually classified according to the rate of change of pressure with respect to time and position</p> <p><strong><em> Steady state</em></strong></p> <p>During steady-state flow, the pressure does <em>not change </em>with time. This is observed for example when a constant pressure effect, such as resulting from a gas cap or some types of water drive, ensures a pressure maintenance in the producing formation. Pressure usually will changes from one point to the other in the reservoir algebraically,</p> <p>…………………………………………1.1</p> <p><strong><em>Pseudo steady state</em></strong></p> <p>The pseudo steady state regime characterizes a closed system response.

The <em>pressure variation </em>with time is a function of the well geometry and the reservoir properties, such as permeability and heterogeneity. It can be expressed mathematically as,</p> <p>………………………….. 1.3</p> <p>Usually, well test interpretation focuses on the transient pressure response. Near wellbore conditions are seen first and later, when the drainage area expands, the pressure response is characteristic of the reservoir properties until boundary effects are seen at late time (then the flow regime changes to pseudo steady or steady state). The applications of the steady-state flow to describe the flow behavior of several types of fluid in different reservoir geometries are presented below. These include:</p> <p>• Linear flow of incompressible fluids</p> <p>• Linear flow of slightly compressible fluids</p> <p>• Linear flow of compressible fluids</p> <p> • Radial flow of incompressible fluids</p> <p> • Radial flow of slightly compressible fluids</p> <p> • Radial flow of compressible fluids</p> <p> • Multiphase flow</p> <p><strong>1.1.3 VerticalMultiphase flow</strong></p> <p>Much has been written in the literature regarding the multiphase flow of fluids in pipe. This problem is much more complex than the single-phase flow problem because there is the simultaneous flow of both liquid (oil or condensate and water) and vapor (gas). The mechanical energy equation   is the basis for methods to estimate the pressure drop under multiphase flow; however, the problem is in determining the appropriate velocity, friction factor, and density to be used for the multiphase mixture in the calculation. In addition, the problem is further complicated as the velocities, fluid properties, and the fraction of vapor to liquid change as the fluid flows to the surface due to pressure changes.</p> <p>Many researchers have proposed methods to estimate pressure drops in multiphase flow. Each method is based on a combination of theoretical, experimental, and field observations, which has led some researchers to relate the pressure-drop calculations to flow patterns. Flow patterns or flow regimes relate to the distribution of each fluid phase inside the pipe. This implies that a pressure calculation is dependent on the predicted flow pattern. There are four flow patterns in the simplest classification of flow regimes:</p> <p>·         Bubble flow</p> <p>·         Slug/Plug flow</p> <p>·         Churn flow</p> <p>·         Annular-mist flow</p> <p><strong>Bubble</strong>: (Fig...) This type of flow was noted to occur at very low gas velocities.  This type of flow is characterized by bubbles of gas moving along the upper part of pipe at approximately the same velocity as the liquid.</p> <p><strong>Slug/Plug flow</strong>: (Fig…) In this type of flow, the flow of liquid is basically restricted due to the amount of gases which evolve from the liquid phase and collage to form slug-like gas pockets. Like the bubbly flow, the liquid phase is the continuous phase but in this case, the gas phase overrides the liquid phase.</p> <p><strong>Churn flow</strong> /<strong>Semi-annular</strong>: (Fig...) It is characterized by secondary currents set up by the velocity gradients in the liquid causing the liquids to climb the tube walls and, aided by waves, to coalesce at the top.  The amount of liquid in the bottom of the tube was greater than at top and walls, hence the name semi-annular.</p> <p><strong>Annular</strong>: (Fig...) This type of flow is characterized by liquid flowing in a thin film around the entire inside face of the pipe, the gas flowing at a high velocity as a central core.  The liquid is flowing in a continuous annular rings, hence the name annular flow.</p> <p><strong>Figure 1.1: </strong>Flow patterns in Vertical Flow</p> <p>Figure 1.1.3 above (Taitel, Bornea and Duckler, 1980) shows the various flow regimes that could be expected in vertical flow as a function of the superficial velocities of gas and liquid flow</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>A calculation method for predicting Bottom Hole Pressure (BHP) based on easily obtainable wellhead parameter has been the preferred method in the oil and gas industry. But the predictive capability of the existing correlations is a thing of concern to the oil industry operators. This is due to the inability of the existing models and correlations to account for the presence of sand particles in the flow stream; also, the requirement for the well to be shut-in for BHP predictions is counterproductive.</p> <p><strong>1.3 AIM&amp; OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aim of the project is to determine the flowing bottom-hole pressure of a vertical well from surface pressure and well parameters. This will be done by the modification of the general energy equation considering only the frictional pressure term. The modified equation (derived model) will be validated with a well data which will be gotten from a company.</p> <p>The objectives of determining the flowing bottom-hole pressure of a well from well head pressure and well head data include the following:</p> <p>·                     Efficient interpretation of the behavior of the underground system.</p> <p>·                     Determination of BHP helps in provision of important information for efficient production, avert early depletion and early sand production in the reservoir.</p> <p>·                     Determination of the most efficient methods of recovery and the most efficient lifting procedures.</p> <p>·                     Determination of pressure losses in pipes and tubing for proper design of Artificial Lift Systems - Gas Lift, ESP’s etc.</p> <p>·                     Production Optimization - Identification of production bottlenecks, Gaslift optimization, and completion designs.</p>                                                           \n\nDETERMINATION OF FLOWING BOTTOM-HOLE PRESSURE FROM WELL-HEAD DATA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF FLOWING BOTTOM-HOLE PRESSURE FROM WELL-HEAD DATA", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0      INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Erosion is one of the surface processes that sculpture the earth’s landscape and constitutes one of the global environmental problems. Soil erosion is perhaps the most serious mechanism of land degradation in the tropics (ElSwaify, et al., 2002). However, gully is visually the most impressive of all types of erosion (El-Swaify, 2000). Gully erosion is a well-defined water worn channel (Monkhouse and Small, 2008).</p> <p>It is a recently extended drainage channel that transmits ephemeral flow, steep side, steeply sloping or vertical head scarf with a width greater than 0.3 m and a depth greater than 0.6 m (Brice, 2006). It is a V or U-shaped trench in unconsolidated materials with a minor channel in the bottom, but not necessarily linked to a major stream (Graf, 2003).</p> <p>Similarly, Bettis III (2005) defined gully as a relatively deep, vertical-walled channel recently formed within a valley where no well-defined channel previously existed. Gully erosion is an advanced stage of rill erosion where surface channels have been eroded to the point where they cannot be smoothened over by normal tillage operations (Hilborn, 2005).</p> <p>Gullies can be active (actively eroding) or inactive (stabilized). The former, according to Poesen et al. (2003), can occur where the erosion is actively moving up in the landscape by head-cut migration. The causes of gully erosion are poorly understood but the processes and factors involved in its growth and degradation are well-known (Bettis III, 2005). The research has shown that gully processes had happened in the past even without human influence or interference. Thus, the phenomenon of gully erosion is either naturally induced or artificially-induced, or both. Like in other parts of the world, gully erosion is one of the major environmental challenges facing Nigeria.</p> <p>The available literatures on the subject show that this menace is more predominant in the eastern half of the country compared to the western half. South-eastern part of Nigeria is more affected than its north-eastern counterpart. Soil erosion in the former has been identified as the most threatened environmental hazards in the country (Albert, et al. 2006). Anambra State is the most affected of all the states in Nigeria where Agulu, Nanka and Oko communities of the state are the worst hit. Available literatures have clearly reiterated the fact that the underlying geology exerts a major of control on gully development and, more often than not, the process is rock type dependent as some rocks are more susceptible to erosion than the others. There is therefore a need to briefly review the geology of Nigeria with a view to recognizing why the phenomenal gully erosion is more prevalent in one part of the country than in the other.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>          Erosion generally degrades land and affects not just plants and animal but is capable of taking away human’s life, though it a natural disaster but ways of preventing it can be thought about. Gully erosion seems to be a factor of discourse every rainy season because maybe the government have decided to pay deaf ears to this menace, sometimes because they must have tried to work on it but the solution was not long lasting and they thought intervening again will just be a total waste of money thereby feeling discouraged. Finally, several studies has been carried out on the effect of erosion on agricultural produce but not even a single research has been carried out on the effects of gully erosion on the environment a case study of Oko, Anambra state.</p> <p><strong>1.3      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>         The main aim of the study is examine the effects of gully erosion on the environment.

Finally, the study will contribute to the body of existing literature and knowledge to this field of studies and basis for further research.</p> <p><strong>1.7   SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study on the effects of gully erosion on the environment is limited to Oko, Anambra state.</p> <p><strong>1.8   LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p><strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Water has some physical characteristics that guaranteed its wholesomeness: it must be colourless, odourless, tasteless, and readily foam with soap or detergents. The human body and blood is composed of 60-75% of water as such needed enough water; at least 2-3 litres for adult to enhance the effective functioning of the circulatory and metabolic systems of the body. Safe water must be used for domestic (drinking, washing, bathing, and cooking), agricultural, industrial processes, and recreational activities. This water is gotten from sources such as: rain, snow, stream, lake, river, sea and aquifer (groundwater). Safe water is dependent on the chemical components of the water.</p> <p>Groundwater is an important natural resource that supplies billions of gallons of water for domestic, agriculture, industrial purposes and other uses. The known surface water bodies in the area under study are severely polluted by anthropogenic activities, as such about 85% of the population of the area now solely depends on groundwater as their source of water. Thus, harnessing and preservation of clean and safe groundwater becomes imperative.</p> <p>The considerable thickness of the aquifers, the high transmissivity of water through these aquifers due to the high degree of porosity and permeability and the adequate groundwater recharge capacity enhanced by the high annual rainfall in the area, makes the aquifers of the area reliable water resources that can yield and supply reasonable millions of volume of water to satisfy the water needs of the people and industries of the area through both public and private abstractions (Todd, 1959; Krivochieva and Chouteau, 2003, Tamunobereton-ari et al, 2010a; Tamunobereton-ari et al, 2010).</p> <p>The characterization and delineation of aquifer in the area becomes imperative as water samples from some existing wells and boreholes in the study area fall short of the acceptable characteristics of groundwater and during the dry season most wells and boreholes drop to a minimum yield and sometimes get dried up; perhaps due to lack of hydrogeological information of the area and improper delineation of the aquifer to facilitate the precise identification of desired aquifer before drilling and well completion for sustainable supply of potable water to the people of the area (Edlefsen, and Anderson. 1941; Tamunobereton-ari et al, 2013).</p> <p>It is an established fact that a quick, non-invasive, cost effective means of subsurface characterization is the geoelectrical or electrical resistivity method. These combined hydro-geophysical methods which employs vertical electrical sounding in conjunction with 2D wenner electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), is majorly the geophysical application methods used for hydro-geological investigation which is directed towards aquifer characterization and ground water quality studies (Olayinka and Mbachi, 1992; Ismail Mohamaden, 2005; Astahani, 2006; Bello and Mankinde, 2007 in Mogagi et al, 2011).</p> <p>These methods image the subsurface geologic stratigraphy for characterization of the subsurface in a bid to delineate zones characterized with high porosity, permeability as well as saturation for sufficient ground water exploitation and determination of depth, thickness and boundary between saline and potable fresh water aquifer zones (Khalil, 2006; El-waheidi et al, 1992; Bello and Mankinde, 2007; Astahani, 2006; Ismail Mohamaden, 2005). Ground water exploration involves the use of numbers of Geophysical techniques available in the location of water bearing rocks called Aquifer (Ariyo and Adeyemi, 2012; Emenike, 2001). Mogaji, et al, (2011) defined aquifer as any mass of permeable rock material from which significant amount of water can be recovered from. Sabongida- Ora Edo State is characterized with limited boreholes and ephemeral stream, thus water is a priceless commodity.</p> <p>The need for water in adequate supply and quantity is a necessity for every life that is for domestic and industrial uses (Ariyo and Adeyemi, 2012). This study aimed at shielding light on the subsurface geology for the determination of geo-electrical and hydro-geophysical characteristics of potable aquifer for optimal groundwater exploration. Both Schlumberger and Wenner array configurations were used in this study.</p> <p>The schlumberger method has a greater penetration than the Wenner therefore, it is suitable for depth and thickness investigation whereas Wenner configuration discriminates between resistivities of different geoelecric lateral layers (Olowofela et al, 2005 cited in Adegbola et al, 2010). Consequently, the application of hydro-geophysical method proffer the existence of a perched water aquifer within a window depth of 15m to 35m and a deep seated confined aquiferous unit at depth of investigation beyond 240m with good characteristic for potable water exploration and its supply in the study area.</p> <p>Methods for applying geophysical techniques in groundwater exploration have been already presented (Van Dongen and Woodhouse 1994) but as MacDonald et al. (2001) pointed out, ‘‘areas with complex geology and hydrogeology are not covered by the general approach and require special methods for particular problems’’. Many geophysical methods have been used for groundwater resources investigation, but the electrical and electromagnetic methods have the greatest success and can be used for studying fresh and/or contaminated aquifers around the world (Meju et al. 1999; Peavy and Valentino 1999; Sørensen and Søndergaard 1999; Gwaze et al. 2000; Corriols et al. 2000; Mendoza et al. 2000; Miele et al. 2000; Maillol et al. 2000; Wynn et al. 2000; Farrell et al. 2000; Paine et al. 2000; Soupios et al. 2010).</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The groundwater potentials and its environs are enormous based on the positive indicators of high resistivity values, clean coarse sand formation materials, the thickness of the established aquiferous saturated zone and the shallow depth to locating the aquifer, which is about from 22m that can facilitate the easy harnessing and supply of safe, sustainable and portable water to the people of the area. Lack of expertise might be a leading problem that might bring about poor water production or drilling. This is a situation whereby the drillers are not able to properly decipher the rudiment of borehole drilling and they just stop into the line of business without knowing the right thing to do. Finally, several studies has been carried out on delineation of aquifer depth but not even a single research has been carried out on the delineation of aquifer depths and its characterisation using geophysical method.</p> <p><strong>1.3    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main aim of the study is to examine the delineation of aquifer depths and its characterization using geophysical method. Other specific objectives of the study include:</p> <p>1.           to determine the depth to bedrock aquifer thickness.</p> <p>2.           to determine the suitable areas for boreholes development.</p> <p>3.           to determine the approximate depths of the proposed boreholes.</p> <p>4.           to determine the factors affecting aquifer depth.</p> <p>5.           to proffer solution to the problems.</p> <p><strong>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS       </strong></p> <p>1.           What is the depth to bedrock aquifer thickness?</p> <p>2.           What are the suitable areas for boreholes development?</p> <p>3.           What is the approximate depth of the proposed boreholes?</p> <p>4.           What is the factors affecting aquifer depth?</p> <p>5.           What are the possible solutions to the problems?</p> <p><strong>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study on the delineation of aquifer depth and its characterization using geophysical method will be of immense benefit to the whole country in the sense that it will educate the government in the different techniques to delineate aquifer depth. It will also guide them on the topological area that is suitable for public borehole establishment. Finally, the study will contribute to the body of existing literature and knowledge in this field of study and provide the basis for further research.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study on delineation of acquifer depths and its characterization is limited to geophysical method.</p> <p><strong>1.7    LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p><strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

While annual temperature averages unquestionably continued to rise through the late 1990s and early 2000s, over-heated areas in the Northern Hemisphere often were matched by excessively cool regions in the Southern Hemisphere (Blij, Muller, Williams, Conrad and Long, 2005).</p> <p>             The discovery and extraction of natural resources has brought different consequences to countries that are endowed with such resources. While some of these nations have become economically strong and self sustaining, others have being drawn into serious economic hardships and conflicts due to the atmospheric influence of man and his activities while man through his various actions deliberately or inadvertently influence weather and climate which brings about climate change refers to an increase in average global temperatures.</p> <p>             Natural events and human activities are believed to be contributing to an increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). Nigeria is experiencing adverse climate conditions with negative impacts on the welfare of millions of people. The climate of an environment or a region are usually explained in terms of the prevailing climatic elements of temperature, rainfall or precipitation, relative humidity, evaporation, solar radiation etc. The description of these climate element or parameters in any region is known as climatic characteristics of what region. Among all these parameters, the most widely used measure of climatic description is the temperature, rainfall or precipitation and relative humidity (Oguntoyinbo, 1983 and Ayoade, 1992).</p> <p>          Over the years, studies of climatic characteristics have been limited to the micro scale known as micro climatic characteristics (Efe, 2002; Oguntoyinbo, 1981; Ojo, 1988; Figurola, 1995; and Efe and Aruegodine, 2003). Human activities have much effect on the climate of Abraka as most of these climatic parameters are being altered by the numerous activities of human in the region. Some of these human activities are the method of farming, gas flaring within the environment or neighbouring communities, transportation, fumes from factory buildings, illegal oil bunker, fumes from generator sets, improper waste disposal, deforestation etc.</p> <p>          Lately the heat wave all over the country has been unbearable. Even with rain, the heat is still unbearable. Have you ever wondered why the sun is so hot? The heat is caused by global warning. Global warning is the rise in the atmosphere. This is called the Green House Effect. A Green House Gas (sometimes abbreviated GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the green house effect.</p> <p>          The primary green house gases in the Earth’s atmosphere are water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. The effect of global warming include extreme weather conditions, heat due to the depletion of the ozone layer by the greenhouse gases, flood, shortage of water due to climate change.</p> <p>          However, in Abraka, urbanization has also resulted in massive increases in problems such as obesity, township life, especially in modern urban slums of the developing world, are certainly immune to neither pestilence nor climatic disturbance such as floods, yet continue to strongly attract migrants. As an area is getting urbanized, there is the need to study climatic characteristics before they are completely militated by the modern trend of human population explosion, human and industrial activities as well as to get acquainted with its rural environmental conditions in relation to its rural surrounding centers. It is against this background that this research attempts to examine the effects of global warning in Abraka.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>As the natural geographical setting and landscape of Abraka and its environs is rapidly being replaced by an agglomeration and clustering of both planned and unplanned building structures, its attendant consequences are enormous. The geometric increase in population, vehicular emissions from exhaust pipes, industrial discharges and increased use of power generating set due to erratic power supply by Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) all these lead to appreciable disturbance in the in the natural ecosystem of Abraka region, which in turn adversely affect the climate of Abraka.</p> <p>          One of the effects of man’s activities that is resulting to increase in temperature is based on the exercised through which changes in atmospheric composition particularly the CO2, Ozone and aerosols content of the atmosphere. There is unequivocal evidence that the CO2 content of atmosphere has been increasing over the years as a result of man’s use of fossil fuels, for energy. For instance the exploration of oil, has led to deforestation, the exploitation of oil has led to gas flaring in the southern part of Nigeria and that now exacerbate high temperature and lower humidity. The coastal location and presence of River Ethiope in Abraka helped to create humid condition and heavy amount of rainfall in Abraka, but the influence of the gas flaring (in neigbouring community such as Ebedei), fumes from generator sets etc. has shadow over this factor (Efe, 2002). Some other human activities in Abraka and its environ has in turn resulted to global warming. Some of these other activities include the use of generator sets, fumes from automobile vehicles and factory buildings, indiscriminate dumping of waste/refuse etc. Most of the farm products that are being produced at Abraka P.O, are being affected due to the adverse effect of human activities as most of the plant are being poorly produced as a result of too much high temperature in that part of Abraka. These substances (Fumes from factory building, generator sets, motor vehicles, tricycles and motorcycles) have also caused air pollution and also increased the temperature of the region there by causing Global Warming. This is as a result of increase in the numbers of building structures and warm air conditioners that adds warmth to the surroundings, much pollutes and radiate heat into the surrounding landscape and also turning of landscape into townscape also altered the natural environment. This alternation according to Efe (2002a and 2006) resulted in increased temperature of the urban canopy.</p> <p>          Similarly research efforts in the past years have focused mainly on education, economic activities, religion, political system, sporting activities, administrative divisions and other non geographical aspect of Abraka region. Virtually, as s result of intense research, it was discovered there has not been much emphasis laid on the effects of global warning in Abraka region, neither has interest been shown towards the idea.</p> <p>          In recent times there has been a call for periodic re-examination of the urban climate of tropical cities in order to have an update and compare the situation in these cities with that of other cities in the world (Lowry, 1998; Efe, 2004 and Adelekan, 2005). Based on these calls and with these numerous problems and the neglects associated with Abraka as an urban centre, the needs arises to carry out this study in order to find out how global warning has affected Abraka community in Delta State.</p> <p>          This study is also meant to truly point out the effects of global warning in Nigeria using Abraka region as a case study, including how urbanization and civilization has affected the climate of Abraka and its environs.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>          The study is aimed at evaluating global warming effects in Abraka, and specific objectives are to:</p> <p>1.   Identify the various climatic characteristics in Abraka</p> <p>2.   Discuss temperature trend over the years</p> <p>3.   Access the effects of anthropogenic/human activities on the climate of Abraka region</p> <p>4.   Examine the effects of global warming on the residents of Abraka</p> <p>5.   Offer suggestions to solve the problems associated with the effects of global warning in Abraka region and how to reduce adverse effect of urbanization on both human activities and climate.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>1.   Abraka has not experienced significant warming over the years</p> <p>2.   Human activities does not significantly affect the climate of Abraka region.</p> <p>3.   Global warning has no significant effects on the resident of Abraka.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study lies in all over the effects of human activities resulting to global warning within Abraka. The effects and the importance of human activities on climate cannot be over emphasized. It is to this effect that the study is aimed at informing the people of Abraka the extent to which human activities have resulted to global warming.</p> <p>          Hence effort must be put in a place to control human activities in order not to affect the climate of Abraka negatively, as if the climate of the study area is continued to be affected by the excess of human activities. There may be excess of rainfall which in turn might cause flooding in the area or there might be over increase in the temperature of the area which will in turn affect not only agricultural activities but other activities also that human’s depend upon for survival. It is therefore hoped that the result of this research work will go an extra mile to control global warming caused by human activities resulting to depletion of the ozone layer which have greatly affected the climate of Abraka region. The findings will also provide useful background information to future research in the contribution of geography towards nations.</p> <p><strong>1.6     STUDY AREA</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6.1  Location and Size</strong></p> <p>Abraka is located in the South-South zone of Nigeria. It is located in latitudes 050 471 and 050 501 North of the equator and longitudes 060001 and 060 081 East of the Greenwich Meridian. It is situated at the Eastern Bank of River Ethiope in Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria.</p> <p>          Abraka covers a total land area of 21.2 square kilometer (Ufuoma, 2000). In the North it is bounded by Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State, in the South, it is bounded by Ughelli Local Government Area of Delta State, in the East, it is bounded by Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State and in the west, it is bounded by Okpe Local Government Area of Delta State.</p> <p>          Abraka region is located in the Benin lowland (Udo, 1987). Abraka is in the Humid Tropical Climate with very high temperature between months of November and April. It may be as high as 250c to 310c.</p> <p>          Rainfall throughout the year is due to its location in the Niger Delta with monsoon wind continually blowing from the Atlantic Ocean. The wet and dry seasons are noticeable with annual rainfall between 2000mm to 3000mm.</p> <p><strong>Table 1.1</strong> Mean Monthly Rainfall Distribution (mm) in Abraka (1976-2005)</p> <p>J F M A M J J A S O N D Total 27 32 122.1 241.5 296.2 442.6 615.5 450.4 628.9 180.8 54.9 25.8 3097.8</p> <p>Source: Archive: Dept of Geography Weather Station: 1976-2005 (Efe, 2006)</p> <p><strong>Table 1.2</strong> Mean Monthly Temperature Distribution (0C) in Abraka (1976-2005)</p> <p>J F M A M J J A S O N D Mean 30.3 30.5 30.4 30.5 30.7 30.1 30.1 30.1 30 30.5 30.7 30.7 30.6</p> <p>Source: Archive: Dept of Geography Weather Station: 1976-2005 (Efe, 2006)</p> <p>Abraka as an urban area has experienced a rapid increase in size over the years, due to the presence of various administrative offices and governmental functions it performs both as the administrative and governmental functions. This is also as a result of the presence of the institution in the area. This attracts people from surrounding area, to itself, because of its employment opportunities and academic activities thus resulting in over-crowding, increased temperature, urban warming, among others leading to global warming.</p> <p><strong>1.6.2  Population of the Study Area</strong></p> <p>          There have been increases in the population of Abraka since 2005 when it was declared an urban centre by the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Urban Development (MLSUD), Asaba-Delta State. The population of Nigeria as a whole has been on the increase in recent times (Mabogunje, 1980). He gave two reasons; which are natural growth in the urban population and migration from other parts of the world. This can be attributed to Abraka region as it is one of the rapid urbanization towns in Nigeria due to the presence of tertiary institution. The presence of tertiary institution that have different programmes and other economic activities has been one of the major pull factors attracting people into Abraka and this has led to population explosion which contributed immensely to rapid economic and socio-economic development of Abraka urban. Apart from population growth the town has expanded from small town to an urban centre today engulfing the surrounding of Abraka rural due to its rapid urban development.</p> <p>The implication of these increase in size and population, is that it has led to population explosion in urban areas of Abraka which have in turn resulted in the alteration of the natural environment and its climate due to anthropogenic activates carried out in the area. This has in turn had adverse effect on the inhabitants of Abraka and its environs through global warming effects.</p> <p><strong>1.6.3  Climate</strong></p> <p>Abraka falls within the tropical environment that enjoys the tropical rainforest climate (AF) of Koppen in 1918 and the wet equatorial climate of Strahler in 1969. The climate is influenced by two masses; the tropical maritime air mass and tropical continental air mass. Abraka is region of the humid tropical climate with high temperature between the months of November and April with variation in temperature between 250c – 290c between April and October. The region of Abraka has an annual temperature of about 30.60c with a monthly mean temperature of 300c from September and 31.10c in June and July with an annual range in temperature between 30c and 50c. It is discovered in repeated studies that the average climatic rainfall in Abraka is about 2500mm annually. Abraka is placed into two seasons; the dry (Harmattan) and wet (rainy) season. However, Abraka experiences rainfall throughout the year owing to its location in the Niger Delta zone with the continual monsoon wind blowing from the Atlantic Ocean and also a continuous from shift in the Inter-Tropical Discontinuity (ITD) due to the movement of air masses.</p> <p>          The implication of these is that intense rise in temperature over the years have affected the inhabitants of Abraka through global warming effects.</p> <p><strong>1.6.4  Vegetation</strong></p> <p>Abraka is located on the equatorial rainforest which is evergreen forest and consist of three canopies of trees which are, the upper layer of which is about 60m tall, middle layer which is about 40m tall and the lower layer which is about 30m in height. The three major vegetation types in Abraka includes; the tropical rainforest belt, temperate grasslands and the grassland vegetation remains one of the key important factor which affect the climate of Abraka Region. Vegetation provides lumbering, medicinal purpose of Abraka region. The high amount of rainfall in Abraka aids the cultivation of crops like cassava and maize within the region. The influence of man has reduced the forest mainly to secondary growth (deciduous vegetation) due to agricultural practices and growing of various cash and food crops. This has in turn prone the environment direct sunlight which has resulted to intensive heating of the environment causing global warning due to lack of trees to act as shade and wind break.</p> <p>          The implication of these is that human activities have reduced the vegetation of Abraka to a secondary re-growth thereby exposing the environment to hazards such as intense temperature rise, flooding erosion, etc. which have in turn affected the inhabitants of Abraka through global warming effects.</p> <p><strong>1.6.5  Geology and Soils</strong></p> <p>Abraka is predominantly underlying sedimentary rock. Abraka lies in southern most sedimentary rock. Abraka lies in southern most sedimentary basis in Nigeria.</p> <p>          Abraka soil is acidic in nature. Abraka soil varies from coarse through medium to fine grained soils. The soils of Abraka can be said to be sandy loam. The colour of the soil is greenish brown to reddish brown and then to brown. The light grayish colouration characterizes the entire sandy portion of the soil, while the reddish brown colouration depicts the presence of ion oxide in the soil. This colouration depicts the availability of mineral matters and moisture. Abraka soil is poorly structured in relation to its type in terms of grain size, pore spaces which greatly influences the rate of percolation and capillarity, aeration and the rate of evaporation.</p> <p>          The implication of these is that human activities have exposed the soil to erosional activates and flooding making the soil inferity for agricultural acuities, etc. which have in turn affected the inhabitants of Abraka region who rely on farming for their source of livelihood.</p> <p><strong>1.6.6  Relief and Drainage System</strong></p> <p>          Abraka and its environs are drained by two major rivers, River Ethiope and River Ovwuvwe.</p> <p>          Most communities in Abraka are located in the upland in between these Rivers. The drainage pattern of River Ethiope is dentritic in nature. These rivers serves as recreational and tourist centers, major sources of water to the populace, mining sites for sand stones, religious activities and agricultural activities just to mention but a few.</p> <p>          Abraka and its environs lies within the low land area of Nigeria, with 50m above sea level. Also, it is only about 45km from the coast of Nigeria. Abraka has a low relief of gentle hilly flat surface with an anticline nature i.e. having an elevation of less than or equal to 60 which in the north shell can also be linked ion classification with the interior coastal landmass of western Nigeria.</p> <p>          The porous nature of the Abraka soil coupled with the undulating landform absorbs much heat which radiates to the atmosphere thereby altering the climate of the area which may be responsible for high temperature in Abraka resulting to global warming.</p> <p><strong>1.6.7  Socio-economic Activities</strong></p> <p>The government of Ethiope East and Delta State at large has in recent time embarked on rehabilitation of existing, socio-economic, infrastructure such as roads, portable water, rural electrification, educational facilities, health facilities, stadium and other socio amenities. The government have areas such as revolutionalized changes and improvement in areas such as Education, Health, Agriculture, cooperative movement, commerce and market development, industrialization, Youth and sports development, etc. Town Unions, Private Individuals and associations, being part of voluntary agencies, have played active roles in the development of educational infrastructure, tourism and recreational facilities in the region.</p> <p>          In terms of transportation, the tricycle mode of transportation in Abraka has aided not only in the facilitation of movement of people and information but also in provision of employment, income and increases the standard of living of both motorcyclist, tricyclist and commercial transports.</p> <p>          In terms of commerce, the Abraka region entails sales of varieties of food crops which are produced locally such as yam, plantain, banana etc. alongside none food products. The physical structure of the Abraka market (Centre of Commerce) and other neigbouring stores being poorly planned has really affected the rate of commerce with regard to drainage, indiscriminate waste disposal at market site which has a resultant effect on the health standard of food crops for consumption sold in the market. This mismanaged waste produce heat which makes the environment inhabitable and thus results in the alteration of the climate which brings about global warming.</p> <p>          In terms of its settlement, Abraka is characterized with primary and secondary settlement. Primary settlement includes residential buildings, hospitals, health care centres and schools while secondary settlements are hostels, filling stations, factories etc. There is no doubt today that settlement pattern and characteristics has played a major role in the socio-economic development of Abraka region and have over the years boast the socio-economic activities of the region.</p> <p>          The people of Abraka region practice both subsistence and commercial agriculture in which food and cash crops are produced. They engage in mixed cropping and crop rotation farming method as their major type of agricultural practices. Over the years, agriculture has provided food, employment, sources of income, etc. to the inhabitants of Abraka region.</p> <p>          Generally speaking, the enormous emotion of poisonous gases and substances from motor vehicles, engines, tricycles etc into the atmosphere has polluted the environment and altered the climate of the area thereby resulting to global warming.</p> <p><strong>1.7     Scope/Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is restricted to the influence of urbanization on climate with emphasis on the effects of global warming in Nigeria using Abraka as a case study. The project is also restricted to some selected areas of study: these include Abraka P.O (Urban area of study), Ekrerejeta, Abraka Inland (rural area of study), Ajalomi, Erho, Oria, Urhuovie, Ugono and a control rural area (such as Umeghe and Urhagbesa).</p> <p>          However, this research work was limited by number of factors, amongst which are finance, time and physical constraints. But these constraints did not deprive the researcher from reaching dependable results.</p> <p><strong>1.8     Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>·         <strong>Global warming:- </strong>The increase in temperature of the earth’s atmosphere, that is caused by the increase of particular gases especially carbon dioxide.</p> <p>·         <strong>Green House Gas Effect:- </strong>The problem of the gradual rise in temperature of the earth’s atmosphere, caused by an increase of gases such as carbon dioxide in the air surrounding the earth, which trap the heat of the sun.</p> <p>·         <strong>Climate:- </strong>The synthesis of weather over 30yers at a particular time within a given location.</p> <p>·         <strong>Weather:- </strong>The state of the atmosphere at a particular point in time within a given location.</p> <p>·         <strong>Climate Change:</strong>- The alteration or variation of climate from its original state when studied for a long time.</p> <p>·         <strong>Environment:</strong>- The surrounding around man in space.</p> <p>·         <strong>Town:</strong>- Large settlement usually harbouring thousand of facilities.</p> <p>·         <strong>Urban Area:- </strong>Characteristics of a city.</p> <p>·         <strong>Rural Area:- </strong>An area normally called a village infrastructure- foundation of a system to develop a place heads together.</p> <p>·         <strong>Community:- </strong>Body of people living in the same area.</p> <p>·         <strong>Temperature:</strong>- The degree of hotness or coldness of a human body.</p> <p>·         <strong>Relief:</strong>- The nature and terrain of a area.</p> <p>·         <strong>Development:</strong>- To increase or grow gradually.</p> <p>·         <strong>Growth:</strong>- An increase in the size, amount or degree of something.</p> <p>·         <strong>Gas:</strong>- Any substance like air that is neither a solid nor a liquid.</p> <p>·         <strong>Effect:</strong>- A change that something or somebody causes in something or somebody else.

The analysis revealed that residents are of high density zone with their occupation of householders being served as basis for establishing status. It assumes that the status of a person translates into his earning, which also influences his choice of location and type of housing to reside. During the research, it was discovered  that most residents live in inadequate housing that lack basic infrastructure and facilities. The high density neighborhoods are unplanned and unsafe with poor sanitary condition. The condition of the neighborhoods allows us to conclude that such locations have suffered long neglect by government with respect to infrastructure development, provision of social amenities, and enforcement of development control standards. Based on the findings, the study proffered appropriate recommendations that there is need for policy of providing public housing for the low-income earners in Jos Plateau and as well as implement urban renewal programme for the area.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION...............................................................................1</p> <p>1.1 Background of

ON FLOODS</b><br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>The study examined the effects of drainage networks on floods in Calabar metropolis, Nigeria. The rapid increase in urbanization without corresponding infrastructures in the city of Calabar has led to increased incidences of flood as the available drainage channels cannot contend with the volume of storm water. In view of this, the study established gauging stations for the measurement of drainage run off using measuring steel tape. And the volume of flood water was measured using stop watch method (Velocity of flow) and copies of questionnaire were administered to 400 households proportionally to the seven sample units. In view of the study objectives, it determine the relationship between drainage width and depth and floods. In addition, varied descriptive statistics tools were used to give a spot on assessment and understanding of the variables of interest. In view of the response of the gauging and physical measurement, it was established that Calabar experience heavy rainfall due to poor drainage facilities The result revealed that about 47% of the respondents said flood occur every year in their zone and 41.75% said it occurred most parts of the year. The frequency of flood is compounded with it’s intensity as over 59% of the sampled population agreed that flood of the sampled population agreed that flood intensity is very high in Calabar. The result further showed that the factors of flood occurrence in the study area is linked to heavy rainfall (26.3%), inadequate drainage channel (22%) poor physical planning (15.5%) among others. On the perceived causes of inadequate drainage channel, the result indicated that abuse of land use plans (28.7%) was a major factor followed by poor monitoring and evaluation of project (21.5%). the study also revealed that the drainage were very narrow and shallows as shown in frequent floods in the city. The incessant flood often leads to water inundating compounds (64.5%), preventing people from going out (11.25%), distortion of the scenic beauty of the environment (6.25%), landslide (4.75%). Based on these findings, the study recommended that since Calabar is located in a tropical zone characterized by heavy rainfall the government should take proactive measure to mitigate storm water. The present drainage systems should be cleared with shovel by the people on a regular basis to allow for a free flow of storm water. State department of town planning should live up to their bidding by ensuring total compliance to urban ordinance to forestall incessant floods and destruction of properties in the city of Calabar.<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Cities the world over are the dominating forces in the organization of human population.<br/>As the world most crowded places, cities continue to show increase in urban population. This increase leads to a growing urbanization trend. Duru and Nnaji (2008) defined urbanization as the increase in the population of cities in proportion to the region‟s rural population.<br/>Urbanization is the outcome of social, economic and political developments that lead to concentration and growth of large cities, changes in land use and transformation from rural to metropolitan pattern of organization and governance. Rapid growth of towns and cities has been common feature of the developing world (Aderamo, 2008).<br/>Although urbanization is the driving force for modernization, economic growth and development, there is increasing concern about the effects of expanding cities, principally on human health, livelihoods and the environment. The implications of rapid urbanization and demographic trends for employment, food security, water supply, shelter and sanitation, especially the disposal of wastes (solid and liquid) that the cities produce are staggering (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, 1992). The process of urbanization is believed to be connected with levels of development and some assert that, for a country to develop there is the need for an increased level of industrialization as it is generally accepted that there cannot be urbanization without rapid economic growth (Tettey, 2005). The pattern of urbanization in developing countries, particularly Africa, however, is creating some concern that it may be generating a lot of development problems in the process of its growth.<br/>\n\nEFFECTIVENESS OF DRAINAGE NETWORKS ON FLOODS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTIVENESS OF DRAINAGE NETWORKS ON FLOODS", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECT OF PRECIPITATION EFFECTIVENESS INDICES ON THE YIELD OF SOME SELECTED CEREAL CROPS</b><br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>Agriculture in Nigeria is mainly dependent on rainfall which is variable in nature. Therefore, the need to have a full knowledge of its pattern and trend is pertinent in order to achieve food sufficiency. This study examined the effect of precipitation effectiveness indices: Onset date, cessation date, length of rainy season and occurrence of pentad dry spells (5, 10 and ≤15) days on the yield of millet, sorghum, rice and maize in Sokoto State, between 1993 and 2008. Walter‟s 1967 method was used to derive the selected precipitation effectiveness indices while dry spell parameters, was derived in pentads. Crop yield data in (ton/ha) and the selected precipitation effectiveness indices wereharmonised using log10 method. Trendline and linear trendline equations where fitted to show the direction of change. While simple correlation was used to analyse the relationship between crop yield and the selected precipitation indices. Furthermore, regression analysis was used to determine to what extent the selected precipitation effectiveness indices influence the yield of the selected crops. The findings revealed that the trend of these precipitation effectiveness indices are characterized by marked “noises” and variability.<br/>Additionally, onset dates of rainfall are arriving earlier while cessation dates are arriving latter. Consequently the length of rainy season is increasing. Dry spells of 5 days is common while dry spell incidents of 10 days and ≤15 consecutive days is decreasing. Similarly rice and maize yield are increasing, due to early onset date of rains. The regression summary shows that the selected precipitation effectiveness indices account for only 52.1%, 50.4%, 52.1% and 68% of yield variation in maize, millet, rice and sorghum respectively. The study therefore, recommends government support for farmers to increase the cultivation of rice and maize in the study area, and the introduction of more crop varieties that are tolerant to dry spells of 5 consecutive days.<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>The limit to the productive capacity of land resources are set by climate, as climatic variability constitutes a major constraint to agricultural production especially in developing countries. However, adequate knowledge of climatic parameters minimizes climatic constraint to food production (Farajzedah et.al., 2012).<br/>The world population is projected to continue increasing well into the present century. The primary question is whether and how global food production may be increased to provide for the population expansion. It will be necessary to increase current level of food production more than proportional to the population growth so as to meet human demand in food production. The major source of water available either for agriculture or for human consumption is the rain that falls on the Earth Surface. Subsequently, the primary source for agricultural production for most of the world is rainfall. Hence, a detailed knowledge of the rainfall at a place is an important prerequisite for agricultural planning and management. More so, for rain-fed agriculture, rainfall is the single most important Argo-meteorological variable influencing crop production in the tropics (Ravindran, 2010).<br/>The most important characteristics of rainfall are, Onset Date (OD), Cessation Date (CD), Length of Rainy Season (LRS), Mean Annual Precipitation (MAR), Hydrological Ratio (HR), number of Rainy Days (RD), Rainfall Intensity (RI), Specific Water Consumption (SWC), rainfall in months of the growing season (May, June, July, August and September), Seasonality Index (SI), Index of Replicability, and Pentad Dry Spells.<br/><br/>\n\nEFFECT OF PRECIPITATION EFFECTIVENESS INDICES ON THE YIELD OF SOME SELECTED CEREAL CROPS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF PRECIPITATION EFFECTIVENESS INDICES ON THE YIELD OF SOME SELECTED CEREAL CROPS", "id": 24}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF CHILD LABOUR</b><br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>Child labour participation is inimical, contrary to the Rights of the Child, and threatens holistic child development, the families, State and the nation at large. This study assesses the demographic and socio-economic consequences of child labour in Anambra State, Nigeria. The objectives were to examine the type of work engaged in by the children, determine the factors responsible for child labour practices, identify the condition of work, assess the demographic and socio-economic consequences of child labour and lastly ascertain the specific possible impact of child labour on future workforce in the state. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the sampled areas in the study area as well as the respondents. A total of 400 children aged between 04-17 years, who are involved in laborious activities were administered a structured questionnaires to collect data. In addition, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather information from child labourers employers. The data wasanalysed using computer SPSS software 19 version. The results are presented using tables and chats.The results indicated that 53.0% of the child labourers are males, child labour participation is found to be higher among older children aged 11-17 years than those aged 4-10. More than half of child labourersare from large household size of 5-9 persons. Out of the entire child labourers, 42.5% are indigenes of Anambra State and 35.0% from Ebonyi State, while the remaining hails from the other surrounding States. Educational status of child labourers shows that 56.5% are in school, while 43.5% are out of school, public school children are the most affected as 77.0% are in public schools, with 66.0% in primary school levels. Out of the entire sampled respondent, 174 (43.5%) are out of school, out of which 95.4% dropped out from school, while 4.6% have never been to school before. Poverty of parents accounted for the major reasons for child‟s school drop outs. About 73.5% of the child labourers work between 4-6 days a week. Most of the children (71.8%) spend more than 7 hours at work. On the working condition of the respondents, the study found that 50.0% of the child labourers work on temporal basis and the remaining work on either contract or permanent basis, 72.5% starts work at age between 4-10 years, the highest earned monthly income by the children is between ₦ 2001-₦ 2500, 64.5% eats twice daily. The study found that 83.5% of the child labourers have encountered various types of dangers relating to the type of work they do. For instance as much as 42.5% have been physically assaulted, more worrisome is the fact that 44.0% and 20.0% have participated in social vices of such as alcohol drinking and drug abuse respectively, while 51.0% suffers from low self-esteem and 25.0% from alienation from friends/family/relation and as much as 87.0% have encountered health related challenges. The finding generally shows that household poverty which is caused by child‟s parent‟s low educational attainment and low occupational status accounted for the major reason why children joins labourious activities either to complement the family income or to pay school fees. The study therefore concludes that for child labour incidence to be curbed there is the need to empower parents with education and soft loans to enhance their business since majority of the parents are involved in various types of businesses, this expected to go a long way in reducing household poverty in the state. There is also the need to introduce a free and compulsory primary and secondary education for children of school going ages in the state as it will help to motivate the children to concentrate in school rather than combining school attendance with work due to the need to complement the school fees, which results to, reduced attendance, grade repetitions and the subsequent school withdrawal.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background to the Study<br/>According to the Child Right's Act 2003, passed into law in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja, a child is a person who has not attained the age of eighteen years. On the other hand, labour according to Macmillan dictionary connotes the aggregate of all human physical and mental effort used in creation of goods and services. Put together, the concept of Child Labour has probably been in existence almost as long as the history of mankind and connotes all economic activities carried out by children regardless of their occupational status (Oloko, 1997). It includes both works that are permissible under the International Labour Organization's (ILO) conventions and that which is not (International Labour Organization-International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour) (ILO-IPEC, 2002). According to United Nation Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) (2007) Child labour is essentially understood as encompassing monetary or non-monetary activities which are mentally or physically, morally or socially hazardous for children below 15 years.<br/>Across countries and societies, various forms of child labour exists these forms range from trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, child domestic labour and illicit activities. Other forms include street hawking, waste pickers, company labourers, apprentices, babysitting, barrow pushers and commercial drivers/ conductors/ touts, water vendors, farm workers, house maids, gardeners, cleaners, and other artisans. Some of which are done on contract basis, whereas, some are considered as free services to guardians or relatives who in return pays back in cash or kind to the child or the child‟s parent all of which are hazardous to child overall development (Oloko, 1997)..\n\nDEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF CHILD LABOUR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF CHILD LABOUR", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ASSESSMENT OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>The study sought to evaluate the challenges and opportunities for effective community participation in rural development projects in Nigeria usingin Sapele LGA, Delta state as our case study, and in turn to test the credibility of the popularized supposition that almost all contemporary development efforts characteristically embrace local participation.

However, despite strategies put in place in form of projects provided for rural people, many do not benefit because of their non-involvement in the project planning process and implementation hence, the emphasis on community participation in rural development project. Rural development is more realistic when people participate in the process of infrastructure provision because at the heart of rural development projects are infrastructures and for the overall goals and objectives to be met, the principle for effective community participation must be adapted (Idachaba and Bankole, 2006). Community participation as a development approach for rural socioeconomic development is an alternative to the top – down approach which has failed to yield the desired result because rural dwellers who are target beneficiaries were not carried along initially (Bankole, 2007). The term has been conceptualized in different ways in the literature as either public, people or citizen participation, however they all have the same focus, which is rural development (Oakley, 1991 and Afolayan, 2008). Participation is all about inclusiveness, social justice and common good which shows that rural development is community based when people in communities determine their needs and aspiration. The concept of local or community participation in development gained prominence in development discourse in the 1970s and since then literature on the subject has grown significantly, it was through the influence of Paolo Freire’s work on the concept of conscientization and analysis of the structural obstacles to the development of Latin American peasantry which stressed the dialogical approach to project work. His argument was that the peasant should be the subject and not the object of development, and this orientation helped affirm the importance of participation. Notably, according to Catanese (1984:124), the idea of community participation in planning had been a long standing and intrinsic part of the history of planning. Thus this words “participation‟ and “participatory‟ development (Rahnema, 1997:117) appeared for the first time in the development jargon during the late 1950s, Stiefel and Wolfe (1994:21) hold that the term popular participation entered into the international discourse on development during the 1960s and became most prevalent in the 1970s, especially in respect of the field of rural development. Thus at this time local participation became a major concern for United Nations agencies such as International Labor Organization (ILO); the World Health Organization (WHO); the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO); the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (Oakley and Marsden, 1994:14). For example, the FAO identified participation as central to future strategies to tackle rural underdevelopment and more specifically, to realize the success of the Small Farmer Development Programme (SFDP) in Nepal launched in 1980, which included the People‟s Participation Programme (PPP) (Bortei-Doku, 1991:61). Since then, many resources have gone into the promotion of participation in rural development. Participation seemed to gain ground again in the 1990s with the hopes that it would emancipate people from the bedeviling crises of their collapsing livelihoods (Maser, 1997:12). This revival was marked by the International Conference on Popular Participation in the Recovery and Development Process in Africa which was held in Arusha, Tanzania in 1990. In the opening statement, of this conference, Adedeji was quoted as saying: “The democratization of the development process, by which we mean the empowerment of the people, their involvement in decision making, in implementation and monitoring process is a condition sine qua non for socio-economic recovery and transformation. African leadership and African people must not desire self reliance but must will it” (Shaw, 1990:20)<br/>The incorporation of the local people in development projects has become a common phenomenon which almost every organization claims to embrace. . However, this acknowledgement seems biased since it has not been the case with “every‟ organization. For instance, at a macro level, the Economic Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP) for most developing countries was alleged by Kanyenze (2004:106) to be a mere imposition by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund which was deficient of local input hence their failure. The concept originated after it was realized that the top-down approach to development did not achieve its developmental goals, which were often very specific material outcomes, and this in turn may have been linked to the lack of inclusion of those people for whom these outcomes were designed (Brohman, 1996). This can be exemplified by the case of USAID which Chiome and Gambahaya (2000) showed as a clear illustration of the negative effects of the domineering role of development agents. In this context it constructed pit latrine toilets in a Bangladesh community without consultations and consent from the local community with the intention of preventing what the implementing agent foresaw as a potential hub for dieses outbreak since the community used to defecate in their rice fields. These efforts by the agent were futile since they were met with violent resistance from the community, which responded by destroying the toilets arguing that it was their cultural practice to use their rice fields as toilets for the sake of increasing productivity. In this context the agent did not consult the community in the first place and this is why the community did not take part and instead destroyed the constructed structures in protestation. Therefore, the current development efforts have been recommended to embrace local or community participation if they are to depart from repetition of the domineering and exclusivist orientation that characterized past development approaches and their negative effects. However, even though the discourse on participation has been widely accepted and emphasized as a feasible substitute for the unwarranted relegation of the local people in implementation of development initiatives, the rapid proliferation of the term and its myriad applications have sparked a great deal of debate and controversy (Chambers, 1992; Brohman; 1996). Consequently this served as a stimulus for more critical enquiry of the concept in the contemporary epoch as is the preoccupation of this particular research. Furthermore, despite its wide acceptance as a useful approach to rural development, Makumbe (1998) submits that its proclamation has been more rhetorical than it has been practical inasmuch as there have been overwhelming evidence of limited cooperation from local people due to their marginalization from participation in its proper sense, a case in point is the Bangladesh case alluded to by Chiome and Gambahaya (2000) above. As such, the concept of community participation has remained a key theme in development discourse for the past few decades, yet a variety of literature alleges that there is no significant transformation from development agents‟ notions of the local people as passive recipients of predesigned development projects (Makumbe, 1998; Kanyenze, 2004). During the preceding decades, African countries and many others in the developing world have witnessed an unparalleled surge in programs and projects aimed at providing solutions to development woes that have been troubling them (Howard, 1998). Conversely, these efforts have remained in vain since they have left out the „victims‟ in the identification, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects aimed at averting their fate (Kottack, 2001). Coetzee, 2001 further notes that this logjam has precipitated from the failure of these programs to include analyses of social and cultural phenomena, which influence the relationship between people and development. Awori (1996:1) have noted that, fundamentally lacking in these approaches has been the peoples‟ dimension which incorporates their indigenous knowledge, experiences, technologies, aspirations, skills, wisdom, culture and local governance systems. This is best explained by the reasons why USAID failed in Bangladesh and ESAP failed in most developing countries as alluded to above by Chiome and Gambahaya (2000) and Kanyenze (2004).<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The research is premised on the understanding that the concept of community participation as widely advocated for by the participatory development paradigm has not lived up to its billing of ensuring the practical and meaningful involvement of the local people in development projects in rural communities. It is clear from evidence in the literature that the concept has not brought the results expected of it due to marginalization of intended beneficiaries from partaking. In fact, community participation has been largely rhetorical and has remained elusive in the realm of practice in rural development projects. Not with standing its theoretical popularity in the discourse of participatory development, the concept has been over-rated and oversold by development agents and governments in developing countries. These have fallen into the trap of taking the phrase participatory development at face value yet in pragmatic terms it has grossly been deficient in project implementation. What is even more salient is the realization that, community participation exercises are gradually and explicitly degenerating into distanced undertakings where ordinary people have mostly become recipients of pre-designed programmes, often a product of administrative manipulation. It would seem to mean that development agents are determined to impose their own version and understanding of community participation on particular communities (Brohman, 1996: 34). Therefore, it is against such a setup that the research aims to untie and redefine the concept of community participation as it relates to decision making in selection, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of development projects by the targeted beneficiaries, through exploring the challenges that could be militating against these realms of participation. The study sought to review community participation with the view to suggest specific remedies to inform more meaningful forms of engagement, dialogue and empowerment at local level. The research, therefore, shall evaluate whether the nature of community engagement in Sapele LGA, Delta State is promotive of local participation and suggest numerous conceptual and practical steps that development agents and the local people should adhere to if otherwise, for the institutionalization of effective involvement of local people in development initiative<br/>1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The research’s primary aim is<br/>    To ascertain the meaning and practice of community participation in current rural development efforts.<br/>    To elicit the challenges faced by development organizations and local residents in effective participation in development projects.<br/>    To assess the extent to which it is possible to institutionalize effectively community participation and consequently account for the challenges and prospects of such efforts to directly involve the local people in development endeavors.<br/>    To make recommendations on the solutions to problems encountered in community participation in rural development projects.<br/>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES<br/>HYPOTHESIS ONE<br/>Hi: There is no significant relationship between community participation and project planning process and implementation or result.<br/>Ho: There is a significant relationship between community participation and project planning process and implementation or result.<br/>HYPOTHESIS TWO<br/>Hi: Community participation is not an effective tool for rural development projects.<br/>Ho: Community participation is an effective tool for rural development projects.<br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Wilcox (1996) had noted that although the concept of community participation has virtually moved to mainstream development since the mid-1980s, many attempts at institutionalizing community participation have been characterized by partial success, because development practitioners are often unclear about where and which level of participation is feasible. However, suffice it to say that bringing communities to „talk about a community project is necessary, but not sufficient for communities to realize project gains (Kottack, 1998: 67). Therefore, participation is most likely to be effective when the different interests groups in a project are satisfied with the level at which they are involved. This research is aimed at exploring this gap to obtain the opinions of communities about what participation means to them – where and at what level participation should occur? This will then be useful to ascertain conditions that might promote or inhibit communities from attaining the full benefits of participation. The findings and recommendations could be used in rural development planning and implementation of rural development strategies. This particular research would be helpful in casting light on the nature of participation in this particularly community. This would ascertain whether the participation is active or passive, direct or indirect and voluntary or coerced. Besides, the research would also bear a positive effect in enlightening the community of its need to be directly part of activities that affect its wellbeing in the long run. It would also appraise the scant studies of community participation which have previously focused on the impact of participation on the overall project outcome and overlooking the need to ascertain whether there is that participation in the first place. As a consequence, this could be a positive point of departure for any endeavors to influence the nature of community engagement towards a more participatory orientation.<br/>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>This study attempted to assess community participation in rural development projects in Sapele LGA, Delta state.<br/>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows Chapter one is concerned with the introduction, which consist of the (overview, of the study), historical background, statement of problem, objectives of the study, research hypotheses, significance of the study, scope and limitation of the study, definition of terms and historical background of the study.

The management of solid wastes in recent time has become a very big challenge. The problem of waste generation, handling and disposal has reached a disturbing level in Nigerian urban centers. The study analyzed domestic solid waste management strategies in Tunga, Chanchaga Local Government, Niger State, Nigeria. This was achieved through characterizing the types of domestic solid wastes generated in the study area, examining the domestic solid waste management strategies employed in the study area, identifying the key players in domestic solid waste management in the study area, examining the frequency of waste generated and waste disposed and ascertaining the effectiveness of the domestic solid waste management strategies employed in the study area. The primary data used in this study was obtained by direct field observations, questionnaire administration, oral interviews, images and photos of the study area. 327 out of 2040 households were sampled. The research questions were answered using tables of frequencies and percentages, bar and pie charts, Chi Square and Kruskal Wallis tests. The results showed that the kinds of domestic solid wastes generated in the study area were mainly organic, paper, plastic, old and rusted metals and textile wastes. The domestic solid waste management strategies in place were burning, open dumping and burying, with open dumping being the most common domestic solid waste management strategy practiced in the study area (about 72%). The key players involved in the management of solid wastes were the government and individual households. The daily generation of waste (about 74%) exceeded the daily disposal of wastes (about 49%) in the study area. 63% of the respondents reported that burning of domestic solid waste is effective, 84% reported that burying domestic solid wastes is effective while 14% reported that open dumping of domestic solid wastes is effective. The Chi Square analysis showed a significant difference between the frequency of wastes generated and waste disposed in the study area with an alpha value of 0.01, while the Kruskal Wallis H test showed no significant difference in the effectiveness of the domestic solid waste management strategies in the study area (α=0.646). The findings of this study showed that the methods of waste management adopted in the study area do not conform to sustainable waste management practices. This implies that much attention has not been given to domestic solid waste management in the study area. The study thus recommended Public Enlightenment and Education on issues of waste management and a better public awareness strategy on the subject matter, Increase in Waste Collection Frequency and the adoption of composting as a method of waste management since majority of the domestic solid waste generated is organic in nature.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Waste  management  is  a  global  environmental  challenging  issue  that  is  severe<br/>especially in developing countries where increased urbanization, poor planning and lack of adequate resources contribute to the poor state of Municipal Solid waste management (Mwanthi et al, 1997). Proper management of solid waste has been established to be critical to the health and well being of urban residents (World Bank, 2013).<br/>According to the Federal Ministry of Environment waste is any damaged or useless material produced during or left over from human activities. The United Kingdom Environmental protection Board (1990), defines waste as any substance, a scrap material or an effluent or other unwanted surplus substance arising from the application of any process\n\nANALYSIS OF DOMESTIC SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF DOMESTIC SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN ANALYSIS OF THE DOMESTIC WATER DEMAND AND SUPPLY</b><br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>Water is one of the basic human need and imperative for sustaining quality of life on earth. However, its unbalance and unmanaged used make it scarce. This study analyzes the Domestic Water Demand and Supply in Ilorin metropolis, Kwara State. Focuses on the analysis of the sources of water resource in Ilorin, assessing factors affecting water demand and supply and their relationship. The methodology involve the use of questionnaires and interview method to gather necessary information from the state water Board and result gathered from the study area. The study was carried out through the use of structured questionnaire which was administered. Two hundred and fifty (250) questionnaires were filled correctly. On the part of water Board questionnaire were correctly filled and returned. Random sampling was employed. The questionnaires were used to solicit information from a sample of respondents. The analytic techniques involve both the descriptive and inferential statistics such as frequency distribution, sample percentage and correlation analysis. Therefore it was deduced from the analysis that consumption and supply are 124.0 liters and 190.2 liters respectively per person per day. The conclusion from the result of correlation coefficient (1.9996) that there exists very high positive linear relationship between the household water demand and water supplied by the kwara State Water Board. The women and children are particularly vulnerable when water is short supply. Bursting of pipe, poor management, topography of an area, water wastage coupled with bias in water supply have been some of the factors influencing water supply. The study recommends that there should be concerted effort by both water users 9demand) and supplier to control water wastage so as to achieve the goal.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Water is essential to life and its supply, consumption and spatial distribution are closely<br/>associated with economic growth and the development of society. Apart from air, water is indispensable to life it is a foundation for human prosperity because adequate and high quality water supplies provide a basis for the growth and development of human social, economic and culture of people (Ward, 1975, Young, 2006). The importance of water to man cannot be overemphasized, it holds the most important benefit to man‟s sustenance beside shelter, food and clothing (Ajadi, 1996)<br/>According to Amin and Mahmud, (2011) it is recognized all over the world that water is a vital resource to human existence and that is a major factor in commanding the progress of civilization.<br/>Water is essential in sustaining quality of life on earth, the sustainability of socially sensitive goods such as water depends on effective and efficient use of available water resources. Amin and Mahmud, (2011) also reported that the extensive use of water has increased globally and the efficacy of supply side measure is questionable owing to drastic increase in population, technological advancement and economic growth; the demand for water supplies is continuously increasing, numerous researchers have emphasized on water demand management rather than the supply side management. The water demand study in relation to water supply enables us to estimate how much the increase in demand for water supplies.<br/>Water demand is the quantity that the treatment plant produce in order to meet all water needs in the community. Water demand includes water delivered to the system to meet the need of consumers, water supply for fire fighting and system flushing. On the other hand water supply refers to system for the collection, transmission, treatment, storage and distribution of water Admassu M.

Even for skeptics,  events such as prolonged dry seasons, long rainfall durations and excessively long Harmattan periods are worrying.  More and more people are getting to ask about what can be done to minimize the impact of the change. <br/>  The Inter-government Panel on climate change (IPPC, 2007) defined climate change as statistically significant variations in climate that persist for an extended period, typically decades or longer. It includes shifts in the frequency and magnitude of sporadic weather events as well as the slow continuous rise in global mean surface temperature.<br/>Climate change is a change in climate that is attributable directly or indirectly to human activities. It affects the atmospheric conditions of the earth thereby leading to global warming. According to Raymond and Victoria (2008), climate change has the potential to affect all natural systems thereby becoming a threat to human development and survival socially, politically and economically. Interest in this issue has motivated a substantial body of research on climate cha- nge and agriculture over the past decade (Fischer, et al., 2002; Darwin, 2004; Lobell, et al., 2008; Nelson, et al. 2009). Climate change is expected to influence crop production, hydrologic balances, input supplies and other components of agricultural systems. However, the changes occur due to variation in different climatic parameters such as cloud cover, precipitation, temperature and increase in Green House Gases (GHG's) emission through human activities. Adverse impacts of climate change in Nigeria include frequent drought, increased rural-urban migration, increased biodiversity loss, depletion of wild and other natural resource base, changes in vegetation types, increased health risk and the spread of infectious diseases and changing livelihood systems (Abaje and Giwa, 2007; Hassan and Nhemachena, 2008).<br/>Of Nigeria's 923,768km2 land size, 34% is occupied by crops, 23% by grassland and 16% by forests, approximately 13% is rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and the remaining 14% fall under other uses according to Ajayi (2009). Also, small scale farm holdings predominate in Nigeria, accounting for about 94% of the agricultural output (Ajayi, 2009). Agriculture employs over 70% of the population, contributes about 41% of GDP, accounts for 5% total export and provides 88% of non-oil earnings. Besides, almost all sectors of agriculture which are crop production, livestock farming, pastoralism, fishery etc. depend on climate whose variability have meant that local farmers who implement their regular annual farm business plans risk total failure due to climate change effects (Ozor et al, 2010). The conditions emanating from climate change are bound to compromise agricultural productions (crop, livestock, forest and fishery resources), nutritional and health statuses, trading in agricultural commodities, human settlements especially of agricultural communities, tourism and recreation among others (Tologbonse, et al. 2010) Nigeria like all the countries of sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (IPCC, 2007). Despite the fact that efforts have been made towards fighting climate change from scientific views, research and policies directed towards indigenous knowledge and perception are highly needed. Understanding of local perception is useful in assessing the true implications of changing climate. Therefore there is the need to gain as much information as possible, and learn the positions of rural farmers and their needs, about what they know about climate change, in order to offer adaptation practices that meet these needs.<br/>Climate change is a major challenge to agricultural development in Africa and the world at large. Ziervogel, et al. 2006 noted that climate change, which is attributable to natural climate cycle and human activities, has adversely affected agricultural productivity in Africa, making Agriculture one of the sectors most vulnerable to climate change impact in Africa, as observed by Falaki et al 2013, the impact of climate is more where agriculture is rain fed and essential for the daily existence such in Nigeria.Zoellick 2009 stated that, as the planet warms, rainfall patterns shift, and extreme events such as drought, floods and forest fires become more frequent. This results in poor and unpredictable yields, thereby making farmers more vulnerable, particularly in Africa (UNFCCC, 2007). Across Nigeria, millions of people are already experiencing changing seasonal patterns of rainfall and increased heat. Climate therefore determines to a large extent availability of water which impacts health and ultimately the level of poverty among Nigerians. Agriculture places heavy burden on the environment in the process of providing humanity with food and fiber while climate is the primary determinant of agricultural productivity. Given the fundamental role of agriculture in human welfare, concern has been expressed by federal agencies and others regarding the potential effects of climate change on agricultural productivity.                                                                                                  <br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem<br/>Climate change is a serious challenge to socio economic developments even in the developed countries of the world. In Nigeria and other parts of Africa, agriculture occupies a critical position particularly in food production and generation of employment. A significant proportion of actors in the agricultural sectors are however, likely to have little or no idea about climate change because of their level of awareness Thus although they suffer more of the impact of climate change, they probably do not know the depth of what is happening to the system. There is therefore a need to gain an understanding of farmers’ perception of climate change so that they can be appropriately targeted in climate change response actions. <br/>Human perception of environmental issues have been broadly categorized as cognitive (related to knowledge and understanding), affective (related to feelings, attitudes and emotions), behavioural (related to changes in behaviour of the viewer) and physiological (biological or physical effects on the observer's body) Zube, et al, 1982.<br/>However, perception decides over resource allocation, without perceiving the risk adequately all other determents seem meaningless. The effects of climate change leads to land degradation which reduces the quality and productivity and manifest throughout the country while in the southern part of Nigeria, the problem is coastal erosion and flooding, in the Sahelian zone of north, the most pronounced climate changed related reforms of land degradation are wind erosion and related sand dune formation, drought and desertification, sheet erosion which results to the complete removal of arable land is Nigeria's biggest threat to agriculture especially in the sandy soils regions of south-eastern Nigeria.<br/>Perception determines the social mental picture of climate change. But a number of other variables like socio-demographic and socio-economic factors or ideological orientations, awareness level, information source influence perception and the mental picture of climate change (Sjoberg, 1995; Stedman, 2004). But the extent to which these factors influence perception of climate change particularly among local farmers have not received adequate attention in the literature and thus remains a subject of research focus.<br/>Fundamentally, the location, size and characteristic relief of Nigeria give rise to a variety of climates ranging from tropical rainforest climate along the coast to the Sahel climate in the Northern part of the country, each being different in its annual precipitation, sunshine and other climate elements (Adejuwom, 2004). In spite of this Nigeria is yet to put in place an agency that would negotiate and co-ordinate the nation’s climate change activities (Agwu, et al., 2011). Farmers in trying to come to terms with climate change have developed strategies for adaptation and mitigation of its effects. Some of these measures include cover cropping, early planting, prompt weeding, regulated use of agro-chemicals and use of tolerant varieties (DelPHE, 2010). However, previous adaptive measures used by farmers become rapidly obsolete and ineffective due to the pace at which adverse climate events take place (Eneteet al., 2011). Action Aid (2008) reports that farmers in the Southeastern part of Nigeria have continued to complain of reduction in farm output arising from the uncertainty of rainfall patterns, increased erosion resulting from heavy down pour which simultaneously destroy the fertility and at times washing away of plants and human settlements. The unfortunate aspect of the climate change dilemma in Nigeria is that most of the farmers do not understand or appreciate their contributions to climate change devastations. This is more so among rural farmers who still engage in traditional forms of slash and burn system of farming (Agwuet al., 2011). Evidence abounds in climate change literature that farmers are aware that the climate has changed and that this change has affected negatively their output (Eneteet al., 2011) but what they do not seem to appreciate is how their farming activities drive climate change. It is, therefore, important to investigate how farmers, who are major environmental stakeholders, perceive the issue of climate change, what types of changes they have observed in the past and how they have coped with them. Answers to these and other several related questions constitute the purpose of this study.<br/>1.3 Research Questions<br/>1.

Its headquarters are in the town of Ido, it is situated along Ibadan-Eruwa road. It is located between Latitude 6' 45' and 9' 45' North of the Equator and Longitude 2' 30' and 9' 45' East of Greenwich Meridian. The Local Government was created during the second republic on May 29, 1989 and it shares boundary with Oluyole Local Government, Ibarapa East Local Government, Akinyele Local Government, Ibadan North West Local Government, Ibadan South West Local Government, Ibadan North Local Government areas of Oyo state and Odeda Local Government in Ogun state. It was among the five in Ibadan district before it was cancelled in 1956, other four local Governments that were in existence at that time were Mapo, Akinyele, Ona-ara, and Olode-Olojumo.<br/>It has an area of 986km2 and a population of 103,261 using a growth rate of 3.2% from 2006 census, it has population density of 116 persons by square kilometer. Like most cities in Southern Nigeria, Ido is characterized by two distinct seasons: the dry and the rainy season. It enjoys abundant rainfall of over 1800mm annually and the south-westerly winds blow most of the year.<br/>The people are predominantly Yorubas and the area is blessed with fertile land, which is suitable for agriculture. The main occupation of the people is farming mainly food and cash crops such as cassava, maize, yam, vegetable, timber, cocoa, oil palm and kolanut, there are also large hectares of grassland which are suitable for animal rearing, vast forest reserves and rivers. The Local Government is a block under the Ibadan/Ibarapa agricultural zone of the Oyo state Agricultural Programme (OYSADEP). The people of Ido are mainly small scale farmers with significant proportion of the farmers engaging in secondary occupation such as hunting, trading, artisan, civil service jobs, food processing. There are also some industries located within the Local Government Area,these include the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Nigeria Wire and Cable, Nigeria Mining Corporation and Cassava Processing Industry. The Local Government area has 75 primary schools, 33 secondary schools made up of 18 junior secondary school and 15 senior secondary school. \n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE PERCEPTION OF LOCAL FARMERS ON CLIMATE CHANGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PERCEPTION OF LOCAL FARMERS ON CLIMATE CHANGE", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>RAINFALL TRENDS AND VARIABILITY</b><br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>     1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Rain is liquid water in form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then precipitated that is, become heavy enough to fall under gravity (Mordurch, 1995; Sala and Lauenroth, 1982). Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation. Rainfall is a determinant factor of many natural occurrences. Vegetation distribution and type of land masses are as a result of rainfall (Ronen and Avinoam, 1999;Tielborger and Kadmon,2000; Shukla et al, 1990). Animals breeding periods synchronize with rainfall periods (Radford and Du plessis 2003). Crop planting, yields and harvests are influenced by rainfall and are practiced in accordance with their respective enabling seasons to ensure improved productivity (Laux et al, 2010; Mudita et al, 2008;Omokhafe and Emuedo 2006). Similarly, the gaseous content of the soil composition from time to time is much affected by rainfall (Lee et al, 2002).<br/>Rainfall trend is the significant change in the spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall. Rainfall trend in other words can be said to be the general tendency, movement, or direction and pattern in which rainfall takes. In the global scene for example, rainfall trend analyses, on  different spatial and temporal scales, has been of great concern during the past century because of the attention given to global climate change from the scientific community: they indicate a small positive global trend, even though large areas are instead characterized by negative trends (IPCC, 1996). Murphy and Timbal (2007) reported that most of the rainfall decline (61%) has occurred in autumn (March–May) in southeastern Australia. A similar rainfall decline occurred in the southwest of Western Australia around 1970 that has many common features with the southeastern Australia decline. However, in the regional level Nicholson (2000) observed that one of the most important contrasts in rainfall is the multi-decadal persistence of anomalies over northern Africa. Nicholson and Grist (2001) had identified several changes in the general atmospheric circulation that have accompanied the shift to drier conditions in West African Sahel. Rotstayn and Lohmann (2002) showed a prominent feature is the drying of the Sahel in North Africa and suggest that the indirect effects of anthropogenic sulfate may have contributed to the Sahelian drying trend (Akinremi et al 2001).<br/>Rainfall variability on the other hand is the degree to which rainfall amounts vary across an area or through time. Variability of rainfall can be used to characterize the climate of a region. Rainfall in Nigeria is subjected to wide variability both in time and space. This variability has assumed a more pronounced dimension as a result of climate change. According to Chidozie et al, rainfall variability increases from the northwest to the southwest, while between-year (yearly) rainfall variability increases from the north central to the southeast. This study further confirms that rainfall variability over time follows a spatial trend within a certain arbitrary boundary (Laux et al, 2010, Mudita et al 2008).<br/>The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rain bands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of the mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climate can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough or inter-tropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes (Laux et al, 2010, Mudita et al 2008). The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across Eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics.<br/>Rainfall characteristics in Nigeria have been examined for dominant trend notably by Olaniran (1990, 1992) and by Olaniran and summer (1989, 1990). They showed that there has been a progressive early retreat of rainfall over the whole country, and consistent with this pattern, they reported a significant decline of rainfall frequency in September and October which, respectively coincide with the end of the rainy season in the northern and central parts of the country. The pattern of rainfall in northern Nigeria is highly variable in spatial and temporal dimensions with inter-annual variability of between 15 and 20% (Oladipo, 1993). As a result of the large inter-annual variability of rainfall, it often results in climate hazards, especially floods and severe and droughts with their devastating effects on food production and associated calamities and sufferings (Oladipo, 1993; Okorie, 2003; Adejuwon, 2004). Rainfall is one of the key climatic resources of Nigeria. Crops and animals derived their water resources largely from rainfall. It is considered as the main determinant of the types of crops that can be grown in the area and also the period of cultivation of such crops and the farming systems that can be practiced.<br/><br/>1.2       THE STATEMENT PROBLEM<br/>            Variations in rainfall trends are still burning issues in the research frontiers. Global warming and climate change have been identified as the major factors influencing rainfall trend and variability. Climate change in particular constitute a major menace to rainfall patterns which will directly or indirectly affects the ecosystems. According to the Department of Ecology 2015, state of Washington, climate change leads to rising levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere have warmed the Earth and are causing wide-ranging impacts, including rising sea levels; melting snow and ice; more extreme heat events, fires and drought; and more extreme storms, rainfall and floods.<br/>Furthermore, scientists project that variation in rainfall trends will continue to accelerate, posing significant risks to human health, our forests, agriculture, freshwater supplies, coastlines, and other natural resources that are vital to a country’s economy, environment, and quality of life. This is because so many system are tied to climate, a change in climate can affect many related aspects of where and how people, plants and animals live, such as food production, availability and use of water, and health risks. In addition, a change in the usual timing of rains or temperatures can affect when plants bloom and set fruit, when insects hatch or when streams are their fullest. This can affect historically synchronized pollination of crops, food for migrating birds, spawning of fish, water supplies for drinking and irrigation, forest health, and more (Todd et al 2001; Dominic et al 2004; Adams &amp; Faure 1997).<br/>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>            Climate change and global warming has increased at an alarming rate as a result of anthropogenic factors such as urbanization. Therefore study is relevant because it will assist researchers to understand the future consequences of rainfall variation due to climate change. This is because climate change has been linked to the climate, which in turn would affect where and how people make a living, how the flora and fauna species would thrive, how food would be produced which would be influenced by availability of water. Studies has shown that both plant and animal require a specific amount of water for their existence, excess or inadequate supply of water could lead to their demise. Carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere at an accelerated rate and also the depletion of the ozone layer which has caused the earth’s surface to be heated up.<br/>1.4       AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in rainfall over Ibadan from 1982 to 2011. The specific objectives include:<br/>    To determine the monthly variation in rainfall from 1982 to 2011<br/>    To determine the annual variation in rainfall variation from 1982 to 2011.<br/>    To determine the biannual variation in rainfall from 1982 to 2011.<br/>    To predict the rainfall in Ibadan for the next 30 years.<br/>1.5       HYPOTHESIS<br/>        i.            There is a significant difference in monthly rainfall trends from 1982 to 2011.<br/>      ii.            There is a significant variation in annual rainfall trends from 1982 to 2011.<br/>    iii.            There is a significant difference in biannual rainfall trends from 1982 to 2011.<br/>    iv.            There is an increase in the annual rainfall for the next 30 years.<br/>1.6       STUDY AREA<br/>1.6.1    Location<br/>            The city of Ibadan is located approximately on longitude 30 541 East of the Greenwich meridian and latitude 70 231 North of the Equator at a distance some 145kilometres North East of Lagos (Figure 1). Ibadan is directly connected to many towns in Nigeria by a system of roads, railways and air routes. The physical setting of the city consists of ridges of hills that run approximately in northwest - southeast direction. The largest of these ridges lies in the central part of the city and contains such peaks as Mapo, Mokola and Aremo. These hills range in elevation from 160 to 275 meters above sea level and thus affords the vistor a panoramic view of the city.<br/>Figure 1: Study Area: Ibadan, Oyo State. <br/>1.6.2    Climate          <br/>            Ibadan has a tropical wet and dry climate, with a lengthy wet season and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Ibadan’s wet season runs from March through October, though August sees somewhat of a lull in precipitation. This lull nearly divides the wet season into two different wet seasons. The remaining months form the city’s dry season. Like a good portion of West Africa, Ibadan experiences the Harmattan between the months of November and February. The tropical rainfall regime experienced in Ibadan is bi-modal, convectional and follows the apparent movement of the sun while both length of rainy season and the yearly total rainfall, decreases with increasing distance from the equator. August is the coldest month and coinciding with the August break while in December-January, the months are noted for the dusty and cold harmattan winds conveyed from the Sahara by the north- east trade winds.\n\nRAINFALL TRENDS AND VARIABILITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RAINFALL TRENDS AND VARIABILITY", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>WATER SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION<br/></b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>This study examines the domestic water supply and consumption in Ibadan north east local government area of Oyo state, Nigeria. Primary and Secondary data were used during the study. Primary data were gathered through the use of administered questionnaires.<br/>Structured questionnaire was used to solicit information from two hundred and forty (240) randomly selected households. This questionnaire was used to obtain information on type of water source, distance from household and water consumption pattern of the households and many more.

These secondary data were used in the research in order to get the accurate information about the study area.<br/>Primary data collected were analysed using appropriate statistical package called SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) and chi-square of independence was used for the analysis. During the course of the study, some problems were detected and solutions and recommendations were given.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>                                                            INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Water is one of the world's most valuable resources. It is a basic necessity of life for both plants and animals. Mankind cannot, in fact, survive without water as even the human body is made up of about 70% water.Water resources are becoming increasingly scarce in many parts of the world due to development, increased demand, climate change and resulting drought and explosive population growth. The availability of a reliable and clean supply of water is one of the most important determinants of our health. WHO explains that diseases related to drinking-water contamination represent a major burden on human health and the interventions to improve the quality of drinking-water provide significant benefits to health.<br/>Water is the only substance that exists naturally on Earth in all three physical states of matter, gas, liquid, and solid, and it is always on the move among them. The Earth has oceans of liquid water and Polar Regions covered by solid water. Energy from the sun is absorbed by liquid water in oceans, lakes, and rivers and gains enough energy for some of it to evaporate and enter the atmosphere as an invisible gas, water vapour. As the water vapour rises in the atmosphere it cools and condenses into tiny liquid droplets that scatter light and become visible as clouds. Under the proper conditions, these droplets further combine and become heavy enough to precipitate (fall out) as drops of liquid or, or if the air is cold enough, flakes of solid, thus returning to the surface of the Earth to continue this cycle of water between its condensed and vapour phases..<br/>The hydrologic cycle is a conceptual model that describes the storage and movement of water between the biosphere, athmosphere, lithosphere, and the hydrosphere. Water on our planet can be stored in any one of the following major reservoirs: atmosphere, oceans, lakes, rivers, soils, glaciers, snowfields, and groundwater. Water moves from one reservoir to another by way of processes like evaporation, condensation, precipitation, deposition, runoff, infiltration, sublimation, transpiration, melting and groundwater flow. The oceans supply most of the evaporated water found in the atmosphere. Of this evaporated water, only 91% of it is returned to the oceans basins by way of precipitation. The remaining 9% is transported to areas over landmasses where climatological factors induce the formation of precipitation. The resulting imbalance between rates of evaporation and precipitation over land and ocean is corrected by runoff and groundwater flow to the oceans.<br/>Water resources are becoming increasingly scarce in many parts of the world due to development, increased demand, climate change and resulting drought and explosive population growth. The availability of a reliable and clean supply of water is one of the most important determinants of our health. Thus, water use (demand) is a function of availability (supply).<br/>Water use falls into several major classes, each of which is associated with certain quantity and quality requirements. These classes include water for drinking and cooking, waste disposal, crop production, aquaculture, livestock, industrial use, recreational use, navigational use, and ecological values such as survival of natural lake, riverine or wetland communities. The quantity of water used within each of these classes is influenced mainly by variables such as climate and precipitation. The proportion of total water used for any specific purpose is controlled by socioeconomic conditions, tradition, culture and water availability. Agriculture based economies, such as Nigeria's, shall require up to 80% of available water for agriculture, and 10% each for industrial and domestic purposes.<br/>In an urban setting, the water used to generate electricity may be used for irrigation down a river. The same water might be used yet again as it is withdrawn for a public water supply or an industry. Only a few uses actually consume water. Irrigated agriculture, for example, consumes 55% of the water it uses. The consumptive nature of irrigation, therefore, limits many simultaneous users of the same resource. Municipal facilities such as cities consume 21% of water they withdraw. In contrast, industry which withdraws very large quantities of water, consumes only about 3% of that water. Although the quality of water returned to the system may change. Unless unacceptable changes in quality occur, many industrial users could benefit from the same water resource. The human needs about 2-10 litres of water per day for normal physiological functions, depending on climate and workload. About 1 litre of water is provided by daily food consumption. The total water consumption per capita per day is determined by a number of factors, such as availability, quality, cost, income, size of family, cultural habits, standard of living, ways and means of water distribution and climate (World Bank Water Research Team, 1993).  <br/>Water supply system is the collection, transmission, treatment, storage, and distribution of water for homes, commercial establishments, industry, and irrigation, as well as for such public needs as fire fighting and street flushing. Of all municipal services, provision of potable water is perhaps the most vital. People depend on water for drinking, cooking, washing, carrying away wastes, and other domestic needs. Water supply systems must also meet requirements for public, commercial, and industrial activities. In all cases, the water must fulfil both quality and quantity requirements. Water was an important factor in the location of the earliest settled communities, and the evolution of public water supply systems is tied directly to the growth of cities. In the development of water resources beyond their natural condition in rivers, lakes, and springs, the digging of shallow wells was probably the earliest innovation. As the need for water increased and tools were developed, wells were made deeper. Brick-lined wells were built by city dwellers in the Indus River basin as early as 2500bce, and wells almost 500 metres (more than 1,600 feet) deep are known to have been used in ancient China<br/>Public water supply started in Nigeria early in the twentieth century in a few towns managed at the lowest administrative level. Amongst the early beneficiaries were Lagos, Calabar, Kano, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Ijebu Ode (Ogun State) and Enugu. The schemes were maintained with revenue from water sales with virtually no operational subvention from government. With the creation of regional governments in the early 1950s the financial and technical responsibilities for developing new water schemes were taken over by the regional governments who also assigned supervisory high level manpower to oversee operations and maintenance. The regions were slow to set up independent bodies to develop, operate and manage the water supply. The first water corporation was formed in the western region in 1966 which took over all the assets and liabilities, including the existing staff. The staffs of the Water Division of the Ministry of Works were also transferred to the new corporation. The next corporations were formed in the 1970s. Today, all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory have water boards/corporations or public utilities boards managing their public water supply. Their efforts are supplemented, in many cases, by local governments who supply water to small villages in their areas of jurisdiction.<br/>1.2    AIM AND OBJECTIVES<br/>         The aim of the study is to examine the domestic water supply and consumption in Ibadan north-east local government area. The specific objectives are to:<br/>1.      Determine the quantity of water used in different household<br/>2.      Access the challenges facing water supply for residents in the area and proffer solution.<br/>3.      Examine the relationship between socio-economic characteristics and pattern of water consumption in the area<br/>1.3   RESEARCH HYPOTHESES<br/>    There is no significant relationship between household size and quantity of water consumed.<br/>    There is no significant relationship between income and quantity of water consumed<br/>3.      There is no significant relationship between distance to water source and the amount of water consumed.<br/>1.4   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>It has been estimated that about 80 % of all the diseases in the developing countries are related to unsafe water supply and inadequate sanitation. Lack of access to improved sanitation and safe water supply is a global crisis. The effects of inadequate water supply are more visible and prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. The fast growth of the study area has contributed to the high demand of water supply and consumption within it. A lot of residents are dependent on boreholes and wells for their water supply. This study will examine the domestic water supply and consumption in Ibadan north east local government and the problems and solutions of water supply for the people of the area.  <br/>1.5 SOURCES OF DATA<br/>There are two basic sources of data, the primary source and the secondary source.  This research depended mainly on the primary source of data. This was done through the administration of questionnaire.<br/> 1.5.1 PRIMARY SOURCE<br/>The primary source will be obtained from the distribution of questionnaires to the various respondents within the community. The questionnaires instrument of which will include multi choice question that will be administered to random household across the different wards in the local government. This study applied a cross sectional survey research design and the use of a structured open ended and close ended is used for data collection. This study was conducted among the dwellers in Ibadan north east local government and basically among household heads of different households in the community. A total number of 240 questionnaires were administered in Ibadan north east local government area. All the questionnaires were purposively administered among twenty (20) household held drawn from each ward. Ibadan north east local government have a total of twelve (12) wards and all the wards has an equal questionnaire of twenty (20) each. The questionnaire is divided into 2 main sections. The first section which deals with the socio-economic characteristics of the respondent which include questions like Age, sex, religion, marital status, household size, occupation, monthly income etc. The second section deals with questions on water supply and consumption pattern in their various households. Questions which include their major source of household water supply distance to the source of water, quality of water used in the household and other relevant questions pertinent to the study. The interviews were administered among the dwellers that showed interest. No incentive was offered to the participant.  <br/>  1.5.2 SECONDARY DATA<br/>      Data from secondary source was obtained from journals and data from previous researches. Others sources of information were from test materials, archives, past projects and literature, article related to the study. Secondary data was also collected from local government secretariat, which will be used in the research in order to get the accurate information about the study area.<br/>1.6 METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS<br/>    Theuse of both descriptive and chi-square method of data analysis were applied for the analysis of the data. For the purpose of making comparison among the variables (i.e, socio-economic characteristics, age, sex, occupation etc), descriptive statistics were used in the analysis. This are used to summarize bulky data for easy understanding. Among these are, the simple frequencies and percentages, mean, and standard deviation etc. the results generated from the analysis are presented in tables and figures to discuss the data and information on various issues addressed by the research objectives. Chi square a statistical test which was used to establish the dependency of a factor on another factor with the aim of determining if there is a significant relationship between the tested factors was used to test for hypothesis..   <br/>1.7   STUDY AREA<br/>The Ibadan north east local government was created on the 27th August 1991 by an administration of former head of state General Ibrahim Badamosi Babaginda. It was carved out of the defunct Ibadan Municipal government and derived its name from the metropolitan nature of the area it covered then (12 km radius with Mapo as the centre)<br/>The local government has its administrative headquarters located along the Iwo-road axis of Ibadan, a major entry point through Ife/Ibadan expressway end of Oyo state capital. The inhabitants of the local government are predominantly Yoruba, although it is highly heterogeneous, accommodating people from various other tribes who either engage in commercial activity or work in the public service.<br/>The local government is heavily populated and covers a large expanse of land with ab area of about 12.5 square kilometer.it is bounded on the east by Egbeda and Ona ara local Governments, on the west by Ibadan North local government and with, Ibadan South east local government on the south. The population is said to be 330,399 as at the 2006 census.<br/>It comprises twelve(12) wards. Each ward is represented by a councillor at the legislative council. The 12 wards cover the under listed areas.<br/><br/>\n\nWATER SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WATER SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>GEOGRAPHY TEACHERS AND STUDENTS PERCEPTION OF FACTORS AFFECTING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN GEOGRAPHY EXAMINATION<br/></b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>The summary of this finding is on teachers and students perception of factors affecting  students performance  in Geography Examinations. The study has been able to identify the three hypotheses statement that were tested and rejected using chi-square methods of statistics. Hence, the three hypotheses were rejected.   The  three hypotheses identified the teachers and students  perception of factors  affecting  students  performance  in Geography Examinations. The findings showed that many factors were affecting academic performance of  students  in school. Hence that successful students have significant motivation for achievement from unsuccessful students.  Also academic achievement is highly correlated with parents socio economic status which lends a good support to the present findings.  However, as a result of lack of motivation, students have negative attitude in their studies which automatically resulted into poor performance in their studies.  It is therefore concluded that interest and attitude of students towards a particular subject is determined by the level of socio economic status of  their parents.  Hence, high motivating factor mostly from the parents and teachers lead to a better achievement on the part of the student as a whole.In order to improve the student academic excellence in their  need to encourage the student in order to display good attitude and better interest in all their subject mostly in geography, while the teacher is motivated in reciprocal as a result of good academic performance by the students.there is need for a good impact on academic knowledge on the students, teacher and parents coupled with the student’s interest in the subject and the display of positive attitude as earlier pointed out are good motivating factors which when combine together is assumed will result to a better achievement in geography.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>The term ‘‘examination’’ or ‘‘test’ has been defined as an instrument or systematic procedure for measuring a sample of a person’s behaviour with a view to evaluating that behaviour against standards i.e. in comparism with a given domain of performance tasks (criterion-referenced) or against norms i.e in comparism with others in the group (norm-referenced) (Gage and Berliner, 1979, Gronlund,1985).<br/>Geography’s role is specifically stated in Section 4(6A) where geography has been listed as one of the core subjects at the Senior secondary level (now section 5(25A)). Students are expected to select ;One of Literature-in-English, History, Geography or Religious Studies as the core subject. Geography has also been grouped as part of the body of elective subjects. Therefore, every student will be expected to select three of those subjects depending on the choice of career up to the end of the second year and may drop one of the non-compulsory subjects out of the nine subjects in the last year of the senior high school course. The geography curriculum has special feature which include:<br/>a.       The provision of a geography curriculum that is based on the choice of suitable and relevant themes,units, contents, teaching materials, sstudents’ activitiies, teaching aids and evaluation.<br/>b.      The reductionn in the scope and content of the subject matter of senior secondary school geography without loosing the high quality required at that level.<br/>c.       The inclusion of innovative elements into the teaching of syllabus through the emphasis placed on ther practical geography throughout the 3-year course and the introduction of geographic principles, concepts and skills that are relevant to current trends in the discipline and useful for solving environmental problems.<br/>1.2BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Education is noted as an instrument of change by different experts and professionals in the field of education. Education has been defined in various ways to emphasize different aspect of this crucial concept.  According to Obafemi Awolowo “education is that process of physical and mental culture whereby a man’s personality is developed to the fullest.  Also, Alfred North White says that “education is not just the acquisition of the art of the utilization of knowledge.  This is the concept of education for functional living within one’s milieu, the art of utilizing knowledge for one’s benefit and for the betterment of the society.<br/>Educational activities in Nigeria were first carried out informally.  This was known as indigenous education where the aim was to transmit the cultural heritage of the society through generations).  After which is the Islamic education which came to Nigeria around the 14th century following the arrival of Islamic Religion. The arrival of the Europeans in 1842 (the arrival of the Wesley Missionary Society) was the beginning of Western Education.  The western education later-on metamorphosed or led to Nigeria developing her own educational system that suits it.  This subsequently brought about the 6-3-3-4 system of education (though there were others before it i.e. 7-5-3 system) which was developed in 1969 (the 1969 National curriculum conference), which implies six (6) years of primary school, three (3) years of  junior secondary, three (3) years of senior secondary’ and at least four (4) years of tertiary education.<br/>Secondary education is defined as “education beyond the elementary grades or primary school”, it could also be said as the education provided by a high school or college preparatory school.  In the 6-3-3-4 system, the emphasis for us here is of the second -3- level, which is the senior secondary level, in which geography is offered or taken during the 3 years duration.  The subjects in the senior secondary are Maths, English, a major Nigerian language and other electives depending on the students area of interest or department (commercial, arts and sciences), in which geography is included.<br/>According to the National Policy on Education (N.P.E, 2004:7a), one of the national objectives states.<br/>“The training of the mind and understanding of the world around us”.<br/>Therefore, it is believed that perhaps geography as a school subject can achieve this stated objective.<br/>Geography is the physical – social science which describes, maps, and seeks to explain the inter-relationship between man and his physical environs.  On the one hand, it deals with the natural setting or physical environs in which man live (some of the elements of the physical environs are the surface or the topography of the earth, soil, rocks and minerals climate, land and water bodies, native plant and animal life, and location on the earth’s surface).<br/><br/>From the afore mentioned it can be seen that the teaching and learning of Geography as a subject is alsobeing influenced by various factors in secondary schools and is faced with diverse problems.  These factors could be external factors, cultural, social, political and economic etc which operate differentially from place to place and from time to time, which are relative and not absolute.  Specifically, some of these factors include: inadequate staffing, lack of suitable texts, unqualified teachers, shortage of qualified teachers, lack of fund to schools, poor students perception of the subject and poor methods of teaching amongst others.<br/>1.2       Statement of problem<br/>Despite the nature and importance of geography to the society, there is still a persistent worrisome poor performance of students in geography. For this reason, this study attempts to identify the factors affecting students’ performance in geography examinations in Nigerian secondary schools. <br/>1.3       Purpose of the study<br/>This research work is basically to identify Geography teachers and students’ perception of factors affecting students’ performance in geography examinations. The purpose of the study will include: <br/>(1)               To access socio-economic background and its effect on performance of students in geography examinations in senior secondary schools.<br/>(2)               To evaluate the extent to which teacher qualification and training affect students’ performance in geography examinations in senior secondary schools.<br/>(3)               To access the extent to which students’ perception of geography affects their performance in geography examinations.<br/>(4)               To examine the extent to which inadequate teaching and learning materials affect students’ performance in geography examinations.<br/>1.4       Research questions<br/>1.                  Does the socio economic background of the students affect the performance of students in geography examinations in Secondary schools?<br/>2.                  How do (To what extent) teacher qualification and training affect the performance of students in geography examinations in secondary schools?<br/>3.                  How does students’ perception of geography affect their performance in geography examinations in secondary schools?<br/>4.                  How does inadequate provision of textbooks affect students’ performance in geography examinations in senior secondary schools?<br/>1.5       Research Hypothesis<br/>1.         There is no significant relationship between socio-economic background and performance of students in geography examinations in secondary schools.<br/>2.         There is no significant relationship between teachers qualification and training and the performance of students in geography examinations in secondary schools.<br/>3.         There is no significant relationship between students perception of geography and their performance in geography examinations in secondary schools .<br/>1.6       Significance of the study<br/>This study will contribute to the findings in the literature on the factors affecting students performance in geography examinations and benefit the students, teachers, parents, curriculum developers, government, and the society at large in the following ways: by informing the government on the need to provide schools with adequate infrastructure, enlighten the teachers on how to better appreciate their work and help in moulding their students understanding of the subject, the need for parents to provide books for their children/wards in helping to mould their knowledge of geography. And also informing the curriculum developers into looking into the actual period of teaching and learning of geography in order to bring it to a good standard, as well as coming up with adequate timing for the subject.<br/>Also it will inform policy makers and geography teachers on the factors responsible for students’ performance in geography examinations in secondary schools.   It may also provide a guide for students (as too the relevance of geography to future careers, and other relevant professions)<br/>1.7 Scope of the study<br/>This is limited to accessing geography teachers and students perception of factors that affect students’ poor performance in geography examinations in public secondary schools in Lagos Mainland (Yaba Local Government Area), in Lagos State.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nGEOGRAPHY TEACHERS AND STUDENTS PERCEPTION OF FACTORS AFFECTING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN GEOGRAPHY EXAMINATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GEOGRAPHY TEACHERS AND STUDENTS PERCEPTION OF FACTORS AFFECTING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN GEOGRAPHY EXAMINATION", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECT OF POPULATION GROWTH IN NIGERIA:<br/> A STUDY OF DEKINA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF KOGI STATE</b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>This research is aimed at investigating into the socio-economic effect of population growth in Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State. To actualized this investigation, chapter one started with background of the study, statement of the problems, purpose of the study, research questions, significance of the study, scope of the study and definition of terms. While chapter two revealed the scholars view on the topic. In chapter three the oral interview and questionnaire method of data collection was used by the researchers from the study undertaken it was used revealed and analysis of data. In chapter four socio-economic effect of growth in population causes by early marriage and moral practice as perpetrated by the young ones. Chapter five shown the summary of findings, recommendations and possible conclusion were drawn, that from investigation increase in population cause unemployment, social vices, famine and starvation.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Erawn (1977) defines the concept of population as the number of people living in one geographical area at a particular time. The study of population is as old as the world itself. The need to study demography or population can never be over-emphasized. The question of population gives rise to population census which is inevitable for social, economic and political planning in a country.<br/>In the same vein, Alades (1984) says that population refers to a group of people inhabiting geographical location. The trend of Nigerian population since 1963 was about 55.7 millions people as time changes so also thins including population continue to change, that is after the census of 1973 figure, which brought the population figure of Nigeria to 120 million people. Out of the total number, over 75% of the population resides in the rural area. Agricultural activities takes place while the remaining 25% of the population lives in the urban centres. Within the time frame right from when Nigeria attained independence rapid population growth is caused by early marriage, immoral practice as encouraged by young people and purely which dragged so many young girls into such prostitution thereby contributing to increase in population growth. Such population growth affect the labour force. Christianity and Islam, the two major religions abhor population control methods like sex education, the use of contraceptive etc. they inadvertently encourage increase in population. They did not understand the medical devices used in controlling unwanted pregnancies thereby leading to the increase in population by these group.<br/>Large population is synonymous with the expansion of local market. By expansion of local market we means, increase in demand for goods and services in the country. This is as a result of the fact that large number of people constitute consumers.<br/>Increase in demand for goods and services will lead to increase in production and that is a good omen to the country’s economic development. A country that has large population will also have more people that are working if other things being equal. These people that are gainfully employed and are potential contributors to the economic development of the country. The more they are the better for the country. As the population of a country continues to increase, so will the number of skill and talented people continue to diversify in all parts of the country.<br/>It is in the light development that this study attempt to examine the socio-economic effect of population rate in Nigeria using Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State as a study.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>In the course of this research work, the researcher encountered some problems. Some of these problems are:<br/>-       There was no enough time for the researcher to go round the whole local government because the researcher combined academic work with the research.<br/>-       There was no enough money for the researcher to produce much questionnaire to circulate the whole village in the local government (Dekina).<br/>-       Another problem was that of the respondents; some of them were not ready to respond appropriately for the fear of one thing or the other as they thought it will have negative implication on them.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>Population as earlier discuss could be described as the total number of people living in a particular geographical area at a particular period of time.<br/>In determining the total number of inhabitant in a particular place, population census is used.<br/>Population census could be defined as the counting of all the people in the country by the government at regular period of time usually every ten (10) years.<br/>Population census is of great importance to economic, political, socio-cultural planning of the country, reliable and detailed data on the size, required for both planning and research purposes. Population census is the major source or benchmark for data collection population is of great importance to the development of the country.<br/>In the first place, good economic planning is one of the importance of population census enable the government to make plan for the economic growth and development of a country. This is so because census gives information such as the number of people in each occupation such information enable the government to make plan on how to allocate amenities such as school, hospitals, roads, pipe-borne water, electricity etc. to different localities in Nigeria.<br/>It also enable the government to know the most appropriate place to establish different type of industry. Political representative is very essential to population growth and national planning. This is because political constituencies are determined by national planning on the basis of the size of population growth. Information such as this, aids the country to determine its population policy. For example, the government of India adopted the policy of birth control measure when it became clear that the population of India was growing too rapidly.<br/>Many developed countries assist the underdeveloped countries in providing such as idea the size of the population. Aids donors will normally not give the same account. The importance of countries at the United Nations Organization with other world assemblies depends on a large extent on the population which it has within the organization of Africa. Population consideration is of important for the above plan. Conclusively, population census is needed and is of important to national planning for political reasons and for effective creation of state, local government, provision of social amenities, public utilizes and  for location of industries and the host of others.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The research is unique because it is the first study carried out on the socio-economic effect of rapid population growth in Nigeria and the people in Dekina Local Government Area. This has advantage of creating awareness in the society as a result of continuous increase in population as it affect them. This is also important as it open widely the eyes of the people to look into the result on continuous increase in population from various perspectives and to look for means of solving the problem.<br/>This study is a model attempt to document the factors that lead to the continuous increase in population in the area, since there is tendency for scholars to take further step into the investigation.<br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work is strictly limited to Dekina Local Government Area due to some reasons beyond t on the researcher’s control. This work would have been conducted on the whole State but for some certain reasons such as financial predicament, transportation, and feeding etc. This financial constraint exhibited itself in the area of not enough questionnaires to cover the whole State. Despite this, transportation and bad road network were among of the problems.<br/>1.6    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The hypotheses upon which this project work is based is stated below:<br/>1.   Continuous increase in population brings about unemployment?<br/>2.   Contain culture and tradition of the people contribute to the continuous increase in population which in turn bring about social problem?<br/>3.   Early marriage lead to continuous in population.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Socio: According to Oxford Advanced Learners, Dictionary, socio simply means combining form connected with society or the study of society.<br/>Economics: According to Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, economics is the study of how society organizes its money, trade and industry.<br/>Socio-Economic: according to Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, Socio-economic is based on a combination of social and economic conditions.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nSOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECT OF POPULATION GROWTH IN NIGERIA: A STUDY OF DEKINA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF KOGI STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECT OF POPULATION GROWTH IN NIGERIA: A STUDY OF DEKINA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF KOGI STATE", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>TECHNICAL CONSIDERATION OF THE EFFECT OF SOLAR RADIATION ON NIGERIA</b><br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0      INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1   BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>Solar radiation (a renewable energy resource) has direct impact on energy generation in addition to agriculture and water resources. The energy resource was observed to be affected by climate changes induced by CO2 emissions (Pan et al., 2004). With enormous solar potential across Nigeria, a moderate seasonal effect of climate change can have significant socio-economic impacts; change of solar radiation in future climate is thus of considerable interest (Pan et al., 2004).<br/>High resolution reliable projections of 21st century climate change are of great importance to assess related impacts on renewable energy resources (directly on solar energy and indirectly on wind and hydro power), human activities and natural ecosystem over the country. African countries are shown to be among the most vulnerable to climatic changes expected for the next decades of the 21st century due to increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2007; Mariotti et al., 2011).<br/>Furthermore, among African regions, West Africa is found as one of the world most exposed to the negative effects of climate variability (Tchotchou and Kamga, 2010). In Nigeria, Climate change is the latest challenge to sustainable human development and is leading to more frequent and more severe climate-related impacts that may deter efforts to achieve the country’s development objectives, including the targets of the Nigeria Vision 20:2020 and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) NEST and Tegler, 2011; NASPA-CCN, 2011; the challenges being multifaceted (social, economic, environmental), its impact on infrastructure will be significant because infrastructure provides a critical platform for the effective functioning of the Nigerian economy (NEST and Tegler, 2011).<br/>Climate change is also expected to negatively affect the already limited electrical power supply through impacts on the existing hydroelectric and thermal generation; service interruption is also expected to result from damage to transmission lines and substation equipment impacted by sea level rise, flash floods, and other extreme weather events (NASPA-CCN, 2011). Climate change was discussed in (Li et al., 2012) to have effect on weather parameters (wind speed, solar radiation, precipitation, mean temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures etc.) that constitute the renewable resources.<br/>Several authors have also shown that potential climatic changes due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gases might affect the availability of renewable resources in West Africa in the future. However, changes (increase or decrease) in resource potentials resulting from climate change consequences may affect power generation from renewable energy resources and can consequently affect the potential contribution to future electricity output.<br/>There is also the tendency of a reduction or increase in magnitude of the several weather parameters (global solar radiation, dry-bulb temperature (mean, maximum and minimum), relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speeds) that contribute to building comforts (through heat gain and loss in buildings) in the advent of a changing climate (Ohunakin et al., 2013).<br/>However, study of the physical mechanisms underlying climate variability and the quantification of the relative contributions of each of the driving factors; require long time series of observations. The long range of observed data is a disability in West Africa because of the relatively few observation stations, and most times, poor quality of available data; these necessitate the use of climate models whose outputs constitute consistent datasets of atmospheric variables.<br/>Climate models (global and regional circulation models) are thus the primary tools that aid in our understanding of the many processes that govern the climate systems (Pal et al., 2007). A number of simulations have been carried out using Global Circulation Models (GCMs).<br/>Climate models with GCMs have been found to have difficulties reproducing various atmospheric variables of interest and thus generating unrealistic outputs (some examples are in the results as given in the following: Community Climate Model version 3-CCM3 in the work of (Jenkins and Mikovitz, 2003); Laboratoire de Me´te´orologie Dynamique (LMD) GCM and also the Centre for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere (COLA) GCM as reviewed in the work of (Tchotchou and Kamga, 2010).<br/>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The sun is the source of most energy on the earth and is a primary factor in determining the thermal environment of a locality. The challenge about technical consideration on the effect of solar radiation could be as a result of incompetency of the engineers that may not be able to make estimates of solar radiation intensity and know how to make simple solar radiation measurements. It could also be that the instruments that are used for solar radiation measurement are not accurate thereby leading to a false result. More also, inability to understand the thermal effects of solar radiation and knowing how to control or utilize them. Finally, the several researches has been carried out on the effect of solar energy but not even a single research has been carried out on the technical consideration of the effect of solar radiation in Nigeria.<br/>1.3   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>The main aim of the study is to examine technical consideration of the effect of solar radiation. Other specific objectives of the study include;<br/>1.          to determine the extent to which technical radiation affects solar radiation in Nigeria.<br/>2.          to determine the impact of technical consideration on solar radiation in Nigeria.<br/>3.          to determine the factors affecting technical consideration on solar radiation in Nigeria.<br/>4.          to proffer possible solutions to the problems.<br/>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS               <br/>1.          What is the extent to which technical radiation affects solar radiation in Nigeria?<br/>2.          What is the impact of technical consideration on solar radiation in Nigeria?<br/>3.          What are the factors affecting technical consideration on solar radiation in Nigeria?<br/>4.          to proffer possible solutions to the problems.<br/>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The study on the technical consideration of the effect of solar radiation will be of immense benefit to the entire Nigeria in the sense that it will enable the solar technical engineers to be well equipped in order for them to be able to handle challenges of any sorts that has to do with solar radiation. The study will also educate the government to be fully aware of the kind of people they employ into this sector for the benefit of the citizens in the country. Finally, the study will contribute to the body of existing literature and knowledge to this field of studies and basis for further research.<br/>1.6   SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>        The study on consideration of the effect of solar radiation is limited to Nigeria.<br/>1.7   LIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<br/>Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

However, the real petroleum reservoir, is a composition of layers with unique interlayer characteristics. The individual layers are usually separated from each other by an interface which could be either permeable or impermeable. Pressure behavior in this kind of vertically heterogeneous system is not necessarily like that of a single layered system and seldom reveals more than the average properties of the entire system. It is against this backdrop that this study became necessary.  Well completion in such systems would be more instructive, enabling better reservoir and production engineering practice if detailed layer information is available at it prime. The petroleum industry is however interested in accurately calculating the pressure losses that occur for multiphase flow in the tubing and pipelines. Accurate predictions of pressure losses in pipes would enable proper design. Also, pressure determination in a production system in the petroleum industry is very important as it helps in the effective production of oil and gas from the reservoir but of all, the most important is the determination of flowing bottom-hole pressure as its knowledge helps in the determination of so many parameters needed for efficient production and also to avert early depletion of the reservoir. Its knowledge can also be used to prevent formation damage which could be caused by early sand production in the reservoir. Surface pressures often can be converted to bottom-hole values if adequate information is available about the wellbore system.<br/>1.1.1 WHAT IS BOTTOM HOLE FLOWING PRESSURE<br/>The pressure at the bottom of a working oil, water, or gas well (the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 1979). The pressure measured in a well at or near the depth of the producing formation. For well-test purposes, it is often desirable to refer the pressure to a datum level chosen at a reference depth by calculating the pressure that would occur if the pressure measurement were made at the datum level rather than at the actual depth of the gauge<br/>(Schlumberger oilfield glossary). A knowledge of this pressure is fundamental in determining the most efficient methods of recovery and the most efficient lifting procedure, yet there is less information about these pressures than about any other part of the general problem of producing oil (Millikan and Sidwell, 1930). As earlier said, the bottom-hole pressure can be determined from surface pressures like the well head pressure if adequate information is available about the production system which can be easily gotten from well testing operations (Economides, 1979). Since the well head pressure and parameters are easily gotten from pressure transient analysis whose success depends on the accurate measurement or estimation of bottom-hole pressure (Omohimoria and Ayodele, 2013), it is therefore desirable and necessary to obtain the bottom-hole pressure from these data. This will be carried out in order to further highlight the advantages which is associated with having adequate knowledge about the bottom-hole pressure of a reservoir.<br/>1.1.2 TYPICAL FLOW REGIMES<br/> At certain position and time in the reservoir different flow behaviors are usually encountered in the reservoir. This gives rise to different flow regimes. Flow regimes are usually classified according to the rate of change of pressure with respect to time and position<br/> Steady state<br/>During steady-state flow, the pressure does not change with time. This is observed for example when a constant pressure effect, such as resulting from a gas cap or some types of water drive, ensures a pressure maintenance in the producing formation. Pressure usually will changes from one point to the other in the reservoir algebraically,<br/>Pseudo steady state<br/>The pseudo steady state regime characterizes a closed system response. With a constant rate production, the drop of pressure becomes constant for each unit of time.<br/><br/>Where k is a constant.  In practice, this can be reached more easily than the steady state.<br/> Transient state<br/>Transient responses are observed before constant pressure or closed boundary effects are reached. The pressure variation with time is a function of the well geometry and the reservoir properties, such as permeability and heterogeneity. It can be expressed mathematically as,<br/>Usually, well test interpretation focuses on the transient pressure response. Near wellbore conditions are seen first and later, when the drainage area expands, the pressure response is characteristic of the reservoir properties until boundary effects are seen at late time (then the flow regime changes to pseudo steady or steady state). The applications of the steady-state flow to describe the flow behavior of several types of fluid in different reservoir geometries are presented below. These include:<br/>• Linear flow of incompressible fluids<br/>• Linear flow of slightly compressible fluids<br/>• Linear flow of compressible fluids<br/> • Radial flow of incompressible fluids<br/> • Radial flow of slightly compressible fluids<br/> • Radial flow of compressible fluids<br/> • Multiphase flow<br/>1.1.3 VerticalMultiphase flow<br/>Much has been written in the literature regarding the multiphase flow of fluids in pipe. This problem is much more complex than the single-phase flow problem because there is the simultaneous flow of both liquid (oil or condensate and water) and vapor (gas). The mechanical energy equation   is the basis for methods to estimate the pressure drop under multiphase flow; however, the problem is in determining the appropriate velocity, friction factor, and density to be used for the multiphase mixture in the calculation. In addition, the problem is further complicated as the velocities, fluid properties, and the fraction of vapor to liquid change as the fluid flows to the surface due to pressure changes.<br/>Many researchers have proposed methods to estimate pressure drops in multiphase flow. Each method is based on a combination of theoretical, experimental, and field observations, which has led some researchers to relate the pressure-drop calculations to flow patterns. Flow patterns or flow regimes relate to the distribution of each fluid phase inside the pipe. This implies that a pressure calculation is dependent on the predicted flow pattern. There are four flow patterns in the simplest classification of flow regimes:<br/>·         Bubble flow<br/>·         Slug/Plug flow<br/>·         Churn flow<br/>·         Annular-mist flow<br/>Bubble: (Fig...) This type of flow was noted to occur at very low gas velocities.  This type of flow is characterized by bubbles of gas moving along the upper part of pipe at approximately the same velocity as the liquid.<br/>Slug/Plug flow: (Fig…) In this type of flow, the flow of liquid is basically restricted due to the amount of gases which evolve from the liquid phase and collage to form slug-like gas pockets. Like the bubbly flow, the liquid phase is the continuous phase but in this case, the gas phase overrides the liquid phase.<br/>Churn flow /Semi-annular: (Fig...) It is characterized by secondary currents set up by the velocity gradients in the liquid causing the liquids to climb the tube walls and, aided by waves, to coalesce at the top.  The amount of liquid in the bottom of the tube was greater than at top and walls, hence the name semi-annular.<br/>Annular: (Fig...) This type of flow is characterized by liquid flowing in a thin film around the entire inside face of the pipe, the gas flowing at a high velocity as a central core.  The liquid is flowing in a continuous annular rings, hence the name annular flow.<br/>Figure 1.1: Flow patterns in Vertical Flow<br/>Figure 1.1.3 above (Taitel, Bornea and Duckler, 1980) shows the various flow regimes that could be expected in vertical flow as a function of the superficial velocities of gas and liquid flow<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>A calculation method for predicting Bottom Hole Pressure (BHP) based on easily obtainable wellhead parameter has been the preferred method in the oil and gas industry. But the predictive capability of the existing correlations is a thing of concern to the oil industry operators. This is due to the inability of the existing models and correlations to account for the presence of sand particles in the flow stream; also, the requirement for the well to be shut-in for BHP predictions is counterproductive.<br/>1.3 AIM&amp; OBJECTIVES<br/>The aim of the project is to determine the flowing bottom-hole pressure of a vertical well from surface pressure and well parameters. This will be done by the modification of the general energy equation considering only the frictional pressure term. The modified equation (derived model) will be validated with a well data which will be gotten from a company.<br/>The objectives of determining the flowing bottom-hole pressure of a well from well head pressure and well head data include the following:<br/>·                     Efficient interpretation of the behavior of the underground system.<br/>·                     Determination of BHP helps in provision of important information for efficient production, avert early depletion and early sand production in the reservoir.<br/>·                     Determination of the most efficient methods of recovery and the most efficient lifting procedures.<br/>·                     Determination of pressure losses in pipes and tubing for proper design of Artificial Lift Systems - Gas Lift, ESP’s etc.<br/>·                     Production Optimization - Identification of production bottlenecks, Gaslift optimization, and completion designs<br/><br/>\n\nDETERMINATION OF FLOWING BOTTOM-HOLE PRESSURE FROM WELL-HEAD DATA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF FLOWING BOTTOM-HOLE PRESSURE FROM WELL-HEAD DATA", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECTS OF GULLY EROSION ON THE ENVIRONMENT</b><br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0      INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1   BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>Erosion is one of the surface processes that sculpture the earth’s landscape and constitutes one of the global environmental problems. Soil erosion is perhaps the most serious mechanism of land degradation in the tropics (ElSwaify, et al., 2002). However, gully is visually the most impressive of all types of erosion (El-Swaify, 2000). Gully erosion is a well-defined water worn channel (Monkhouse and Small, 2008).<br/>It is a recently extended drainage channel that transmits ephemeral flow, steep side, steeply sloping or vertical head scarf with a width greater than 0.3 m and a depth greater than 0.6 m (Brice, 2006). It is a V or U-shaped trench in unconsolidated materials with a minor channel in the bottom, but not necessarily linked to a major stream (Graf, 2003).<br/>Similarly, Bettis III (2005) defined gully as a relatively deep, vertical-walled channel recently formed within a valley where no well-defined channel previously existed. Gully erosion is an advanced stage of rill erosion where surface channels have been eroded to the point where they cannot be smoothened over by normal tillage operations (Hilborn, 2005).<br/>Gullies can be active (actively eroding) or inactive (stabilized). The former, according to Poesen et al. (2003), can occur where the erosion is actively moving up in the landscape by head-cut migration. The causes of gully erosion are poorly understood but the processes and factors involved in its growth and degradation are well-known (Bettis III, 2005). The research has shown that gully processes had happened in the past even without human influence or interference. Thus, the phenomenon of gully erosion is either naturally induced or artificially-induced, or both. Like in other parts of the world, gully erosion is one of the major environmental challenges facing Nigeria.<br/>The available literatures on the subject show that this menace is more predominant in the eastern half of the country compared to the western half. South-eastern part of Nigeria is more affected than its north-eastern counterpart. Soil erosion in the former has been identified as the most threatened environmental hazards in the country (Albert, et al. 2006). Anambra State is the most affected of all the states in Nigeria where Agulu, Nanka and Oko communities of the state are the worst hit. Available literatures have clearly reiterated the fact that the underlying geology exerts a major of control on gully development and, more often than not, the process is rock type dependent as some rocks are more susceptible to erosion than the others. There is therefore a need to briefly review the geology of Nigeria with a view to recognizing why the phenomenal gully erosion is more prevalent in one part of the country than in the other.<br/>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          Erosion generally degrades land and affects not just plants and animal but is capable of taking away human’s life, though it a natural disaster but ways of preventing it can be thought about. Gully erosion seems to be a factor of discourse every rainy season because maybe the government have decided to pay deaf ears to this menace, sometimes because they must have tried to work on it but the solution was not long lasting and they thought intervening again will just be a total waste of money thereby feeling discouraged. Finally, several studies has been carried out on the effect of erosion on agricultural produce but not even a single research has been carried out on the effects of gully erosion on the environment a case study of Oko, Anambra state.<br/>1.3      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>         The main aim of the study is examine the effects of gully erosion on the environment. Other specific objectives of the study include:<br/>1.  to determine the extent to which gully erosion affects the environment.<br/>2.  to determine the causative factors of gully erosion.<br/>3.  to determine the effect of gully erosion on the environment.<br/>4.  to proffer possible solutions to the problems.<br/>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.  What is the extent to which gully erosion affects the environment?<br/>2.  What are the causative factors of gully erosion?<br/>3.  What is the effect of gully erosion on the environment?<br/>4.  What are the possible solutions to the problems?<br/>1.5   STATEMENT OF RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>H0:    Gully erosion has no significant on environment.<br/>H1:        Gully erosion has a significant on environment.<br/>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The study on the effects of gully erosion on the environment will be of immense benefit to the entire Oko, Anambra state in the sense that it will enable the ministry of environment to come up with a strategy on how to handle gully erosion in not just Oko but in other local government areas of Anambra state that are also facing gully erosion challenges. Finally, the study will contribute to the body of existing literature and knowledge to this field of studies and basis for further research.<br/>1.7   SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>The study on the effects of gully erosion on the environment is limited to Oko, Anambra state.<br/>1.8   LIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<br/>Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

While annual temperature averages unquestionably continued to rise through the late 1990s and early 2000s, over-heated areas in the Northern Hemisphere often were matched by excessively cool regions in the Southern Hemisphere (Blij, Muller, Williams, Conrad and Long, 2005).<br/>             The discovery and extraction of natural resources has brought different consequences to countries that are endowed with such resources. While some of these nations have become economically strong and self sustaining, others have being drawn into serious economic hardships and conflicts due to the atmospheric influence of man and his activities while man through his various actions deliberately or inadvertently influence weather and climate which brings about climate change refers to an increase in average global temperatures.<br/>             Natural events and human activities are believed to be contributing to an increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). Nigeria is experiencing adverse climate conditions with negative impacts on the welfare of millions of people. The climate of an environment or a region are usually explained in terms of the prevailing climatic elements of temperature, rainfall or precipitation, relative humidity, evaporation, solar radiation etc. The description of these climate element or parameters in any region is known as climatic characteristics of what region. Among all these parameters, the most widely used measure of climatic description is the temperature, rainfall or precipitation and relative humidity (Oguntoyinbo, 1983 and Ayoade, 1992).<br/>          Over the years, studies of climatic characteristics have been limited to the micro scale known as micro climatic characteristics (Efe, 2002; Oguntoyinbo, 1981; Ojo, 1988; Figurola, 1995; and Efe and Aruegodine, 2003). Human activities have much effect on the climate of Abraka as most of these climatic parameters are being altered by the numerous activities of human in the region. Some of these human activities are the method of farming, gas flaring within the environment or neighbouring communities, transportation, fumes from factory buildings, illegal oil bunker, fumes from generator sets, improper waste disposal, deforestation etc.<br/>          Lately the heat wave all over the country has been unbearable. Even with rain, the heat is still unbearable. Have you ever wondered why the sun is so hot? The heat is caused by global warning. Global warning is the rise in the atmosphere. This is called the Green House Effect. A Green House Gas (sometimes abbreviated GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the green house effect.<br/><br/>          The primary green house gases in the Earth’s atmosphere are water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. The effect of global warming include extreme weather conditions, heat due to the depletion of the ozone layer by the greenhouse gases, flood, shortage of water due to climate change.<br/>          However, in Abraka, urbanization has also resulted in massive increases in problems such as obesity, township life, especially in modern urban slums of the developing world, are certainly immune to neither pestilence nor climatic disturbance such as floods, yet continue to strongly attract migrants. As an area is getting urbanized, there is the need to study climatic characteristics before they are completely militated by the modern trend of human population explosion, human and industrial activities as well as to get acquainted with its rural environmental conditions in relation to its rural surrounding centers. It is against this background that this research attempts to examine the effects of global warning in Abraka.<br/>1.2     Statement of Problem<br/>As the natural geographical setting and landscape of Abraka and its environs is rapidly being replaced by an agglomeration and clustering of both planned and unplanned building structures, its attendant consequences are enormous. The geometric increase in population, vehicular emissions from exhaust pipes, industrial discharges and increased use of power generating set due to erratic power supply by Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) all these lead to appreciable disturbance in the in the natural ecosystem of Abraka region, which in turn adversely affect the climate of Abraka.<br/>          One of the effects of man’s activities that is resulting to increase in temperature is based on the exercised through which changes in atmospheric composition particularly the CO2, Ozone and aerosols content of the atmosphere. There is unequivocal evidence that the CO2 content of atmosphere has been increasing over the years as a result of man’s use of fossil fuels, for energy. For instance the exploration of oil, has led to deforestation, the exploitation of oil has led to gas flaring in the southern part of Nigeria and that now exacerbate high temperature and lower humidity. The coastal location and presence of River Ethiope in Abraka helped to create humid condition and heavy amount of rainfall in Abraka, but the influence of the gas flaring (in neigbouring community such as Ebedei), fumes from generator sets etc. has shadow over this factor (Efe, 2002). Some other human activities in Abraka and its environ has in turn resulted to global warming. Some of these other activities include the use of generator sets, fumes from automobile vehicles and factory buildings, indiscriminate dumping of waste/refuse etc. Most of the farm products that are being produced at Abraka P.O, are being affected due to the adverse effect of human activities as most of the plant are being poorly produced as a result of too much high temperature in that part of Abraka. These substances (Fumes from factory building, generator sets, motor vehicles, tricycles and motorcycles) have also caused air pollution and also increased the temperature of the region there by causing Global Warming. This is as a result of increase in the numbers of building structures and warm air conditioners that adds warmth to the surroundings, much pollutes and radiate heat into the surrounding landscape and also turning of landscape into townscape also altered the natural environment. This alternation according to Efe (2002a and 2006) resulted in increased temperature of the urban canopy.<br/>          Similarly research efforts in the past years have focused mainly on education, economic activities, religion, political system, sporting activities, administrative divisions and other non geographical aspect of Abraka region. Virtually, as s result of intense research, it was discovered there has not been much emphasis laid on the effects of global warning in Abraka region, neither has interest been shown towards the idea.<br/>          In recent times there has been a call for periodic re-examination of the urban climate of tropical cities in order to have an update and compare the situation in these cities with that of other cities in the world (Lowry, 1998; Efe, 2004 and Adelekan, 2005). Based on these calls and with these numerous problems and the neglects associated with Abraka as an urban centre, the needs arises to carry out this study in order to find out how global warning has affected Abraka community in Delta State.<br/>          This study is also meant to truly point out the effects of global warning in Nigeria using Abraka region as a case study, including how urbanization and civilization has affected the climate of Abraka and its environs.<br/>1.3     Aim and Objectives<br/>          The study is aimed at evaluating global warming effects in Abraka, and specific objectives are to:<br/>1.   Identify the various climatic characteristics in Abraka<br/>2.   Discuss temperature trend over the years<br/>3.   Access the effects of anthropogenic/human activities on the climate of Abraka region<br/>4.   Examine the effects of global warming on the residents of Abraka<br/>5.   Offer suggestions to solve the problems associated with the effects of global warning in Abraka region and how to reduce adverse effect of urbanization on both human activities and climate.<br/>1.4     Hypothesis<br/>1.   Abraka has not experienced significant warming over the years<br/>2.   Human activities does not significantly affect the climate of Abraka region.<br/>3.   Global warning has no significant effects on the resident of Abraka.<br/><br/>1.5     Significance of the Study<br/>The significance of the study lies in all over the effects of human activities resulting to global warning within Abraka. The effects and the importance of human activities on climate cannot be over emphasized. It is to this effect that the study is aimed at informing the people of Abraka the extent to which human activities have resulted to global warming.<br/>          Hence effort must be put in a place to control human activities in order not to affect the climate of Abraka negatively, as if the climate of the study area is continued to be affected by the excess of human activities. There may be excess of rainfall which in turn might cause flooding in the area or there might be over increase in the temperature of the area which will in turn affect not only agricultural activities but other activities also that human’s depend upon for survival. It is therefore hoped that the result of this research work will go an extra mile to control global warming caused by human activities resulting to depletion of the ozone layer which have greatly affected the climate of Abraka region. The findings will also provide useful background information to future research in the contribution of geography towards nations.<br/>1.6     STUDY AREA<br/>1.6.1  Location and Size<br/>Abraka is located in the South-South zone of Nigeria. It is located in latitudes 050 471 and 050 501 North of the equator and longitudes 060001 and 060 081 East of the Greenwich Meridian. It is situated at the Eastern Bank of River Ethiope in Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria.<br/>          Abraka covers a total land area of 21.2 square kilometer (Ufuoma, 2000). In the North it is bounded by Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State, in the South, it is bounded by Ughelli Local Government Area of Delta State, in the East, it is bounded by Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State and in the west, it is bounded by Okpe Local Government Area of Delta State.<br/>          Abraka region is located in the Benin lowland (Udo, 1987). Abraka is in the Humid Tropical Climate with very high temperature between months of November and April. It may be as high as 250c to 310c.<br/>          Rainfall throughout the year is due to its location in the Niger Delta with monsoon wind continually blowing from the Atlantic Ocean. The wet and dry seasons are noticeable with annual rainfall between 2000mm to 3000mm.<br/>Table 1.1 Mean Monthly Rainfall Distribution (mm) in Abraka (1976-2005)<br/>J F M A M J J A S O N D Total 27 32 122.1 241.5 296.2 442.6 615.5 450.4 628.9 180.8 54.9 25.8 3097.8<br/>Source: Archive: Dept of Geography Weather Station: 1976-2005 (Efe, 2006)<br/>Table 1.2 Mean Monthly Temperature Distribution (0C) in Abraka (1976-2005)<br/>J F M A M J J A S O N D Mean 30.3 30.5 30.4 30.5 30.7 30.1 30.1 30.1 30 30.5 30.7 30.7 30.6<br/>Source: Archive: Dept of Geography Weather Station: 1976-2005 (Efe, 2006)<br/>Abraka as an urban area has experienced a rapid increase in size over the years, due to the presence of various administrative offices and governmental functions it performs both as the administrative and governmental functions. This is also as a result of the presence of the institution in the area. This attracts people from surrounding area, to itself, because of its employment opportunities and academic activities thus resulting in over-crowding, increased temperature, urban warming, among others leading to global warming.<br/>1.6.2  Population of the Study Area<br/>          There have been increases in the population of Abraka since 2005 when it was declared an urban centre by the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Urban Development (MLSUD), Asaba-Delta State. The population of Nigeria as a whole has been on the increase in recent times (Mabogunje, 1980). He gave two reasons; which are natural growth in the urban population and migration from other parts of the world. This can be attributed to Abraka region as it is one of the rapid urbanization towns in Nigeria due to the presence of tertiary institution. The presence of tertiary institution that have different programmes and other economic activities has been one of the major pull factors attracting people into Abraka and this has led to population explosion which contributed immensely to rapid economic and socio-economic development of Abraka urban. Apart from population growth the town has expanded from small town to an urban centre today engulfing the surrounding of Abraka rural due to its rapid urban development.<br/>The implication of these increase in size and population, is that it has led to population explosion in urban areas of Abraka which have in turn resulted in the alteration of the natural environment and its climate due to anthropogenic activates carried out in the area. This has in turn had adverse effect on the inhabitants of Abraka and its environs through global warming effects.<br/>1.6.3  Climate<br/>Abraka falls within the tropical environment that enjoys the tropical rainforest climate (AF) of Koppen in 1918 and the wet equatorial climate of Strahler in 1969. The climate is influenced by two masses; the tropical maritime air mass and tropical continental air mass. Abraka is region of the humid tropical climate with high temperature between the months of November and April with variation in temperature between 250c – 290c between April and October. The region of Abraka has an annual temperature of about 30.60c with a monthly mean temperature of 300c from September and 31.10c in June and July with an annual range in temperature between 30c and 50c. It is discovered in repeated studies that the average climatic rainfall in Abraka is about 2500mm annually. Abraka is placed into two seasons; the dry (Harmattan) and wet (rainy) season. However, Abraka experiences rainfall throughout the year owing to its location in the Niger Delta zone with the continual monsoon wind blowing from the Atlantic Ocean and also a continuous from shift in the Inter-Tropical Discontinuity (ITD) due to the movement of air masses.<br/>          The implication of these is that intense rise in temperature over the years have affected the inhabitants of Abraka through global warming effects.<br/>1.6.4  Vegetation<br/>Abraka is located on the equatorial rainforest which is evergreen forest and consist of three canopies of trees which are, the upper layer of which is about 60m tall, middle layer which is about 40m tall and the lower layer which is about 30m in height. The three major vegetation types in Abraka includes; the tropical rainforest belt, temperate grasslands and the grassland vegetation remains one of the key important factor which affect the climate of Abraka Region. Vegetation provides lumbering, medicinal purpose of Abraka region. The high amount of rainfall in Abraka aids the cultivation of crops like cassava and maize within the region. The influence of man has reduced the forest mainly to secondary growth (deciduous vegetation) due to agricultural practices and growing of various cash and food crops. This has in turn prone the environment direct sunlight which has resulted to intensive heating of the environment causing global warning due to lack of trees to act as shade and wind break.<br/>          The implication of these is that human activities have reduced the vegetation of Abraka to a secondary re-growth thereby exposing the environment to hazards such as intense temperature rise, flooding erosion, etc. which have in turn affected the inhabitants of Abraka through global warming effects.<br/>1.6.5  Geology and Soils<br/>Abraka is predominantly underlying sedimentary rock. Abraka lies in southern most sedimentary rock. Abraka lies in southern most sedimentary basis in Nigeria.<br/>          Abraka soil is acidic in nature. Abraka soil varies from coarse through medium to fine grained soils. The soils of Abraka can be said to be sandy loam. The colour of the soil is greenish brown to reddish brown and then to brown. The light grayish colouration characterizes the entire sandy portion of the soil, while the reddish brown colouration depicts the presence of ion oxide in the soil. This colouration depicts the availability of mineral matters and moisture. Abraka soil is poorly structured in relation to its type in terms of grain size, pore spaces which greatly influences the rate of percolation and capillarity, aeration and the rate of evaporation.<br/>          The implication of these is that human activities have exposed the soil to erosional activates and flooding making the soil inferity for agricultural acuities, etc. which have in turn affected the inhabitants of Abraka region who rely on farming for their source of livelihood.<br/>1.6.6  Relief and Drainage System<br/>          Abraka and its environs are drained by two major rivers, River Ethiope and River Ovwuvwe.<br/>          Most communities in Abraka are located in the upland in between these Rivers. The drainage pattern of River Ethiope is dentritic in nature. These rivers serves as recreational and tourist centers, major sources of water to the populace, mining sites for sand stones, religious activities and agricultural activities just to mention but a few.<br/>          Abraka and its environs lies within the low land area of Nigeria, with 50m above sea level. Also, it is only about 45km from the coast of Nigeria. Abraka has a low relief of gentle hilly flat surface with an anticline nature i.e. having an elevation of less than or equal to 60 which in the north shell can also be linked ion classification with the interior coastal landmass of western Nigeria.<br/>          The porous nature of the Abraka soil coupled with the undulating landform absorbs much heat which radiates to the atmosphere thereby altering the climate of the area which may be responsible for high temperature in Abraka resulting to global warming.<br/>1.6.7  Socio-economic Activities<br/>The government of Ethiope East and Delta State at large has in recent time embarked on rehabilitation of existing, socio-economic, infrastructure such as roads, portable water, rural electrification, educational facilities, health facilities, stadium and other socio amenities. The government have areas such as revolutionalized changes and improvement in areas such as Education, Health, Agriculture, cooperative movement, commerce and market development, industrialization, Youth and sports development, etc. Town Unions, Private Individuals and associations, being part of voluntary agencies, have played active roles in the development of educational infrastructure, tourism and recreational facilities in the region.<br/>          In terms of transportation, the tricycle mode of transportation in Abraka has aided not only in the facilitation of movement of people and information but also in provision of employment, income and increases the standard of living of both motorcyclist, tricyclist and commercial transports.<br/>          In terms of commerce, the Abraka region entails sales of varieties of food crops which are produced locally such as yam, plantain, banana etc. alongside none food products. The physical structure of the Abraka market (Centre of Commerce) and other neigbouring stores being poorly planned has really affected the rate of commerce with regard to drainage, indiscriminate waste disposal at market site which has a resultant effect on the health standard of food crops for consumption sold in the market. This mismanaged waste produce heat which makes the environment inhabitable and thus results in the alteration of the climate which brings about global warming.<br/>          In terms of its settlement, Abraka is characterized with primary and secondary settlement. Primary settlement includes residential buildings, hospitals, health care centres and schools while secondary settlements are hostels, filling stations, factories etc. There is no doubt today that settlement pattern and characteristics has played a major role in the socio-economic development of Abraka region and have over the years boast the socio-economic activities of the region.<br/>          The people of Abraka region practice both subsistence and commercial agriculture in which food and cash crops are produced. They engage in mixed cropping and crop rotation farming method as their major type of agricultural practices. Over the years, agriculture has provided food, employment, sources of income, etc. to the inhabitants of Abraka region.<br/>          Generally speaking, the enormous emotion of poisonous gases and substances from motor vehicles, engines, tricycles etc into the atmosphere has polluted the environment and altered the climate of the area thereby resulting to global warming.<br/>1.7     Scope/Delimitation of the Study<br/>The scope of this study is restricted to the influence of urbanization on climate with emphasis on the effects of global warming in Nigeria using Abraka as a case study. The project is also restricted to some selected areas of study: these include Abraka P.O (Urban area of study), Ekrerejeta, Abraka Inland (rural area of study), Ajalomi, Erho, Oria, Urhuovie, Ugono and a control rural area (such as Umeghe and Urhagbesa).<br/>          However, this research work was limited by number of factors, amongst which are finance, time and physical constraints. But these constraints did not deprive the researcher from reaching dependable results.<br/>1.8     Definition of Terms<br/>·         Global warming:- The increase in temperature of the earth’s atmosphere, that is caused by the increase of particular gases especially carbon dioxide.<br/>·         Green House Gas Effect:- The problem of the gradual rise in temperature of the earth’s atmosphere, caused by an increase of gases such as carbon dioxide in the air surrounding the earth, which trap the heat of the sun.<br/>·         Climate:- The synthesis of weather over 30yers at a particular time within a given location.<br/>·         Weather:- The state of the atmosphere at a particular point in time within a given location.<br/>·         Climate Change:- The alteration or variation of climate from its original state when studied for a long time.<br/>·         Environment:- The surrounding around man in space.<br/>·         Town:- Large settlement usually harbouring thousand of facilities.<br/>·         Urban Area:- Characteristics of a city.<br/>·         Rural Area:- An area normally called a village infrastructure- foundation of a system to develop a place heads together.<br/>·         Community:- Body of people living in the same area.<br/>·         Temperature:- The degree of hotness or coldness of a human body.<br/>         Relief:- The nature and terrain of a area.<br/>·         Development:- To increase or grow gradually.<br/>·         Growth:- An increase in the size, amount or degree of something.<br/>·         Gas:- Any substance like air that is neither a solid nor a liquid.<br/>·         Effect:- A change that something or somebody causes in something or somebody else.

The analysis revealed that residents are of high density zone with their occupation of householders being served as basis for establishing status. It assumes that the status of a person translates into his earning, which also influences his choice of location and type of housing to reside. During the research, it was discovered  that most residents live in inadequate housing that lack basic infrastructure and facilities. The high density neighborhoods are unplanned and unsafe with poor sanitary condition. The condition of the neighborhoods allows us to conclude that such locations have suffered long neglect by government with respect to infrastructure development, provision of social amenities, and enforcement of development control standards.
