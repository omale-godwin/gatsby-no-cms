IMO STATE)<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>In the early centuries cooperative societies have been in existence This is to say that they started even before the creation of the Earth. There was cooperation between the holy spirits or trimly ( that is God the father God the son and God the holy spirit) which led to the achievement of the creation of the world. This was as a result of certain factors.<br/>In addition at the time of the stone age men and the wonders there was need for cooperation. This occurred at the agricultural sector through it was limited within families. After some time things begins to improved and it came a time when there was communal farming system. This occurred because of certain factors and because there is need for it.<br/>Further more countries began to relate in businesses exchanging goods and services from one country to another or from one state to among countries. Certain factors gave rise to that because there is need for it. That is to say that nothing achieving can come into existence without needs for it or without needs for it or without certain factors which must have led to it indeed these factors leading to cooperation among people states. Countries and the world at large are not for fetch but are those desires that needs to be satisfied or measured. These factors as put under this introductory section can be either positive or negative.<br/>1.1 STATEMENT OF THE FACTORS<br/>As indicated earlier the factors that can influence the establishment of cooperatives can either be positive or negative. These factors as well differs from state to state country to country etc. But the most important is the type of cooperative or its members involved in its operations.<br/>In recent times a lot of persons and scholars have tried to talk on the factors that can influence the establishment of cooperates. This is because slot of people and to their own understanding has failed to understand what these factors are .rather they often mistake it for motives. So to say these worlds are two different things altogether. At the later side of this project the difference between factors and motives well be talked on.<br/>However in Owerri L.G.A Imo state there are a lot of factors that can influence cooperative establishment. According to Mr L.M. Ejwnye (principal register of cooperatives Imo state) he said that the factors that influence cooperative establishment in Owerri L.G.A Imo state .<br/>In essence this factors are those things needs or desires or even set back that has led to identifications of needs there by organizing together for the purpose of establishment.<br/>Despite these factors that has led to the establishment of cooperatives a lot of these cooperative society still fails and closes up and this occurs as a result of certain factors as well.<br/>1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>This academic exercise is meant to appraise the feasibility of the factors that can influence the establishment of cooperatives and the socio-economic standard of cooperatives member and its society at large in Owerri L.G.A Imo state. These factors are as follow;<br/>a. To know how these factors has helped cooperatives its members and generally the public at large.<br/>b. To know how these factors have led to the establishment of cooperatives in Owerri L.G.A.<br/>c. To know the number of cooperatives that has failed in Owerri L.G.A.<br/>d. To ascertain the number of cooperatives that are still in existence in Owerri L.G.A Imo state.<br/>e. To ascertain the achievement of cooperatives in the economy of Owerri L.G.A, Imo state.<br/>f. To bring foreword how much cooperatives has helped to reduce unemployment in Owerri L.G.A, Imo state<br/>g. To find on the problems militating against the establishment of cooperatives in Owerri L.G.A, Imo state.<br/>1.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Cooperatives have done a lot in the development of many countries or nations. In countries like Krael, Denmark, Sweden, India, Britain etc. cooperatives has played vital role in sectors like manufacturing distributions and even consummation.<br/>At the end of this research many people will find out the importance of cooperatives to human existence. This involves the above mentioned;<br/>a. The government both the federal state and local government.<br/>b. The society in general<br/>c. The cooperative section and<br/>d. The general academics<br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>a. What are the factors that can influence the establishment of cooperatives in Imo state ?<br/>b. In what ways can these factors really influence the establishment of cooperatives in Imo state?<br/>c. Are these f actors negative or positive<br/>d. What are those negative factors that can influence the establishment of cooperative in Imo state?<br/>e. As a result of these factors, how many cooperatives are viable in Imo state<br/>f. What are the likely causes that has led to their failure?<br/>1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>The study covers the extent of those factors that can influence the establishment of cooperative society in Imo state . It went further discussing the importance or objectives of the cooperatives in Imo state. Also the factors that led leads to their failure.<br/>Further more the study covers an extent of cooperative that are viable and non viable societies in Imo state.<br/>1.6 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>A lot of circumstances dismounted the extent of this research. One of the major circumstance is time which restricted the researchers from collecting and gathering materials from cooperative department (or in Road secretariat) Imo state. There was no time to collect other questionnaires sent out.<br/>Secondly finance was another constraint that restricted movement from various cooperative offices.<br/>Thirdly protocols in getting the right source to feed the researcher with useful information and details. I was striated from one area office to the other and from one zonal office to another and finally to the head quarters of cooperative department.<br/>Finally my school programmes was another major constraint that compelled my movement to be timely and limited.<br/><br/>\n\nCOOPERATIVES – FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE ESTABLISHMENT IN IMO STATE: (A CASE STUDY OF OWERRI L.G.A.

This study is a descriptive survey which involves the collection of statistics for the purpose of describing the role of cooperative societies in economic development. This study posit that for over one hundred and sixty years on cooperatives have been an effective way for people to exert control over their economic livelihoods as they play an increasingly important role in facilitating job creation, economics growth and social development.<br/>        The economic importance of cooperative societies in a modern economy the branch  always supports all the society activities which are reflected in the form of services and benefits for its shareholders and the area residents thus revealing true nature as to achieving and added value to the society through its contributions in the economic development efforts, furthermore, Al-Kamali (2000) stressed that the Al-Qasr branch is constantly in constant with various clients segments in the area and works on reinforcing relationship and field of cooperation in order to service the area resident, whether through the cooperative society or other body’s the project investigate the effective and successful, cooperative must achieve two interrelated goals, enhances viability and improve ability to service its members and retain an economically viable innovative and competitive, enterprise. In most industrial countries like United State of America and  United Kingdom the problems of cooperative are very acute and this problem retards the growth of the economy of these nations it is therefore necessary for government to employ the quality comparative experts in government establishment.     <br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>This study intends to highlights the economic importance of cooperative societies in a modern economy a case study of cooperative societies in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>In the course of the study, the researcher will attempt to achieve the following objective; to analyze the possible solution to the problem that may affect cooperative societies in a modern economy. <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study can be clearly understood when the purpose of the study and its concern is taken into consideration this research is being carried out for the purpose of importance of cooperative societies in modern economy in Ovia North East Local Government Area. <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>For the purpose of this study Ovia North East Local Government Area in Edo State of Nigeria has been selected as case study.

A review of feminist literature indicates that there is now a demand for re-orientation of research and changes in methodological procedures used for complication of national income. There are at least three stands to this firstly; there is the issue that a considerable portion of women’s labour is not reflection in Ovia North East Local Government statistics. This is a phenomenon due to the fact that the labour of the house wife is not traded and valued at market prices.<br/>        Secondly, there is the formal versus informal sector issue. On a worldwide basis, but more so in the developing countries of the world women constitute the greater percentage of the informal sector labour forces. Thirdly, there is the rural-urban dichotomy more than not; women are left behind when there is male migration from rural to urban areas. These three issues are mutually self explanatory as women get left behind in the rural areas. They have limited opportunities for self improvement. They are therefore suitable mainly informal sector employment. Their labour as house wives, house maids etc is not accurately affected in nation statistics. Another relevant issue is that where women are in selection for religions or social reasons, enumerators who are more often men cannot meet the women to accurately appraise their labour input.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS    <br/>        The basic premise of this essay is that the non involvement or marginalization of women in development programmes is wasteful and impedes effective economic development. Its effect is similar to inadequate use of factor of production in agriculture which means that the production possibilities curve is lower than it should be on the basis of this premise, the problem associated with the involvement of women in the economic development of Edo State and strategies of solving these problems are discussed.<br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>        The objective of this paper is therefore to highlight the role of women in economic development of Ovia North East Local Government Area in Edo State with view to identifying attendant problem and suggesting possible solution.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        It is hoped that this study will be useful in selecting appropriate rural women in Ovia North East Local Government Area. it is also hoped that it will help the rural women in producing and advertising their products.<br/>        Finally, it is my hope that the project work will justify the economic investment in rural women in Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Does transportation problem put a serious problem in the rural women farmers?<br/>Is inadequate finance a problem to rural women farmers?<br/>Does diseases outbreak affects their products?<br/>Does bad road affect rural women farmers?  <br/>Does an inadequate material affect their product?<br/>SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>        The study focuses on economic development of rural women farmers in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. Edo State is made up of local government area. As a result of time and financial constrains book on social studies and geography of Edo State which relate to economic contribution of women in Edo State are consulted.

In carrying out this research, the area of questionnaire and other secondary means were adopted to collect the required data. It was observed that a reasonable percentage of these cooperative societies had appreciable impact on members and communities in which they are located. The study also revealed that these societies also have some constraints which include mis-management, overdue loans, embezzlement and lack of frequent meetings. In the light of the constraint, some useful suggestions were made as a way of enhancing cooperative in the Local Government Area. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Chapter One                <br/>1.1        Introduction<br/>1.2        Purpose of the study<br/>1.3        Objective of the study<br/>1.4        Scope of study<br/>1.5        Limitation of the study<br/>Chapter Two      <br/>Literature  Review <br/>Chapter Three   <br/>3.0        Introduction<br/>3.1        Population of study<br/>3.2        Administration and collections of questionnaires<br/>Chapter Four     <br/>4.1        Introduction<br/>4.2        Analysis<br/>Chapter Five      <br/>Conclusion and Recommendations<br/>5.1        Summary of findings<br/>5.2        Conclusion<br/>5.3        Recommendations<br/>References        <br/>Questionnaires            <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>The study is carried out to identify the research importance of cooperative society in Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State. Orhionmwon Local Government Area is situated in the Southern and Eastern left bank of the river Nigeria. The area is bounded on the worth by Kogi State on the East by river Niger, on Etsako West, Etsako East, Etsako Central and Etsako North. The administrative headquarters of Orhionmwon Local Government Area is Abudu most of the inhabitant are farmers who main produce are yams,  cassava, rubber, coffee and cocoa. There are also traders who trade on food items clothes and petty retail shops are also found in the area. The prominent mineral found in Orhionmwon is lime stone and as such Okpella cement factory is located there.<br/>The report on the introduction of cooperative societies in Nigeria by strict land shows that cooperative societies began to develop in Nigeria about 1925 with the appointment of a registrar of cooperative. A cocoa marketing society was formed in 1925 in Gbedum and many others where later formed. It can therefore be said that, at present many types of cooperative societies exist in Nigeria. They include, agricultural produce marketing societies, consumer cooperative societies, thrift and loans societies and multi-purpose cooperative societies. Some of these societies now exist in Orhionmwon Local Government Area. The cooperative societies were established in Uzairue in 1933 and they were mainly farm produce cooperative society. To this effect, cooperative societies are very important economically; this does not means that they do not have some problem research is therefore an attempt to investigate the favourable and unfavourable impact of cooperative societies in Orhionmwon.          <br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Cooperative societies is of great economic importance in Orhionmwon Local Government Area even with even with these economic importance they still face a lot of problem in the area of formation and activities of the existing cooperative societies in Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State.     <br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The general purpose of the study is to critically examine the;<br/>Economic importance of cooperative societies<br/>To identify problems militating against their performance in Orhionmwon Local Government Area<br/>To provide recommendation which will help both the people and the government in organizing better organized cooperative societies in the area<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>It is hoped that at the end of the study, the findings will help  to reveal the economic importance of cooperative societies in Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>The following research questions were formulated; <br/>The moiré effective the management of cooperative societies the higher the level of satisfaction derived by customers.<br/>Lack of education and awareness has made the people to neglect the importance of cooperative societies in the area.<br/>The higher the membership, the larger the fund available to the cooperative.  <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is limited to Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State, it was carried out to examine the economic importance of cooperative societies in the area.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES: A CASE STUDY OF ORHIONMWON LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES: A CASE STUDY OF ORHIONMWON LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF MEDIA IN ENCOURAGE ADULT PARTICIPATION IN COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES</b></p><p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/> INTRODUCTION<br/> &lt;&gt;1.0BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/> Cooperative society is a group of people who have bunched themselves together to carry on a business enterprise for the benefit of all of the members, which acting as an individual could not do or could do well. Cooperative then is the organization of a group of people who have provided their own self help user group enterprise. It is an association of persons, usually of limited means, who have voluntarily joined together to achieved a common economic end through the formation of a democratically controlled business organization making equitable contribution to the capital required and accepting a fair share of the risks and benefits of the undertaking. Cooperative society objectives are to foster economic development, provide social justice and strengthening political democracy (Ebonyi and Jimo 2002).<br/> So many claims and counter claims have been made by researchers, concerning the historical development of cooperative such as Benjamin Franklins: Mutual Fire Insurance company in Philadelphia in 1752, International Cooperative society founded in Lennoxton in Scotland in 1812, Robert Owen era, Dr. William King (1825-1830) and Rochdale Equitable pioneers (Ntia 1999).<br/> Cooperative societies as we know today, are based on a set of principles. These principles have been used as the distinguishing characteristics of the cooperative organization the world over. They included open membership, democratic control, promotion of members education, political and religious neutrality limited interest on capital and service at cost.<br/> The aims of cooperative organizations are to establish credit agencies thereby permitting greater productive investments of accumulated capital funds, impart business management into other areas both horizontally and vertically, to accumulate capital in various ways including the pulling of members investments to assists in the development of other cooperative institution necessary for the establishment of general economic and social development. It is critical that the attainment of these objectives transcends the singular activities of the cooperative organization members and necessarily entails the activities of others bodies outside the organization.<br/> There are various types of cooperative societies in Nigeria. Important among these are the farmers or Agricultural cooperatives which consist of produce marketing, credit and thrift, group farming and fish farming societies, (b) cooperative building societies (c) crafts and Artisan Artisan societies (d) consumer cooperative like the cooperatives Banks and Printing press.<br/> Government initiative or participation is usually needed to establish cooperative organization in Nigeria. Such participation may be in the form of providing training schools, research, regulations grants and preferential treatments in procurement direct organization.<br/> Adult participation is the engagement in activities with others. Being a member and taking part in a group activities is group or social participation. Participation in most formal associations has been measured in terms of holding of membership regular attendance at meetings, holding workshops, symposium debate, Discussions listening to Radio, watching television, Demonstration visit and excursions, using posters and pamphlets, leaflets Articles in news papers and periodicals serving in committies going out to actually work for the association. Thus participation is often thought of in terms of opportunity for social interaction in formal groups as well as identification with the groups  ideal and objectives (Ekong, 2003).<br/> The media is all formal channels of mass communication. It is an indispensable institution in every society. Given its basic function of information disseminating, the media becomes a crucial element of the social system. It ensures general diffusion of knowledge about life, thus influencing many aspect of the social cultural, political and economic pattern of the society. But when the media is not used in any organization, it brings problem for people to participate very well in any organization. The thrust of this study therefore, is to examine the problems associated with use of media in encouraging societies.<br/><br/><br/></p> \n\nPROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF MEDIA IN ENCOURAGE ADULT PARTICIPATION IN COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF MEDIA IN ENCOURAGE ADULT PARTICIPATION IN COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE IMPACT OF SOCIO- ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS ON LOAN REPAYMENT, <br/>AMONG COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISES IN OSHIMILI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>  This research study adopted an econometric analysis on The Impact of Socio-Economic Characteristics On Loan Repayment Among Cooperative Enterprises In Oshimili South Local Government Area of Delta State.

Co-operative societies need funds to finance their fixed and working capital, to pay for services and for making interest-yielding investments. Lack of funds had featured prominently among the key constraints to co-operative business enterprise in Nigeria even at normal times. We can then imagine, or rather, we are all aware of the situation under the prevailing excruciating business climate in Nigeria. (Chukwuemeka, 2001).<br/> The issue of funds has become critical, as expectations, opportunities for small-scale enterprise cannot be seized due to a general lack of investible funds. Added to the abolition of subsidies, the results is fewer resources, tougher competition, higher capital cost and reduced access to credit. This is more so because cheap government credit on which co-operatives relied heavily in the 1980s has since dried up, many banks have gone  from distress to bankruptcy, and the surviving ones have constricted their lending. Many people and organizations including co-operative lost their deposits in collapsed banks and finance houses during 1990s. Indeed, the ‘banking culture’, the cultivation of which has been seen as one of the necessary conditions for savings mobilization among small and medium enterprises operators has worn off considerably in view of the aforementioned travails of the financial sector in Nigeria. Worse still, donors in Europe and America, especially the United States, that great watershed of bilateral and multi-lateral aid funds for various assistance program are suffering donor fatigue. Thus small and medium enterprises general are severally hit. But co-operatives which have always been the least able to raise finance capital, appears to be worst affected.<br/> Today, many co-operative are hobbled by a weak capital base, limited credit worthiness and are therefore not in a position to compete effectively with rival business interests. It is on this background that the research tends to review the source of funds available to co-operative society and identify inherent constraints to<br/>proper funding of co-operative business enterprises; with a view to stimulating thoughts as to ways and means of deepening and extending them.<br/> 1.1      Background of the study <br/> In the mid to late 1970s, it was relatively easy for cooperative societies to raise investment funds. A lot of funds were available on concessionary terms from specialized credit institutions such as the Nigerian Agricultural and cooperative Bank and the Central Bank (NACB) managed Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Funds (ACGSF), which encouraged lending practices through Sundry Channels. In 1977 the Rural Banking programme further boosted the pool of funds, which cooperatives could source for investment. In addition to these opportunities, special government food production and rural development programmes like the National Accelerated Food Production Programme (NAFPP:1973), the Green Revolution (1980-1983), the Operation Feed the Nation (1976-1979) provided opportunities for rapid expansion of credit to cooperative societies. All these institutions and programmes operated from the praxis of the old theory of rural credit in which it was assumed that rural production enterprises (including cooperatives) were poor and helpless and needed cheap supply-leading government credit to remain active.<br/> However, the combined effect of the oil price crises, global recession, Austerity measures of 1982 and the Structural Adjustment programme (SAP) Since 1986 drastically rolled back all those opportunities. Many cooperative societies that could not adapt to the new climate had since either wound up or gone moribund. When government took bold steps to mitigate the harsh effects of its adjustment measures by establishing such institutions and funds small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Funds, Peoples’ Bank (PB), Better Life For Rural Women Programme, Family Support Programme, the Directorate for Food, Roads and Rural Infrastructures and the Directorate for Social Mobilization (MAMSER) all of which had special recognition for cooperatives as<br/> avenues for channeling funds to productive activities, we expected a brighter prospect for cooperatives.<br/>  However, not many of them took advantage of such opportunities.<br/> 1.2  Statement of the Problem<br/> Most co-operative societies are under funded, thereby making the diversification of projects slow. This arises from the fact that financial structure of the co-operative does not provide enough finance, which results in productivity. Many of co-operators in Nigeria, have quite often lamented the impediments on their way as they try to raise funds for the operations of their co-operative society.<br/> However, co-operative are subject to frustrations of all small and medium enterprises in Nigeria such as lack of collateral, general lack of credit, worthiness in the estimation of potential lenders, and high interest rate structure and so on. In this regard, both government and finance houses have not lived up to expectation. At timesgovernment does not give grants and loans to the co-operatives.<br/> Besides, co-operatives are affected by the peculiarities inherent in their nature and structure: the principle, laws and regulations guiding them. Notably, share contribution is not combined with higher direct influence in the society’s affairs according to the principle of one member, and vote, therefore, member are often reluctant to contribute more than the minimum. In most co-operative societies, the amount of money that can be raised through issue of shares in too low as directed consequence of low membership size and general poverty of the members.<br/> Managers and leaders of co-operative societies in Nigeria on their part, have become too used to easy hand outs from government to be innovative in their fund raising activities. Besides, they often are not able to conceive bankable projects.<br/> These unfavorable financial constraints therefore lead to poor performance of the co-operative movement. Finding ways to overcome these and other obstacles is a major challenge of the co-operative movement in Nigeria.<br/> 1.3      Objectives of the study <br/> The broad objective of the study is to examine the challenges in the financing of co-operative enterprises- A case study of some selected co-operatives in Asaba, Oshimili South Local Government Area of Delta State. Specifically, the study aims to:-<br/>i)            Examine the socio-economic characteristics of the members;<br/>ii)          Identify the internal and external sources of funds open to the co-operative enterprise;<br/>iii)           Examine the inherent constraints to the proper funding of co-operative enterprise;<br/>iv)         Ascertain the income raised internally by the cooperative societies.<br/>v)           Examine the amount of loan requested, disbursed, and repaid.<br/> vi)         Ascertain the impact of some variables on loan repayment.<br/>   vii)       Make recommendations based on the findings.<br/> 1.4      Significance of the Study <br/> This research work intends to empirically investigate the determinants of loan repayment under the indigenous financial system. Considering the fact, that low repayment of loans by cooperative enterprises in turn affects the amount of credit given to cooperative by commercial banks.<br/> The importance of this study lies on the fact that no project could be executed without a functional financial structure. If co-operative societies do not have access to an input that is most essential for their development such as finance, their situation is critical. This is because project execution cannot be successful without funds just as it is impossible for individual to live in the absence of all needs and necessity of life such as food, shelter and clothes among others. Therefore, the business organization needs finance as the life wire and blood for its survival.<br/>  1.5      Research Questions <br/>1.          What are the Socio-economic profiles of the members?<br/>2.          What are the sources of funds open to the co-operative business?<br/>3.          Which of the major sources of finance is more convenient and reliable to the society<br/>4.          What is the major problem encountered in the operation of the co-operative enterprise?<br/>5.          What are the factors militating against co-operative enterprise in raising funds?<br/>6.          What are the variables influencing loan repayment by cooperative enterprises?<br/> 1.6      Research Hypotheses <br/> Ho: Socio-economic variables do not significantly affect loan repayment by cooperative societies.<br/>Hi: Socio-economic variables significantly affect loan repayment by cooperative societies.<br/>1.7      Scope of the study <br/> The scope of any study examines or views the areas, which the study intends to cover. The study covers co-operative enterprises operating in Asaba, Oshimili South Local Government Area of Delta State.<br/> This research work, focuses extensively on how co-operative enterprises are financed with more attention on the determinants of loan repayment, as well as challenges encountered in the proper funding of co-operative enterprises. Possible measures to be taken to improve on the financing of co-operative enterprises were also identified.<br/> 1.8      Limitation of the Study <br/> The uncooperative attitude of members of the various co-operation societies covered posed a major constraint. This is because after assurance, most of them still believe that the study will in one way or the other jeopardizes their business and therefore withheld vital information relevant for the study. Also, financial constraints and time frame for the completion of this research work are as well limiting Factors.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF SOCIO- ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS ON LOAN REPAYMENT,AMONG COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISES IN OSHIMILI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF SOCIO- ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS ON LOAN REPAYMENT,AMONG COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISES IN OSHIMILI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF THE ORGNS IN THE DEVELOPEMTN OF CROP IN NIGERIA<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF THE COOPERATIVE FEDERATION OF ANAMBRA STATE)<br/>ABTRACTS</b><br/>Over the years, there has been a high rate of business failure in both private and public  sector . analysis and the review of the problem has shown that the provision of capital and technology alone cannot avert the situation.

It is found throughout the whole world. We found in capitalist countries, in socialist countries and sometimes, countries, which are regarded to have what we called mixed economy. They are found in the developing countries or third world countries.<br/>The owed co-operative that has come tousled as an adjectival noun is from the verb to co-operate or the noun cooperation. The term co-operation can be used as a generic term covering a wild area of activity in which tow or more people join together whether formally or not formally on abhor on legally or illegally or socially accepted or unaccepted action to archive some aims. Su h action may be selfish in nature or by be the public good or in the interest of those performing the action without it being detrimental to any one else. It also use in narrower sense to mean activity undertaking by co-operatives and other self-help organization.<br/> G.J Holyoake, one the foremost British co-operative pioneer, propagandist and author bring out this two meaning succinctly with borders on the definition and charat3eristics of the co-operative according to Holyoke, co-operative is an organized self help by honest labour and honest trade; the profit been equitably divided among those who created them whether by word of mouth or by brain. That is what we understand as industrial co-operatives.<br/>There is a familiar use of the word co-operation which mean two or more people or thing acting together to produce result as when man and lever gets together to move long or a cat’s paw or employed to pull chestnut form the fire, or as when physician marries the daughter of undertaker with a view to uniting the business. In the cases the log is not consulted, the cats get no chestnuts. The owner is not plundered by the two thief unite and the patient dose not profit by the patient of the pestle and the spade , to the general public, the act of concert equally mean co-operatives. We mean by the word, the co-operation of honest industry with a view for equitable share of the profit and if the laborer and the trader be not honest, the public is cheated and the co-operation will be an organize form of fraud.<br/>On the character of a true co-operation, He writes, in the same work that co-operation mean concern for the diffusion of wealth. It leaves no body out who help to produce it. It touches no man fortune, it seeks no plunder, it causes no disturbance in the society, it gives no trouble to statement, it enter no secret association, it needs no trade union to protect its interest. It contemplates no violence, it subverts no order. it loses not dignity . It accepts no guilt or ask for any favour. It keeps no time with the idle and will break no faith with the industrious. It neither mendicant, servile nor offensive, it has its hands in no man’s pocket and dose not mean that any hand shall remain long and comfortable in its own. It means self-help, dependency, as such share of common competence as labour shall earn or thought shall win.<br/> According to professor Caselman, co-operation is an economic system with a social context. According to professor Ernest Gruenfeld, a German, a co-operative is an association made up of social weak person endeavoring to archive certain social aim within the framework of and enterprise open to all and based on the rule of solidarity and democracy.<br/> Berko, a Ghanian (1987, P.13) define co-operative thus; an association of person with variable membership who have pulled themselves and their resources together on manual or self-help basis to form business organization which seeks to solve the economic problem and socio economic problem of the members by directly providing goods and service to them in their capacity as either he costumers or the employee of the co-operative enterprise. He goes father to mention he ingredient that will contain in a co-operative society. Every one has its own definition of co-operative, but the one which is generally accepted is that of the ICA, that a co-operative society is an association of person who have voluntarily joined together to archive a common end through the formation of democratically controlled organization making equitable contribution to the capital required and accepting a fair share of risk and benefits of the undertaking in which the members actively participate. They are for the common people “ a mechanism for the defense and emancipation to combat the harsh condition brought about by the mercantile economy.<br/> The co-operative movement started in the 19th century during the time of industrial revolution in Britain. The first successful co-operative society. The rochadel Equitable pioneers was founded in 1844 by twenty-eight ideavers.<br/>The origin of co-operative in Anambra can traced to the origin of co-operative I Nigeria. The first attempt of forming a modern co-operative society was initiated at Agege a predominantly coca farming area in Yoruba land. The co-operative movement in Nigeria is about fifty years old. Its history date back to early 1930’s when the British government having successfully introduces co-operatives in India and 1912 tried to bring it into Nigeria. The Nigerian government in 1933 appointed Mr. C.F Strickland to study the possibility of introducing co-operative in Nigeria. Mr. Strickland strongly recommended the introduction of co-operative society into Nigeria and his report submitted in April 1934 forms the corner stone for the introduction of modern co-operative into Nigeria. Mr. Strickland also drafted a proposed ordinance and regulations. His report was accepted and quietly implemented. A register of co-operative in the name of Mr. E.A.F.G Haig was appointed and send for training oversea. Mr. Haig studied the India co-operative and modified in Nigeria. The first job of the new register was to re-organize the cocoa farmers society and union, which were already marketing the best quality cocoa in the country. The second task was to bring them under the protection of the law. The co-operative society ordinance of No. 39 of the 1935 was assented to in the name of the king of England on the 3rd the December 1935 and the regulation made thereafter came into force on the 16the February 1936. co-operation continued to progress and by 1951, following the reorganization, the co-operative movement came under the supervision of various regional government vis; east west and north. In 1944, the co-operative federation of Nigeria was formed which supervise by the staff of the co-operative division that is attached to one ministry or the other. In the formal Anambra state, the co-operative is in the ministry of trade and the director of co-operatives heads the co-operative service. The co-operative federation of Anambra state was registered in 1991 under the provision of the revised co-operative law of the eastern Nigerian cap.28 of 1963 as No. 1722 of 24th December 1991. Is registered office was located at No 321 Enugu road Awka. However, the co-operative federation of Anambra state was created from the old Anambra state co-operative movement.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Co-operative societies in the Nigeria today are faced with a lot of problem. The problems go a long way to hampering their growth and prospects in the country and thereby limiting their potential contribution to the development and upliftment of our distressed economy. Such problem is;<br/>A.     Managerial malady of the affaires of the co-operative federation of Anambra state.<br/>B.      Lack of appreciation of responsibility is society committee. This led to the dishonest practice between employee and the prejudices granting of loan and advance.<br/>C.      They are usually under-capitalized and find financial institutions.<br/>D.     They keep poor accounting and operational records<br/>E.      Poor service condition for the co-operative staff. Al categories of staff are poorly remunerated and are well taking care of.<br/>F.       Experts are not often employed because of low capital outlay involved. There is also government interference in the activity of the co-operative movement<br/>The researcher will focus attention on the impact of the co-operative apex with a particular reference to co-operative federation of Anambra state ltd (COFAS) and what the management should do to alleviate the problem hindering the economic emancipation and opportunity available to COFAS for the development of co-operatives in Anambra state which will be determine through the use of questionnaire and sample survey at the apex society cited and how the management policy of the apex should be fashioned to march the objective of the researcher.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>Generally, the purpose of this study is to find out ways by which the co-operative Apex will help in the development o-operatives in Anambra state.<br/>It is especially;<br/>To critically analyze the activities of the co-operative Apex their inherent problem with the view of proffering solution to them<br/>To create awareness for the government group and individual in the society to know their responsibility toward developing co-operatives in the state.<br/>To provide a highlight of the achievement of COFAS in the state so far and area where they have failed to address which is their line of duty<br/>To aid in projecting the economic importance of the co-operatives in the society <br/>To identify and examine the organizational structure of the co-operative federation of Anambra state.<br/>To examine the operation and management of the case study<br/>To identify the source and use of funds<br/>To identify the problem militating against the co-operative management of COFAS and suggesting way of improving the state Apex. Also how they are assisting in improving the primary, secondary, and the tertiary society.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is very important in the society. The co-operatives is an organization which help in the entire economic growth. Its benefit improves the standard of living in the society. To a very large extent, the co-operatives drastically reduce the unemployment saga. The finding of the study will go long way in helping the management of the co-operative federation of Anambra state and all co-operative society of primary and secondary level to adept and solve problem of poor management.<br/>This will enable the state apex to gain support and loyalty of government since it is a society at a federal level.<br/>In some secondary and primary society, it will be of benefit for growth and formulation of other society to the help the masses.<br/>This work will be very useful for reference research work. it will be of benefit to anyone who will have the time to go through it especially the department of co-operative and management studies.<br/>It is however said that the need foe most researcher is the collection and interpretation of data and those other motive inspire the researcher work as it is a continues exercise.<br/>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>The work covers the activity of co-operative federation of Anambra state (COFAS). In projection co-operation in the state, the procedure involve in registering co-operatives, how to make a co-operative federation to stand and he benefit of the members of the society in general. The problem affecting rapid development of co-operative in the state were also treated and possible remedies to the problem were also provided. Personally, the researcher wills term the scope –“COFAS” – the journey to far.<br/>In the course of this study, time was a major problem. There were no enough time to effectively combine the research work and the academic study. The fact-finding exercise was very difficult. The researcher visited the case study on several occasions for face owing to the nature of the work. The staff were not always in the office or free to grant interviews and give some data.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/> 1.          What are the activities of the co-operative federation of Anambra state (COFAS), and how those it come to be?<br/>2.          How many primary and secondary co-operatives are in Anambra state (its affiliates)?<br/>3.          Since they are co-operative at the state level, what are the requirement of the town and local co-operative society need so that they will be supervise?<br/>4.          What are the problems that hinder smooth growth and running of the COFAS in the state?<br/>5.          What are the impacts they have made in developing the co-operative society of Anambra state?<br/>6.          What benefit do members and the society in general drives from the COFAS?<br/>7.          How do they create awareness for government and individual in the society to know their responsibility towards developing co-operative in the state?<br/>8.          How do they identify the functions and source of fund used in the operation of the society?<br/>9.          Dose COFAS has an operational base outside Awka?<br/>10.      What are the activities of COFAS?<br/>11.      What is the staff strength and their quality?<br/><br/>\n\nTHE STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF THE ORGNS IN THE DEVELOPEMTN OF CROP IN NIGERIA\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF THE COOPERATIVE FEDERATION OF ANAMBRA STATE)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF THE ORGNS IN THE DEVELOPEMTN OF CROP IN NIGERIA\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF THE COOPERATIVE FEDERATION OF ANAMBRA STATE)\r\n", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>C0-OPERATIVE FEDRATIONS: OPPORTUNITY AND THREATES IN A CAPITALIST ECONOMY<br/>(A CASE OF ABIA STATE CO-OPERATIVE FEDRATION)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Capitalism is seen as an economic system or market economy was there is free allocation of market resources and free private participation in economic activities.

Among these systems, three types are prominent namely, Socialist, capitalist, Mixed Economic system. The socialist system is seen as a type of economy where all the activity and sector of the economy are controlled by the government. This implies that there is government ownership on every investment in the system. Today, socialism is giving in to other type of economic system in that most countries of the world that practice socialism are losing their holds in the economy of their respective country. The union of soviet socialist republic (U.S.S.R) is a good example of such dwindling socialist country.<br/>Capitalism on the other hand is a reserve of what is obtainable in a socialist economy. This is because capitalism is seen as an economic system whose individual controls the economic activities of the country. It is characterized by an interplay of the market force , E.I. force of demand and supply, cut the throat competition and indiscriminate like in the price of goods and services.<br/>A mix economy is an economic which comprises the features of the socialist and the capitalist economy. In a mixed economic system, there is joint ownership of the factors of production by the government and private entrepreneurs. The private interprise takes count of the key service, which is special to the masses. It is too exhurbitant to procure or reserve for the social class. The government therefore takes charge of the administration. Statutory service in a mixed economy system. The individuals on the other hand exercises the legal right of embarking on any type of business enterprise as the demands<br/>This price work emphasis on how capitalist system of economy affects the co-operatives society and the opportunity they have to excel. In there drive towards archiving their set objectives, they face a lot of challenges especially those that are posed by the capitalist businessmen. The project look into he very nature of capitalism and its general principles as it affects the growth of the co-operative society is analyzed.<br/> Co-operative started as a proverbial necessity being the mother of invention. It arose in the 19th century out of the atrocities of the shrewd capitalist businessmen. The adulteration of the commodities , the use of false weight, unemployment was rife, wages were extremely low and below the subsistence level among others. This is because capitalist businessman is aimed at maximizing profit. At the detriment of the consumers. As a result of this , the spirit of cooperation in the minds of the great father of the movement and a form of business enterprise which by its principle and practice a negative attitude towards capitalism emerge and still remains today as what it knows as and is referred to as the co-operative societies.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Most often, business activities are faced with numerous problems, which hinders archiving of their objective. Some of this problem is posed by the vagaries in the economy such as inflation. Why some arises as a result of the type of the type of the economic system in which the business enterprise operates. This project take a direct look into the problem posed by capitalism to a unique form of business enterprise known as the co-operative society. Giving a case of study of Abia state, the activities of capitalist businessmen and the problem it poses against the growth and the development of the co-operative societies are disused. Co-operative society is faced with many problems in a capitalist economy, which hinders their growth and development. Such problem that the cooperative society has to contend with the capitalist economy includes;<br/>Stiffen and cut threat competition <br/>Lack of enough financial resources<br/>Lack of adequate government support<br/>Lack of proper legislation<br/>Lack of people interest in co-operatives<br/>This problem highlights above are among the numerous problem which faces cooperative society in a capitalist economy<br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>The is research is aimed at looking specifically into co-operative society as agents of social and economic development thereby bringing into play their problem as it affect or hinders their development.<br/>The study also considers capitalism as a contrast to the very principles on which cooperation is founded. It focuses on the numerous problem created by the capitalist economy and the threat which this problems brings to the co-operative enterprises. The study also looks at opportunities and tries to relate as factors necessary for social and economic development. In addition to this, it also throws more light on the activities of the co-operative society as unique form of business organization. Finally, this writ-up is also aimed at improving the general knowledge about the co-operative for the lack of proper knowledge on the part of general has contributed immensely the setback that the co-operative society has witnessed for a long time.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>He important of this research work cannot be overemphasis, this is because this writ-up will brig up the hidden problems that the cooperative societies are facing and at the same time put up some suggestion that will help in solving this problems.<br/>This will ensure proper and well-articulated programme aimed at withstanding the problems posed by the capitalist concept. This can be attributed to people’s ovine to maximize profit and this brought about serous competition in the economy. In the wake of this, this work will related the effect of the co-operative society in trying to cob the bad business practices with the aim of bridging a relief to the poor masses by breaking the chains of capitalism.<br/>This believe will usher in a new socio-economic world where the suffering populates will enjoy some form of economic freedom<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This borders on the influence of the capitalist phenomena on the co-operative believe and principles taking into consideration in giving area where there is greatly activity of capitalist businessmen.<br/>The case study is in Abia state where there is high level of capitalist oriented business activities. The interplay of forecast of demand and supply and the spirit of profit maximization as can be seen in most commercial town of Abia state.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>For the purpose of clarification, definition of some terms in this project topic is needed.<br/>Co-operative societies: a co-operative society is an enterprise whose owners are at the same time the costumers and users of the facilities, goods and services provided.<br/>Opportunities: favorable choices or opening offered by circumstances<br/>Threats: declaration of the an intention to punish or to hot<br/>Capitalist:

ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION:<br/>Co-operation is as old as human society.  From time immemorial, man had relied on the existence of his fellows for existence and examples of working together.  Modern co-operative is however associated with the successful experiment of 28 weavers from Rochdale, England who in 1844 established the first successful co-operative consumers society.  Their success became widely acclaimed and their working principles were accepted as the basic principles of co-operative organization.<br/>Earlier attempts to form co-operative failed because members were illiterate, dishonest and accounts were not kept.  Following the Rochdale principles, enabled the co-operative movement to avoid most of the evils of the era of industrial expansion.<br/>Again, because the majority of the composition of membership had been people of low income, their contributions in the form of shares and thrift savings, special saving and other sources of income had been very low.  The view of this coupled with the de-emphasis of capital in the society i.e. the instituted low return on capital, the wealthy men with capital have technically been scared away.<br/>Lastly, the system of accounting usually adopted by these bodies gives no room for proper management.  This is because information is hardly extracted from such records kept by them for planning and controlling of their operation.  I therefore wish to derive into the functions and functioning of the co-operative movement with particular emphasis on the accounting aspects of its management and then recommend on the practical and attainable application of its principles to ensure the achievements of the goal of the movement.<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:<br/>Man had relied on the existence of his fellows for existence and examples of working together.  Man made an attempt to form a co-operative but they failed due to because members were illiterate and an account were not kept.<br/>Growth is a gradual process, co-operative also is a gradual process.  Co-operatives as a gradual process of growth has succeeded in developed countries but this has not been the case in developing countries.<br/>It appears that this process of co-operative has not been clear to developing countries and this has resulted in their inability to develop like industrialized nations.<br/>The system of accounting usually adopted by the management is because information is hardly extracted from such records kept by planning and controlling of the operation.  The majority of the composition of members had been people of low income.<br/><br/>\n\nSOLVING THE PROBLEM OF PERENNIAL CASH SCARCITY (AMONG WORKERS) THROUGH THE MEMBERSHIP OF CTLS\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF IMT MPCS

In a co-operative society membership is not obligatory people join at their own will they are free and  independent.  A co-operative society can them be defined as  an association of persons who off their own free will join together to  solve their common and collective economic  needs through mutual help enterprise.<br/>            There  are other definitions of the international labour organization defines it as an association of person who have voluntarily joined together to achieve a common goal through the  formation of a democratically controlled  organization making equitable contributions  to the capital required and accepting  a  fair  share of the risks and actively participate.  It  must  be emphasized that a co-operative society is a business organization and is recognized as  such  in the  world over.  In Economics and  commerce the co-operative society is a business forms of business organization.<br/>            The above definition shows that for a co-operative to exist:-<br/>1.                  There must be groups of persons with a common need and with variable membership.<br/>2.                  The objective of the group must be to promote  the economic interests of its members.<br/>3.                  Return to capital must be limited<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            The saying “necessity is the mother of invention.<br/>This is very true in the sense that the co-operative was an invention of necessity.<br/>The co-operative can be traced back to the stone age where people co-operated with one another in order to achieve easier objective but academically the modern day co-operation could be regarded as an advent of necessity originated in create Britain in the early 19th  century  as a result of the evil deeds of the  industrial revolution which entire England people in that nation were in  bad economic fortune which needed urgent solution.  The capitalists were exploiting the working class  who were below subsistence level the workers sanitary condition was pitiable. <br/>            Some  critics began to criticize the evils of  capitalism and to the  government to do something  to  better the living conditions of the working class.<br/>The  most vocal of these critics was Mr. Robert Owen, who  himself  was a factory owner.  It was Mr Robert Owen who suggested the formation of co-operatives as a check to capitalism  and its attendant vices.  He formed co-operative  committees or villages of co-operatives between 1825 and 1827,  four of such co-operatives<br/>Were formed by Robert Owen but unfortunately they were not successful stories.<br/>            Neither less their impact was felt and they arouse into the interest in people to from co-operatives in  the  future which eventually met with success.<br/>This is the reason why  Robert Owen is known  all  over the world as the  father of co-operative. The  year 1844 is a very  important one in the  co-operative  history. In August  of that  same  year a small village of Rochdale , the first successful co-operative society  that was launched  was owned by 28 weavers.  These 28 weavers are know in co-operative society history as the Rochdale Equitable pioneers  because  their successful co-operative  society was launched in the village of Rochdale, England.<br/>            The above description is a brief study of the  origin of co-operative in the world over.  Now let us see briefly how co-operative society originated in Nigeria co-operative.  Nigeria is above five  decade old.  The British co-operation having   introduced co-operation wanted to do the  same  in Nigeria.  The  Nigeria  government in 1933 appointed  Mr. F.C strickland  to  make the feasibility study of the  adaptability of co-operation in  Nigeria.  His report was accepted by the government and  in 1935, the Nigeria co-operative society ordinance was enacted and in the following year 1936 regulation were drawn up to guide the  running of co-operative society. In the same year cocoa co-operative society started and by 1944,there were a hundred and eight-one (181) co-operative societies in Nigeria which were gotten form the one ministry of works, commerce and  industry.<br/>1.2       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The reason for undertaking this case study cannot be overemphasized.  I stand to gain a  let form this study so are the  numerous student of co-operative Economic and management.<br/>            However the greater   benefactors  will be the  members of the IMT  multi-purpose co-operative  society limited which will find this case study as  a valuable candid study that will expose their society.<br/>            This case study will expose me to the practical aspect of writing and making a case study of a gives subject.<br/>            The most important reason for undertaking  this case study is to bring the IMT multi-purpose co-operative society limited under study. Their  operational strength will be studied  their weakness be looked into and  how to correct them recommended.  This study aims at x –raying their operational  efficiency and their usefulness and impact in the society in general will also be checked to see if the objects  usefulness  economic reliability shortcomings  and relevance in this modern time.<br/>            No person can doubt the usefulness of   forming co-operatives to achieve a particular and specified goal but mistakably a lot of co-operatives  were declared  insolvent . this is not because they are not a reliable ventures for this time. It  is because of bad management and this is why this case study of IMT multi-purpose co-operative society limited is of great importance as to look into the  management  of this co-operative.<br/>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This  study aims to x-ray the importance  of  co-operatives in this modern society  whenever   there  is a co-operative society their social and  economic importance  are felt by the community.<br/>            As the co-operative are the association of people with common interest it is believe that the IMT Enugu  multi-purpose co-operative  society limited as the secretary  of the society Mr.C. Nkeanyadi have  lamented that  it is helpful to the members to get their goods and services from the other areas at a minimum cost the performances of IMT Enugu multi-purpose co-operative society limited have been the topic of most discussion seminars symposia and conferences in recent past.<br/>            I hope to contribute my I deals through this study and also help enlighten co-operators

INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Co-operative law are those legislative enactment aimed at regulating and directing the activities of Co-operative Societies.  It guides the ruling, formation of co-operative enterprises, so that it enables their activities to be stable, effective and efficient for the successful operation of a given co-operative society.<br/>The Co-operative originated in Nigeria in 1935 under the NO. 39 Ordinance, while the rules follows in 1936.  Both applied the rules follows in 1936.  Both  applied to the whole locating, then colony and protectorate of Nigeria.  In 1952, the country was divided into 3 regions, North, West and East and co-operative was made a regular subject.  Each adapted the 1935 ordinance with necessary amendments.  In August, 1977, the then Federal Commissioner for Co-operative and Supply, Alhaji U.A Mutallh, set up a panel  to review and unite the Nigeria co-operative society laws and rules with J.T Catlow Idowu as chairman.<br/>It was General J.B Babangida at the face end of Military rule, decided to sign the draft into a decree, the Nigerian Co-operative Societies Decree No. 90 of 1993.  Being a federal law which superseded all other laws of co-operative society in Nigeria.<br/>1.1                OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>The motive behind this project is to undertake a study of a critical assessment of the important of studying co-operative laws and rules.<br/>                            STUDY<br/>-          To examine the impact of the co-operative law in every co-operative establishment.<br/>-          To examine the law meant for co-operative establishment.<br/>-          To know the limit provided by the law that differentiates it from other terms of business.<br/>-          To suggest ways and means of enhancement.<br/>-          To know that there is provision in the law of co-operative that every registered society must have their bye-laws.<br/>1.2                SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>With the above project been carved out by the researcher, the society will get to know and understand that co-operative laws and rules will  help to improve the economic activities of the society.  This research work will equally help the federal government to improve the society, since it  is the federal government that enact the law in which co-operative must follow.  Co-operative law is a vital element in co-operative development which should not be under-rated.<br/>The law should discriminate between full – rigid genuine co-operative, psendo co-operative and pre-co-operatives.<br/>The law stipulates that all the co-operative should be registered and it must be reformed to reduce federal government control so that a true co-operative movement will emerge.<br/>Co-operative law should take legislative cognizance’s of the higher-class, co-operatives and invest them will freedom to take their own decisions.<br/>1.3                PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>Co-operative society is a dynamic and liable business enterprise that has unique ideologies and method.  It should be regularized not as the same way as other business organizations.<br/>a)        To take the co-operative out of the content of preview of other laws.<br/>b)        To encode a legal personality on the co-operative and other privileged upon registration co-operative receive body cooperate status.<br/>c)        To grant special right to the co-operatives  such as exemption from taxes.<br/>d)       Enlarging self and self – reliance in other to bring co-operative to the stage supervision and development.<br/>e)        Protection of its members is vital and third parties e.g, supplies creditors, employ the public.<br/>f)         To give good advice to co-operators on the proper way to manage their business.<br/>g)        Preventing fraud in the co-operative enterprise.<br/>1.4                DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>CO-OPERATIVE:<br/>According to OBODOECHI (2002, P. 30)  defined Co-operative “as the process of man working in consonance with another to attain a positive result.”   Co-operative entails man in a social frame working, striving to accomplish:<br/> a)        Religious result<br/>b)        Economic result<br/>c)        Political result<br/>d)       Cultural result<br/>e)        Ethnical result<br/>f)         Educational result.<br/>LAW:<br/>These are legislative enactment aimed at regulating and directing the activities of the people.<br/>RULES:<br/>These are rules made by the Director exercised by him, given to him by Section 54 of the law.<br/>AMALGAMATION:<br/>This is the going of weaker societies to become one.<br/>DISPUTES:<br/>It is the quarrel that arises in the

societies have been in existence This is to say that they started even before the creation  of the Earth.  There was cooperation between the holy spirits or trimly  ( that is God the  father God the son and God the holy spirit) which led to the achievement  of the creation of the world. This was as a  result of certain factors.<br/>            In addition at the time of  the stone age men and the wonders there was need for  cooperation. This occurred at the  agricultural  sector through it was limited within families. After some time things begins to improved and it came a time when there was communal farming system.  This  occurred because of certain factors and because there is need for it.<br/>            Further  more countries began to relate in businesses exchanging   goods  and  services from  one country to another or from one state to among countries. Certain factors gave rise to that because  there is  need for it.  That is to say that nothing achieving can come into  existence without needs for it or without  needs for it or without certain factors which must have led to it indeed these factors leading to cooperation among people states. Countries and the world at large are not for fetch  but are those desires that needs to be satisfied or measured. These factors as put under  this introductory section can be either positive or negative <br/>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE FACTORS<br/>            As indicated earlier the factors that can influence the establishment of cooperatives can either be positive or negative.  These factors as well differs  from state to state country  to country  etc. But the  most  important is the type of cooperative or its members  involved in  its operations.<br/>            In recent times a lot of persons and scholars have tried to talk on the factors that can influence the establishment of cooperates.  This is because slot of people   and to their  own understanding has failed to understand what these factors are .  rather they often mistake it for motives.  So to say these worlds are two different things altogether.  At the later side of this project the difference  between factors and motives well be talked on.<br/>            However in Owerri L.G.A  Imo state there are a lot of factors that can influence cooperative establishment.  According to Mr L.M. Ejwnye (principal register of cooperatives Imo state) he said that the  factors that influence cooperative establishment in Owerri L.G.A Imo state .<br/>            In essence  this factors are those things needs or desires  or even set back that has led to identifications of needs there by organizing together for the purpose of establishment.<br/>            Despite these factors that has led to the establishment of cooperatives a lot of these cooperative society still fails and closes up and this occurs as a result of certain factors as well.<br/>1.2       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>            This academic exercise is  meant to appraise the feasibility of  the factors that can influence the establishment  of cooperatives and the socio-economic standard of cooperatives  member and its society at large in Owerri L.G.A Imo state.  These factors are as follow;<br/>a.         To know how these factors has helped  cooperatives its members and generally    the public at large.<br/>b.                  To know how these  factors have led to the establishment of cooperatives in Owerri L.G.A.<br/>c.                   To know the number of cooperatives that has failed in Owerri L.G.A.<br/>d.                  To ascertain  the number of cooperatives that are still in existence in Owerri  L.G.A Imo state. <br/>e.                   To ascertain the achievement of  cooperatives in the economy of Owerri L.G.A, Imo state.<br/>f.                   To bring foreword how much cooperatives has helped to reduce unemployment in  Owerri L.G.A, Imo state <br/>g.                  To find on the problems militating against the establishment of cooperatives in Owerri L.G.A, Imo state.<br/>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            Cooperatives have done a lot in the development of many countries or nations. In countries like Krael, Denmark, Sweden, India, Britain etc. cooperatives has played   vital role in sectors like manufacturing distributions and even consummation.<br/>            At the end of this research many people will find out the importance of cooperatives to human existence.  This involves the above mentioned;<br/>a.                   The government both the federal state and  local government.<br/>b.                  The  society in general <br/>c.                   The cooperative section and <br/>d.                  The general academics<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>a.                   What are the factors that can influence the establishment of  cooperatives in  Imo state ?<br/>b.                  In what ways can these factors really influence the   establishment of cooperatives in Imo state? <br/>c.                   Are  these f actors negative or positive <br/>d.                  What are those negative factors that can influence the establishment of cooperative in Imo state?<br/>e.                   As a result of these factors, how many cooperatives are viable in  Imo  state  <br/>f.                   What are the likely causes

Conclusion<br/>Finding<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>The planning of  the establishment of Institute of Management and Technology Enugu, there not in progressive forms till 1967 to a college of technology up to the ordinary diploma level.<br/> An institution of administration which provide short come in-service training courses for civil servants of various grades and a co-operative college offered a certificate course in co-operative studies to co-operative inspector from the ministry of industry, trade and co-operative.<br/> These institutions were separated and separately located.  The college of technology was part of the ministry of Education and was controlled  and directed by that ministry, similarly, the institute of administration was controlled by the ministry of establishment, while the co-operative college was directly under the ministry of rural development.<br/> All the staff of these institutions were civil servants, they were posted and re-posted from one department to another according to their needs or civil services.<br/> However, after 1970, they arose the need for higher institution  of learning to up grade the training in the technological and managerial fields which there were severe need for manpower development.  The future graduates in the technology and management and allied field would be more effective by functional training than the institute of administrations.<br/> To the founding father, the main purpose became the maximization of the management efficiency, professional and technical expertise and also the acquisition of the additional tools for these.<br/> The close coupling of the management and technology in the new objectives was the needless to say and not the fruitful.  The management and technology of then needs training for the satisfaction and fulfillment of itself, and in the world it applied science entails more problems of both moral and ecological  significance.  Later, they can no longer afford to  be the narrow minded professional concerned with only machine and structure.  He must understand the relationship and social setting of his position with his industrial environment.  He  must work with other people, be acquainted with the basic personnel and labour matters.  This was as a result of these idea of an autonomous, IMT was conceived.<br/> In the process of  performing these, the executive council of the state agreed to merge the former college of teaching, the institute of the administration and up grade their functions in 1971.   Both the institute and college were in same under unified control of the cabinet office on 1st April 1972.   In October of the same year, a provisional   council for the purpose of a new institute was appointed by the administrator of then east central state, the council who was in charge with the responsibility of determining the recommendations to the government to appropriate structure of an autonomous institution that would produce the high quality of technologists and technicians.  The council pursued  this task with vigour and determination and in early April 1973, they submitted its findings.  On 31st May 1973, an Edict No. 10 titled the “Institution of Management and Technology Edict 1973” was promulgated.  The edict took effect from 1st July 1973, and thus gave birth to Institute of Management and Technology while its first chairman was Dr. Ukwu.<br/>In October, the institute opened its doors to students and they admitted 550 student in addition to 300 second year students to of 850 students.  At the time of opening, their were only  20 senior staff including the Rector, Registrar, Academic staff and four ( 4) Administrative staff.  The institute started with eleven departments grouped into three (3)  divisions.<br/> The first convocation of the institute was held on 16th October 1976  and about 900 graduates received their Diplomas and Higher Diplomas.<br/>1.2                Historical Background of the Study.<br/>The department of co-operative studies was established as a separate department in the Institute of Management and technology, Enugu in January         1978.<br/> Before then, co-operative studies was but one among the academic programmes within the department of business management and public Administration which had other programmes like Accounting, Marketing, etc.  and was first handed by Dr. S. Umoh.<br/> In fact, IMT  was the first institute of higher learning in Nigeria to start a programme in co-operative studies for many years.  It had only one full time lecturer named Dr. Enyeribe Onuoha, who after a Ph.D  in sociology from Rome, his co-operative studies in Canada, he taught all the co-operative courses in the department except those requiring practical field experience, which he handed over to part-time lecturers from the ministry.<br/> Co-operative studies started with humbleness as one year  in servicing programme for newly appointed junior staff of co-operative department of the ministry of commerce and industry.  After the Nigeria civil war in 1970, the ministry of administration of then Eastern state close down the co-operative college at Agwu and transferred their duties to the institution.<br/> The certificate programme in co-operative was upgraded to a two-years diploma prolgramme in 1975, and it wasn’t then targeted on the in-service trainees from the ministry but on secondary school leavers possessing the minimum institute requirement entry.  The departmental requirement at this time was four credit including English, pass in mathematics, while other departments required a credit in mathematics.   The reduction in entry requirement attracted  many candidates reaching a peak in 1980/81 when about 120 students registered.<br/>Two graduates were recruited to bring the number of full time lecturers to three in the year of  October 1977.  these were Dr. S. C Chukwu and Mr. S. Y Berko.  Co-operative studies became a full-fledged department with Dr. S. C. Chukwu as the first head of department in 1978.   That  is when the name was changed to the department of Co-operative Economics and management in time with it protégé.  In  Germany during the period, a higher diploma programme was introduced.<br/> The programme co-operative Economics and management indicates that the teaching of the subject (co-operative) will rise above the merely descriptive level.  It employ tools of economics and management in the study of co-operative Enterprise.  The department is slot into its curriculum courses taken from the field of Economics and management and it also taught by experts from their fields.<br/> Two historical that affected the department is mentioned.  In 1987, the federal military government under General Obasanjo favoured the strength of the  diploma programme for polytechnics to three years rather than the two-steps (ND/HND) four years programme.  All IMT programmes  including co-operative studies has to be restructured but in 1980, the N N D (Nigeria National Diploma) certificates was withdrawn by the succeeding civilian administration and the ND/HND programme restored.<br/> In 1985,  then the military governor, Navy Captain .A. Madueke ordered the merge of the Anambra state university of Technology (ASUTECH) with IMT as a cost saving device.  All the academic programmes of the IMT  were up-graded to degree programme for studies and with university qualifications while the old diploma programme were retained for less qualified students, the merge, however, lasted only three months after which the two institutions were again demerged  as a result of stony opposition from ex-students and friends of the institute.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>Human beings are not predictable in any environment, there are most interesting and important resources in the enterprise.  Human beings make decisions concerning other resources. <br/>A major personnel activity is to train and educate co-operative members to facilitate and quicken their learning and acquisition of skills and knowledge, since their present inventories of capabilities are partly a consequence of their past learning.  Unfortunately, co-operative institutions always set high level of performance  for their members without appreciating the fact that the performance  is a function of training, education, and other variables.<br/>They fastly attribute lack of performance to inability of their members and failing to realize the fact that a person, tackling inability can make up through proper training, education and motivation.<br/> The following information shows why some co-operative institutions especially the large ones have specific training programmes, a good number of others shows apathy in training and education to their members and infact see it as a wasteful expenditure on the part of the organization.  The fact is that some of these members are left to wither away because they remain unproductive.  It is for this reason that if is said that untrained student is a liability to any organization, therefore emphasizes the need for regular training and education of co-operative students by the Nigeria Tertiary Institution.<br/>Based on the above statement and as a result for the purpose of this study, I then ask these questions.<br/>Are individual training and education determined in  IMT on co-operative matters?<br/>How  are individual pre-training  needs determined in IMT?<br/>Are these students needs satisfied to yield desired result?<br/>1.3                SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>First and for all, the findings and recommendations to be made from this study can be of much help to students of co-operative and Business Administration in general and in other  field who may wish to investigate the subject of training and education in any other organization.  With the measure of this study, it will be so useful to the institute and it will help it appreciate more, the purpose of proper training of its staff is for learning and teaching process.   Teaching process will help both the students and  the staff  to be productive in all the department of the institution will also definitely increase.<br/> However, this research work will afford or create an opportunity to undertake a research work for the first time on in-depth study in all field of study of interest.<br/>1.4                DEFINITION OF TERMS.<br/>CEM  -   Co-operation Economics and Management.<br/>IMT   -   Institution of Management and Technology<br/>NND  -   Nigeria National Diploma<br/><br/>\n\n CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF THE  DEPARTMENT OF CO-OPERATIVE ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT (CEM), INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY (IMT) ENUGU.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF THE  DEPARTMENT OF CO-OPERATIVE ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT (CEM), INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY (IMT) ENUGU.", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN APPRAISAL OF THE ACTIVITIES AND MANAGEMENT METHODS OF ANAMMCO WORKER’S MULTIPURPOSE CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY LTD”, <br/>PROPOSAL</b><br/>This project research on an Appraisal of the Activities and management methods of Anamco workers multi-purpose co-operative society should be aimed to examine the examine the management and activities of Anamco worker’s multi-purpose co-operative society limited, which is located in Eneme, Enugu state.<br/>I intended to look into the aims and objectives of the society;

together of their own free will to form the ANAMMCO worker’s multipurpose co-operative society Ltd.  This is made up of people who voluntarily associated together as human beings on the basis of equality, for their social-economic interest.<br/>Anammco worker’s multipurpose co-operative society limited has become co-operative that co-operation as a corrective measure to capitalism, has an ideological base that is rooted on democracy, caring and sharing.<br/>The society was formed in August 11 1987 and was incorporated in 25 March 1988, with total membership of 415.  Activities of the society include: granting of loans to members, establishment of staff shop to sell commodities.<br/>Presently, Anammco worker’s multi-purpose co-operative society has about 748 members, among them are

co-operatives face a lot of problems such a insufficient financial resources; lack of educated personnel management activities often do not conform with co-operative purpose, non-specification of an ideal co-operative purpose to be followed by management over dependence on government, etc.<br/> Hence, this study is concerned with the task of finding out about the general and specific activities of Anammco worker’s multipurpose co-operative society Ltd, with regard to its management, objectives and activities.<br/>1.3         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The prime reason why individuals join co-operatives  is for the fulfillment of their basic needs, thus, their continued patronage and loyalty to the society depends on the society’s ability to meet their needs. <br/>The study of Anammco

the following issues will be discussed: Background of the study, Statement of the problems, Purpose of the study, Research questions, Scope of the study, Limitations of the study etc.<br/>Co-operatives is sometimes regarded as an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. They are based on values of self help, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity. Co-operative members believe in ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others.<br/>However, people pool themselves and their resources together as a result of their inability to solve their problems by themselves. This inability of individuals militates against the economic development of the society and this leads to the common man. Adequate measure and policy should be put in place as a solution. The government of Nigeria has tried to alleviate poverty through the introduction of several programmes and measures. To better the lives of the masses the Nigeria government a lot of programme such as Family Support Programme (FSP). Better Life Programme for the Rural Women (BLW). Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP)etc. The government had also intensified co-operative society as channel through which these programmes could be implemented properly. Co-operative is also seen as the means through government incentives and aids can get to the grass roots level and proper result achieved.<br/>It is however at this point that this project tends to review the role of co-operative in poverty alleviation.<br/>Many advance societies have embraced the co-operative form of enterprise while other are embracing it at a fast rate. This is based on the belief that the organization has a lot to offer. No doubt, co-operative can enhance the standard of living of people. Historically, co-operatives have developed in response to some difficult situation. The under-privileged people can gather together to protect themselves by providing things through joint action.<br/> The general low income of most people in the rural areas is a pre-requisite for group action. Co-operative organization is seen by the government as a tool that is capable of supplementing government efforts in raising developmental capital and thereby assisting the growth of the economics.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Poverty no doubt militates against economic development and it is also one of the causes of the suffering of the masses hunger mass exploitation and other social problems such as prostitution, bribery, rituals, armed robbery, adulteration of goods and services, corrupt practices, drug addiction, frustration illiteracy, child abuse, high morality rate and other corrupt practices which people engage themselves in other to get rich quick.<br/>Poverty in its simplest term means people with low income. Infact, the concept of the poverty has been a topic of debate in the past and in the present. The place of co-operative in the developed nations.<br/>Co-operative in developing nations is trying to bring job opportunities can be created by co-operative. Directly and indirectly co-operative can improve standard of living and among others.

It’s about a business.  It is in line with these assertion that various definitions of this subject have been postulated by some school of thoughts.  Whereas some scholars see co-operative or define co-operative as an association of person usually of limited means who have voluntarily joined together to achieve a common Economic goals through the formation of a democratically  controlled business organization, making equitable contribution to the capital required and accepting a fair share of the risk and benefits of the undertaking in which the members actively participate.<br/>Other International Co-operative Alliance (I.C.A) compliments with the view that co-operative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise.<br/>Furthermore, a co-operative society can be defined as an enterprise formed and directed by association of users applying within itself the rules of democracy and directly intended to save both its own members and the community as a whole.<br/>Finally, according to (Bob-Igwe, 1993:15), he defined Co-operative as a voluntary, evolutionary democratic process resulting from initiative and enterprise at the “grassroots” by individuals motivated by the principle of self -help and mutual aid.<br/>From the above definition we can infer that the co-operative society is basically:-<br/>a)      An association of persons<br/>b)      A union of capital<br/>c)      A common need to solve a mutual problem (self help.)<br/>Co-operative Value.<br/>Values are basic conceptions of what is good or bad, a standard for behaviour and quicker for action when properly inculcated.  The I.C.A in 1995 amended the 1966 principles of co-operatives, the principles were derived from co-operative values which clearly states the co-operative attitude to social and economic life which distinguishes them from other forms of business.<br/> When we understand the co-operative values, then we can understand the nature of co-operatives.  Co-operative values are stated by the I.C.A in 1995.<br/>a)      Self-help<br/>b)      Democracy<br/>c)      Equality<br/>d)     Equity<br/>e)      Solidarity<br/>f)       Honesty<br/>g)      Openness<br/>h)      Social responsibility<br/>i)        Caring for others.<br/>These values can be divided into two parts namely:<br/>A)      Organization related values.<br/>B)       Moral behaviour related values.<br/> The first set of values deal with the happenings inside the co-operative complex, which relates to the effectivity and efficiency in the co-operative society.  While the second group of values are concerned with what is good and what is bad.<br/>Self-Help:-  Basically a co-operative is an association of persons who come together to solve a common problem which they cannot solve on their own.  The idea of self-help springs to mind immediately, the need for them to assist one another in solving an immediate problem and not rallying on the government or other external bodies to come to their aid.  These doesn’t take out the possibility of it getting external assistance.  They can of course enjoy that through their joint effort – a self-help.<br/>Democracy:-  In the co-operative society each member has only one vote irrespective of his contribution to the organization in capital and effort.  This originated from the Rochdale Pioneers and was an attempt at safeguarding the organization from their multiple share holders who may tend to dictate the tune for running the co-operative business enterprise.<br/>Equality:-  Without any discrimination of sex, race, religion, politics, creed, social status and economic class, men are equal.  In the conduct of the affairs of a society, members are regarded as equals and treated as such.  In simple analysis, equality entails same right to participation, right to be informed, right to be heard, right to be involved in decision making and executive work.  The value of equality recognizes the importance of all members not minding their social status or economic contribution to the society.<br/>Equity:-  While the society tends to recognize all their members as being equal, it would also be unfair not to acknowledge the fact that some members may have played very active role for the success of the co-operative business through high patronage, higher capital contribution.  According to Onuoha, equity means proportional equality.  This is usually represented in percentages for instance, 10 percent of shareholding of patronage, etc..  what is being emphasized here is that all will not benefit equally but one should benefit to the extent of his/her involvement in the society.<br/>Furthermore, equity also relates to how their parties are treated.  By this I mean how employees, suppliers, creditors and other non-member customers are handled by the society.  The rule of equity means that each of these receives a fair share of their industry.  Co-operative wealth or earnings must be distributed on the basis of one’s contribution.<br/>Solidarity:-  The most important co-operative value is self help while the second most important is solidarity.  Solidarity simply stated means unity, interdependency and mutual support.  They need to stand together to be able to carry out decisions which have been jointly taken by the members of co-operative.  Alone members would be unable to stand but united they stand strong.<br/>Honesty:-  Honesty has always been applied in the running of the co-operative enterprise.  The Rochdale Pioneers made it one of the rules when they insisted on sales of pure and unadulterated goods.  The value states that members of the co-operative and their officers should be honest in their transactions with the co-operative business enterprise clearly stating all their transactions for members accordingly.<br/>Openness:-  Co-operative society is a social group, not a secret society or a cult.  It is also a public organization.  Therefore openness states that the members of the co-operative should give clear statement of their transaction, which should be recorded and made it available to all members on demand to inspect, commend or criticize.<br/>For many co-operatives in Nigeria, one major problem has always been mismanagement  characterized by abuse of office by officers, embezzlement of funds, fraudulent conversion of associations property to personal use, etc.  if the co-operative books are recorded accurately and kept open for inspection, the likelihood of these sharp practices occurring will not emerge, for fear of being found out immediately the books are inspected on demand by any member.<br/>Social Responsibility:-  For hundreds of years age, co-operatives being people oriented have learnt to be socially responsible and environmentally friendly.  Today, in Nigeria, many multi-national corporations still refuse to comply with corporate social responsibility stipulations.  For instance, we are all aware of the persistence youth restlessness in the Niger-Delta area of Nigeria as a result of environmental recklessness on the part of these multi-nationals.  We can also say social responsibility, the co-operative has over the years been used by members, government and non-governmental agencies to address the issues of social development.  This is because of the social nature of the co-operative-society.  They have a social obligation in solving the social problem of their members and non-members as well.<br/>Caring for others:-  Both within the co-operative enterprise and outside co-operative provide for the needy.<br/>The value encourages the co-operative to reach out to people other than the members of their co-operative according to their financial ability.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING PRINCIPLES AND ECONOMICS OF CO-OPERATIVE AS A QUALIFYING SUBJECT FOR THE AWARD OF OND IN BUSINESS STUDIES (BUS 123)<div

STUDY<br/>There are some vital issues that we have not failed to know and understand about the topic under discussion.  First and foremost, we have succeeded in bringing into cognizance  that one of the support agencies which its role deals squarely on unemployment and underemployment in Nigeria  is National Directorate of Employment (NDE).  It was established by the Federal Government in November, 1986 which is solely dealing with the menace of mass unemployment in the country as it was stated in its four core programmes and it was inaugurated on 30th of January, 1987.<br/> On the other hand, the co-operative societies  are not exempted, in so far that the both are promoting the creation of employment opportunities for co-operators.  Co-operative itself cuts across every facet of social, political and economic aspects.   For instance, Nigeria Agricultural and Co-operative Bank (NACB) which was constituted in 1973 by the federal Government with an initial capital of twelve million naira (N12m).  In this direction of co-operative societies in the agricultural sector with the provision of credit facilities.<br/> In furtherance, National Directorate of Employment has the following cardinal objectives to achieve especially in generating employment.  Ensuring that co-operators or job seekers become entrepreneurial oriented and pay less attention on government paid employment and thus reducing drastically the high level of unemployment.<br/> Before we round off, the federal government has been making concerted effort to mass unemployment.  Currently, Olusegun Obasanjo’s regime is tackling this through  National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP) as far back as 1999 till date (2005).  All is to stamp out unemployment.<br/> Recently, the National Directorate of Employment announced and outlined various training programmes and thousands of job to be provided for the unemployed Nigerians at the middle of August, 2005.<br/>1.2            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>More often than not, lack of employment has given rise to all kinds of set back, problem in all sectors of our economy.  In fat, the high rate of unemployment and under employment has completely raged the socio-economic well - being of our nation, thereby, causing untold hardship, depression, frustration and forceful massive exodus of our teeming brethrens who are seeking for greener pastures abroad.<br/>In other words, the fact remains that the high rate of unemployment problems are getting out of hand and even reached to a worsening level.  Day-by – day, it multiplies to an alarming proportion.<br/>Therefore, we still believe that there is a room for absolute alleviation or even eradication of this unemployment scourge who has done more harm than good.   Then, what is likely going to be the hope and future of our human and material resources in Nigeria?  Is it not the high time  for the federal government to introduce practical policies and implement them without any delay; for a stitch  in time saves nine?  Are we going to create a good atmospheric condition which is conducive for our citizens and possibly discourage them from traveling to overseas?  In a sum, your guess is as good as mine.  Let us place our hands on deck, to fight this intractable problem of unemployment bedeviling this nation.  Government should do their own and the citizens should do theirs as well in order to find a lasting solution to all these problems ravaging the entire fabric of our economy.<br/>1.3            PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>It is imperative to outline some of the things that are uppermost in mind which have been given special attention.<br/>Most importantly, the reasons are not far fetched which must and hop0ed to be actualized as far as “Unemployment and Co-operative Societies” is concerned.  Thus, these are the overriding purposes of the study, namely:-<br/>1.        To design and implement programmes to combat mass unemployment.<br/>2.        To articulate policies aimed at developing work programmes with labour intensive potentials.<br/>3.        To obtain and maintain a data bank on employment and vacancies in the country with a view to acting as a clearing house to link job seekers with vacancies in collaboration with other government agencies.<br/>4.        To discourage in entirely of being over-dependent  on government paid employment and non-governmental establishment but rather become innovative and creative.<br/>5.        To promote vocational skills acquisition in co-operative societies because it cuts across every sphere of specialization such as thrift and loan co-operative society, Agricultural co-operative society, to mention but a few.<br/>1.4            SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>Let us put it clear that an adequate coverage was made in terms of the subjects studied like human beings, issues, period taken and so on.<br/>In essence, our area of focus is within Enugu East Local Government and particularly the Co-operative department.<br/>1.5            SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of this very topic under discussion arises as a result of man’s quest for finding problem – solving  to avoid the problem of unemployment and underemployment  especially in co-operative societies.<br/>Also, to promote the relevance of spirit of Co-operation which  the co-operative societies tends to uplift and maintain.<br/>Then, ensuring that different programmes of creating massive employment is implemented and achieved not only in cooperative societies but throughout the socio-economic and political sectors of the nation.<br/>1.6            RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>As its names implies, some of the questions asked in the course of research are listed below:<br/>1.         What are the means by which unemployment in cooperative societies could be alleviated or eradicated?<br/>2.         What is the department of co-operative doing in particular to raise employment opportunities?<br/>3.         What are really the causes of ever increasing unemployment problems?<br/>4.         Why is it that nowadays, some people do not want to join co-operative society in your local government area?<br/>5.         Lastly, what are the positive contributions of co-operative since its existence in your local government?<br/><br/>\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT AND

CO-OPERATIVES AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK)<br/>ABSTRACTS</b><br/>This study step out to analyze the loan administration in the financial institution in the Nigeria economy ( a case study of he Nigeria agricultural cooperatives and rural development banks ( NGCRDB). The project is intended to focus on the adequacy of credit supply to he sector of the economy by NACRDB loan disbursement. The researcher attempted to find answer to the following research question. Viz to what extent has NACRDB contributed to the development of Nigeria economy through this loan administration? What is the adequacy of NACRDB sectoral allocation towards agricultural development in Nigeria ? what is the influence of the interest rate on loan administration by NACRD?<br/>The researcher relied extensively on data and information-collected form the NACRDB of Enugu and Awka zone. The study is covered by the period of 2000 – 2002. the researcher also employed the percentage analysis and used table to illustrate the trend analysis carried out. To carry out this study is a directive framework. Four research questions were formulated. The four questions attracted a total of 7 questions in the questionnaire. The questionnaire is made up of three section (ABC). Section “A” deals on the general information, which was not tested while section B&amp;C were tested. Four hypothesis were drawn and was tested using the chi – square method and formular. Questionnaire were designed, typed and distributed to the area of study, which involve both the costumers and the staff of financial institution of the study. This was to gather vital information on the topic in question. The stratified random sampling was used in the in the selection of the respondent in the financial institution (NACRDB). The reason to enable or make it easier for the researcher to get a comprehensive use of the population of the study. A total of 70 questionnaires were administered and out of this figure, 40 were returned, and 30 were unreturned. A table is used to illustrate the return of the questionnaire; percentage method was used in analyzing the research question. The outcome or the result of the research question or the hypothesis shows that loan administration in financial institution NACRDB in the Nigeria economy is very vita in the sense that it contribute to a very great extent in the growth and development of the country.<br/>However, NACRDB have to be helping farmers by giving them enough loan and advances so as to boost the agricultural sector, which is the major source of food supply in the economy. As a result, more food will be produced and the export rate will increase. After collection and analysis of data, the researcher was able to give some suggestion on how the NACRDB farmer relationship in financing could be improved. It is recommended that the federal government should continually provide the enabling environment for the NACRDB to perform by providing rural area with basic amenities and as well ensure adequate funding of the institution (NACRDB). Finally, conclusions were drawn based on the findings and recommendations.

This is due to the fact that the agricultural sector is the major source of the food production and supply in the country. This loan is been administered through the financial institution established by the federal government of Nigeria. It (loan administration) is been introduced so as to help rural farmers and small-scale business financially in their various businesses. This enhances and increases the agricultural productivity. Loan administration in the financial institution is also one of the elements that determine the extent of economic growth and development in the country. Financial institution in 1990”s do not properly administer their fund to the major sector of the economy which is the agricultural sector and this led to the importation of food to the Nigeria making the country so much dependent on other country for food. Thus the agricultural sector could not boast of food production due to the fact that it was not adequately financed. In Nigeria, up to 75% of its production engage in agriculture which is the major source of food supply in the country and most of them are poor and rural farmers which have limited fund to produce the input and technological required in carrying out their agricultural business. This lack of fund lead to reduction in the food supply in the country and at the same time retard economic growth and development. Therefore, agricultural sector need to be adequately funded through the use of loan administration so that the economy can boast of being independent of other countries and also can develop.<br/> Do to the problem of lack of capital experience in the agriculture sector; especially in the rural farmers and small-scale traders, the federal government of Nigeria took a major concern on the issue of loan administration to enhance development in the country’s economy through financial institution. This led to the establishment of the Nigeria agricultural co-operatives and rural development bank (NACRDB), family economic advancement programme (FEAP), the Nigeria agricultural cooperative and rural development bank (NACRDB). This establish in January 200 but was dually confirmed by the federal executive council of Nigeria in November 200. the bank is been supervised by the federal ministry of agriculture. But it renders its financial report to the federal bank of Nigeria (CBN). Its function is not only in financing agriculture but also other sector e.g. small-scale business. It also contributes in financing rural project and rural development programme. The major aspect that promotes the economic development and growth of the country is the loan administration. In so many ways in Nigeria in the past years, the loan provided by the financial institution is based on the short term, medium ands long-term bases. This is because the financial institution is established for profit. This financial institution charge small of high interest on this loan disbursed and little or no collateral might also be requested as security for the loan.<br/>In some cases, the problems of default in the repayment of loan hinder the ability of financial institution in the provision of loan and this leads to poor productivity in the country. This is because that is discouraged the financial institutions in administering loan. In this case of Nigeria agricultural cooperatives and rural development bank (NACRDB), its loan is focus mainly on promoting agricultural and enhancing loan administration to the rural farmers and small scale farmers. If loan are been properly administered by this bank, rural urban migration of the farmers will be reduced and this will as well boost the economic growth and development especially in the agricultural sector. His is because no country can survive without agriculture, and that is why adequate finance is needed through proper loan administration by financial institution in the case of NACRDB.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Loan administration by the financial institution in Nigeria both in the past and even in the recent time has not been adequate and as a result Nigeria has been experiencing poor performance in economic growth and development. This inadequacy in loan administration in the financial institution of the economy is coursed by the same problems arising from both the institution and the borrowers. In the case of the institution, it is caused by high interest rate, lack of adequate finance, lack of accessibility and reluctance in the part of the staff in performing the function, strict and rule guiding the administration of the loan by financial institution. Them the part of the borrowers, there is problem of default in the repayment of loan. Some borrowers do not repay their loan at the exact date or period required. Borrowers also Atimes divert the loan borrowed to their ventures other than the proposed project as decided by the institution. These problems hinder the agricultural development since non-viable project are being embanked on instead of the viable once. This issue of collateral security is another problem that militates against the provision of loan by financial institution. Poor impression about the federal government established financial institution makes it often difficult in the county to convince people that cooperative and financial institution are veritable instrument for agricultural development. Also in the case of Nigeria agricultural cooperation and rural development bank (NACRDB) most of their beneficiaries are rural farmers and they are not enlightened. So they find it difficult to understand the benefit of the bank. Atimes, people fail to meet up with the bank rules and guidelines. Done to the recent merging of banks (NACRDB). Most of the banks; NACRDB, PEN, FEAB, lack trust and as such are discouraged from banking with the new bank (NACRDB). Also most borrowers of (NACRDB) dose not honor the invitation of the banks. As a result of merging, the bank is finding it difficult to recover the outstanding loan of former NACB, PEN, and FEAP. This hinders smooth funding of the bank in carrying out its loan administration in the sector of the economy.<br/>Furthermore, bank are observed to really meet up with the central bank of Nigeria (CBN) credit guidelines on the economy allocation of loan to the Nigeria economy (especially in the case of (NACRDB) ). The provision of loan to all sector of the economy is very important in enhancing economic growth and development.<br/>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The general objective of this study is primarily to analyze and study how loan is administered in financial institution in Nigeria with particular reference to (NACRDB). It tends to find out in what ways the Nigeria agricultural cooperatives and rural development bank has contributed to the development of the Nigeria economy through its loan administration. This study adopt a general approach in studying the role of the Nigeria agricultural cooperative and rural development bank in financing every sector of the economy, especially agricultural sector through this loan administration. The objective of this research will specifically address the following;<br/>To ascertain the extent to which the (NACRDB) has contributed in the development of the Nigeria economy through its loan administration.<br/>to establish whether or not the ( NACRDB) has adequate fund for performing the task of lending to agricultural sector.<br/>to determine the influence of interest rate in loan administration by ( NACRDB)<br/>To determine the repayment rate among borrowers of ( NACRDB)<br/>To highlight the factors that militate against the credit supply by (NACRDB)<br/>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is significant to several groups. It is of greater relevance to all financial institution especially in the case of (NACRDB) whose lending performance and loan administration is been delayed. The study will only be meaningful with some indication of its value for other immense befit to all Nigerians economy. This research work on loan administration be agricultural cooperatives and rural development bank ( NACRDB) will also be of a benefit to the agricultural sector of the economy and rural area in terms of development. It will beneficial mostly to the farmers in terms of recommendation and suggestion giving are been seen by the financial institution in their administration especially ( NACRDB). There will be sufficient fund made available to the farmers to help enquire more farm tools, equipment and other input. This will of course lead to an increase in the agricultural productivity. Moreover, this research study is vital in that adequate financing will enable development and mobilization of the agricultural sector and even the Nigeria economy at large. This will make the sector very attractive to greater majority of Nigerian citizen thereby creating more employment opportunities. In addition, the manufacturing sector of the economy will be able to procure raw material form the agricultural sector, which they will use in the production of material needed in the economy. This reduces the rate of reliance on the imported raw material. Finally, Nigeria can be in the position to increase her export, which she use to finance the long term projects. Loan administration is the key element in the mobilization of the economy. It remove he financial constraint and accelerate the process of adoption of loan which consequently help to reduce our external dept, burden and as well increase our foreign exchange and investment.<br/>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>The following research questions were tested;<br/>What are the activities of the Nigerian agricultural cooperatives and rural development bank (NACRDB) ?<br/>What are the problems facing (NACRDB)?<br/>What are the objective of the society?<br/>What are the benefit of the research to the members of Nigeria agricultural cooperative and rural development bank (NACRDB)?<br/>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will have its focus on the way and manner loan are been administered in the financial institution. The study has to do the analysis of loan administration in financial institution to the agricultural sector of the economy through its loan administration. And an analysis of the sectoral disbursement of loan to agriculture in vi-va-sal other sectors. However, some limiting factor. The scope has to be limited to (NACRDB).<br/>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Lending: this is the act of making money available to someone who is in need (borrower) by the lender (banks or the financial institutions) for personal or commercial use<br/>Capacity: this is concern with the source of repayment. Economic condition plays a part in the decisions on lending and the rigidity of the lending bank invariably affect its general policies on advances.<br/>Sectoral allocation: these parts of the central bank of Nigeria advance which is allocated to the various sector of the economy (NACRDB) most especially to the agricultural sector.<br/>Interest rate: this is the amount charge by a bank to a customer by the bank. A costumer can as well earn interest for money deposited in the bank.<br/>Economic development: this can be seen as the economic advancement of a country in terms of providing basic amenities to the citizen and also creating employment opportunities.<br/>1.9 REVIEW OF THE RELATED LITERATURE<br/>The importance of loan administration in the financial institution in Nigeria<br/>Loan administration by financial institution is of a great importance as it contributes towards the economic development of Nigeria as a country. Every aspect of the Nigeria economy require adequate finance, and most especially the agricultural sector which is the most essential sector of the economy since it is the major source of food supply in the economy. This function of financing can only be archived through the administration of loan by the financial institution. The economy is able to increase her agricultural productivity through this loan administration. And these increases in productivity invariably reduce the rate of importation of food and raw material from other countries. Through loan administration, the exchange rate, foreign investment and the employment rate in the economy is increased. The issue of loan administration in the past was not seriously implemented by financial institution and this why Nigerian is still importing most of her raw material instead of been self independent. Loan administration should be well implemented and in the financial institution so that the country can boast of been economically independent. This finance can be in form of short term, long terms and could be employed for consumption or productive purpose.. Short-term loan are those with short repayment period of one year. It is usually used in financing capital or intermediate life project such as livestock, machinery, poultry etc. it been giving to the small scale farmer whose annual income is not more than 30,00 to aid in financing their agricultural business.<br/>Long-term loan are those with long repayment period of 3 years and above. The beneficiaries of this type of loan are usually large-scale farmers whose annual income is above 1m. this loan is used either for enquiring new technology or commercialization of the rural economy development. Medium term loan has a repayment period of one to two years. It is therefore clear that there is conscience of opinion on the need and the important of credit in the economic growth and development.<br/>Generally, loan administration affects positively the level of money supply in the economy.<br/>THE PROBLEMS OF LOAN ADMINISTRATION IN THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION<br/>Loan administration that is not properly implemented dose not encourages economic growth and development and there are some factors that hinder its implementation in the financial institution. In Nigeria between 1990 and 1998, the Nigeria financial institution was critically hit by masses failure, distress resulting from poor loan portfolio which is a consequences of the stiff competition in the market i.e. Risk and return relationship were never given serious thought in the disbursement of loan. And this did not ensure efficient loan disbursement. Most borrowers are discourage due to increase in the lending rate. Is sometime hindered though to mop-up of liquidity. Times. Atimes available credit will be diverted to the available sector, which may not be profitable of viable for credit expansion. There is also the problem of reduction in the capital allowance on financial operator contingent liabilities, e.g. equipment leasing. Also non-payment of project dept to banks time hinders effective loan administration by the bank. Loan administration can also be limited by the external environment factors either directly or indirectly. This may arise as a result of the activities of the users of the financial service, management crisis, and political and socio-cultural climate.<br/>It is however essential to state that there are no computer codes or programme for successful lending rather each loan request is treated according to its merit base on the sound lending principle, laws and regulation impose by the marketing authorities which affects the bank lending. According to Clark, 1989, the following are the principal reason why bank has expose themselves more to problem of loan distraction as a result of the procedural breakdown within their own system, this are;<br/>Insufficient underwriting and lack of prior background knowledge and the investigation of the potential borrowers.<br/>Inadequate analysis of the real purpose and use of the loan proceeds and the source of payment.<br/>Lack of undertaking of the borrowers through financial need and how the fund will benefit them.<br/>Conceived loan form extended by the banks<br/>Poor review and the audit of the marginal loan.<br/>Inexperienced loan officers which incorrectly approve loan because they do not have necessary expertise to analyze and evaluate loan and credit or because they might sought for necessary counsel on making such loan including neglecting to properly evaluate, document and collateral loans. Finally, some rural people fling it difficult to pay the interest required do their low level of poverty. Also a time, financial institution is not well funded by the federal government and such cannot carryout the function of loan administration effectively.<br/>Structure of the Nigeria agricultural and rural development bank (NACRDB)<br/>Nigeria agricultural and rural development bank (NACRDB) are establish as a result of the merger between the NACB, PBN, and FEAP. The pronouncement was made I January 2000, but was duly confirmed by the federal executive counsel in November 2000, the major quarter level and also on 31 December 20002 it (emerge) was done done at the zonal office level. The main aim of he merging was to combine or integrate the activities of the above mention banks.Nigeria agricultural and rural development bank (NACRDB) at the moment has the largest branches network in Nigeria with 185 branches across the country. These are minimum of 5 branches of (NACRDB) in each state. The headquarter of the bank is at Kaduna. The bank (NACRDB) is divided into six zones in the country, this are<br/>South east zone, has its headquarter at Enugu<br/>South, south zone, has its headquarter at port-Harcout<br/>South west zone, has its headquarter at Kaduna<br/>North central zone, has its headquarter at Abuja<br/>(NACRDB) was been established and easy sponsored by the federal government of Nigeria. The federal ministry of agriculture is the supervising body but it renders its report to the central bank of Nigeria (CBN). The bank exist without income by the CBN as commercializing it rater it existing as a purely on the law of the federal executive counsel of Nigeria.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE ANALYSISI OF LOAN ADMISTRATION IN

study, research questions, scope and definitions of the study.<br/>1.1                               BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The essence of a credit society is to create a pull of fund.  It has from it’s beginning, been charged with designing and building members owned and controlled co-operative Finance System.  The greatest handicap to goal attainment is fund.  This society encourages the extension of micro and other credit facilities to rural and urban to galvanize their economic activities, which will create employment and raise the statement of human existence.<br/>Consequently, co-operators have given much thought and effort to setting up their own financial institutions so as to marshal the financial resources necessary to provide the many services that modern co-operative business requires.  It was largely the credit problems of farmers Co-operative that arose major public concern and caused the first widespread co-operative finance association to be formed in the farming sector, although consumers co-operatives have also encountered the need for more credits.<br/>Those days, the citizens helped them selves by communal efforts as well as embarking on personal or collective savings.  In Ibo land for instance, “Isusu” clubs provided a forum for collection of saving from members of the society.  The members agreed on how the money was to be given out as loans to the members.  Though the weakness of “Isusu” was that members did not always get the money they needed it.  As a result of the problems of lack of credit, there arose a need for co-operative thrift and loan society to combat the problems and shortcomings of the “Isusu Clubs.  <br/>A co-operative Thrift and Loan Society is a co-operative society that provides its members with convenient and secured means of interest.  This is most suitable for workers in one organization.  These workers pay for their saving and loans from the source of their income.<br/>They do not as a rule, have a regular weekly or daily income, but receive a comparatively large sum of money at the end of the month, which enable the deduction of their payment from the extravagant spending which so often occurs when there is money in the pocket.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Workers are always in need of money to meet up with emergency, investment or provision for their retirement, what they need is loan that will be granted to them fro production or emergency purpose.<br/>But in spite of all the effort of credit co-operatives, it is still experiencing low or decreasing productivity as it relates to the satisfaction of the members need especially in the rural and sub-urban areas.  These are relatively low levels of productivity as some of the members are no more interested in their society.  What are the causes of this low productivity in their services?  Is it as a result of poor management, poor inspection by the co-operatives assistance, lack of co-operation among the co-operators?<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The general objective of the study is to determine the problem of the co-operatives thrift and loan society Limited in Owerri, (FMKT), Imo State Zone 1998 – 2004.<br/>To determine the general study of co-operative thrift and loan society in Owerri Imo State.<br/>To access the operation of co-operative thrift and loan society, and in relation to the members, to determine the sources of capital and how members obtain loan and their pay-back system.<br/>To access how often the director of co-operative inspects co-operative societies in Owerri, Imo State and its impact on the effective management of the co-operative thrift and loan societies.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>If the purposes of this study are achieved, it is point to be of a great importance to the management of the co-operative thrift and loan society.  The members, other co-operative societies, the economy of our society to the institution of the researcher in the following ways:<br/>-           To the management of the co-operative thrift and loan society.  It is necessary to investigate their budget planning and execution and evaluate their effectiveness especially today that camping is going on for every body to became a member of co-operative society.  This study will determine why co-operative thrift and loan societies do not thrive as other co-operative societies.<br/>Moreover, the committee members will know that co-operative thrift and loan society must achieve their objective in order to justify the existence.<br/>To the members of co-operative thrift and loan society, through this study they will know that they have an important role to play in order to insure the viability of the co-operative thrift and loan society.  According to self-help value of co-operative, there must be co-operation between them and the management.<br/>Therefore, everybody should put in his best to achieve the goal of the society.  Therefore every member has the right to vote and be voted for.  Besides, the general meeting is the superior authority of a co-operative society.<br/>To other co-operative societies, the solution to the problem of co-operative thrift and loan society can put them in a right position to solve theirs.  Also, they can loan, a lesion from the efficient management of the co-operative thrift and loan society if enhanced.<br/>The society as a whole will benefit a lot from the viability of a co-operative thrift and loan societies, as it will go a long way in reducing unemployment problems in the country.  Moreover, the production of co-operative thrift and loan society if enhanced, will increase the national income of our economy.<br/>To the researcher’s institute, it will be a thing of honor and prestige to produce a student who could carry out a successful study like this, which shows the quantity of education, which the institute offers.<br/>To the researcher, this has exposed him to various publications in his field of studies as well as knowing in details the practice of co-operatives.  Finally, it qualifies him the award of Higher Nation Diploma in co-operative Economics and Management.<br/>1.5                   SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The researcher of this study intended to study the problems of co-operative thrifts and loan societies in Owerri, Imo State, but will limit the study to co-operative thrift and loan society of the Federal Ministry of Industry and Technology Owerri, Imo State.<br/> 1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.         Does co-operative thrift and loan society no satisfy its members’ need?<br/>2.         Is lack of sound co-operative one of the Problems of co-operative thrift and loan societies?<br/>3.         Is there poor inspection in co-operatives?<br/>4.         does there exist co-operation within co-operative thrift and loan societies?<br/>5.         Does the management committee of co-operatives thrift and loan<br/>societies apply the principles and laws of co-operatives in the management of their societies.<br/>6.         Is constant withdrawal of members a prolem to co-operative thrift and societies?<br/>7.         Is constant withdrawal of members of problem to co-operative thrift and loan society?<br/>8.         Do debtor-members of co-operative thrift and Loan society pay their debts as at when due?<br/> Lack of co-operative education poses another problem to co-operative thrift and loan society.  Bonna 91996:118) quoting Duberon at the First congress of co-operative union of 1869, one of the greatest difficulties among co-operators was the want of education on the part of the managers and officers.  Staner (A Swedish Co-operative expert as in Onoh (1996), “If I am given to choose between two alternative of capital with out educated members and a co-operative society with small amount of capital but with educated members, I will choose the later” People cannot be good co-operators unless they are men of business and they cannot be good business unless they are men of education.  If the co-operative movement were to continue to pursue its mission, it must educate its members with the objective of making the good co-operative citizens (Bonua) 1961:199). <br/>  <br/>\n\nA STUDY ON COOPERATIVE THRIFT AND LOAN SOCIETY\r\n (A CASE STUDY OF FEDERAL MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND TECHNOLOGY,

are members and business undertaking which are established, managed and financed by the members of the co-operative enterprises for the promotion of their individual enterprises and for house holds.<br/>Co-operative are institutions for evolution which stress the importance of life long education, which see to mobilize their members to improve their own situation through organinised group

policies are towards enhancing the development of co-operative organizations.  Indirectly, development of co-operative organisation is the development of individual members or co-operators.<br/>As such, co-operatives with their peculiar social and economic objectives principles and structure are among the most suitable institutions to involve the people in the process of development through their own organizations.<br/>The co-ordination of co-operative of development plans with national and states development plans is essential for the success of co-operative programmes.  This is especially so, when co-operative societies are used as agents for the implementation of the integrated development programmes.  One of the essential preconditions for collaborates between co-operatives and government agencies are that government will have to allow co-operative a certain degree of autonomy.<br/>When settling common goals, guidelines for joint action and self-government will have to be preserved for the co-operatives within the general framework of plan and the co-operative objectives.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER  ONE                             -

co-operative movement records many cases of individuals and communities being socially rehabilitated through co-operatives.  The co-operative movement through the methods it employs and qualities from its members, free individual not only from users and profiteers but also from individual attitudes and social customs, which are obstructive to progress, and teaches the virtues of honesty, loyalty, and punctuality and stick respect for engagements.<br/>Active participation in co-operative affairs, people become aware of their individual and social responsibility, their gain self-respect and self-reliance and learns how to trust their fellow co-operators.  Without which a meaningful economic and social transformation of individual members and communities are impossible.  Co-operative and encouraged to do things for themselves relying on their own efforts and not let others do things that they themselves could under take satisfactorily.  This give them a feeling of responsibility and achievement in individuals by realizing their ability to achieve success in economic undertakings are generally stimulated to become alert to achieve success in economic under-taking and generally stimulated to become alert to achieve civil responsibility and to participate more actively in public affairs.<br/>Co-operatives also prove to be Gecetteut training ground for democracy members actively involved in co-operative affairs is constantly leaving the methods of reaching decisions democratically.  Co-operative practice like majority vote, delegation of authority to responsible officers, observance of rules agreed upon by the group proper respect for the rights of individuals and one’s duties towards collective welfare teach people in real situation in the way they understand best.  In some developing countries, the co-operative movement has had a sizable influence on the political development of the leaders.<br/>A good co-operative is a continuous source of education.  Credit co-operative promote habit of thrift and teach the proper use of money by joining the consumer co-operative people learn about the true value and people to live with, in one means, marketing co-operative inform producers of the member also learn about business operation in form of balance sheet, operating statement and business practices involving roles as Administrators, Manager, Secretaries, treasurer and so on.<br/>The principle of equality mutual aid and social justice, underlying the co-operative political views tend to minimize difference and make people realize that human needs and aspirations are similar regardless of difference in race, colour, social tensions and help people to find common ground on which they can work together.<br/>1.1       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/> 1.         The first is to review and examine some of the policies of government towards the development of co-operative organisation.<br/>2.         To analyze if impact on the members of the co-operative societies are one hand and the government itself on the other.<br/>3.         To proper solutions and recommendation to the department of co-operative organisation in local government and Nigeria as a whole.<br/>4.         To Unearth or uncover (if any) laps in the policy implementation of the policies governing co-operative societies with a view to redressing the policies.<br/>5.         Lastly, to see the impact this co-operative has made towards the transformation of the normal development of the Green area and finally to suggest ways and means through which the policies can restructure the movement and give maximum benefit to the development of Nation and Awka North Local government in particular.<br/>1.2                                           PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of government policies towards the development of co-operative societies in Awka North Local government.  Researcher would also like to make possible recommendation to encourage the department efficiency in the implementation and man against of co-operative policies in Awka North Local government of Anambra State so that it enhance even development of co-operative organisation in the area.<br/>1.3                   STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM<br/>The problem with which this study attempts to grade is to find out the effect of government co-operative policies on co-operatives societies in Nigeria.<br/>This study is informed by the fact that co-operative societies seldom confirm to the ideals of the policies especially in the process of operation.<br/>Similarly the study as hypothesis with in a great extent measures the effect of the policies vis-à-vis, the improvement in the standard of living of the co-operative.<br/>Most of the co-operative problems as identified include in effective implementation of government policies by the government agent rested with the responsibility of implementing co-operative policies, the department of co-operative societies with out proper tools to handle co-operative matters effectively.  The low level education of members and the officials of government department of co-operative, lack of patronage on the part of members to their societies, then the attitudes of people generally towards joining societies.<br/>1.4                                                       HYPOTHESES<br/>Lack of well guidance and low level of education cannot hamper the development of co-operative organisation in Awka North Local government area.<br/> The more people participate in the co-operative movement the more unlikely they will help to improve their standard of living.<br/>1.5                                           THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>In Nigeria today, there are more than one thousand (1000) different types of co-operative societies.  Likewise in Anambra State, the topic of the research is the effect of Federal government policies toward the development of co-operative societies/organisation in Awka North Local Government Area.<br/>The study is restricted to the area alone due to time factor and for reasons, or peering and economy.  Consequently, the number of the respondents chosen was restricted for the same reason.<br/>However, what ever is the out come of the study, it will hope to grapple at current problems effecting co-operative societies, with a view to generalizing it.  This will be after further researches are conducted.<br/>1.7                                           DEFINITION OF THE TERMS<br/>The researcher made use of the following terms when conducting the study:<br/>CO-OPERATIVE

Conclusion<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>            A co-operative society is an association of persons who have voluntary joined together to achieve a common end through the formation of a democratically controlled organization making equitable contributions to the capital required and accepting a fair share of the risks and benefits of the undertaking in which the members actively participate (L.L.O 1960).<br/>            The term co-operative is often used to mean the activities of a specific form of organization, that is any form of persons working together to achieve some aim or aims on a formal basis.<br/>            A co-operative is always determined by four elements and these are:<br/>i           A group of persons with at least one economic interest in common.<br/>ii          The self-help motivation, that is, the aim of the group which is to meet<br/>the common need of members by joint action based on mutual<br/>assistance.<br/>iii         The means to achieve this aim which is to establish a common<br/>enterprise.<br/>iv         The main objectives of this co-operative enterprise is to perform<br/>services . The promotion of the economic interest of the members.<br/>The attitude of people students and the society in general especially the ignorant ones towards co-operative society today is not encouraging and this has prompted the researcher to carry out study on the importance of studying the course by students so that they may contribute to the knowledge of co-operative after their stay on school and to make known to the outside world the impact of co-operative societies.<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>            The first successful co-operative society is caused the Rochadale society of equitable pioneers was established in Rochdale an industrial town close to Manchester. The Friendly Societies Act registered the society on October, 28th 1844.<br/>            This co-operative society originated from discontent with the adulteration of goods, false weights and measures and high prices prevailing on retail distribution among workers living on or near subsistence level owing to their bargaining power, living on or near subsistence level (Bob lgwe 1993:2) owing to their weak bargaining power in the labour market. The consumer co –operative movement on the true sense was the off-spring of a marriage between the wage camers need of an immediate rise in their standard of living and the aspiration towards a better social order based on the teachings of Robert Owen, Dr Willian king and other social philosophers and pioneers of 18th and 19th century England.<br/>            This society started with just twenty eight workers who set out themselves to conquer the world by faith and sheer determination. Much work which led to the success of the first co-operative in Rochale was done by these committed members who believed on mutual help. They were guarded by terms and principles which they knew were going to help them and so in 1852, the industrial and provident societies Act law was passed by the British parliament. But today, we have many co-operative shops and societies in existence.   <br/>1.2       STSTEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>            There have been concented effort by government and some philanthropists to enhance the knowledge and establishment of co-operative colleges and enterprises are aimed at making its existence known and probably for it to be patronized and identified with, inspite of all nthese efforts being made, the co-operative societies still existence low level of patronage and membership and this is caused by probably low level of education and training. There is general laxity amongst members who believe that the co-operative business is no business. Since profits is not shared and non-members enjoy equal benefits with members and they stand to lose nothing in the members business running at a loss while the members bear the risks alone.<br/>            When then are the causes of this non-challant attitude of members and non-members towards the co-operative society and what are the importance of the business to the society? What benefit is the society to it’s members?<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>            Since the co-operative society or enterprise can be said to be business organization, it has done much impact to the world of business on the society today and so its importance cannot be over emphasized. Based on the problems stated above, the objectives of this research shall be,<br/>1          To find out the importance of co-operative business enterprises<br/>2          To find out the roles of co-operative business enterprises<br/>3          To find out the impact of effect it has.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The research is important to both the student and members of co-operative business enterprises because it encourages growth and diversification, provided for the best us of human beings and stimulates creativity.<br/>            This research will be one of the things the researcher will fulfil before the award of Ordinary National Diploma. It will also serve as a reference for further researcher to know more about the topic finally through the knowledge obtained from the research, the researcher will understand the principles and methods of the co-operative business enterprises and so be in a position to impact the knowledge on to people for the progress of the nation.<br/>TO CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY MEMBERS<br/>            This research work is of a good significance to them because it brings to their knowledge the benefits and importance of co-operative business enterprise. Among these are: -<br/>1          It enables a member to have the spirit of oneness in whatever they do.<br/>2          It brings to their knowledge the benefits of bulk buying which <br/>increases patronage refund.<br/>3                    Better services and value for money are gotten from being a member since a member is a customer and at the same time a shareholder.<br/>4                    A number enjoys low concession and exemption since they are involved on promotion and non-profit.<br/>5                    A member is given loan if he wants in a credit society.  <br/>1.6       DEFINITON OF TERMS<br/>Principles: This is a general law determining the existence and distinguishing it from other systems. <br/>Co-operator: This is a person that has accepted the terms and principles of co-operatives and so has decided to join the co-operatives as a member sharing in all its profits and losses.<br/>Democratic Management: This means that the co-operative is an organization that should be handled or the principle of one member one vote and must enjoy independence and autonomy.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF STUDING ECONOMICS OF CO-OPERATIVE BUSINESS

financial statement of an enterprise by an appointed auditor in pursuance of that appointment and in compliance with any role statutory obligation.  an audit involves an examination or investigation of the statement in figure from relevant evidence with the objective of enabling the auditor to make a report on the state of statement.  Also is the examination of business transactions with a view of ensuring that the balance sheet and the Profit and Loss account give a true and fair view of the financial statement, that is, the examination of accounts to see that they are in order.<br/>Auditing is of two steps:  The first being the process of gathering evidence relating to transactions, and the other being the function of reporting to the members of the enterprise as to whether the financial statements show a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the enterprise and the profit or loss for the year ended on that date.  In the case of a statutory audit, the matters to be reported upon are laid down in the companies act or in other relevant legislation.  Coming to non-statutory audit, the matters to be dealt with in the report should be agreed in writing between the auditor and his client.  The engagement letter should explain the scope of the audit and state that the auditor will review the accounting systems in order to assess their adequacy as a basis for this preparation of the financial statements.  Furthermore, the letter should state that the auditor will need to obtain relevant and reliable sufficient to enable him to reach reasonable conclusions there from.  The latter should state also that if the auditor plans to place reliance on any internal controls, he will ascertain and evaluate these controls and perform tests on their operations.  In this respect, reference should be made to the auditor reporting to the management on any significant weakness in organizaation’s  system which comes to the auditor’s notice and which he thinks should be brought to the notice of management.  The auditor will carry out his work and make his report in accordance with approved auditing standard, where appropriate, will have regard to international standard when reviewing the financial statement it should make it clear, that the client not the auditor is responsible for the preparation of financial statement giving a true and fair view and for maintaining proper accounting records and a system of internal control which is appropriate to the enterprise.  Auditing can also be defined as embracing:<br/>1.          An examination of the records of an under-testing in order to assess the reliability of the information contained therein.<br/>2.          An examination of the documentary evidence from which the records are written up in order to assess validity.<br/>3.          As consequences of  (1)  and (2) above , the reduction and prevention of fraud and errors.<br/>4.          It is a general examination of financial statements (balance sheet and profit and loss account) prepared by an enterprise to ensure that a true and fair view is given of the financial position at a specified date and transaction at a specified period.<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>One of the major problems that  have placed or rubbed co-operative societies of the goals is the fact that the management of co-operative societies is coals accountability the principle of democratic member control as outline as the second principle of I C A principles of 1995 was to insure that the management of co-operative does not mislead the members and  therefore prevent it from attaining its goal.<br/>To further ensure accountability in co-operative, the law permits the co-operative director to audit the account of co-operative.  This involves the systematic examination of the account and financial transactions of co-operative  societies to avoid misappropriation  of co-operative funds.<br/>In spite of the struggles by various co-operative societies to organize a noble society, it is discovered that these societies die prematurely. This is as a result of poor co-operative auditing.  This as a matter of fact has discouraged many people from joining co-operative society since they do not see co-operative as business organization that can last like any other business organization.<br/>Unlike in other forms of business auditing in co-operative faces many problems ranging from the attitude of co-operative members who see auditors as government agents who have come to reap their rewards.  The attitude of the auditors who at times give up the aim of their task to their personal interest and the problem of illiteracy among the members  of co-operative  and lack of facilities to facilitate co-operative auditing.  These have necessitated this problems and proffer a lasting solution to them.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Audit is one of the instrument used by the director of co-operative as well as the members of co-operative to know the financial sand of a co-operative society.  It has been established that finance is the wire of every business organization.  This every  co-operative society is audited to insure that the management of co-operative justifies the usage of any finance  sourced by  co-operative society.<br/>Obviously, this audit is a veritable instrument for ensuring the efficient and successful running of a business enterprise.  In spite of the importance of this audit to the co-operative growth and development, it’s practice has faced many problems which prevent co-operative from satisfying the needs of it’s members and as well adding to the growth of the economy at large.<br/>What could be these problems associated with co-operative auditing?  Could it be that the members of co-operative societies do not like co-operative auditing which makes them to feel that co-operative auditing is a way of pippin into their account or that illiteracy has made the members not to keep a proper record of their financial transaction, this making it impossible for the external auditor to lay hold of any needed document to carry out the works?  Could it rather be that the external auditors are not competent enough to carry out real audit that could make co-operatives grow in this nation?  These have caused the researcher to carry out this project work.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.        To detect fraud and errors in posting books and records of enterprise.<br/>2.        To ensure the reliability of the annual account.  This is because an audited account shows a true and a fair view of the enterprise.<br/>3.        To reinforce the confidence  of the members in co-operative societies.<br/>4.        To know the financial state of the business enterprise,  that is when an enterprise engaged in trade relationship or credit transactions.<br/>5.        Audited Account helps in taxation.<br/>6.        To determine whether the audited entity is keeping effective control over revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities.  Whether it is properly accounting for resources, liabilities and operation.<br/>7.        To determines whether the audited organization  is complying with the requirements placed upon it by patent laws and regulation.<br/>8.        To find out whether the audited entity is being carried out.  It’s responsibilities in giving due attention to conservation of it’s resources and minimum expenditure of efforts.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>At the completion of this project work, if the action thereof is implemented, the researcher is optimistic  that this research project is going to be of important to the case study organization (Co-operative Societies in Nsukka Local Government Area)  in the sense that  their co-operative societies will have a new breath of effective and progressive co-operative audit.<br/>To the members of co-operative societies, this project work is going to be of  importance because their needs (Economic) is going to be net as the co-operative societies thrive as a result of effective auditing of co-operatives which will be insured by this work.<br/>The researcher and the research institution will also benefit from this study hence the study will expose the researcher to so many literature in this field of study and insures the advancement of the researcher’s knowledge of the same time the researcher’s institution will be made proud of successful completion of this study.<br/>  This society as a whole will benefit from his as it will increase the national income through co-operative development.<br/>Research Questions<br/>1.               Is there a bad attitude of  Co-operative members towards external auditors?<br/>2.               Do the members of Co-operative embrace external auditors?<br/>3.               Do the external auditors have the required skills for carrying out their duties?<br/>4.               Are there necessary documents needed for effective co-operative audit made available to the external auditors?<br/>5.               Is there enough fund for necessary facilities for co-operative audit?<br/>6.               Can there be a lasting solution to the problem associated with co-operative auditing?<br/> <br/>\n\nTHE  PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH CO-OPERATIVE AUDITING\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NSUKKA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN ENUGU STATE CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT.)\r\n<div

INTRODUCTION<br/>          In most developing countries, cooperative societies constitute the most important aspects of rural development. It was proposed as a result of the evils of the industrial revolution as of (1750 – 1850. It was when the factory owners (the capitalists) exploited workers bitterly in order to maximize profit. During that period    unemployment was rife and were extremely low. There was child labour, shop keepers on their own part sold adulterated goods. The worker lived in crowded shanties in unsanitary conditions. The worked for more than twelve hours in ill ventilated factory buildings <br/>That looked like a prison yard<br/>These anti-social effect of the life industrial revolutions resulted in wide spread of poverty and sufferings while others died of malnutrition, disease and starvation. Life was so hard that the decade became known as “hungry forties” it was because of all these problems that great men (workers) started fighting for social reform they retailed with violence and strikes they condemned the evils of capitalist.<br/>        It was then that the apostles of Robert owen (the Owenties) Dr Willian king, JohnLyod Charles Hawarth, Willaim owenite. Willaim pare looked for the better way to solve their problems and later proposed the word co-operatives as a solution to wipe out those evils. The gospel spread all over the countries of the world throughout cooperatives movement.<br/>        When they have succeed in 1750 through the help of Rochadale pioneers of 1844, they carried on the gospel o cooperative. The rochdale pioneers include.<br/>-      Charles fourier<br/>-      Charles Donwin<br/>-      Louise Blank<br/>-      Phillipe scotta<br/>-      Philipe Buchez <br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY      <br/>        Cooperatives societies have spread all over the countries of Africa, more especially in Nigeria it was because of its vital roles towards the development of rural areas that led to its proposal after the F.C strick land report.<br/>        Cooperative society help to reduce the sufficient of less privileged ones living in the problem of poverty, unemployment and poor standard of living among rural dwellers need a self help organization were they will pool their little resources together to help themselves this will stop total dependence in government assistance by means of forming a cooperative society that is collective action they will be able to solve their individual problems.<br/>        Cooperative is an association of people who comes together to solve their problems through mutual action. It raises its head in metropolis as well as in cosmetropolitan environment. It was the uniqueness of cooperative and its flexibility permits it to be practiced among farmers, fishersmen, artisans and woman.<br/>        Cooperative societies do not discriminate either in sex, religion or race, it is for all both producers and consumers, men and women the rich and the poor the educated and the illiterates engaged in cooperatives activities.<br/>        Cooperatives societies has reached to various local government areas and was headed by divisional cooperative officers to promote cooperative in the area of the research was carried on to find out the development of Enugu east (NIKE) Local government area.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The research is<br/>        Cooperative as agent of rural development. The development of rural areas cannot be achieved as was expected by rural dwellers. This is because people were much dependent in government to provide all their needs which they cannot be able to solve completely because of voluminous works and other needs they have to attain. Hence government encourages people to form organization in which they should come together to solve their problems.<br/>        Cooperatives society is are of the major organization were people mostly in rural areas emerged together to achieve their set objectives the problem is to access how important cooperative societies it to the rural development.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>          This research has the major objective of finding out the importance of cooperative society to rural development in Abakpa Nike (Enugu East) local government area.<br/>Specific objectives include:<br/>-      Identify the help of cooperative society in motivation of rural people to form or join a cooperative society.<br/>-      To know how they have in the provision of infrastructure facilities.<br/>-      To access their help so far in education the rural people.<br/>-      To know how they have in providing the farmers with storage facilities.<br/>-      To know whether they organized any market for the farmers.<br/>-      To know how they have helped to solve unemployment problems in Abakpa Nike local government area.<br/>-      To know how they have helped them to raise their income.<br/>-      To know also how they have helped the farmers to receive government assistance.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        There is the need for the development of rural areas through cooperative societies. This study will show the importance of cooperative societies to the rural development in Nike local government area as a basis for offering uniformed suggestions for improvement in the rural development.<br/>        It is believed that the findings, suggestions and recommendations of this study will be benefits to increase the importance of cooperative societies to rural development.              <br/>Specifically this study will go a long way to developing rural areas this also my result to the improved in the development of people as well as increasing their standard of living.<br/>        The individual people would be well educated which will encourage in the establishment of cooperative business enterprise to enhance development. The provision of basic infrastructure facilities will be a affordable and both cooperative societies and government would be involved in financing agriculture activities.<br/>        The availability of processing industries and storage facilities would be provided which will reduce the wastage of goods.<br/>        Finally, the outcome of this study will be very useful to the development of Nike local government entirely.     <br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>-  How far have cooperative societies helped in the provision of infrastructure facilities in Nike? <br/>-       Do cooperative society help in education of the rural dwellers?<br/>-       Do cooperatives help in eliminating the middlemen and the extortioners?<br/>-       Do cooperative society  organizes market for them?<br/>-       Whether cooperative society solve unemployment problem in the area?<br/>-       Do cooperative society helps them to receive government grants and subsidy?<br/>-       Do cooperative provide storage facilities for them?<br/>-       Do cooperative society encourage them to join cooperative societies <br/>-       Do cooperative help them to raise their income<br/>-       Whether cooperative societies increase their standard of living?<br/>-       Do cooperative help them in provision of transport facilities.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The scope of this study is focused on cooperatives as agent of rural development in Nike local government area.

objectives of the study, significance of the study, research questions, scope and definitions of the study.<br/>1.1                               BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The essence of a credit society is to create a pull of fund.  It has from it’s beginning, been charged with designing and building members owned and controlled co-operative Finance System.  The greatest handicap to goal attainment is fund.  This society encourages the extension of micro and other credit facilities to rural and urban to galvanize their economic activities, which will create employment and raise the statement of human existence.<br/>Consequently, co-operators have given much thought and effort to setting up their own financial institutions so as to marshal the financial resources necessary to provide the many services that modern co-operative business requires.  It was largely the credit problems of farmers Co-operative that arose major public concern and caused the first widespread co-operative finance association to be formed in the farming sector, although consumers co-operatives have also encountered the need for more credits.<br/>Those days, the citizens helped them selves by communal efforts as well as embarking on personal or collective savings.  In Ibo land for instance, “Isusu” clubs provided a forum for collection of saving from members of the society.  The members agreed on how the money was to be given out as loans to the members.  Though the weakness of “Isusu” was that members did not always get the money they needed it.  As a result of the problems of lack of credit, there arose a need for co-operative thrift and loan society to combat the problems and shortcomings of the “Isusu Clubs.  <br/>A co-operative Thrift and Loan Society is a co-operative society that provides its members with convenient and secured means of interest.  This is most suitable for workers in one organization.  These workers pay for their saving and loans from the source of their income.<br/>They do not as a rule, have a regular weekly or daily income, but receive a comparatively large sum of money at the end of the month, which enable the deduction of their payment from the extravagant spending which so often occurs when there is money in the pocket.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Workers are always in need of money to meet up with emergency, investment or provision for their retirement, what they need is loan that will be granted to them fro production or emergency purpose.<br/>But in spite of all the effort of credit co-operatives, it is still experiencing low or decreasing productivity as it relates to the satisfaction of the members need especially in the rural and sub-urban areas.  These are relatively low levels of productivity as some of the members are no more interested in their society.  What are the causes of this low productivity in their services?  Is it as a result of poor management, poor inspection by the co-operatives assistance, lack of co-operation among the co-operators?<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The general objective of the study is to determine the problem of the co-operatives thrift and loan society Limited in Owerri, (FMKT), Imo State Zone 1998 – 2004.<br/>To determine the general study of co-operative thrift and loan society in Owerri Imo State.<br/>To access the operation of co-operative thrift and loan society, and in relation to the members, to determine the sources of capital and how members obtain loan and their pay-back system.<br/>To access how often the director of co-operative inspects co-operative societies in Owerri, Imo State and its impact on the effective management of the co-operative thrift and loan societies.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>If the purposes of this study are achieved, it is point to be of a great importance to the management of the co-operative thrift and loan society.  The members, other co-operative societies, the economy of our society to the institution of the researcher in the following ways:<br/>-           To the management of the co-operative thrift and loan society.  It is necessary to investigate their budget planning and execution and evaluate their effectiveness especially today that camping is going on for every body to became a member of co-operative society.  This study will determine why co-operative thrift and loan societies do not thrive as other co-operative societies.<br/>Moreover, the committee members will know that co-operative thrift and loan society must achieve their objective in order to justify the existence.<br/>To the members of co-operative thrift and loan society, through this study they will know that they have an important role to play in order to insure the viability of the co-operative thrift and loan society.  According to self-help value of co-operative, there must be co-operation between them and the management.<br/>Therefore, everybody should put in his best to achieve the goal of the society.  Therefore every member has the right to vote and be voted for.  Besides, the general meeting is the superior authority of a co-operative society.<br/>To other co-operative societies, the solution to the problem of co-operative thrift and loan society can put them in a right position to solve theirs.  Also, they can loan, a lesion from the efficient management of the co-operative thrift and loan society if enhanced.<br/>The society as a whole will benefit a lot from the viability of a co-operative thrift and loan societies, as it will go a long way in reducing unemployment problems in the country.  Moreover, the production of co-operative thrift and loan society if enhanced, will increase the national income of our economy.<br/>To the researcher’s institute, it will be a thing of honor and prestige to produce a student who could carry out a successful study like this, which shows the quantity of education, which the institute offers.<br/>To the researcher, this has exposed him to various publications in his field of studies as well as knowing in details the practice of co-operatives.  Finally, it qualifies him the award of Higher Nation Diploma in co-operative Economics and Management.<br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.         Does co-operative thrift and loan society no satisfy its members’ need?<br/>2.         Is lack of sound co-operative one of the Problems of co-operative thrift and loan societies?<br/>3.         Is there poor inspection in co-operatives?<br/>4.         does there exist co-operation within co-operative thrift and loan societies?<br/>5.         Does the management committee of co-operatives thrift and loan<br/>societies apply the principles and laws of co-operatives in the management of their societies.<br/>6.         Is constant withdrawal of members a prolem to co-operative thrift and societies?<br/>7.         Is constant withdrawal of members of problem to co-operative thrift and loan society?<br/>8.         Do debtor-members of co-operative thrift and Loan society pay their debts as at when due?<br/>Lack of co-operative education poses another problem to co-operative thrift and loan society.  Bonna 91996:118) quoting Duberon at the First congress of co-operative union of 1869, one of the greatest difficulties among co-operators was the want of education on the part of the managers and officers.  Staner (A Swedish Co-operative expert as in Onoh (1996), “If I am given to choose between two alternative of capital with out educated members and a co-operative society with small amount of capital but with educated members, I will choose the later” People cannot be good co-operators unless they are men of business and they cannot be good business unless they are men of education.  If the co-operative movement were to continue to pursue its mission, it must educate its members with the objective of making the good co-operative citizens (Bonua) 1961:199). <br/><br/><br/>\n\nA STUDY ON COOPERATIVE THRIFT AND LOAN SOCIETY \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF FEDERAL MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND TECHNOLOGY, OWERRI, IMO STATE  - 1998 - JUNE

co-operative.<br/>Principles. The international co-operative alliance (ICA) came into being in 1895 in London, England. The ICA roap is the regional office for Acia and the pacific of international co-operative Alliance (ICA) the world body of all co-operative with its head office in Geneva founded in London on 13 August 1895.  I C A is a member – based organization with national and international co-operative organizations in over 102 countries.  It serves more than 241 member organizations, including  five international organizations, representing well over 780 million individual members around the world.<br/> Besides the head office in Geneva, Switzerland, there are five regional offices vis:<br/>a)        Regional office for Asia and the  pacific.<br/>b)        Regional office for East Central and Southern Africa.<br/>c)        Regional office for West Africa.<br/>d)       Regional office for central America and the Canibbean.<br/>e)        And Regional office for Europe.<br/>The I C A enjoys category – 1 consultative status with the united Nations Economic and social council (UNECOSOC) and has active working relations with UN and other international organizations.<br/>The I C A  Regional for Asia and the pacific (ICA ROAP) is also located in New Delhire India, serves 54 national level organizations from 22  countries and one international organization Asian Confederation of Credit Unions (ACCU), representing over 48 million individual  members of co-operatives in Asia pacific region.   It is the apex body charged with co-operative development.  Over time, I C A came to realize the inadequacies of the Rochadale co-operative principles.<br/> Many factors gave rise to I C A revisiting the Rochdale principles.  Over the years, all co-operatives the world ever adopted these principles just to be recognized as co-operatives.  With the passage of time practitioners recognized that these Rochdale principles were grossly inadequate to all types of co-operatives.<br/>Many reasons accounted for this.  They include:<br/>i)                    The Rochdale principles were essentially for consumer retailing and therefore could not apply to other types of co-operatives like credit, marketing, farming, etc.<br/>ii)                  The Rochdale principles were not only philosophies but contained some trade practices which were not typically principles.  For instance, cash trading at market price and sale of pure and unadulterated  goods were trade practices, which can apply to other business organization.<br/>iii)                Some of the principles of Rochdales, like we pointed out before, were mixture of owenites, chartist and Christian socialist, which in the real sense were not co-operative in character, and finally<br/>iv)                Some environmental factors found their way into the principles.  For instance, the principle of cash sale at market price found its way into the principle because of the failure of the pre-Rochdale co-operatives.  Today, however in the world of business, credit salts is the in thing.  In advanced societies,  the use of credit card out weigh the use of physical cash.<br/>Hence,  the introduction of the modern trends in the co-operative principles otherwise known as the International Co-operative Alliance principles.  In 1966, the International co-operative Alliance produced its own principles of co-operation and continued updating them from time to time.  The statement on co-operative identity was adopted at the 1995 General Assembly of the International Co-operative Alliance held in Manchester on the occasion of the Alliance’s centenary.<br/>International Co-operative Alliance (I C A) <br/>Meaning:  This is the highest Co-operative body world-wild.  It is not only an international organization but a non-governmental organization whose foundation it  is to unit, represent and serve co-operatives world-wide.<br/> 1.2                BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>According to Dr. Onuoha (1986) the history of the listing of co-operative principles fall into two major periods.  The first period is from 1840’s to as late as the 1960’s.  during this period co-operators all over the world only ascertained what they recognized as Rochdale principles and accepted them as co-operative “commandments”.  Since the Rochdale principles contributed to the success of the pioneers, they must be observed.  Major thrust of this chapter is to X-tray the emergence of todays’ co-operative principles.  The International Co-operative Alliance (I C A) came into being in 1895 in London, England.  It is the apex body charged with co-operative development.  Over time, I C A came to realize the inadequacies of the Rochdale co-operative principles.<br/>These principles were received world over as the co-operative Alliance until in 1966 when the International Co-operative Alliance at a congress held in Vienna, Austria, first questioned the validity of the principles.  In 1966, the International Co-operative Alliance produced its own principles of co-operative and continued updating them from time to time.<br/>1.3                OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>We appreciate IFRIC Draft Interpretation D8 on members share in co-operative Entities.<br/>We support this interpretation as an interim method.  However, final interpretation should be so formulated that it is based on nature purpose and principles of co-operative entity.<br/>We suggest these subjective in view while formulating the final interpretation:<br/>a)        Unlike investor- oriented companies, members are owners of her co-operatives and members should use the services of co-operatives.<br/>b)        Members contribute share capital to provide corporate shape to conduct economic activities in co-operative way to fulfill their common economic needs.<br/>c)        Members share capital is main source of capital of their co-operative.  It determines financial strength of a co-operative.<br/>d)       Co-operative institutions in almost all the countries of Asia-Pacific region are prohibited by law to raise capital from open market.  In other words, their equity capital comes only from their members.<br/>e)        In Asia-Pacific region, in most of the countries share capital contributed by members cannot be redeemed during the life of a co-operative law/bye-laws permit to transfer the share capital at par value to some other person, if member wants to resign from a co-operative.<br/>f)         To promote the world co-operative movement based upon mutual self-help and democracy.<br/>g)        To work for political stability of all co-operative in the world.<br/>h)        I C A shall not associate itself with any political or religious organization and shall maintain such independence in al  its activities.<br/>1.4                STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLES<br/>The International Co-operative Alliance statement on the co-operative identity.<br/>In 1966 the international co-operative alliance produced its own principles of co-operation and it continues updating them from time to time.  The statement on co-operative identity was adopted at the 1995 general Assembly of the International co-operative alliance held in Manchester on the occasion of the Alliances’s Centenary.  The statement problem was the product of a lengthy process of consultation involving thousands of co-operators around the world.<br/>1.5                DEFINITIOON OF TERMS<br/>A Co-operative is an autonomous Association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.<br/> The International Co-operative Alliance (I C A) defined as an umbrella organization that promote co-operative all over the world.<br/>The I C A was founded in London on 23rd August, 1895.   it is an association of National Union of co-operatives societies which seek to promote a non-profit system of production and trade organization in the interest of the whole community and based upon voluntary and mutual self-help.<br/><br/>\n\nA STUDY OF THE ACTIVITIES OF I C A IN REGIONAL OFFICE OF WEST AFRICA, ASIA AND

GOVERNMENT IN CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The Role of Government in Co-operative Development emphasis on the economic growth of the nation and the eradication/alleviation of poverty among the populace.<br/>The significant of the contribution of government towards the growth of co-operative society in the country (Nigeria) cannot be over emphasized because it has brought about the reduction of dependency rate of the country.  This increasing the national income of the country.  The government take no special interest in the co-operative movement outside  providing it with the necessary legal basis for registration and under some circumstances, granting minor privilege  in the form of reduced tax rate.<br/>The aim of this project is to find out the role of Anaocha Co-operative society development,  Anaocha local government area in Anambra state.  The subjects used for the study consisted of four hundred and ninety-nine (499) Anaocha co-operators from six (six) registered Anaocha co-operatives in the same local government.  Sample size was used in selecting these four hundred and ninety-nine (499) co-operators from the population of six registered Anaocha co-operatives societies in the local government.  Questionnaire and oral interview were the major instruments used for the study.<br/>A total of 550 questionnaires were administered to registered members of the co-operative societies.  Out of this number, 499 were completed and returned, one more questionnaire was administered to the Divisional co-operative officer of Anaocha local government area.  He also stressed on the need for the co-operative officers in Anaocha local government area to encourage the women to invest more to productive ventures than collection of individual loans from the co-operatives.  This will help provide employment opportunities for the members and the people of Anaocha in general.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE:<br/>1.0        INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1

CONCLUSION<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>  APPENDIX<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1        BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>According to the co-operative law of Eastern Nigeria (CAP.28) of 1956 co-operative society is an association which has its objective the promotion of the economic interest of  or the provision of services for its members in accordance with co-operative principles.  Therefore, co-operative is a self help project.<br/> Abinitio, co-operative were not supposed to be under government influences and control, though, co-operative were not supposed to work in isolation or in competition with government for is all states of the world political  power is exercised for the state by government.<br/>The government provides security for lives and property and also provides and enacts laws which enables business and co-operative to flourish.  Beyond the level of work only for the interest of the member and betterment of the entire society.<br/> This project is aimed at x-raying the various ways and programmes  which government contributes towards the development of co-operative societies.  Therefore, the project research is to identify the various areas where government affects the development of co-operative society in Anaocha and to clearly state the significance of the programme.  Also, the research work elaborates the factors responsible towards the development of co-operative in Anaocha; thus no financial aid to the orgnisation operating under the co-operative society sector.<br/> 1.2        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/> From the background of the study, it should be understood that modern Anaocha co-operative societies were formed in Anaocha local government area to cater for the socio-economic needs of the Anaocha.  It is also aimed at savings as instrument for Anaocha development.<br/>But it is however, surprising that despite the existing Anaocha co-operative in the said local government, the various communities that constitute the local government are still in their primary stage of development.  Even the Anaocha co-operators themselves are still suffering from poor standard of living.<br/>1.3        PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/> The purpose of this study is to:<br/> 1.          Examine the level of Anambra development through co-operatives in Anaocha local government area.<br/>2.          Find out the level of performance and the extent to which the Anaocha is achieving or failing to achieve Anaocha development in the said local government.<br/>3.          Find out the problems that face Anaocha co-operatives thereby hindering them from achieving the objectives of development and to suggest ways of enhancing the effectiveness of these co-operatives.<br/>4.          And to determine the contributions of these Anaocha local government area.<br/>1.4        SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is significant for the following reasons:<br/> 1.            It will eliminate doubts as to whether or not women co-operatives aae of any significance in Anaocha development especially in the case study.<br/>2.            This study will guide other researchers who may wish to operate along co-operative especially as it concerns Anaocha development through co-operative in Anaocha local government.<br/>3.            The significance of this study is most conspicuous in its service as an aid to Anaocha development especially in this period of economic recession in which government wants all hands on desk to increase food production.<br/>4.            The study will also find solutions to some problem associated with co-operative in particular and Anaocha development in general.<br/>5.            Finally, the information in this study will be of enormous help to researchers who might wish to further their research into areas of Anaocha development not covered by this study.<br/>1.5        Research Questions.<br/> 1.        Do co-operative societies play any role in the development of Anambra state?<br/>2.        Is there any problem faced by Anaocha co-operative which hinders them from achieving their set objectives?<br/>3.        Do co-operative societies in Anaocha contribute to the provision of infrastructural development in Anambra state?<br/>4.        Is there any contribution of co-operative societies  in Anaocha towards Agricultural development of Anambra state?<br/>5.        Does Anambra state play any role in the development of co-operatives in Anaocha local government area?<br/>1.6        Definition of Terms.<br/>A co-operative Society:  Is

This vital role has been justified by co-operators in the socio-economic and political development particularly in developed countries like England, known for consumer co-operative and Germany known for Credit co-operative.  Likewise in the developing countries like Nigeria.<br/> Co-operative movement is a world wide phenomena from which countries have developed from simple traditional form (8) of mutual institution to a modern formally organized institution.<br/>This institution has gained world wide acceptance because of the great role.  It has played in the economy development of various countries particularly in those of the developed countries.<br/> The economic success of co-operative inevitably has social effects.  Co-operative management bring better yield which in turn yields better income and which in the essence means better housing, better health, high standard of living, and better education for members and their families.<br/>This economics success of co-operative societies has been witnessed invaluably in co-operative business enterprise.  This can be seen in the area of  co-operative credit association, which are:<br/>1.      CTLS:  Co-operative Thrift and Loan Societies. (Chukwu S.C 1990.)<br/>2.      CTCS: Co-operative Thrift and Credit Societies.<br/>1.2                  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The project work intends among other things to look into the various problems encountered by co-operative and co-operators field workers in the process of setting up and sustaining co-operative business enterprises.<br/> Some of these problems encountered in this process include ignorance, lack of knowledge on the meaning and purpose of co-operative business enterprises.<br/> Another problem is the one encountered by the government and ministerial officials in the process of getting to the people at the grassroots and so as to be able to set up co-operative business enterprises from the mutual benefit of the people.  Another area is the business cycles problem.  The problems of fluctuating business cycles has contributed to the difficulty of organizing co-operative enterprises.<br/> Finally, the project work intend to point out that lack of education of co-operative members.  In their right and duties as members of the co-operative is to be run, to ensure it’s continued existence.<br/>(Igwe C C., 1993).<br/>1.3                  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The project work is conducted to highlight the role and performance of co-operative society in terms of promotion of the economics interest, or provision of service for it’s members at a suitable rate.<br/> Also the objective of this study is to throw more light on the formation of co-operative business enterprises as regard to what motivates various individuals.  It could be for either of sociological or emotional reasons and external pressure.<br/>1.4                  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of this study, economics of co-operative business enterprises, can be x-rays in special co-operative banks that have been established in many state of the federation for financing co-operative development projects.  For instance, the federal government has given two outstanding federal government financial institutions that gives loans and advance of co-operative on soft grounds, they are:<br/>The Central Bank of Nigeria (C B N)  and the Nigeria Agricultural and Co-operative Bank (N A C B) which was established in 1973.  And  presently, the Federal Government has also set-up “FEAP Loan Scheme” for the financing of small scale business enterprises under the umbrella of co-operative society.<br/>1.5                  DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Most of the terms which are commonly used in this project report may be unfamiliar.  It may have peculiar meaning and connotations.  These terms are as follows:<br/>1.       Agricultural co-operative: Are societies that engage in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of Agricultural products.<br/>2.       Fishery Co-operative: These are societies of persons which in deep sea finding and later sale to members at a more affordable price.<br/>3.       Economic End Result: This is known as the services as the major economic result and surpluses as the minor.<br/>4.       Dividend: This is the surplus made by co-operative societies that are been distributed each year for share hinders as made in order business organization.<br/>5.       Political and Religion Mentality:  This is seen as one of the principle of the co-operative society which does not allow religion or political affair to interfere in the running of day to lay activities and admission of new members in the society.<br/>6.       Producer co-operative Society: These are association of producers.  They principally aim at purchasing factors of production in bulk.<br/>7.       Credit and Thrift Co-operative: These encourage their members to save by giving loans to members at a very low interest rates.<br/>8.       Surplus: This is the excess made from co-operative transactions but in order business enterprise it’s known as profit.<br/>9.       Patronage rebate: This means that members are given back some money according to their purchasing power or capacities toward the co-operative development.<br/> <br/>\n\nTHE  IMPORTANCE OF STUDING ECONOMICS OF CO-OPERATION AS A QUALIFYING SUBJECT FOR THE AWARD OF O.N.

ONE<br/>1.0        INTRODUCTION<br/>In Anambra State, most inhabitants survive through Agriculture and their main occupation is subsistence farming which attracted the interest  of many co-operative societies both the old and new ones.  Improving the Agricultural production was their main target and at the same time lifting the level of it size and qualities.  Most of the crop couldn’t grow well in  order to produce as expected.  The product that were several affected were yam tubers, cocoa yam, vegetable, cassava stem and tubers.<br/>In the sixties, Anambra State economy had a mono-sectorial dependency on Agriculture as the main source of earning, and also the main source of employment.  Then we took one leaf from this dependency  on agriculture to a higher dependency on trade and white collar jobs.<br/>Anambra state Agriculture is till completely preasentised,  hoe, cutlass economy with a large number of small-scale holder producers.  One can observe that Anambra state is still semi-substantial and their output from Agriculture production can neither feed the fearing population nor provide essential raw material for the agro-based industries.  The export of the state major cash crops which has in the past supported the economy has virtually stopped.<br/>While a lot of observers dwell on the urgent need to reinitialize this sector, Omuma (1986) implied the adverse effects of no reinitialization  of the agricultural sector noted that under such conditions, all it needed was famine and kwashiorkor to be evident in the village.<br/>Furthermore, one wondered why it is taking the state so long despite its abundant land and know-how to revitalize the agricultural sector and save the inhabitants of Anambra state who both underrated kwashiorkor stricken  and undernourished.  While emphasizing the importance of improving agriculture productions, through co-operatives.  Igbo (1996)  said, it is now on the government  the dependence on the external sources of food, because it has ties their state independence to the uncertainties of ridiculed.<br/>According to Anambra state food journal (1991), Agriculture was the back bone of the state’s economy development to thousands of Anambra  state indigenes over 95%  of the labour force, mostly from rural areas.  Agriculture produces feeds for animals that provide proteins for man.<br/>All these made the government to organize these present farmers into agricultural co-operative with view of having massive food production in the country.<br/>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>          Co-operative movement all over the world has been considered or taken as both mean and instrument  of development whereby individual as group of people with common social-economic come together mutually to take and solve their common socio-economic problems.  In our country today, sources of statements have been made in the newspapers and other news media, by scholars advocating the use of co-operative societies for the development and improvement of living standard of the rural people.<br/>Meanwhile, many programmes have been launched by the federal government in support of this rural development, such as Agricultural Development Project (ADP), National Land Development Authority (NALDA), Directorate of Food, Roads and Rural Infrastructures (DFRRI), Better Life  {Programme (BLP),  etc.<br/>Recently, the family support programme (FSP) which was launched by the federal government which aims at improving the life of the rural dwellers through the formation of co-operative movement.  Co-operative movement spans through many aspects of our economic life such as production, consumption, distribution, thrift, savings and the provision of rural infrastructures.<br/>1.1        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Nigeria has embarked on various programmes and policies, costing hundreds of millions of naira aimed at reviving the depressed agricultural sector.<br/>In view of this, agricultural co-operative was instituted so as to organize the small-scale farmer who are still involve in manual labour type of farming in co-operative and had failed to produce enough food for our teaming population thereby forcing the country to be involved in importation of large quantity of food with a huge percentage decline in agricultural export.  All these government efforts have not actually had much significant improvement in this sector as much emphasis is now being placed on agriculture.  This  call for urgent reexamination of the role of these agricultural products, its aim of facilitating the attainment of self sufficient in agricultural and making agriculture to take its prime position in the national economy of this country.<br/>1.2         PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The general purpose of this project report is to undertake a study of the existing farmer co-operative societies has their efforts in improving the development of agriculture.<br/>Also the study has the following objectives:<br/>a)      To examine the organizational structure and the operations of co-operatives movement in Anambra state with particular reference to Aniocha Local Government Area.<br/>b)      To examine the impact of the farmer co-operative societies.<br/>c)      To investigate the problems facing the farmers co-operative societies.<br/>d)     To suggest ways and means for enhancing the effectiveness of the societies and assist in further research into contemporary issue on this manner.<br/>1.3        DEFINITION OF TERMS.<br/>1.      Agricultural Productivity:<br/>         The index of the ratio of the value of the total farm output to the value of the total                             <br/>         input used  in farm production.<br/>2.     Farm Management:<br/>        The application of farming science and technology , the solution of the day-to-day           <br/>         problems facing the farmers.<br/>3.      Bye-laws:<br/>         We mean the registered bye-laws made by a co-operative society which governs the  <br/>         activities of  such society and which is made by a society in the exercise of any power<br/>        conferred by the co-operative society law.<br/>4.          Small-scale Individual farms:<br/>       This implies a farmer whose total cultivatable counterparts the nation of Nigeria, not to talk of the world.  If they are organized in co-operative increased productivity enhanced the profit maximized to them, and their farming will once more look attractive.<br/>5.  Auxiliary Co-Operatives:<br/>           This type provides individual services to number the co-operatives’ main functions which provide credit supply and market and storage.  The co-operatives main functions are to provide credits supply, market and storage.  The co-operative has no  hand in the supervision and management affairs of member farm.<br/>Productive Co-operatives:<br/>     There is a full integration.  The co-operative absorbs all the members business<br/>     enterprise that is members’  economic responsibilities are borne to be the co-operative which is found in Aniocha local government area.<br/>     This is co-operative by integration; the farmer depends on society for his production<br/>    activities.  There is a strong link between the co-operative and members in areas of<br/>    management facing them.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THROUGH CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES.\r\n(A CASE STUDY

therefore, co-operative exist either informal or informal or formal organizations.  But modern co-operative societies started in the year 1844 in Great Britain, England by Rochdale Equitable Pioneers after the pitfall of the earlier/pre-Rochdales in 1830’s co-operative societies as a result of negative effect of their practices and industrial revolution which rendered many people jobless because machines were introduced to replace human labour such as farmland were bought only by the rich and noblemen therefore, only the rich people could afford farming practices especially on a large scale.  There was the room for subsistence farmer.<br/>The prevailing unemployment led to widespread of poverty and destitution of common man in the society, had no house to live and had no cloth to wear because everything was owned by the capitalist.  The suffering was terrible that people had to move from place to place, jumping from one job to another, from one trade to another before they could feed their family.  However, the rich were becoming richer while the poor becoming poorer.  The bad maltreatment of the masses by the capitalist lead to intervention of people that matters a lot as far as co-operative is concerned known as Robert Owen and Dr. Williams King and Rochdale Equitable Pioneers in 1844.  They are the father of modern co-operative societies as well as the touch bearer of co-operative which passes the touch of co-operative from one generation to another, their mission in co-operative was to eliminate/reduce corrupt practices and suffering of the masses in their untold condition, nevertheless, the co-operative development in Oji River divisional co-operative council started in the year 1976 when co-operative ministry implement their policy of taking over the formal eastern Nigeria co-operative training institution, Enugu, which still remain Federal Co-operative College located at Awgu now re-located at Oji River Local Government Area, Enugu State.  But before the above mentioned institution for co-operative, there are many traditional societies in their communities, towns, which had no legal backing or legal recognition.  These societies include viz:<br/>•Egbebele Ugo Women Organisation<br/>•Onyemalu Nwanne ya Organization<br/>•Oga-adimma Organization<br/>•Oganiru Age Grade Organisation<br/>Most of these organizations mentioned above fold-up because they have no legal recognition.  Notwithstanding, following the establishment of the three (3) Federal Co-operative Colleges in Nigeria located as follows:<br/>(a)        Federal Co-operative College, Ibadan<br/>(b)        Federal Co-operative College, Kaduna<br/>(c)        Federal Co-operative College, Oji River, Enugu State, the aim of these established institutions by the Federal Government in collaboration with ministry of co-operative is to produce position co-operative experts/co-operative extension officers that will help in disseminating information on co-operative matters, moreso, impacting co-operative ideologies, principles, practices, culture and norms in all nooks and corners of the rural areas.  The idea of this sector brought about full knowledge of co-operative societies in Oji River L.G.A..  They started with six (6) autonomous communities in that area stated as follows:<br/>1.         Oganiru Achi Farmer Multi-purpose Co-operative Society (OAFMCS) Limited.<br/>2.         Akpugoeze Farmer Multipurpose Co-operative Society (A.F.M.C.S.) Ltd.<br/>3.         Igwebuike Farmers Multi-purpose Co-operative Society (IFMCS) Ltd, Inyi.<br/>4.         Ugwuoba Women Multipurpose Co-operative Society (UWMCS) Ltd.<br/>5.         Awlaw Farmers Multipurpose Co-operative Society (AFMCS) Ltd.<br/>6.         Ekemma Women Multipurpose Co-operative Society (EWMCS) Ltd.<br/>However, the above co-operative societies in Oji River divisional co-operative council excel in their business due to hard working and painstaking effort among the members, almost all of them were successful in their respective business they work relentlessly with co-operative spirit.<br/>The record of their achievement according to the data available in the course of this study shows that there is increase in type of co-operative societies, increase in the membership strength and increase in business of co-operative societies of the area.  They had the record of an increase in the different brand of co-operative societies right from the 1998 – 2004.  The societies in that area increase from six (6) to hundred and sixty-five (165) that call for study on this regard.<br/>Other salient factors responsible for poor co-operative development in Oji River divisional co-operative council were stated as follows below:<br/>1.         Lack of awareness:  The awareness about co-operative is not enough, most of the people in some communities of Oji River Local Government due to poor awareness campaign on mass media such as television, radio, co-operative journal, newspapers and magazines etc.<br/>The co-operative experts and extension agents has a lot to do in dissemination of information about co-operative societies, to lecture than on the meaning of co-operative societies, the principles and practices of co-operative, norms and values as well as the benefit they are going to derive after joining co-operative societies (co-operative effect).<br/>2.         Lack of Trust Among Some Co-operators:  Most of co-operators failed to fulfill their promises to some communities in that area, moreso, officers discriminate each other in terms of differences in communities or towns, race, tribe.  Under this arrangement, it discourages non-members, staff and government in participating in co-operative activities.  Thereby decrease the rate of co-operative development of the area.<br/>3.         Abandonment of Co-operative Projects:  Most of co-operative project were abandoned and lack of revisitation of projects as a result of mismanagement of resources by some staff.  In Akpugoeze for instance, co-operative societies in that area abandoned their farms and oil mail at Nkwere-Inyi, Oji River L.G.A. and other cumulated misconducts that are responsible for poor participation of non-members and government in co-operative development.<br/>4.         Lack of unity among the clans:  The co-operative development in Oji River always sustain misinterpretation and conflict with the communities thereby hindered the effort of co-operative officials of the area.<br/>5.         Poor Support from State Government:  It is observed that co-operative societies existing within Oji River divisional co-operative council, otherwise their affiliates did not receive enough support from the state government.  Such support like fertilizers, tractors, pesticides, fungicides, herbicides etc and other incentives like grants, and subsidies.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The study on this regard, co-operative development and government was designed to access and ascertain co-operative societies existing in some autonomous communities of Oji River Local Government Area.  Such communities like Achi, Inyinese, Omeire, Awlaw, Akpugoeze, Ugwuoba autonomous communities all in Oji River, Enugu.<br/>The research work also covered the whole parts of Oji River Local Government area to determine the effectiveness of co-operative and government in development of co-operative societies in Oji River from 1999 – 2004.  The study also extend to some institutions mentioned but few co-operative unit/ministries, Federal Co-operative College, Oji River, Institution of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu and at Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUTECH) to call forth some useful ideas.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM:<br/>In Oji River divisional co-operative council of Enugu State, about  70% of the total population deeply engaged on peasant/subsistence farming and small scale business enterprise.  It is only about less than 30% of the population engaged in white cola job/office work, therefore, for farmers to thrive in Oji River Local Government Area according to the experiment of fact conducted in Oji River divisional council within the range of 1999 – 2004 there is a great need for them to organize themselves as a group; “co-operative society, to increase the productivity level, since, co-operative stand on a better chance to mechanize agriculture.  Therefore, farmers should do all they can, to organize themselves as co-operative society to enable them progress in their agricultural operations.  Such benefit is like getting loan easily from any financial institution at a cheaper rate of interest without unnecessary protocol such as collateral security with the aid of Certificate of Registration.  They will obtain loan easily especially, on co-operative banks, agricultural banks, Nigeria Agricultural Co-operative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) moreso, as a group they can get inputs like fertilizers, tractors, pesticides, and other incentives like grants, subsidies, etc poor participation of government in co-operative development like share capital, entrance fees of members, deposit from members, donations from cheerful giver, reserve etc, which is very bad for co-operative society who wants to make impact on co-operative business and societies who want to grow.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The study on this regard has its significance which focus on development of co-operative societies in Oji River Local Government, the degree of Government participation in co-operative matters, with special reference to Oji River Divisional Co-operative Council in terms of management of co-operative societies under their control.  The sole aim of this studies is to review the condition of co-operative development and to provide materials for the successor as well as the beneficiaries (undergraduates students) of Co-operative Economics and Management of Institute of Management and Technology, Enugu in their academic pursuit.<br/>It will also serve as a policy guide in the local government depending on those who made their carrier on co-operative field, and for those who have interest on co-operative thought.  Nevertheless, Oji River Local Government has its potential resources for co-operative sector and non-co-operative sector of economy, such as:<br/>(a)        Police College:  The Nigeria Police College was established for training of forces on disciplinary actions to maintain peace and order in Oji River and nation at large.<br/>(b)        Federal School of Health and Technology:  The School of Health was instituted in Oji River Local Government for training of nurses and it is equivalent to combat diseases and sickness in Oji River.<br/>(c)        Federal Co-operative College:  One among the three federal co-operative colleges in Nigeria through the joint effort of Government and Ministry of Co-operative experts in all co-operative professionals especially, on technical issues, for them to help farmers in the rural areas of Oji River. <br/>(d)       National Electric Power Authority:  The electrical power authority was established in Oji River to take the responsibility of electricity supply in sundries of Oji River Government.<br/>(e)        Natural Pure Water:  This was known as (water worse).  It is naturally pure and minor potentials which serve as yardstick to the neighbouring Local Government and state at large.  However, co-operative is very important especially during the period of state and federal government wants to use co-operative as a spring board in implementation of their policies and programme at the grassroot level.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS:<br/>The following questions were designed for my investigation and inquiry in Oji River divisional co-operative council states as follows:<br/>1.                  Are there existing co-operative societies in the local government area viable enough to contribute to co-operative development?<br/>2.                  Are there enough co-operative societies in the local government?<br/>3.                  What are the factors that have hindered the effective mobilization of co-operative societies in order to enhance co-operative development in Oji River?<br/>4.                  What service members drive from the existing societies (co-operative effect).<br/>5.                  On what aspect has co-operative societies have intervened on economic conflict of Oji River Local Government to enhance development at the grassroot level.<br/>  <br/>\n\nCO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNMENT \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF OJI RIVER L.G.A.

APPENDIX           <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0        INTRODUCTION<br/>In Anambra State, most inhabitants survive through Agriculture and their main occupation is subsistence farming which attracted the interest  of many co-operative societies both the old and new ones.  Improving the Agricultural production was their main target and at the same time lifting the level of it size and qualities.  Most of the crop couldn’t grow well in  order to produce as expected.  The product that were several affected were yam tubers, cocoa yam, vegetable, cassava stem and tubers.<br/>In the sixties, Anambra State economy had a mono-sectorial dependency on Agriculture as the main source of earning, and also the main source of employment.  Then we took one leaf from this dependency  on agriculture to a higher dependency on trade and white collar jobs.<br/>Anambra state Agriculture is till completely preasentised,  hoe, cutlass economy with a large number of small-scale holder producers.  One can observe that Anambra state is still semi-substantial and their output from Agriculture production can neither feed the fearing population nor provide essential raw material for the agro-based industries.  The export of the state major cash crops which has in the past supported the economy has virtually stopped.<br/>While a lot of observers dwell on the urgent need to reinitialize this sector, Omuma (1986) implied the adverse effects of no reinitialization  of the agricultural sector noted that under such conditions, all it needed was famine and kwashiorkor to be evident in the village.<br/>Furthermore, one wondered why it is taking the state so long despite its abundant land and know-how to revitalize the agricultural sector and save the inhabitants of Anambra state who both underrated kwashiorkor stricken  and undernourished.  While emphasizing the importance of improving agriculture productions, through co-operatives.  Igbo (1996)  said, it is now on the government  the dependence on the external sources of food, because it has ties their state independence to the uncertainties of ridiculed.<br/>According to Anambra state food journal (1991), Agriculture was the back bone of the state’s economy development to thousands of Anambra  state indigenes over 95%  of the labour force, mostly from rural areas.  Agriculture produces feeds for animals that provide proteins for man.<br/>All these made the government to organize these present farmers into agricultural co-operative with view of having massive food production in the country.<br/>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>          Co-operative movement all over the world has been considered or taken as both mean and instrument  of development whereby individual as group of people with common social-economic come together mutually to take and solve their common socio-economic problems.  In our country today, sources of statements have been made in the newspapers and other news media, by scholars advocating the use of co-operative societies for the development and improvement of living standard of the rural people.<br/>Meanwhile, many programmes have been launched by the federal government in support of this rural development, such as Agricultural Development Project (ADP), National Land Development Authority (NALDA), Directorate of Food, Roads and Rural Infrastructures (DFRRI), Better Life  {Programme (BLP),  etc.<br/>Recently, the family support programme (FSP) which was launched by the federal government which aims at improving the life of the rural dwellers through the formation of co-operative movement.  Co-operative movement spans through many aspects of our economic life such as production, consumption, distribution, thrift, savings and the provision of rural infrastructures.<br/>1.1        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Nigeria has embarked on various programmes and policies, costing hundreds of millions of naira aimed at reviving the depressed agricultural sector.<br/>In view of this, agricultural co-operative was instituted so as to organize the small-scale farmer who are still involve in manual labour type of farming in co-operative and had failed to produce enough food for our teaming population thereby forcing the country to be involved in importation of large quantity of food with a huge percentage decline in agricultural export.  All these government efforts have not actually had much significant improvement in this sector as much emphasis is now being placed on agriculture.  This  call for urgent reexamination of the role of these agricultural products, its aim of facilitating the attainment of self sufficient in agricultural and making agriculture to take its prime position in the national economy of this country.<br/>1.2         PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The general purpose of this project report is to undertake a study of the existing farmer co-operative societies has their efforts in improving the development of agriculture.<br/>Also the study has the following objectives:<br/>a)      To examine the organizational structure and the operations of co-operatives movement in Anambra state with particular reference to Aniocha Local Government Area.<br/>b)      To examine the impact of the farmer co-operative societies.<br/>c)      To investigate the problems facing the farmers co-operative societies.<br/>d)     To suggest ways and means for enhancing the effectiveness of the societies and assist in further research into contemporary issue on this manner.<br/>1.3        DEFINITION OF TERMS.<br/>1.      Agricultural Productivity:<br/>         The index of the ratio of the value of the total farm output to the value of the total                             <br/>         input used  in farm production.<br/>2.     Farm Management:<br/>        The application of farming science and technology , the solution of the day-to-day           <br/>         problems facing the farmers.<br/>3.      Bye-laws:<br/>         We mean the registered bye-laws made by a co-operative society which governs the  <br/>         activities of  such society and which is made by a society in the exercise of any power<br/>        conferred by the co-operative society law.<br/>4.          Small-scale Individual farms:<br/>       This implies a farmer whose total cultivatable counterparts the nation of Nigeria, not to talk of the world.  If they are organized in co-operative increased productivity enhanced the profit maximized to them, and their farming will once more look attractive.<br/>5.  Auxiliary Co-Operatives:<br/>           This type provides individual services to number the co-operatives’ main functions which provide credit supply and market and storage.  The co-operatives main functions are to provide credits supply, market and storage.  The co-operative has no  hand in the supervision and management affairs of member farm.<br/>Productive Co-operatives:<br/>     There is a full integration.  The co-operative absorbs all the members business<br/>     enterprise that is members’  economic responsibilities are borne to be the co-operative which is found in Aniocha local government area.<br/>     This is co-operative by integration; the farmer depends on society for his production<br/>    activities.  There is a strong link between the co-operative and members in areas of<br/>    management facing them.<br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL

It is a system divided into exploiters of exploited in which the exploiters namely the capitalist: own the means of production that is means production, which means of life in the form of venture capital and property.<br/>        During this period, people begin to search for remedies to stop the evil of capitalism. It was in this period that the following Robert Own came up with an ideal of organization the people, to stop the evil of capitalism and to promote the economic interest of the people through cooperative.<br/>What is Cooperative? <br/>The definition of cooperative was defined by the (ICA) international Cooperative Alliance (1995), according Onoh (2009:15), as an autonomous association of person(s), united voluntarily to met their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspiration through a jointly owned and democratically body which means they are free from government and external bodies.  The members of the cooperative society join voluntarily, it is an association of person, not of capital and their objective is to meet their member’s needs in the economic circle.<br/>What is Mobilization <br/>Mobilization means gathering of people together, to work, in order to achieve a particular goal or aims.  Before mobilization system can be successful, the people involved must have the same common interest.  It can be seen as a way helping people in achieving their actualized dreams. It is important to mobilize their actualized dreams. It is important to mobilize people because it encourages people towards achieving their specific goals.<br/>        Therefore, mobilization in this context means gathering of rural farmers, towards achieving their aims or goals.  And during this mobilization, the rural farmers are educated and developed in the field.<br/>How can Cooperative Mobilize the Rural Farmers <br/>The cooperative can mobilize the rural farmers through organizing an agricultural or supporting programmes which helps in reducing illiteracy among the rural farmers and also develop their knowledge in agricultural activities.  And the program, are some of supporting programmes that helps in developing the rural farmers and they are Fadama Development project (FDPs), Rivers Basic and Rural Development Authorities (RBRSAs), Agricultural Development PRogramme (ADPs), National Agricultural Land Development Authorities (NALDA) etc.<br/>        Since the rural farmers are faced with inadequate capital, the cooperative can mobilize them by giving them grants, loans, funds, and credit which the rural farmers can easily payback.  They should also provide them with Agro-chemical such as fertilizers, pesticides etc which helps them in improving their farm product and controlling of disease, and pest or insect.<br/>        The cooperative acting as a link between the rural farmers and the government should represent the rural farmers well by presenting their problems and also sought for support from the government on behalf of the rural farmers they should also make it possible for the government to support the programme of the rural farmers through finances and any other means.<br/>        The cooperative society can mobilize the rural farmers through sending extensional officers to them, to educate the supervise all their activities.  Extensional officers such as auditors, inspectors, arbitrator etc to oversee al the affaires of the rural farmers.<br/>Who are Rural Farmers<br/>Rural farmers are those farmers who practice agricultural activities in their village sector rural area.  They are not expert and they lack government support.<br/>These farmers of their finance in running the affairs of their farm, they are note educated.<br/>Functions of the Rural Farmers<br/>1.   The rural farmers practices agricultural activities like cultivating of crops, veering of animals, fishery etc.<br/>2.   The rural farmers are mainly based on subsistence farming system.<br/>3.   Some of the rural farmers who are based on cultivation to tubers have barns where their tuber products are spread.  Tubers like yams, cocoyam etc<br/>4.   In most rural areas, the time of farming and harvesting are periodic.  For instance, in my hometown, we have time when all the farmers go and harvest their cassava products and apart from that day, no farmer is allowed to enter into his farm.<br/>5.   The rural farmers practices farm activities annually and especially during running season.<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem <br/>Before the arrival of the cooperative, the rural farmers has being facing some problems which affected their agricultural activities.  <br/>Lack of Capital:  The rural farmers do not have enough capital in financing and running the activities of their farm.<br/>1.   High Level of Illiteracy: The rural farmers are illiterates, no education, no advise from expert, so because of this, the farm system are low and poor.<br/>2.   Inadequate Infrastructural Facilities: The rural farmers do not have good roads, hospital and educational centres which actually affect the farming activities.<br/>3.   Lack of Government Support: The rural farmers do not receive any encouragement and support from the government.<br/>4.   Lack of Tools: Most rural farmers does not have capital in order to purchase the farm tools and machineries.  Thereby they lack most tools and it affect their farming system.<br/>1.3    Objectives of the Study <br/>The broad objectives of the project is to determine how the rural farmers could be mobilize through the cooperative in Nsukka LGA of Enugu.<br/>The specific objectives are to:<br/>1.   How can the impact of the rural farmers be examined?<br/>2.   In what ways can be rural farmers be educated?<br/>3.   How can the cooperative serve as a link between the government and the rural farmers.<br/>4.   What are the problems facing the rural farmers.<br/>5.   What are the possible solutions to these problems?<br/>1.5    Significance of the study <br/>1.     This project will be of a great advantage to the students for more research on this topic.<br/>2.     It will help the government in making policy for cooperative and rural farmers.<br/>3.     It will help the rural farmers in maintaining good relationship with the cooperative.<br/>4.     It will help the cooperative in putting more effort and make policy towards the mobilization of rural farmers.<br/>5.     This project work will help Nigerians in looking into the development of the rural farmers and rural areas.<br/>1.7    Definition of Terms <br/>1.      Mobilization: Mobilization in the context means gathering of rural farmers in order to achieve their common goals.<br/>2.      Farm Products: They are those things produce by rural farmers after harvesting.<br/>3.      Rural Farmers: Rural farmers are those farmers that practice agricultural activities in a rural area.<br/>   <br/>\n\nMOBILIZATION OF RURAL FARMERS THROUGH COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT IN ENUGU STATE \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NSUKKA, LOCAL

their main occupation is subsistence farming which attract the interest of may cooperative societies both old and new ones.          Agriculture plays a very central role in the economic development of Nigeria like offering of employment to more than 65% of the working population account for more than 70% of non oil exports and provides raw materials for the industrial sector.         Following the oil boom in the seventies agricultural production started to decline, the country started expressing increasing food shortage with the attendant increase in the quantity of food imports.<br/>        One can observe that Enugu state is still semi substantial and their output from agriculture production can neither feed the fearing population nor provide essential raw materials for the agro based industries. The export of the state major cash crops which has in the past supported the economy has verbally stopped.<br/>        While a lot of observers dwelt on the urgent need to reinitialize this sector, Omuma (1998) implied that the adverse effect of non-initialization of the agriculture sector will only bring such condition like famine and Kwashiorkor to the village but emphasizing on the importance of improving agricultural production through loans from government Igbo (1986) said it is now on the government for the independence on the external sources of food because it has tried their state independence to the uncertainties of ridicule.’<br/>        Then in the early seventies, the central bank of Nigeria and the federal government carried out a study to find out reasons for the declining agricultural production. The study revealed that credit was one of the major factors then the commercial and merchant banks (now deposit money bank) were reluctant to lend to agriculture because of the high default risk and the inability of the borrower offer tangible collateral.<br/>        The agricultural credit guarantee scheme was established in 1977 to share in the risk of the banks in agricultural lending and hence encourage them to continue to extend credit to it. As at 31st December 2004 the total investment under the scheme were N4.4billion.<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>          In our country today, sources of statements have been made in the newspapers and other news media, scholars advocating the use of agriculture for the development and improvement of living standard of the rural people. Agricultural activities have brought about solutions to our national problem of massive food shortage.      Many agricultural cooperative societies plays vital role and function in massive food production they include the following:<br/>1.   Agriculture has embrace all the cooperative activities with the aim of helping farmers in their professional capacities and producers. The inherent weakness of farming Calo of this type of cooperative society.<br/>2.   Agriculture has contributed immensely to the improvement of the viability of the small holders by bringing their economies of scale.<br/>3.   Agricultural activities are a type of producers cooperatives which aim at improving food production and well being of the citizens.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Much of the increase in Nigerians agricultural output in recent years has resulted from expansion of the area under cultivation rather from increased productivity. Some of the many problems militating against the agricultural sector have been listed and discussed.<br/>Infrastructure Problem<br/>Which include the following              <br/>Poor feeder road and inadequate road network between the rural areas where agriculture production mainly takes place and the urban area <br/>Lack of appropriate on-farm and off-farm storage facilities.<br/>        Irrigation facilities are still very poor despite the existence of River Basin  and rural Development Authorities (RBRDA) for instance in Ogun state only 15 hectares of land were irrigated between 1997 and 1999 by Ogun-Osun RBRDA.<br/>Manpower/Skill Underdeveloped Problems<br/>          The extension services delivery system still suffers from inadequate number of extension men/women. The few areas that are in place lack mobility to improve on extension farmers while women extensionist are few to handle gender issues.<br/>Inadequate capital is a major problem hindering agricultural production.<br/>Default in repayment of loan by peasant farmers who could not meet up with loan    collateral   requirement         <br/>Low income and poor provision of collateral ,security to qualify for credit worthiness  <br/>Government /Regulatory Policy Problems            <br/>        There are numerous policies that are not supportive enough to agriculture transformation E.G landAct ,importation tariff and unproductive policies. <br/> 1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>          The general purpose of this project report is to undertake a study of the existing farmers of agricultural activities and the effort of the government in enhancing the development of agriculture through the agricultural credit guarantee scheme, also the study has the following objectives.<br/>(a)        To examine the organizational structure and the operation of agricultural activities in Enugu state with particular reference to Nkanu East local government area.<br/>(b)        To examine the impact of the farmer’s cooperative societies.       <br/>(c) Investigate the problems facing the farmers co-operative societies.<br/>(d)        To suggest ways and means for enhancing and proffering for loans from banks for the effectiveness of the societies and assist in further research into contemporary issue on this manner.<br/>(e)        To increase production of livestock and fish to meet the domestic needs and increase surplus for export.<br/>(f)  To know whether there are benefits members derive from the agricultural cooperative societies in the area.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS    <br/>1.   What are the main objectives for establishing of agricultural cooperative societies in Nkanu East local government area?<br/>2.   To what extent have these objectives been realized?<br/>3.   What are the problem militating against agricultural activities?<br/>4.   Do agricultural cooperative societies receive support from the government?<br/>5.   What are their sources of finance?<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>          Any study that has positive outcome must have negative aspect moreover the significance of the particular studies are central banks of Nigeria has taken up greater responsibilities particularly with respect to information of agricultural policy and various means which enhances agricultural productivity.<br/>        Areas of central banks of Nigeria involvement in improving agricultural activity  includes:<br/>(a)        Agricultural research<br/>(b)        Training of middle level agricultural workers<br/>(c) Creation of loans and large scale mechanization food agriculture farmers.        <br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS        <br/>Agricultural Cooperative: agricultural cooperative <br/>societies are those societies which embark all the cooperatives activities which is aimed at helping farmers in the professional capacities as producers.

The study was carried out to survey the past programmes and policies constituted by government to mobilize peasant farmers into agricultural cooperatives and check the functionality of the existing ones, as a way of facilitating the attainment of self-sufficiency in agricultural output. The challenges inhibiting achievement of the objective of these agricultural cooperatives and how it affects agricultural cooperatives in Anambra state was indentified. These challenges included use of crude and primitive method of farming implements, poor member-education and inadequate public awareness of cooperative potential, inadequate storage facilities and marketing outlets, individualism among Nigerian unwillingness to pool resources and work together and excessive control by the government who develops initiatives and direction the society would go.   Finally, to curtail all these challenges, improved and adequate co-ordination has to be put into consideration between the state and local government authorities, political and policy instability and inconsistency should be avoided and there should be adequately trained personnel.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTES<br/>Chapter One<br/>1.0        Introduction                                                <br/>1.1    Background of the study                               <br/>1.2    Statement of the study                         <br/>1.3    objectives of the study                         <br/>1.4    Research Hypothesis                            <br/>1.5    Significance of the study                               <br/>1.6    Scope and limitation of the study           <br/>1.7    Definition of Terms                                      <br/>Chapter Two<br/>Literature Review                                                        <br/>2.0    The Concept of Agriculture and cooperative      <br/>2.1    Importance of Agricultural Cooperative            <br/>2.2    Problem of Agriculture Cooperatives               <br/>2.3    The Importance of Farmers Cooperative Society<br/>2.4    Government Policies and Programmes            <br/>2.5    Types and Organizatioanl Forms of Agriculture<br/>Chapter Three<br/>3.0    Research Design and  Methodology                <br/>3.1    Population of study                                              <br/>3.2    Determination of Sample Size                                <br/>3.3    Sources of Data                                          <br/>3.4    Research Instrument                                    <br/>3.5    Instrument for Data Analysis                         <br/>Chapter Four <br/>4.0    Presentation, Analysis and Interpretation of Data<br/>4.1    Presentation of Data                            <br/>4.2    Analysis of Data                                  <br/>Chapter Five<br/>5.1    Summary of Findings                           <br/>5.2    Recommendations                                       <br/>5.3    Conclusion                                          <br/>Bibliography <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>          Agriculture is the bedrock of any nation’s economy. However, the dilapidating state of Nigeria’s agricultural sector and its consequences on the socio-economic development of the nation’s economy had given rise to this research work. Thinking along this path, the need to look into the sector and address the issue of poor performance gave rise to the establishment of agricultural cooperative societies to increase agricultural cooperatives societies to increase agricultural output. This is because agricultural cooperative have a large number of labour force in the rural area, who have contributed in the production of food crops, raw materials for industries and as a means of foreign exchange.<br/>        In the 60s, Anambra state economy had mono-sectorial dependency on agriculture as the main source of earning and employment for the ever teeming population. In the 70s, there was s shift from agricultural produce to non-agricultural sector.           The state is still peasantised with a larger number of people involved in smalls-scale production and there had been no significant agrarian modernization and revolution. Subsistence agricultural is still been practiced which its output is not enough to feed the population, let alone provide raw materials for our agro based industries.<br/>        Exportation of the state’s cash crops which in the past has supported the economy has virtually reduced. This has been blamed on negligence and poor performance of the farmer’s agricultural cooperative societies. And at such there was urgent need to revitalize the sector, owing to its importance in improving agricultural output in the country.<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>          The government had been making efforts to improve agriculture in Nigeria both at the state and federal levels. However, there still goods scarcity in the country. Population is more rapid than agricultural growth and this has seriously reduced the benefits of increased food production and the associated increase in income.<br/>        As a result of this, many people in the country still without food, irrespective of the strategic position of agriculture in the state economy and the huge allocate made out to importation of food items. Thus a need to come up with a solution through proper diagnosis of the problems confronting the sector. This resulted in the bringing together these peasant farmers under cooperative societies with a view of improving agricultural production, increase income earning and self-sufficient in good items.<br/>        Prior to the discovering of crude oil in Nigeria, there were cash crops like groundnut, cocoa and rubber, cultivated in large quantities which were exported to Europe and America in the pre 60s. The incursion of military government in Nigeria politics had equally contributed to the poor state of the sector and even with transition to democracy, the country is yet t regain her position in the agricultural market. The administration of president Olusegun Obasanjo has watered the ground to empower Nigerian farmers and agro-allied investors to harness the country’s rich resources in producing food and raw materials for industries and export by ensuring banks and other extension services like making available fertilizers, pesticides, planting technologies etc at subsidies rate.<br/>        Working in hand with the farmers is the Nigerian export promotion council which assists in finding buyers of cash crops produced. Land was equally provided at reasonable term for large scale farming.         Government equally encouraged foreign agriculture investors which has yielded a remarkable result for instance the southern African countries have found Nigeria at home to start off operations to produce.   The agricultural initiative of the Obasanjo administration saw to the restriction of some food importation thereby encouraging our local farmers to compete in the international market.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM              <br/>        Nigerian government had embarked on various programmes and policies involving hundreds of millions of naira, aimed at reviving the ailing agricultural sector. This gave rise to the organization of small scale farmers into agricultural cooperatives societies in order to meet the demand of the growing population. However, these efforts and the cooperative societies have failed in achieving this objective which has made the nation rely heavily on importation and deterioration of the agricultural sector and the industries. Thus, this research aims at examining the need to improve the activities of the cooperative societies with a view to increasing agricultural output to enhance the socio-economic development of the nation.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY      <br/>        The main purpose/objective of this project is to undertake a study of the existing farmers cooperative development of agriculture.<br/>        The study has the following specific objectives<br/>(a)        To examine the organizational set up and operations of the farmers’ cooperative movement in Anambra state with a particular reference to selected cooperative societies I the state.<br/>(b)        To examine the impact of farmers cooperative societies to agricultural output.  <br/>(c)         To investigate the problems confronting farmers cooperative societies.<br/>(d)        To suggest pragmatic ways and means of enhancing the effectiveness of these societies.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS   <br/>     i.        What is the organizational set up and operations of farmer’s cooperative movement in Anambra state?  <br/>    ii.        What is the impact of farmer’s cooperative societies on agricultural output in Nigeria?<br/>  iii.        What are the problems confronting agricultural cooperative societies in Nigeria?  <br/>  iv.        How can these problems facing agricultural cooperative societies be tackled in other to enhance the effectiveness of these cooperative societies in Nigeria?<br/>1.5    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>          For agricultural cooperative societies to attain high service and huge surplus, there must be an adequate assistance from the government, educated cooperators and committee members and adherence to cooperatives principles, law and rules in their activities.   The full success of agricultural cooperative societies will depend on the extend of assistance received from the government and the level of commitment the members show to the society and their activities as well. Hence, collectivity will go along way rather than individualism in the achievement of self sufficiency in food production.<br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY    <br/>        Agriculture is so important in order to sustain any economy. This is because the benefits of agriculture especially to most developing nations cannot be over emphasized. However, the system of agriculture in Nigeria society is more of subsistence than commercial. This role of organizing individual farmer’s into a larger umbrella to increase their output, if they must attain economic and social goals and freedom the nation’s economy. Equally, through this research study, the government will be better informed of the challenges confronting the agricultural cooperative societies in a bid to proper solution that would enhance efficiency.<br/>        Through this research work, farmers cooperative societies would be educated as well as enlightened on the benefits they stand to gain from their activities in terms of profits maximization, increased income and the assistance the government is willing to offer them such as extending credit facilities to them, education on farming techniques, provision of farm items, such as fertilizers, at a cheaper price than they would have obtained outside of the societies.<br/>        Finally it would also be of benefit to students who wish to go into agricultural business in the near future to take advantage of cooperative societies in order to excel and compete in the international markets across the globe.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>        Most of the terms used in this research work are register of cooperative societies which may be unfamiliar to the readers. At such there was need to define them for clearly understanding of the study.<br/>Agricultural productivity:  This is the index of the ratio <br/>of the value of the total farm output to the value of total inputs used in production.<br/>Farm Management:   the application of farming with <br/>science and technology to the solution of the day to day problems facing farmers.<br/>Agriculture:      can be broadly defined as the art and <br/>science of production of plants and animals that are of benefits to man.<br/>Cooperative Society: this is a form of organization <br/>where people voluntarily associate together as human beings on the basis of equality for the promotion of their economic and social interests.<br/>Production Promotion Cooperative:   This is cooperative <br/>by integration. The farmers depend on the society for their production activities. There is a strong link between the cooperative and its members in the area of management, credit and decision making.<br/>             <br/>\n\nSOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING AGRICULTURAL

class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The study was conducted to examine how unemployment can\r\nbe reduced through the cooperative movement (A Case Study  of Co-operative\r\nFederation of Anambra State), In the course of this investigation, research\r\nobjective and hypothesis were formulated.  Both primary and secondary data\r\nwere collected, and data were then presented in a tabular form. Based on the\r\nabove,   the findings on the topic are as follows: Staff/employee of\r\nthe sampled cooperative are averagely qualified for their various jobs and they\r\nare given opportunities for further training by the cooperative societies.\r\nEmployee of the sampled cooperative are averagely paid with some necessary\r\nallowances. Co-operative societies absorb about 35% of school leavers yearly.\r\nThere is a continuous education both to the members and the whole public. The\r\nresearcher’s recommendations include these: Government should make it\r\ncompulsory for every establishment to have its own cooperative. Government\r\nshould set up more cooperative banks to give loans to individuals and groups\r\nthat are prospecting to establish cooperative. In conclusion the researcher\r\ndeemed it necessary that every hand must be on desk to encourage the\r\nestablishment of cooperative enterprises, since it is now obvious that the only\r\noption left for us is to adopt the socio- economic model of mutual self help.<span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New

percent in 2012. Historically, from 2006 until 2012, Nigeria Unemployment\r\nRate averaged 14.60 Percent reaching an all time high of 23.90 Percent in\r\nDecember of 2012 and a record low of 5.30 Percent in December of 2006. The\r\nunemployment rate can be defined as the number of people actively looking for a\r\njob as a percentage of the labour force. This year 2012 the Federal government\r\nbudgeted over N50 billion deal with unemployment yet, unemployment increases on\r\ndaily basis.  Both the state and federal governments are lunching out a\r\nlot of programmes, on small scale business enterprise, yet unemployment is\r\nincreasing. There is vast unemployment in Nigeria and Anambra State in\r\nparticular.  After many years of democracy there are graduates of 15 (fifteen)\r\nyears standing, that room the street in search of white-collar jobs that don’t\r\nexist.  Unemployment is still on the increased irrespective of federal\r\ngovernment budget to curb the scourge.   However, the fact remains\r\nthat no country can succeed in providing a reasonable standard of living for\r\nher citizens.  It is now obvious that the only option left to us is to\r\nadopt the socio – economic model of mutual self help whereby unemployed\r\nindividuals can voluntarily join together to achieve a common goal through the\r\nformation of co-operative enterprise. Co-operative we know plays multiple roles\r\nas institutional frame work for allocating scarce resources, stimulating\r\neconomic growth and enhancing economic welfare.  It raises the income\r\nlevel of the people by providing income earning opportunities.   Many\r\nreasons have been given for this critical situation concerning  jobs, and\r\nsuch reasons include rapid growth of population in our country, the movement of\r\ncapital to the cheap labour and the impact of new technology.  This study\r\nwill be made up of five chapters, chapter one deals with the introductory part\r\nof the study. It will touch on vital subjects such as statement of the\r\nproblems, purpose of the study, scope of the formulation of hypotheses, theoretical\r\nframework, limitation of the study. Chapter two highlights the literature\r\nreview which is other peoples view on the subject matter, the study will\r\nattempt to strike a balance between observation and theoretical concepts and\r\nfeeling of COFAS in reducing unemployment. Chapter three will deal with the\r\nareas covered by the study and the method employed in the analysis of the data\r\nthat will be collected through research questionnaire, design, selection of\r\nsample size, sources of research materials, the research instruments and\r\ntreatment of data. Chapter four will analyze the collected data and presented\r\nthem in a simple form as to enhance proper understanding and provide correct\r\nstatistical testing for the postulated hypotheses in the study using the\r\nchi-square. Chapter five will bring about together the summary of findings,\r\nincorporating the observed data to make recommendations on how to government\r\nwill facility the activities of cooperatives societies in other state a part\r\nfrom COFAS. On which recommendation s will be made.<span style='font-family:\r\n\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";mso-bidi-theme-font:\r\nminor-bidi'></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">CHAPTER ONE<span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";\r\nmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi'></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">1.0      INTRODUCTION<span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\nmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi'></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\nmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi'></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Co-operative is a basis for overall information of\r\ncitizenry social and economic problems. According to (Berko (1987:),\r\nco-operative society is a voluntary and democratic association of persons, with\r\nvariable membership and variable capital whose members pooled themselves and\r\ntheir resources together on mutual and self help basis to form a business\r\nenterprise which seeks to solve the socio-economic problem(s) of these members by\r\ndirectly providing goods and services to them in their capacity as either the\r\nowner/customer or owner – employees of the cooperative enterprise.<span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\nmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi'></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">According to (Amahalu  (2005 :2), cooperative is\r\ndefined as an association usually incorporated with economic aims, formed by or\r\nfor persons or co operations, having common needs, approximately equal voice in\r\nmanagement, making approximately  equal or proportional contributions to\r\ncapital, deriving proportionate services and benefits from it.<span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\nmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi'></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Co-operative in order to promote the welfare of their\r\nmembers involve themselves in most tangible projects like building of houses,\r\nbuilding of schools, building of hospitals, building of recreation centers,\r\nmarkets and building of industries.  Co-operative serves as a hold to\r\ncompany and local development agency; it also seek to provide a community owned\r\nstructure.<span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";mso-bidi-font-family:\r\n\"Times New Roman\";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi'></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">1.2

there is vast unemployment in Nigeria and\r\n   Anambra state in particular.  After many years of democracy\r\nthere are graduates of 15 (fifteen) years standing, that room the street in\r\nsearch of white-collar jobs that don’t exist.  Unemployment is still on\r\nthe increased irrespective of federal government budget to curb the\r\nscourge.  In the year 2000 the Federal government budgeted N10 billion and\r\nN20 billion  in 2001 to deal with unemployment yet, unemployment increases\r\non daily basis.  Both the state and federal governments are lunching out a\r\nlot of programmes, on small scale business enterprise, yet unemployment is\r\nincreasing.<span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\";mso-bidi-font-family:\r\n\"Times New

It is the most widely cultivated crop in the Southern part of the country in terms of area devoted to it and number of farmers growing it. Indeed, it is growth by almost every household, cassava has also increased in important in the middle belt in recent years, in all places, cassava has become very popular as a good and cash crop and is fast replacing yam and other traditional staples of the area.  In all over fourth fifth of the cultivable land area is suitable for cassava growing.<br/>        Cassava (Manihot Esculenta Crantz) was introduction into central African from South America in the Sixteeth century by the early Portuguese explorers (Jones 1959), it was probably the emancipated slaves who introduced the cassava crop into Southern Nigeria as they returned to the country from South America with the Islands of Scio-Tonne and Fernando Po A. E. that time there were Portuguese colonies of Nigeria shores (Ekandem) cassava, however, did not become important in the country until the end of the nineteenth century when processing techniques were introduced, as many more slaves returned home.  Cassava is important not only as a good group but even more so as a major source of income for rural households, Nigeria is currently the largest producer of cassava in the world with an annual production of over 34 million tones of tuberous roots.  Cassava is largely consumed in many processed forms in Nigeria, its use in the industry and liverstock feed, it well known but is gradually increasing, especially as important substitution becomes prominent in the industrial sector of the economy.<br/>        As a cash crop, cassava generates each income for the largest number of households of comparison with other staples.  It is produced with relevant purchased inputs as frequently as and in some cases more of total production, probably larger than of most staples, is planted annually for sale.<br/>        As a food corp, cassava has some inherent characteristic which make it attractive, especially to the cassava processing industries in Nigeria.  First, it is rich in carbohydrate especially starch and consequently has a multiplicity of end uses, secondly, it is available all year round, making it preferable to other more seasonable crops such as grains, pees and beans and other crops for food security.  Compared to grains, cassava is more tolerant of low soil fertility and more resistance to drought, pest and disease furthermore, its roots are storable in they ground for months after the mature.  These attributes combined with other socio economic consideration are therefore what the federal government (IFAD) has recognized in the crop as lending itself to a commodity based approach to poverty alleviation (FAD/IC, 1995).  The socio economic importance of cassava and the accidental introduction of cassava mealybug which ravaged most cassava fields in the major producing areas led to the federal governments direct intervention in a way of rendering effort to the subsector, in the implementation to the IFAD assisted cassava multiplication project (CMP) between 1987 and 1996.  In the early 1980s Udemili South of Anambra State Nkanu East drusticaly the combined effects of pests disease (Mosaic virus, cassava bacteria bright) Cassava Production Fell (Mealybug and Green Spider Mite), thereby posing a threat to national food security.  In response, IFAD initiated the CMP as a parallel financed part of the World Bank – assisted MSADP –L.  The overall objective of the CMP was to multiple, promotes and distribute improve varieties to cassava processing industries so as to improve productivity and income.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Government intervention and the efforts on non government organization in the cassava subsector have led to a number of measures that support the production, processing and marketing of cassava, dating back to the 1970s, these include government programme such as the National Accelerated Food Production Programme (NAFPPO), and Operation Feed the Nation (OFN), the Agricultural Development Projects (ADP), the development of the National Agricultural Research Systems and their close collaboration with the International institute of tropical Agriculture (IITA) and other International Agricultural research centres and large scale planting material multiplication and distribution facilitated by the IFAD assisted Cassava Multiplication Programme (CMP) and activities of oil companies and church organizations through these efforts, appreciable program has been made in genetic improvement, agronomic practices, root storage and in the development of processing technology and rural infrastructure concerted efforts have also been made to introduce improved practices to farmers.  Thus, improved varieties now occupy approximately 0.75 percent of cassava land area and several labour intensive operation in processing notably grating, dewatering and milling, have mechanized.  This has had a great effect on cassava land area expansion and production growth.  Despite the rapid growth in cassava production, the cassava subsector in Nigeria is soil constrained by a number of factors, namely pest and diseases agronomic problems, shortages of planting materials, inconsistent policy measures, poor market access, limited diversification of processing options, inefficient extension delivery system and inadequate access to improve processing technology.  Consequently, future intervention strategies should include the following;<br/>-      Development, rapid multiplication and dissemination of improve varies to enhance the availability and diversity of improved planting materials.<br/>-      Development and extension of improved agronomic practice for cassava production.<br/>-      Deliberate efforts to supports the development of cassava processing prototypes and identification of application and useful technologies and incentive for local entrepreneurs to fabricate them. This will sara labor and improve the efficiency of processing, raise the quality and enhance marketability of products.  The design of such machines should be gender, sensitive, beaning in mind the cardinal role of women in processing.    <br/>-      Strengthening of Extension: Farmers linkage with research to facilitate the ongoing spread of cultivars, management practice and processing techniques.  This should lead to the mobilization of farmers through emphasis on a participatory development approach, family or group based extension and seed multiplication activities involving due recognition of the role of women in production, processing and marketing and assistance that would enable all farmers to take advantages of development programmes as far as possible, adequate and sustained research funding which must be timely released.<br/>-      Development of new cassava products and packaging techniques for existing and new products.<br/>-      Promotion of industrial uses of cassava and diversification of processing options to encourage increased cassava production and enhanced rural household incomes.<br/>-      Establishment of a sound macro economic policy that would promote sustained cassava development.<br/>-      Investment in rural infrastructure (especially feeder roads and water supply) to promote cassava production, processing and marketing and <br/>-      Greater involvement of the private sector and non-governmental organization in the use of researcher and technology in cassava production, processing and marketing in the development of infrastructural facilities.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>The general objective of this research is to analyze the effort of federation government towards cassava production using cassava processing industries in Nkanu East of Enugu state a reference point therefore, the specific objective are as follows:<br/>-      To determine the economic importance of cassava <br/>-      To determine the role of government in cassava production in Nigeria.<br/>-      To assess means of improving cassava production in Nigeria<br/>-      To find out further intervention for production, processing and storage of cassava and <br/>-      To make recommendation based on the findings of the study.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS   <br/>1.     What are the trends in cassava production and utilization between 2001 and 2010 at the national level?<br/>2.     What are the major interventions of efforts of federal government toward cassava production?<br/>3.     How can we analyze the investment in cassava research or development, including production, processing and marketing of the crops?<br/>4.     What is the success and failures (or limitations) or the federal government interventions or efforts towards.<br/>5.     What is the success and failures (or limitations of the federal government interventions or efforts towards cassava production?<br/>1.5    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS <br/>H1:    The major interventions or efforts of the federal government towards cassava production have yielded positive result.<br/>H0:    The investments or an effort of the federal government towards cassava production has yielded negative result.<br/>H2:    The investment in cassava research or development has improved the production, processing and marketing of the crop.<br/>H0:    The investment in cassava research or development has not improved the production processing and marketing or the crop.<br/>H3:    There is investment in infrastructure and service to promote development (roads, storage facilities etc) and processing infrastructure.<br/>H0:    There is no investment in infrastructure and service to promote development of the crop both in service infrastructure (roads, storage facilities etc) and processing infrastructure <br/>H4:    There are the successes in federal government intervention or efforts towards cassava production.<br/>H0:    There are failures in federal government interventions or efforts towards cassava production.<br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The importance of the study cannot be over emphasized consequently it will be of benefit which includes the following:<br/>-      Development, rapid multiplication and dissemination of improved varieties to enhance the availability and diversity of improved planting materials.<br/>-      Deliberate efforts to supports the development of cassava processing protypes and identification of applicable and useful technologies and incentives for local entrepreneurs to fabricate them.  This will sava labour and improve the efficiency of processing, raised the quality and enhance marketability of products.  The design of such machine should be gender sensitive, bearing in mind the cardinal role of women in processing.<br/>-      Strengthening of extensive – farmers linkage with research of facilitate the ongoing spread of cultivars, management practice and processing techniques. This should lead to the mobilization of farmers through emphasis on a participatory development approach, family or group based extension and seed multiplication activities involving due recognition of the role of women in production, processing and marketing and assistance that would enable all farmers to take advantages of development programms as far as possible, adequate and sustained research funding which must be timely released.<br/>-      Development of new cassava products and packaging techniques for existing and new products.<br/>-      Promotion of industrial uses of cassava and diversification of processing, option to encourage increased cassava production and enhance rural household income.<br/>-      Establishment of a sound macro economic policy that would promote sustains cassava development.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>-       Cassava: It is a type of floor made from the thick roots of a tropical plan and it is the most important crops in Nigeria.<br/>-       Federal Government: A system of government in which the individual states of a country should have control over the affairs of plants. <br/>-       Crops: A plant that is grown in large quantitative, especially as food, cassava has always been an important crop on the land.<br/>-       Cultivated: Land used to grow crops or plans that are also wild grown on a farm etc in order to be sold.<br/>-       Industries: A production of goods from raw materials, especially in factories heavy/light industries.<br/>     <br/>\n\nTHE ANALYSIS OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT \r\nEFFORT TOWARDS CASSAVA PRODUCTION \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NKANU EAST LGA ENUGU STATE)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ANALYSIS OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT \r\nEFFORT TOWARDS CASSAVA PRODUCTION \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NKANU EAST LGA ENUGU STATE)\r\n", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE IMPACT OF SEMINARS WORKSHOPS AND CONFERENCE IN THE PROMOTION OF<br/> CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF ACTIVITIES OF ECONFED IN PROMOTING COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES, ENUGU STATE)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>An investigation into the impact of seminars, workshops and conferences in promotion of co-operative fields workers was carried out by the use of questionnaire and review of existing literature in the field.  A total of sixty (60) respondents were used for the study.  Respondents were randomly drawn from various members of Economic Co-operative Federation Limited (ECOFED) and the co-operative division of the ministry of Commerce and industry Enugu State.     The findings shows that the members of Economic Co-operative Federation Limited (ECOFED) have not benefited adequately from the use of seminars/ workshops and conference as a veritable tool for co-operative education and training.

It enables the recipient to acquire knowledge skills and abilities that is often exhibited through performance of tasks.  According to the new Websters/ dictionary of English language (1995:298) education is instruction or training by which people (generally young) learn to develop use their mental, moral and physical powers.<br/>        In the words of Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary (1989:385) education is a system of training and instrument designed to give knowledge and develop skills, knowledge abilities and development of character and mental power that result from a training intellectual, physical etc. From the foregoing, one can conclude that education has to do with advancement of knowledge, skills, acquisitions and intellectual advancement generally.  The over-all effort of education is change.  Co-operative seminar, workshops and conferences is therefore concerned with the systematic training and instruction of people on the aims, objectives, merits, and benefits of co-operative business so as to create in them ability to appreciation the role of co-operative business in improving the socio-economic background of the members, the community and nation at large.<br/>1.2       Statement of the Problem <br/>It is obvious that illiteracy and poor leadership impediment, against the co-operative movement.  Co-operative can only be successful in the hand of those who know its sound ideas and principles.<br/>        It is of common knowledge, that most of the co-operative members have not been sufficient exposed to adequate training in terms of seminars, workshops, and conferences. Lack of co-operative training has been the greatest hindrance in the development of Enugu State Co-operative Federation Limited (ECOFEDO) in general.  Co-operative seminars, workshop and conference is all about the knowledge of the characteristics features of a co-operative organization. It deals with structural and functional characteristics and practice of co-operative as a socio-economic organization and how to acquire the membership of the co-operative movement of their individual and collective responsibility. In relationship to the above situation, co-operative cannot be expected to achieve the level of business profitability that would keep movement on path of sustainable growth and development.  This study is therefore to assess the impact of seminars, workshops and conferences in enhancing the performance of cooperative field workers in Enugu State Co-operative Federation Limited (ECOFED).<br/>1.3       Objective of the Study <br/>The basic objective of this study is to determine the over all impact of the co-operative training program like seminars, workshop and conferences in enhancing the performance of co-operative field workers in Enugu state, Co-operative Federation (ECOFED).<br/>        Therefore, the objectives of this study include the following:<br/>1.   To determine the vital role played by co-operative seminars, workshops and conferences in enhancing the performances of co-operative field workers in Enugu State co-operative Federation (ECOFED).<br/>2.   To determine the adequacy or otherwise the institution encouragement e.g funding, government policy, support etc, made for co-operative seminars, workshops and conferences.<br/>3.   To understand the reaction of the existing co-operative society concerning co-operative seminar, workshop and conference in Enugu State Co-operative Federation (ECOFED).<br/>4.   TO establish ascertain whether there are gaps in the course offered during the seminar workshops and conference in enhancing the performance of co-operative federation.<br/>1.4       Research Questions <br/>This study is built around the following questions:<br/>i.             How far has Enugu state co-operative Federation (ECOFED) utilized co-operative seminars, workshops and conferences in enhancing the performance of cooperative field workers?<br/>ii.            Whether the right caliber of staff and facilities needed for effective co-operative training program were used?<br/>iii.          What impact does the training have on co-operative organization in the area?<br/>iv.          Are there institutional arguments for participants of these seminars, workshops and conference for the purpose of critical evaluation?<br/>v.           What specific subject area are training program?<br/>1.5       Research Hypotheses<br/>Subsequent to the aforementioned objectives and research questions, the following hypotheses have been formulated and shall be subjected to empirical tests.  The hypothesis are presented in both null and alternative hypotheses.<br/>1.   Ho:    Seminars, workshop and conferences has no <br/>         impact in the promotion of co-operative <br/>        societies.<br/>H1:    Seminars, workshop and conferences has impact  in the promotion of co-operative societies.<br/>2.   Ho:    Seminar, Workshop and Conferences do not Promote Cooperative societies.<br/>Hi:     Seminar, workshop and conferences promote cooperative societies.<br/>3.   Ho: Seminars, Workshops and Conferences are not Effective tools in Promoting Cooperative Societies.<br/>H1: Seminars, Workshops and Conferences are  Effective tools in promoting cooperative societies.<br/>4.   Ho: Seminar, workshops and conference do not have any significant in the promotion of cooperative societies in Enugu State.<br/>H1: Seminar, workshops and conference have any  significant in the promotion of cooperative societies in Enugu State.<br/>5.   Ho:  Seminars, workshops and conferences not Enough tools in promoting the activities of  cooperative society by ECOFED. <br/>Hi:    Seminars, workshops conference are enough tools in   promoting the activities of cooperative societies.<br/>1.6    Significance of the Study <br/>The study will assist in the establishment of future directions for providing co-operative training program like seminars, workshops and conferences in enhancing the performance of co-operative field workers in Enugu State Co-operative Federation (ECOFED). It will also assist policy makers to identify areas of operation between the co-operative movement, the government and co-operative training programs.<br/>        Finally, it is designed to improve

this, one might start to wonder what this research topic is all about, since such a programme is not a new one.<br/> All the same, the truth remains that the existence of Co-operative, Thrift and Credit Society in our higher institutions, one side is lower than the other, badly balanced.  This is to say that its present existence concern itself with only a particular section of the institution.<br/>Institute of higher learning presently doing this programme only operate for the benefits of academic an non-academic staff (who are interested in the movement) in these institutions.  Thrift and Credit programme for educational institutions with particular references to the students populace.  To this time, student in institutions of higher learning have been deprived of enjoying the benefits of being members of co-operative movement as much as there is the urgency of the needs to inform students with the objective of the co-operative movement.<br/>It is important for the cause of this research project to have a knowledge of the cooperative movement, the world over and in particular, Nigeria.  This is because such knowledge and understanding gained, provides an invaluable background of the history and patterns of co-operative in different parts of the word.<br/>In the modern form, however, the origin of co-operative, thrift and credit societies can be traced to the 19th century and to Germany.<br/>In Germany, many of the farmers have very small area of land but by hand work and skillful farming, there was just enough to keep the farming going.  The farmers got their credit from local merchants who charged high rate from them and paid low prices for the farm produce.  The result was that the farmers were most heavily indebted and sank into poverty.<br/>Fredrick Willhelm Raiffeison (1818 –1888) seeing all the poverty and hardship of farmers, he tried to help in the light of these he thought out a plan for co-operative thrift and credit society in which the good men of the village could join together to make fund available as loans to co-operative members.  For each loan made there was the security of the property of the borrowed and two guarantors, who had to be members of the society.<br/> History of Institute of Management and Technology (IMT) Enugu.  The institute came into existence under the East central state edict NO.10 of 1973, promulgated by the Administrator of East Central State Ajie Ukpabi Asika.<br/>Earlier to the establishment of the Institute of Management and Technology heading to the award of Ordinary Diploma, the institute of Administration which provided short in service training for civil servants of various grades, the cooperative studies to cooperative inspectors from the ministry.<br/>The institution were autonomous and located differently, the college of technology which was part of the ministry of education were directly controlled by the ministry.  The institute of Administration was controlled by the ministry of establishment while the cooperative college was directly under the ministry of Rural Development.<br/>All the institutions were staffed by civil servants who were posted there from the ministry and could be reposted to other departments or ministries according to the need of the civil servants. <br/> The need to establish a higher institution of learning by upgrading the training of our people technologically, managerial and engineering fields arose in 1970.  this need was vigorously pursued in October, 1971.  the Ukpabi Asika’s administration decided to merge the farmers college of technology and the college came under the unified control of the cabinet office on 1st April, 1972.<br/>In October, 1972 a provisional council was charged with determining and recommending to the government appropriate structure of autonomous institution that would provide higher quality of technologists and technicians, as well as professional and managerial manpower in subject area indicate by the state and national need.<br/>Institute of Management and Technology was occupying presently three different campuses but new two campuses.  And the two campuses were merged in 1971.  Institute  of management and technology started with three school but have grown to eight schools and all made up of thirty five (35) departments.<br/>1.2         STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>It is important at this stage to try and identify the problems that this project seek to address in relation to cooperative thrift and credit society particularly in institute of management and technology, Enugu.<br/>The problems are:<br/>1.        To find out if students of institute of management and technology are aware of cooperative thrift and credit society progeamme and the benefit that the potentials in educational institutions.<br/>2.        To find out factors hindering them from being members after being aware of the existence of the  programme.<br/>3.        To find solutions to the factor militating against students being members of the society.<br/>4.        To make student know the need of a common forum where they can solve their financial and material problems.  Such as school fees, book, etc.<br/>1.3         PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>To educate student about the special attributes of a cooperative thrift and credit.<br/>To educate students about the essence of cooperative society and its beloved feature.<br/>To engineer the creation of the co-operative thrift and credit programme in educational institutions of higher learning with a view to enhancing proper, efficient and thrift management of funds among students and provide credit facilities for them.<br/>To create awareness among students of the necessity of co-operative thrift and credit  society programme to meet the students feeding, educational, material supply and financial upliftment needs.<br/>To educate students about the cooperative movement existence.<br/>1.4         SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>The scope of this research work will entail basic understanding of cooperative movement in the world and how it relates to Nigeria.<br/>A clear understanding of the meaning, need and essence of cooperation and of course good appreciation of the cooperative thrift and credit society programme.  This research work will also concentrate on blending co-operative, thrift and credit societies programme.<br/>1.5         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this research project is to assist in creating cooperative

Much of the early interested in co-operative structure seemed from deep regards to the social consequence of industrial capitalism, critics of the new order not simply a framework for business organisation but also as a vehicle for the reutilization of radical social and political goals. However, much concepts of c-operative have been erased the claims of earlier social prophets, a residual belief remains that co-operators are motivated by group interest as well as self interest, and that non-economic as well as economic objectives may be pursued.  Other of these propositions present difficulties through not inseparable one’s in terms of applying economic analysis to the study of applying economic analysis to the study of Co-operatives, it is pertinently imperative and a restrictive device of immense capacity that co-operative organizations have paid the way for the new economic and social order not only for those, ‘depressed’ in the economy who (mostly of less privileged) are at the receiving end, the logical and social justice, which they embody, but in our ability to translate them concretely and realistically from social theory into social fact and to make them effective in our daily live. We must always remember that co-operative are organizations of by and for members therefore they are designed to respond to the needs of members. Agricultural Co-operative has created for the economic charge, for increasing in food produce, for building a better or a more just and equitable society.  They serve to give individuals through voluntary co-operation and mutual assistance, control or bit of their destiny to make people in some way asters of their own fate, subjects and not objects of their history.  Co-operatives are of course pragmatic institution noted in reality of concerts goals.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER   ONE<br/>1.0   Introduction                                                <br/>1.1    Background of the Study                              <br/>1.2    Statement of the Problems                   <br/>1.3    Objectives of the Study                                <br/>1.4    Research Questions                                     <br/>1.5    Significance of the Study                              <br/>1.6    Limitations of the study                                <br/>1.7    Definition of Terms                                                      <br/>CHAPTER   TWO <br/>2.1    The role of Agricultural Co-operative Organization<br/>2.2    Farming Systems/Agricultural System             <br/>2.3    The Importance of Agricultural Co-operative    <br/>2.4    Problems of Agricultural Co-operative     <br/>2.5    Market of Produce                                       <br/>2.6    Brief History of Destiny Broilers             <br/>CHAPTER   THREE<br/>3.0    Research Design and Methodology                 <br/>3.1    Area of Study                                                     <br/>3.2    Population and Sample                                 <br/>3.3    Source of Data                                                    <br/>3.4    Instrument for Data Collection                               <br/>3.5    Data Collection Procedure                             <br/>3.6    Method of Data Analysis                                       <br/> CHAPTER   FOUR<br/>4.0    Presentation, Analysis and Interpretation of Data<br/>4.1    Presentations of Data                           <br/>CHAPTER   FIVE<br/>5.0    Summary of Findings, Recommendation and Conclusion                                            <br/>5.1    Summary of Findings                           <br/>5.2    Recommendations                                       <br/>5.2    Conclusions                                        <br/>Bibliography<br/>Questionnaire<br/>Appendix<br/> CHAPTER   ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>Agriculture, from the beginning of time, the first concern of man has been food clothing and shelter in that order.  Agriculture being one of the oldest industries, its origin can be traced to the earliest human societies.  The existence of man from the prehistoric era up to the era ancient civilization depended on the ability of the individual to hunt and gather food for consumption.  Food was, however the basic source of life which provided him energy in his wondering and constant struggle for survival.  However, with the realization that food was basic need for survival, efforts were made by early man to cultivate crops.<br/>In spite of the limitations which agriculture is facing, it still remained the most important sector of the world economy.<br/>Agriculture is a basic industry that supports all industries and all aspects of needs can justify from its role and contributions to nation building.   Between 75 – 80% of working population in rural areas engage in agriculture production (farming).  Some are provide jobs in the industries e.g. textile industry, Breweries and shoe industry. Agriculture aids in rural development, with the location of industries that utilize agricultural produce in an area other investors go to rural areas to set up factories trade and operate business centers people are employed and paid to earn their living. Agricultural provides industrial raw material, textile mills required cotton, and plastic industries use rubber/latex.<br/>Agricultural involves operational clearing of the land and the breaking-up of surface soil, the sowing for seeds, the removal of the weeds from the farm, the harvesting and storage of crops which are disposed of by marketing and the breeding and rearing of animals.  All these Co-operatives can do in a number of different, which involve amounts of labour, time, expense and productivity.  Agricultural education is an area in agriculture that a concern with helping people to

Development Bank.   The study is motivated by the necessity to establish the extent of Agricultural Co-operatives.<br/>To solve the research problem primary and secondary data was collected.  The data were questionnaire and oral interview.  The respondents comprised of personnel of the bank in organizing and presenting data collected, tables’ frequencies and percentages were used.  Data analysis and interpretation give the following findings:<br/>1.         Criteria for granting loan to co-operative is that they have an account holder, have viable and bankable project and should be credit worthy.<br/>2.         The impact of NACRA has been very much via FEAP, NACB through micro and macro loans and PBN loans to co-operatives<br/>3.         Collateral Securities do not pose much problem to give facility to farmers.<br/>4.         Insurance cover is necessary to cover some degree of risk involved co-operative failure.<br/>5.         The level of response to wards loan facilities is very satisfactory.<br/>6.         Loan management by co-operatives is very satisfactory.<br/>7.         When loan is not repaid, the guarantors are involved and auction of any real estate

financial house with the authority to guide groups and individual who could be having monetary transaction to do.  The provision of sound financial regulations that make for economic well being is very essential and the assistance of financial house in building up a safe terrain of monetary reserves is very important.  The well directed influence of vital banks on the larger society, as a whole is always something to admire every time.  The need to have on economic group well tasted and approved of with the education of members of the society in forming a financial viable social ground belong in the part to the intelligent services rendered by banks.<br/>In Agricultural Co-operative societies, where individuals who hold agricultural stock could pull their resources together when union of these stockholders could amount to a greater gain to the advancement of their individual well being and collective aspiration, the expertise of bank posted to assist piece groups material comes by with a great relief government has whole lot of work load to carryout financial or otherwise and so has not much moment to supervisor minor economic units.  She has to assign a duty to her agencies these agencies as the dog in the wheal of the success of such co-operative societies and of the same time supply the necessary materials for their improvement and standard procedure.  Special agro allied banks have been set up under the auspices of the Apex Bank to grant material aid to agro-stock holders.  These Banks are viz.:<br/>•Commercial Bank Limited Nigeria<br/>•Agricultural Co-operative and Rural Development Bank<br/>These financial institutions have the authority to deal on multiple problems traumatizing agriculture and formation of agro Unions in Nigeria.  The Bank of agriculture is becoming so highly modernized so that it will take a lot of money to produce food and cash crops in much profitable abundance.  If is with these in mind that government has arranged with her many agencies to bring some relief to aspiring agro stockholders.<br/>Banks in any nation have the keynote to play on unfolding the financial success in the economy.<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Agricultural Co-operative society is a venture by some farmers who hold agricultural stock and are seeking to uplift their collective and individual agricultural standards.  These standards range from planting tag techniques to seed procuring and from financial subsidization to produce display in proper places.  Agricultural Co-operatives provide useful services where none exists especially one that would be uneconomic for individual ownership.  To induce excessive cost of middlemen, help farmers get a fair share of national income, direct Agriculture towards the goals of national economic planning and generally to improve the social economic planning and generally to improve the social and economic conditions of Rural people.  They seek for favourable trends such as loan, scheme, planting, crucial, banking services and general market safety regulations ignorance of new methods, benefits and possible support from responsible agencies have killed an idea to turn Agriculture around for the better, Banks being organized.  Financial units that can monitor research, cash flow and general economic trends happen to be a greater ease to deal with farmers.<br/> The ideal relationship between the financial houses and farmers as individuals or as co-operatives could not be over emphasized.  Individual farmers could find relative bank services fit for a great initiative transformation.  Financial scheme that enable peasant transformation into giants in Agriculture are abundant such as a loan in agricultural co-operative Society where many individuals pull researches together.  The level in individual maturity and productivity capacity could not be reckoned with.<br/>With the foregoing points, I wish to point out that the prime focus of this study is to found out how bank been able to finance agricultural productivity.<br/>In other accomplish this study Agricultural Co-operative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) has been selected as a case organization.  The Nigeria Agriculture and Co-operative Bank (NACB) is a specialized bank primary set up to enhance investment in Agriculture.  It was established bank primary set up to enhance investment in agriculture.  It was established in 1973 and was commissioned in 1975.  Recently, it was merged with people bank and the family economic Advancement Programme (FEAP) in 2002 and now it was called Nigerian Agriculture Co-operative and Rural Development Bank.  It grant loan to small holders and large investment holders.  Its major problem is inaccessibility of credit by small scale farmers, this problem is solved by putting emphasis on co-operative formation.<br/>Its objective includes efficient and effective credit administration with target beneficiaries being rural poor.  The minimum percentage of interest rate emerges when loan is granted is 8% maximum loan amounts are revised upward depending on timely repayment of previous loans and client invest.  This loan product carried a confessional interest rate, which was as of 1998 was 15% per annum.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>There have been concentrated efforts by government to enhance Agriculture productivity in Nigeria, for instance, the Federal and State Government have set up some agencies like Nigeria Agricultural co-operative and Rural Development Bank, to help small stockholders by granting them loan to improve Agriculture production.<br/>But in spite of all the effort being made, farmers still experience low or decrease in production, due to the fact that farmers do not have collateral to offer.  List of crop failure earn be very high, interest charged can be too high for the returns from economic activities, records are not properly kept for lack of insurance coverage.<br/>What are the causes of this low productivity in agricultural co-operative?<br/>What can be done to remedy the situation to make recommendation as to how bank can increase his effectiveness towards agricultural production?<br/>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is very timely especially now that all hands are on deck to enhance the development and growth of Nigeria economy.  This study will help farmers to know the immense benefit of banks in financing agriculture in addition lack of credit is a major factor.  For the lack of development of agro business, hence it is required to buy inputs and improved technology.  It is expected that this findings will help us to know that credit is a major accelerator of development, if other essentials needed for development are available, through this investigation, therefore both banks and co-operatives will understand their short coming or made points and will subsequently adopt measure aimed of enhancing agriculture effectiveness and development.<br/> It will also help government to adopt the right Agro business credit policies to enhance credit effectiveness.  This study will help us to know the constraints in credit availability to farmers.<br/>1.4       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The general purpose of this project is to undertake a study on the Role of Banks in Financing Agricultural Co-operative.  The study will address the following objectives:<br/>1.         To determine the causes of low productivity in agricultural co-operatives.<br/>2.         To determine what can be done to enhance Agricultural production.<br/>3.         To appraise the contribution of banks to the profitability of Agricultural development.<br/>4.         To make recommendation as to how bank can increase its support in agriculture co-operative.<br/>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research study is limited to the geographical and political boundaries of Nigeria in general, Enugu Metropolis in particular.  It involves only Nigeria Agriculture co-operative and Rural Development Bank.  Among other financial institutes, this research study is to ascertain the Role of banks in financing agricultural Co-operative.  How they have been able to facilitate the development of Agricultural Co-operative and to boast small stockholders and large-scale investors.  Nigerian Agricultural Co-operative and Rural Development Bank  (NACRDB) is being used as the case study.<br/>1.7       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>Have banks been able to improve the efficiency of agricultural production in large scale?<br/>Have banks inputs been able to increase the volume of yield and manpower resources?  <br/>Has it been able to increase the income of farmers?<br/>Has it been able to make for easy access availability of credit of farmers?<br/>1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>CO-OPERATIVE FARMING        :           Is used to denote collective <br/>farming.

<br/>        Globally unemployment is causing government bodies sleepless management.  Several government bodies have set-up institution that can find solution to the unemployment menaced.  A time these bodies come-up with several community that government should control population of educational system and compulsory service for graduting youth etc as means of checking unemployment rate.<br/>        In Africa, particularly in Nigeria, unemployment menace have caused the government to come up with several employment scheme like National Directorate of Employment (NDE) to provide jobs for its teaming population. However the government even carried out self reliance programmes so as to impact into it’s citizen the need to develop their initiatives and employ themselves.<br/>        Some state government was not left out in finding solution for the teaming populace. Several employment agencies were set up like Voluntary Service Scheme (VSS) at Enugu state and school in land of River –State etc.  Suffice it to say that upon all these efforts no significant result were recorded.

It also means any form of two or more people working to achieve some aim. This kind of working together may be on a formalized or informal basis, economic or non-economic nature or permanent.<br/>      Cooperative societies are institutions through which the activities of cooperation are practiced or demonstrated. International cooperative alliance (ICA) stated that it is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common aspiration through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise.<br/>        Cooperative can be seen as an association of persons usually of limited means who have voluntarily joined together to achieve a common economic, making equitable contribution of the capital requirement and accepting a fair share of the risk and benefit of the undertaking.<br/>     A fair analysis of definitions will show that cooperative societies are basically: an association of persons.<br/>         A common need to solve a mutual problem (self help value).<br/>         A union of  capital.<br/>         At various levels, cooperative societies can be seen as a primary, secondary and tertiary, depending on the aims, resources and capacity of the owners.<br/>          Two or more primary societies may amalgamate vertically according to S.52 of the Nigerian cooperative decree 1993.<br/>          However, the rise and expansion of the modern cooperative society movement has its roots in the far reaching economic, social and political changes which took place in Europe in the 19th century and the effect of Capitalism as an economic policy.<br/>           In England, it dates back to 1858. In France, it was developed as far back as 1865. In Germany, it dated back to1888.In India, it came as a result of British Colonial rule in 1945. It came to East Africa from where it spread to other parts of Africa, including Nigeria and Ughelli local government area in Delta state due to the influence of British colonial rule.<br/>       The operations of cooperative  societies and cooperative societies and their economic development effects are what this work sets to look into with particular reference to Ughelli local government area of Delta state.<br/> 1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>         Women contributes a lot in economic empowerment and development of this country especially in Ughelli local government area of Delta state through their economic enterprise.

Hence, the well known slogan “self help through mutual help” by cooperators.<br/>        However, cooperatives in Onitsha north are yet to make the desired impact on the communities, there is then the need for an effective management  system that will help direct the activities of the cooperatives towards achieving their objectives, thereby endeavour to examine the extent to which poor management system retards the growth of the farmers cooperative societies in Onitsha north.<br/>        The viability of any cooperative society depends on the finance, educational competence and managerial skills of executives and cooperation of all the cooperatives. Therefore poor management have being the brain behind the low productivity and poor generation of revenue of some of the societies in Onitsha north local government area.<br/>        The importance of good management of farmers cooperative societies cannot be over emphasized, a good management capitalizes on the economic and social needs satisfaction of its members since when individual joins an organization, they often hope to achieve a personal goal but this cannot be possible without achieving organizational goals. Unfortunately, there is bifurcation i.e division of interest among members and executives. They lack effective management skill and most of them have never had the opportunity to attend seminars, workshop and symposium on management cooperatives societies.<br/>        Furthermore, farmers cooperatives society in Onitsha north lack good organizational structure. The principle of democracy in cooperative organization has rendered it playing toy and it has become perpetually unproductive as members with less investment in the cooperative often close their eyes to the risk of poor management strategies in a competitive economy like ours.<br/>        It is worthy to point that the researcher’s attempt to formulae strategies geared towards the successful implementation of the cooperative goals and objectives.<br/>1.2    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY               <br/>        The general objectives of this study is to scientifically and critically highlight managerial problems which affects the efficient functions of farmers cooperative society.<br/>Specifically the objectives of the study includes<br/>i.             analyzing how these management problems abort the well being of members of the cooperative.<br/>ii.            How best these problems could be successfully eliminated.<br/>iii.          The objectives is also o analyze how members react to these problems.<br/>iv.          Finally, this project is aimed at identifying how lack of education contributes negatively on the managerial problems of farmers cooperative society.<br/>1.3    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        The study is intended to investigate the major management problems and solutions of farmers cooperative societies in Onitsha north local government area of Anambra state.<br/>        It is interesting observed that cooperative societies have laudable objectives which they set for themselves but these objectives are never achieved because of the management problems facing them, such as inadequate funding by members, poor and ineffective management of the societies and not having enough members.<br/> 1.4    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY      <br/>        The research work is mainly for academic purpose, the reliability of many cooperative societies and the liquidation of some of them suggests that something is wrong, perhaps with their management system.<br/>        Therefore, it is the objectives of the researcher to find out some of the causes of these problems and suggest ways to bring about a lasting improvement to farmers cooperative societies.<br/>        The researcher would look into the problems militating against the effective management of farmers cooperative societies in Onitsha north.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION    <br/>          The following research question will be aimed at finding answer to this study.<br/>1.   Do unavailability of finance constitute a problem to the effective management of farmers cooperative society?<br/>2.   Do lack of committees in decision making constitute a problem of the effective management of farmers cooperative society?<br/>3.   Do lack of trained staff constitute a problem to the effective management of farmers cooperative society?<br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY           <br/>        This study is meant to aid cooperators gain more knowledge of what is expected of them for the success of the cooperative enterprise by:<br/>1.   Determine some of the basic management flaws that are encountered by farmers cooperative societies in Onitshan north local government area.<br/>2.   Determine the extent to which their problems constitute a hindrance to the efficiency of the societies.<br/>3.   Seeking avenues through which such problems can be minimized.<br/>4.   Finally based on the findings of the study, recommendations shows that the inefficiency of management should be rectified for the realization of the societies objectives.<br/>This study also wants to ameliorate the bottleneck preventing farmers in cooperative from realizing the benefits of large scale production, marketing and credit facilities. Other benefits of the study includes:<br/>1.   The enlightenment of cooperators on the need to be properly committed to the cooperative movement. This will help to make cooperators understand what is expected of them in cooperation and how to cooperate for effectiveness.            <br/>2.   It is envisaged that cooperative organizers will gain more insight on how to organize and manage the farmers cooperative societies more profitable after going through their report.<br/>The government will come to see the need to have well trained cooperative leaders to champion the affairs of farmers cooperative societies. They will also be more willing to remove the administrative bottlenecks that militate loan disbursement to farmers cooperative societies. This will come about when the suggestion of this research is implemented<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.     Cooperative Society: This is an association of persons who join together either formally or informally adhoc or permanent basis for legal or illegal or socially accepted or unaccepted actions to fulfill certain aims (Obodoechi, 2011).<br/>2.     Farmers Cooperative Societies: It is a cooperative society that is made up of only farmers to cater for the need of its members.<br/>3.     Farmers Multi-purpose Cooperative Society: This is cooperative society that performs more than one function e.g food production and marketing.<br/>4.     Identification: In relation to this research it shows certain phenomenon that are detrimental to the management of cooperative.<br/>5.     Management: It is act of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling and budgeting in a farmers cooperative society so as to realize its objectives.<br/>6.     Problems: This refers to those objectives and concerns that affect the performance of the management of the society.<br/>7.     Trained Staff: This refers to anybody who has undergone professional training in any cooperative institution.<br/>  <br/>\n\nMANAGEMENT OF FARMERS MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN ANAMBRA STATE: PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF ONISTHA NORTH L.G.A)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MANAGEMENT OF FARMERS MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN ANAMBRA STATE: PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF ONISTHA NORTH L.G.A)\r\n", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MOBILIZATION OF RURAL FARMERS THROUGH COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT IN ENUGU STATE <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF NSUKKA, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA)<br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>Cooperative is an association of persons with common goals and their main objective is to promote the society to achieve the aim and objectives, members must have the same interest.

It is a system divided into exploiters of exploited in which the exploiters namely the capitalist: own the means of production that is means production, which means of life in the form of venture capital and property.<br/>        During this period, people begin to search for remedies to stop the evil of capitalism. It was in this period that the following Robert Own came up with an ideal of organization the people, to stop the evil of capitalism and to promote the economic interest of the people through cooperative.<br/>What is Cooperative? <br/>The definition of cooperative was defined by the (ICA) international Cooperative Alliance (1995), according Onoh (2009:15), as an autonomous association of person(s), united voluntarily to met their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspiration through a jointly owned and democratically body which means they are free from government and external bodies.  The members of the cooperative society join voluntarily, it is an association of person, not of capital and their objective is to meet their member’s needs in the economic circle.<br/>What is Mobilization <br/>Mobilization means gathering of people together, to work, in order to achieve a particular goal or aims.  Before mobilization system can be successful, the people involved must have the same common interest.  It can be seen as a way helping people in achieving their actualized dreams. It is important to mobilize their actualized dreams. It is important to mobilize people because it encourages people towards achieving their specific goals.<br/>        Therefore, mobilization in this context means gathering of rural farmers, towards achieving their aims or goals.  And during this mobilization, the rural farmers are educated and developed in the field.<br/>How can Cooperative Mobilize the Rural Farmers <br/>The cooperative can mobilize the rural farmers through organizing an agricultural or supporting programmes which helps in reducing illiteracy among the rural farmers and also develop their knowledge in agricultural activities.  And the program, are some of supporting programmes that helps in developing the rural farmers and they are Fadama Development project (FDPs), Rivers Basic and Rural Development Authorities (RBRSAs), Agricultural Development PRogramme (ADPs), National Agricultural Land Development Authorities (NALDA) etc.<br/>        Since the rural farmers are faced with inadequate capital, the cooperative can mobilize them by giving them grants, loans, funds, and credit which the rural farmers can easily payback.  They should also provide them with Agro-chemical such as fertilizers, pesticides etc which helps them in improving their farm product and controlling of disease, and pest or insect.<br/>        The cooperative acting as a link between the rural farmers and the government should represent the rural farmers well by presenting their problems and also sought for support from the government on behalf of the rural farmers they should also make it possible for the government to support the programme of the rural farmers through finances and any other means.<br/>        The cooperative society can mobilize the rural farmers through sending extensional officers to them, to educate the supervise all their activities.  Extensional officers such as auditors, inspectors, arbitrator etc to oversee al the affaires of the rural farmers.<br/>Who are Rural Farmers<br/>Rural farmers are those farmers who practice agricultural activities in their village sector rural area.  They are not expert and they lack government support.<br/>These farmers of their finance in running the affairs of their farm, they are note educated.<br/>Functions of the Rural Farmers<br/>1.   The rural farmers practices agricultural activities like cultivating of crops, veering of animals, fishery etc.<br/>2.   The rural farmers are mainly based on subsistence farming system.<br/>3.   Some of the rural farmers who are based on cultivation to tubers have barns where their tuber products are spread.  Tubers like yams, cocoyam etc<br/>4.   In most rural areas, the time of farming and harvesting are periodic.  For instance, in my hometown, we have time when all the farmers go and harvest their cassava products and apart from that day, no farmer is allowed to enter into his farm.<br/>5.   The rural farmers practices farm activities annually and especially during running season.<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem <br/>Before the arrival of the cooperative, the rural farmers has being facing some problems which affected their agricultural activities.  <br/>Lack of Capital:  The rural farmers do not have enough capital in financing and running the activities of their farm.<br/>1.   High Level of Illiteracy: The rural farmers are illiterates, no education, no advise from expert, so because of this, the farm system are low and poor.<br/>2.   Inadequate Infrastructural Facilities: The rural farmers do not have good roads, hospital and educational centres which actually affect the farming activities.<br/>3.   Lack of Government Support: The rural farmers do not receive any encouragement and support from the government.<br/>4.   Lack of Tools: Most rural farmers does not have capital in order to purchase the farm tools and machineries.  Thereby they lack most tools and it affect their farming system.<br/>1.3    Objectives of the Study <br/>The broad objectives of the project is to determine how the rural farmers could be mobilize through the cooperative in Nsukka LGA of Enugu.<br/>The specific objectives are to:<br/>1.   How can the impact of the rural farmers be examined?<br/>2.   In what ways can be rural farmers be educated?<br/>3.   How can the cooperative serve as a link between the government and the rural farmers.<br/>4.   What are the problems facing the rural farmers.<br/>5.   What are the possible solutions to these problems?<br/>1.5    Significance of the study <br/>1.     This project will be of a great advantage to the students for more research on this topic.<br/>2.     It will help the government in making policy for cooperative and rural farmers.<br/>3.     It will help the rural farmers in maintaining good relationship with the cooperative.<br/>4.     It will help the cooperative in putting more effort and make policy towards the mobilization of rural farmers.<br/>5.     This project work will help Nigerians in looking into the development of the rural farmers and rural areas.<br/>1.7    Definition of Terms <br/>1.      Mobilization: Mobilization in the context means gathering of rural farmers in order to achieve their common goals.<br/>2.      Farm Products: They are those things produce by rural farmers after harvesting.<br/>3.      Rural Farmers: Rural farmers are those

introduce the following point, background of the study, statement of the problem, objective of the study, research hypothesis, significant of the study, scope and delimitation of the study and definition of terms.<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>        Globally unemployment is causing government bodies sleepless management.  Several government bodies have set-up institution that can find solution to the unemployment menaced.  A time these bodies come-up with several community that government should control population of educational system and compulsory service for graduting youth etc as means of checking unemployment rate.<br/>        In Africa, particularly in Nigeria, unemployment menace have caused the government to come up with several employment scheme like National Directorate of Employment (NDE) to provide jobs for its teaming population. However the government even carried out self reliance programmes so as to impact into it’s citizen the need to develop their initiatives and employ themselves.<br/>        Some state government was not left out in finding solution for the teaming populace. Several employment agencies were set up like Voluntary Service Scheme (VSS) at Enugu state and school in land of River –State etc.  Suffice it to say that upon all these efforts no significant result were recorded. No amount of government policies, provision of human and material subvention, training of manpower, employment of expatriates have been able to improve rate.<br/>        Like a mustard seed an ideology which marched force with European industrial revolution of 18th century particularly in Britain not only survived but was exported to other parts of the world including Nkanu Local Government Area.  This research activity is conducted as to known the level or impact of cooperative in reducing unemployment menaces.  The act of carrying out these activities is called cooperative.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Since the inception of this concept there is a remarkable reduction of unemployment rate within Nkanu West Local Government Area.  There are lots  of school learners, graduates, skill and unskilled labourers of different professional without job.  Does it mean that this concept is no longer feasible?  Besides day of white-collar job are over, why can’t people of different professions, artisans horizontally or vertically integrate their resources in forming and organizing cooperative business enterprises.<br/>        Why its becoming impossible for people of different background to run a business ventures successful?  All these are attributes yet to be analyzed which in fact keep the author sleepless night.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>This academic exercise is meant to appraise the feasibility of self-help co-operative in eating the social economic standard of its environment.  Again, it will probe into its constraints and find out means of ameliorating the unemployment problem through co-operatives.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS <br/>For the purpose of the study the following hypothesis is formulated.<br/>i.       H0:    Co-operative business enterprise do not create <br/>self employment.<br/>H1:    Co-operative business enterprise create self employment.<br/>ii.     H0:    Cooperative business enterprise create self <br/>employment <br/>H0:    Cooperative do not business enterprise create <br/>self employment <br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY <br/>At the end of the research many people will find it helpful in the execution and existence of the active life, such people likely to benefit from the study are as following.<br/>1.           The inhabition of Nkanu West local Government Area.<br/>2.           The society in general <br/>3.           The cooperative organization <br/>4.           The academician etc.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS  <br/>Co-operative Society: A co-operative society is an

In conclusion the role of agriculture cooperative in proving the lives of rural inhabitant cannot be overemphasis.  It is regard that much government end envious to use organizations as an agent of social transformation of their various economics.   <br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER   ONE<br/>1.0   Introduction                                                                <br/>1.1    Background of the Study                                              <br/>1.2    Statement of the Problems                                   <br/>1.3    Objectives of the Study                                                <br/>1.4    Research Questions                                                     <br/>1.5    Significance of the Study                                              <br/>1.6    Scope of Study                                                           <br/>1.7    Definition of Terms                                                   <br/>CHAPTER   TWO <br/>2.1    Brief History of Peace Broiler/Hatchery and Agricultural Engineers (Enugu) FMCS               <br/>2.2    The role of Agricultural Co-operative Organization<br/>2.3    Farming Systems/Agricultural System               <br/>2.4    The Importance of Agricultural Co-operative      <br/>2.5    Problems of Agricultural Co-operative               <br/>2.6    Market of Produce                                                 <br/>2.7    Co-operative Education                                          <br/>CHAPTER   THREE<br/>3.0    Research Design and Methodology                   <br/>3.1    Research Design                                            <br/>3.2    Area of Study                                                       <br/>3.3    Population Sample                                                 <br/>3.4    Sample Size                                                         <br/>3.5    Source of Data                                                      <br/>3.6    Administration of Instrument                                   <br/>3.7    Method of Data Analysis                                           <br/>3.8    Test of Hypothesis                                                   <br/>CHAPTER   FOUR<br/>4.0    Presentation, Analysis and Interpretation of Data <br/>4.1    Presentations of Data                           <br/>CHAPTER   FIVE<br/>5.0    Summary of Findings , Recommendation and Conclusion                                           <br/>5.1    Summary of Findings                           <br/>5.2    Recommendations                                       <br/>5.2    Conclusions                                        <br/>Bibliography<br/>Questionnaire<br/>Appendix<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>Agriculture, from the beginning of time, the first concern of man has been food clothing and shelter in that order.  Agriculture being one of the oldest industries, its origin can be traced to the earliest human societies.  The existence of man fro the prehistoric era up to the era ancient civilization depended on the ability of the individual to hunt and gather food for consumption.  Food was, however the basic source of life which provided him energy in his wondering and constant struggle for survival.  However, with the realization that food was basic need for survival, efforts were made by early man to cultivate crops.<br/>In spite of the limitations which agriculture is facing, it still remained the most important sector of the world economy.<br/>Agriculture is a basic industry that supports all industries and all aspects of needs can justify from its role and contributions to nation building.   Between 75 – 80% of working population in rural areas engage in agriculture production (farming).  Some are provide jobs in the industries e.g. textile industry, Breweries and shoe industry.<br/>Agriculture aids in rural development, with the location of industries that utilize agricultural produce in an area other investors go to rural areas to set up factories trade and operate business centers people are employed and paid to earn their living. Agricultural provides industrial raw material, textile mills required cotton, and plastic industries use rubber/latex.<br/>Agricultural involves operational clearing of the land and the breaking-up of surface soil, the sowing for seeds, the removal of the weeds from the farm, the harvesting and storage of crops which are disposed of by marketing and the breeding and rearing of animals.  All these Co-operatives can do in a number of different, which involve amounts of labour, time, expense and productivity.  Agricultural education is an area in agriculture that a concern with helping people to develop a desire to learn and teach agriculture.  This is a change of behaviour towards agricultural practices. <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Agricultural co-operatives are greatly involved in food production so as to improve the social and economic life of the members and the country as a whole.<br/>In spite of these, agricultural co-operative are still experience low food production owning to some distributing factors, as it associated being studied.<br/>1.     High financial commitment in the formation of the agricultural co-operative of different size and types.<br/>2.     Members neglecting their obligations, participating in-group farm work in the farmland weeding, planting, harvesting and marketing of farm produce.<br/>3.     Procurement of farm inputs like high yielding seeds, stem and seeding, agro-chemical disinfectants and fertilizer.<br/>4.     Problems of marketing of produce and efficiently distribution and returns to inputs utilized.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>In food production the study is aimed all examining the role of Agriculture Co-operative food production so as to benefit members and the society as a whole.  The purposes of this study are:<br/>i.      To identify the factor that can cause low food production in agriculture co-operative in (Enugu) North.<br/>ii.      To investigate whether problem identified are associated with the agriculture co-operative society.<br/>iii.     To investigate the farms of supports and incentives provided by the government to the agriculture co-operatives if there are any.<br/>iv.     To find out the ways and methods that can be used in solving the problems of low food productivity.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>To achieve the purpose or objectives of this study the following research questions were formulated.<br/> i.      What are the causes of the low food production among agriculture co-operative in Enugu South Local Government Area?<br/>ii.      To what extent are the problem identified applied or associated with the agriculture co-operative societies being studied?<br/>iii.     Do agricultural co-operative receive incentives from the government?<br/>iv.     What form does the incentives from government take?<br/>v.     What are the ways/methods that can afford possible solutions to the problems of low food production?<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The findings of this research work will enable the society to know what to do in order to improve or enhance the economic activities of the society.  This research work will equally help the Federal government whose set objective is to use co-operative in rural development and increasing the production capacity of the country.<br/>The producer of agricultural products will also benefit because their effective production will be assured through the effective and efficient management of the agricultural co-operatives in food production and there will be an increase in food supply and production in the country thereby leading to a fall in price of goods.  When this is achieved, the consumers and the general public will benefit.<br/>When there is an efficient and effective management of agricultural produce in food production, the co-operative societies especially the rural based ones, it will help in development recommendations of this research work will also be of great benefit to other co-operative societies in the country as it well served as reference material from them.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.     Enterprise<br/>This is institution of

The continued economic crunch has highlighted the need for feasibility studies before now starting/embarking on nay project.<br/>        A feasibility study evaluates the project's potential for success; therefore, perceived objectivity is an important factor in the credibility of the study for potential investors and lending institutions. Feasibility studies involves a closer examination of cost and benefit of a project with a view to ascertain whether it is feasible, viable, and profitable to undertake such a venture.<br/>        The aim of the study is to make co-operative, individuals, firms and organizations to know the importance of feasibility report in any business venture. The drive can only take place when there is sufficient money or resources. The importance of a well prepared feasibility studies in the course of co-operative formation and investment cannot be over emphasized.<br/>        A well prepared feasibility studies can be used to upgrade the performance of co-operative enterprise and investment. As co-operative backed by good feasibility study are difficult to wind up easily. “planning business is an absolute must” says BAUNBACK (1992:31). Having the right good at the right place at the right time and right price is the accepted objective.<br/>        He also believe that control is indispensable. The whole idea if a feasibility study or report complaint and planning and control. Thus a feasibility study shows whether a propsed business opportunity will succeed or fail after a consideration of alternatives against the firms objective. Different views explain reasons why people join co-operatives society. Co-operative afford for socio-economically disadvantaged people an alternative way of doing business. It follows maturely that the intention or motive for establishing a sole trade partnership or joint stock company are similar but not same for establishing a co-operative society.<br/>        According to Onuoha (1999:28) profit motive is the motivating factor for private entrepreneurs while service to members if the motivating force for co-operative. The necessity for making a choice between investment alternative arises frequently in business decision (Ude 1999:64). Accordingly it is necessary to appraise your project to determine whether it is worth going into the business or not. For any project, these are alternative technology, production equipment, building and other investment.<br/>As each decision is concluded, the next issue is the problem of selecting the most viable of all alternative.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The spate of business failure in Enugu state is on the increase. According to LOUCK (1989:5) to start a business is very easy but to stay in business is very difficult. Most business had failed due to lack of proper planning which are characterized by their promoters. This most in the case of small scale business which are characterized by owner and personnel. The failure of some co-operative business ventures deserved to be questioned. Like few feasibility studies were the provision, well implemented, the nature of staff quality etc, their day to day operation are usually in the hands of owners who lack the requisite know-how to embark upon the research topic “feasibility business enterprise (A study of importance of feasibility studies to co-operative investment). Unknown population parameter. Nwabuokei (1986:24).<br/>        The posited hypothesis for this study is as follows:<br/>The use of feasibility studies leads to successful co-operative business formation and co-operative investment.<br/>The use of feasibility studies can minimize the risk of business failure among co-operative.<br/>The use of feasibility studies helps in optional allocation of resources that are scarce.<br/>Feasibility report studies facilitated the chances of obtaining loan i.e credit from leading institutions.<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The objective of this study is to x-ray the importance of feasibility<br/>studies for successful business enterprise and (a study of the importance of feasibility studies to cooperative investment).           <br/>•To identify the content of feasibility report/study<br/>•To identify the course of business failure among cooperative.<br/>•To ascertain the motive for joining or forming a cooperative society.<br/>•To relate feasibility studies and cooperative investment.<br/>•To identify the quality of staff of cooperative.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>•These question pose a guide to the researcher in carrying out the study. They must be correctly answered in the course of wok. They are as follows:<br/>•Are people aware of the importance of feasibility studies in co-operative formation/investment? Can the use of feasibility studies reduce the risk of business?<br/>•Do those who carryout feasibility studies engage the services of consultants and or experts or do it themselves?<br/>•What are the constraints militating against carrying out feasibility study before engaging in a venture.<br/>•What is the relationship between feasibility studies and the profit of your society?<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study will highlight on the radiance of feasibility studies and<br/>cooperative business enterprises and cooperative investment.  <br/>        This will be of immense benefit to those wanting to engage in new venture. It will also help in minimizing business failure among cooperatives, since people will appreciate the need to embark on feasibility studies in the course of cooperative instrument and successful business enterprises.<br/>        Again, it will benefit those who might want to undertake further studies on this topic or related issues.<br/>        It is also hoped that the adoption and implementation of the finding and recommendation of the study will be helpful significantly in boosting our economy through business success engendered by use of feasibility studies among cooperatives.<br/>1.6       HYPOTHESIS/RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>“A hypothesis is a statement of assumption about an<br/>1.7       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>        Due to the fact, that the researcher is a student and do not have enough time and money to research on the whole topic the research selected a few cooperative from which references can be made that is Enugu East, Enugu South, Enugu North and Enugu Central.<br/>1.9       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Feasibility Study: A closer examination of cost and benefit of a project to ascertain whether it is viable, feasible and profitable to undertake as a venture.<br/>Feasibility Report: A written document plan or a blue print of operation of a business project.<br/>Investment: Commitment of fund or money in the purchase of an asset or a contribution of assets intended for installation to yield return in the business concern.<br/>Cooperative Formation: This refers to ways by which cooperative are formed.

about the topic under discussion.  First and foremost, we have succeeded in bringing into cognizance  that one of the support agencies which its role deals squarely on unemployment and underemployment in Nigeria  is National Directorate of Employment (NDE).  It was established by the Federal Government in November, 1986 which is solely dealing with the menace of mass unemployment in the country as it was stated in its four core programmes and it was inaugurated on 30th of January, 1987.<br/> On the other hand, the co-operative societies  are not exempted, in so far that the both are promoting the creation of employment opportunities for co-operators.  Co-operative itself cuts across every facet of social, political and economic aspects.   For instance, Nigeria Agricultural and Co-operative Bank (NACB) which was constituted in 1973 by the federal Government with an initial capital of twelve million naira (N12m).  In this direction of co-operative societies in the agricultural sector with the provision of credit facilities.<br/> In furtherance, National Directorate of Employment has the following cardinal objectives to achieve especially in generating employment.  Ensuring that co-operators or job seekers become entrepreneurial oriented and pay less attention on government paid employment and thus reducing drastically the high level of unemployment.<br/> Before we round off, the federal government has been making concerted effort to mass unemployment.  Currently, Olusegun Obasanjo’s regime is tackling this through  National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP) as far back as 1999 till date (2012).  All is to stamp out unemployment.<br/> Recently, the National Directorate of Employment announced and outlined various training programmes and thousands of job to be provided for the unemployed Nigerians at the middle of August, 2012.<br/>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>More often than not, lack of employment has given rise to all kinds of set back, problem in all sectors of our economy.  In fat, the high rate of unemployment and under employment has completely raged the socio-economic well - being of our nation, thereby, causing untold hardship, depression, frustration and forceful massive exodus of our teeming brethrens who are seeking for greener pastures abroad.<br/> In other words, the fact remains that the high rate of unemployment problems are getting out of hand and even reached to a worsening level.  Day-by – day, it multiplies to an alarming proportion.<br/> Therefore, we still believe that there is a room for absolute alleviation or even eradication of this unemployment scourge who has done more harm than good.   Then, what is likely going to be the hope and future of our human and material resources in Nigeria?  Is it not the high time  for the federal government to introduce practical policies and implement them without any delay; for a stitch  in time saves nine?  Are we going to create a good atmospheric condition which is conducive for our citizens and possibly discourage them from traveling to overseas?  In a sum, your guess is as good as mine.  Let us place our hands on deck, to fight this intractable problem of unemployment bedeviling this nation.  Government should do their own and the citizens should do theirs as well in order to find a lasting solution to all these problems ravaging the entire fabric of our economy.<br/>1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>It is imperative to outline some of the things that are uppermost in mind which have been given special attention.<br/> Most importantly, the reasons are not far fetched which must and hop0ed to be actualized as far as “Unemployment and Co-operative Societies” is concerned.  Thus, these are the overriding purposes of the study, namely:-<br/>1.    To design and implement programmes to combat mass unemployment.<br/>2.    To articulate policies aimed at developing work programmes with labour intensive potentials.<br/>3.    To obtain and maintain a data bank on employment and vacancies in the country with a view to acting as a clearing house to link job seekers with vacancies in collaboration with other government agencies.<br/>4.    To discourage in entirely of being over-dependent  on government paid employment and non-governmental establishment but rather become innovative and creative.<br/>5.    To promote vocational skills acquisition in co-operative societies because it cuts across every sphere of specialization such as thrift and loan co-operative society, Agricultural co-operative society, to mention but a few.<br/>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of this very topic under discussion arises as a result of man’s quest for finding problem – solving  to avoid the problem of unemployment and underemployment  especially in co-operative societies.<br/> Also, to promote the relevance of spirit of Co-operation which  the co-operative societies tends to uplift and maintain.<br/> Then, ensuring that different programmes of creating massive employment is implemented and achieved not only in cooperative societies but throughout the socio-economic and political sectors of the nation.<br/>1.5     RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>As its names implies, some of the questions asked in the course of research are listed below:<br/>1.     What are the means by which unemployment in cooperative societies could be alleviated or eradicated?<br/>2.     What is the department of co-operative doing in particular to raise employment opportunities?<br/>3.     What are really the causes of ever increasing unemployment problems?<br/>4.     Why is it that nowadays, some people do not want to join co-operative society in your local government area?<br/>5.     Lastly, what are the positive contributions of co-operative since its existence in your local government?<br/><br/>\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT AND COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES\r\nA CASE

cooperative started, what is known is that there were traces of cooperative related organization in the ancient Egypt as early as 3600BC.  There were also recorded of cooperative ideas in the ancient Greek, Roman and Chinese cultures.  During the middle ages, cooperative ideas were in the form of guilds with the aims of uniting workers to meet there common needs.  During the 13th century, the first farmers cooperative were recorded when a group of sip diary farmer made Cheese cooperatively. In the new world, early Americans also experimented with cooperative.  The colonist worked jointly on many self survival projects.<br/> 1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>There have always been instance in the history of human society where individuals have come together to achieve certain aims in cooperative with others.  In most tribal societies, this has been  a common features. However, these common effect were usually directed at fulfilling a certain temporary need.  Organization cooperative business ventures of a mere permanent character were comparatively rare through some example can be found throughout history in the middle ages as well as in classical times.<br/>        Form creation, man had always shown a sign of working together. The Igbo man had a proverb which buttress this more, “when a man is in difficulty, he seeks for help from another but when an animal is, it cannot turn to another. In rural areas, small farmers become increasing indebted to various money tenders.  These money lenders exploited the fact that the farmer who had loved mere or less at subsistence level was now in desperate need of money to buy supplies for the culturaion of cash crops, to buy mere modern equipment, and to pay taxes, which formerly had been collected in kind. The resulting social unrest and insecurity provided a fertile ground for ideas for a new soci1al and economic orders.  The rise and expansion of the modern cooperative movement has it roots in the far reaching economic, social and political changes which took place in Europe in the café eighteenth and all through the nineteeth century, especially the revolution and the liberation of the pleasantly from the farmer feudalistic system.<br/>        Furthermore, of this the Enriguezwe C. G. (1986), wrote that man’s environment in cooperative is essentially for improving the existing social order, achieving mere happiness in life, bring to man mere human dignity and bring about social societies for mere attraction opportunities elsewhere.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>In spite of the achievements recorded during the period under review, the organization is still today beset with some serious problems, which are hampering its growth and health development.  The main ones are as follows:<br/>-      Lack of Finance: There exist two main sources of revenue for financing co-operative activities namely, internally generated funds of the unions and loans and grants from government and secondary financing agencies. With regard to internally generated funds the small size of the average primary  co-operative society constitutes a serious constraint on the ability of such union to generate and mobilize funds for their own subsistence.  The loans and grants provided by the state governments and their secondary financing agencies have similarly proved inadequate for the number of union in vowed. This has created a serious problem.  All previous efforts made to increase the average size of each primary co-operative organization to make it viable have not so four yielded much result.<br/>-      Lack of Effective Leadership and Qualified Personnel: Since most of he leaders entrusted with the responsible for meaning co-operative societies have to been properly trained and exposed to modern management techniques, the unions have generally been operating under poor management, ineffective control and sometimes resulting to heavy financial losses.  The co-operative societies are therefore seldom able to compete effectively with ordinary business organizations or sustain the confidence of their members.  The situation has been <br/>worsened by the high turn over of officials who are deserting the between its affiliated organizations, to safeguard the interest of the co-operative movement in all its forms, to promote friendly and economic relations between the co-operative organizations of the types nationally and internationally, to work fro the establishment of lasting peace and security, to protect public money invested in co-operatives in the form of grant, loans, subsides, infrastructures, to ensure that co-operative conform to government policy and do not pursue illegal objectives and to promote self help and encourage self reliance.<br/>-      Inadequate public awareness <br/>Lack of public awareness about the existence and usefulness of the cooperative movement of the its potentials for catering for the its potentials for catering for the welfare of members has prevented many potential members from joining the movement. More vigorous public enlightenment programmes are essential to more co-operative forward.<br/>The recent increase in government involvement in the activities of the co-operative movement especially by way of providing funds and expertise to assist in running the various co-operative unions, through FEAP, is expected to result in increased membership of the movement.  The government involvement and encouragement development through self help, mobilizing development resources at the lower and middle income level and providing effective organizations that can attract credit as well as provide a vehicle for the implementation of government economic policies and progarmmes.<br/>        Agricultural co-operative and credit societies, consumers co-operative, building societies and other similar organization will be encouraged and given all necessary assistance to enable them discharge their functions effectively discharge their function effectively self help with government support where necessary adopt for the promotion of co-operative societies.<br/>        With the high rate of co-operative graduates coming out from our higher institutions nowadays, it is expected that the problem of lack of effective leadership and qualified manpower will be at its minimum in the next century, culminating in an adequate public awareness of the importance and benefits of co-operatives.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  <br/>-      Co-operative society can be defined as an autonomous association of persons united voluntary to meet their common united voluntarily to meet their common economic social and cultural needs and aspiration, social and cultural owned and aspiration through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprises.  The following are the objectives of co-operative organizations in the country, such as follows, to maintain good relations justice to all.<br/>-              In spite of these favourable conditions the co-operative movement would scarcely have had the upsurge and astonishingly fast growing if it has not been for a group of dedicated philanthropists, politicians, churchmen and civil servants who promoted co-operative by instilling general enthusiasm for its ideals or by showing the way through practical examples.<br/>-      Though the result especially from the philanthropists, were sometimes hard to discern, their ideas still served as inspiration for some or time to come.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS  <br/>1.     Do corporative society encounter any problems?<br/>2.     In what ways can be problems be solved?<br/>3.     What are the causes of the problems?<br/>4.     Is there any ways corporative society can be affected in their growth of development?<br/>5.     In what ways can the problems hindered the growth of cooperative society?<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  <br/>A co-operative is ;a plan humanic business organization formed by individual who are desirous of pooling themselves and their resource together to form a democratically controlled organization devoid of pecuniary gain.  The uniqueness of co-operative are its flexibility permits it to be practiced among; farmers, fishermen, Artisans, industrial and commercial works, drivers, students, marketmen and women etc.<br/>        Membership of co-operative cut across men and women the poor and the rich, the bourgeois and the preliterate’s, producers, and consumers, the literate and illiterates, the mighty and the low.  Cooperative  may be defined as a voluntary association of persons grapping with the same socio-economic problems, and legally constituted, to ensure the common needs of its members democratically, providing services at cost or and sharing benefit in proportion to use.<br/>        Let us briefly elaborate on each of these characteristics such as follows;<br/>        A cooperative is open to patrons only.  A patron is one who make use of services being offered thus, some one who is likely to take loans is a potential patron of a credit co-operative society and a former is a likely patron of a produce marketing society. In this context, a patron is to distinguished from a mere “investor” who buys shares in a business is expectations of profits but who may never patronize the product of that enterprises.  A co-operative is open to patrons only, conversely no potential patron in its area of operation should be barred from membership for petty reasons like ethnicism, party policies, sex or social class.  No body can be compelled to join a cooperative.  Co-operative are voluntary, non government organizations.  People join co-operative only if they perceive that cooperative can render their needed series.  Co-operative must be legally constituted and incorporated.  They must be registered with the government.  Registration makes a cooperative a legal entity distinct from its members able to own properly, to sue in court for damages or breach of contract and to be sued for it.  Until a society is registered, it can only be a pre-cooperative.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF IMPORTANT TERMS <br/>The term cooperative can be used in its generic term to cover a wide area of activities which two or more people join together either formerly or in formerly on adhoc or permanent basis, for legal or illegal or socially accepted or unaccepted action  to fulfill certain aims.<br/>        Such actions may be selfish in nature or may be in the interest of those performing the action without it being detrimental to any one else.<br/>        However, cooperative is often used in the positive sense.  It is also used in a much narrower sense to mean activities undertaken by cooperative organizations. Put simply, therefore, cooperative society can be refers as an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspiration through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise.<br/>Agricultural Co-operatives: There are societies which <br/>Embrace all classes of people earning a livelihood on the hand ranging from the former who rents some plots of across to the peasant family which works its own holding with its own labor.<br/>Artisanal Co-operatives: These are co-operative formed <br/>by skilled workers employing themselves and perhaps a few journey men and apprentice in handicrafts or related branches of trade.<br/>Marketing Co-operatives: These are co-operative <br/>established to market the agricultural produce of the members.

Hence development should be seen as a collective responsibility of all the people that make up the society irrespective of sex, age class. (Ijere 1486).<br/>            Though the colonial administration gave little recognition to the socio-economic status of women thus women’s role in economic empowerment  was relegated  to kitchen and catering to the needs of their children and husband. While empowerment and trade were for men.<br/>            Now the Nigerian woman has gone beyond the stage of merely agitating for liberation or equal right with her male counterpart. The nation’s current constitution of 1979 accepts the obligation to accord women the same treatment as is accorded to men in all spheres of life, particularly in all areas covered by the convention. Women, today contribute over 80% of the nations food supply. (Ijere 1486).<br/>            Though women contribute over 80% of the nations food supply, their economic power are still limited. They have limited access to ownership of land and housing, limited participation in nation building. The role of women in economic empowerment is determined by the society and also by the societal perception of the status and place of women and the extents of their participation in economic development of their family and the society in general.<br/>            With the recognition of women as vital instrument for economic empowerment and the realization of the vital role of women in the field of Agriculture, health and commerce, Education, the need to properly organize equip and harness the potentials of women towards  national development remains inevitable.<br/>            One cannot therefore, over emphasis the important role which co-operative movement can play in Nigeria, especially in this era of food shortage and economic depression. It is certain that the co-operative society plays in increasingly significant role in satisfying material, social and potential needs of their rural and urban women in Nigeria. It was as a result of this that the Federal Republic of Nigeria in her third National Development Plan (1975 – 1980) had a policy objectives of fostering the growth of co-operative movement as instrument for achieving increases Agricultural Productivity and rural transaction, some of these programmes such as Better Life for rural women, Family Support Programme and Family Economic Advancement Programme are yet another move by the government to ensure women participation in development.<br/>            Co-operative societies are organized groups, which are created to accomplish one or more functions including production, purchasing, supplying and the provision of credit facilities to its members.<br/>            Inspite of the government emphasis on the need for Nigeria to form co-operative societies in order to achieve self sufficiency in food production especially during this period of depressed economy. We are yet to experience the women’s full participation in co-operative societies. Ijere (1981) estimated that out of a population of 80 million, only 2.4% of Nigerian women were co-operative. It is against this backdrop that the present study goes on to investigate the role of co-operative  society in Economic Empowerment of women and the problems militating  against the full participation of women in co-operative society with a view of making recommendation.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>            It has been universally accepted that no nation can achieve a full economic power and sustainable growth it she leaves women out of development process. It is quite imperative for developing nation to consider both sustainable human development and economic growth as function of investment on girls and women as resources or engines of growth or social engineering. However in Nigeria, we find that to varying degrees. Women especially rural women constitute socially economically and politically disadvantaged group when compared to their male counterparts.<br/>      The introduction and formation of co-operative society in Nigeria is being targeted to correct the imbalance .Thus the problem to be solved in this research work are centered on the nature, organization role and relevance of co-operative society towards the economic and educational development of women .This research also intend to see co-operative societies solve the economic needs of women .<br/>                In Nigeria, guest for Education and Economic power have made a lot of plans and strategies to be implemented and amongst these measures in the recent past has been the clarion call for the formation of co-operative societies.  This work will therefore enable us highlight its contribution and explore areas that need improvement for Economic Empowerment of women .The research will go further to make reason able suggestion with a view to putting zeal for its formation to be extended to the rural women . The research will go further to make reasonable suggestion with a view to putting zeal for its formation to be extended to the rural women.<br/>1.3             PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>The research was therefore undertaken for the purpose of the following.<br/>(i)            To find out types and classification of co-operative societies.<br/>(ii)          To determine the extent to which these co-operative societies help their member economically.<br/>(iii)         To identify the problems that confronts women’s participation in co-operative society.<br/>(iv)         Base on the findings; make recommendations on how the efficiency of this co-operative society can be enhanced.<br/>1.4         RESEARCH  QUESTIONS<br/>This study is guided by the following questions.<br/>(i)            Do co-operative societies contribute to national development?<br/>(ii)          To what extent do women engage in socio-Economic roles that contribute to national development? <br/>(iii)         To what extent do women experience difficulties in their role performance towards Economic Empowerment?<br/>(iv)         What problems confront co-operative societies?<br/>(v)          To what extent does lack of fund effect women in the struggle for economic emancipation?<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>            The value of any research depends on its contribution to knowledge and development. The study is important especially now that the present democratic government has placed great emphasis on the mobilization of women for rural and national development.<br/>            This study will enable the federal government to work out and implement realistic measures to motivate women so that they can embark on some economic ventures. No nation can grow beyond its enlightened populace. However, this form a confront towards educating and enlightening the rural women who constitute the greater part of the population inculcating in them the acceptance of the dignity and more superior option to form co-operative societies for their economic empowerment.<br/>            This study also highlights the activities of co-operative societies, ills and setbacks confronting co-operative societies in Nigeria with an aim of making recommendations on how these problems could be checked so as to improve the man-woman economic imbalance.<br/>            It will be a stepping stone for other similar research especially in the area of women and national development.<br/>1.6       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>The definition of the underlisted terms is as used in the context.<br/>Co-Operative Society: This is an association of persons who have  voluntarily joined together and having as its primary objective the promotion of members socio-economic well being through self efforts and democratically managed by members of the society in line with agreed principles. <br/>Economic Empowerment: This is the process by which group, communities or sex with low per capital national income may increase their production of goods and services employment level of demand so as to raise their standard of living.(Grenchine 1081)<br/> Enlightenment: This is getting an individual to adopt to the environment in which he lives by inculcating in him those knowledge, skills, values and attitudes required for his day-to-day activities.

A survey was conducted on the type of marketing co-operative in Orodo marketing and the management and organization of Orodo marketing co-operatives to obtain relevant data on the views of the respondents towards he marketing co-operatives. The information was collected from two categories of respondents viz: members of the organization and the local government co-operative council of Mbaitolu local government area.<br/>        The major instrument used for data collection was questionnaire. The data collected were analyzed using the percentage system of data analysis. The study found out that the societies in the area encouraged the habit of savings among members, give little loans to members and foster unity among them. They also sell goods at low prices and produce food stuff (rice) for the area.<br/>        However, the study showed that growth of marketing co-operatives in the area is affected by problems such as frauds, ineffective management by those in charge of running the co-operatives, lack of finance and non-payment of loans among others.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction <br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Research questions<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature review<br/>History of marketing co-operative in Nigeria<br/>Marketing co-operatives<br/>Economics development  <br/>Marketing co-operatives and development in Mbaitolu<br/>Functions of Orodo Rice marketing co-operative<br/>Criteria for performance appraisal <br/>Structure and organization of marketing co-operative in Nigeria<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Research methodology<br/>Sources of data collection<br/>Population of the study<br/>Description of data<br/>Method of analysis of data<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Data presentation and analysis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Summary, recommendation and conclusion <br/>Recommendations<br/>Remarks on findings<br/>Bibliography<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>          Marketing co-operative societies as a forum or type of business organization came about where people with common interest unite themselves into a group financed  and controlled by them for the purpose of marketing some of the commodities produced by members or from other sources in order to achieve their goals (co-operative societies started in Nigeria in the life patterns of various communities in the country showed some traits of co-operative activities before the advent of modern co-operative activities before the advent of modern co-operative societies.<br/>        This is because most communities in Nigeria generally had (and other still have) series of association, youth associations, etc.<br/>        According to Iheanacho co-operative/marketing co-operative office in Mbaitolu, which were created from Mbaitolu/Ikeduru local government area of Imo state of Nigeria in 1989 with the formation of multi-purpose co-operatives societies. With the increase in the formation  of new co-operative societies in Nigeria is a clear indication that many people and institutions alile have found co-operative societies, a useful tool in furthering different interests.<br/>        In the fourth national development plan, government has pledged to give all necessary encouragement towards the growth and development of the co-operative sector in the country.<br/>        In analyzing the marketing co-operatives in Mbaitolu attentions must be paid to their basil agricultural product, hence just like other area within the East. They are mainly farmers. But most importantly, some parts of this area are not for the production large quantity. Orodo people, Amukwu and Odunmana do produce rice. This work is also to analyse the effects of this production of rice on national development with special reference to Mbaitolu.<br/>        Okafor (1998) claimed that the establishment of marketing co-operative societies  could enhance the standard of living of the masses of the area, contribute to the education of members and facilitate  the marketing activities of farmers and to economic development of Nigeria.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>          The associated problem with marketing co-operative which inhibits the expected level of development are many. Apart from the role of government and is agencies in encouraging and creating enabling environment for these co-operative to thrive are still questionable, hence the poor level of agriculture/co-operative activities. Below are some of the strictly questions to be analysed in the course of this work.<br/>1.   To what extent has the government been supportive of co-operative societies.<br/>2.   Why has there been excessive migration from agriculture to white collar jobs.<br/>3.   To what extent has marketing co-operative helped in Nigeria development.<br/>4.   In the light of this, the researcher looks into indentifying the means of improving the roles of those societies in the economic development of the area of operation.<br/>1.3    OBEJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>          There are two main objectives namely:<br/>1.   General objective.<br/>2.   Specific objective<br/>The general objective is aimed at evaluating and finding enabling farm work for national development through marketing of rice.<br/>The specific objectives are as follows:<br/>1.   To find out the level of socialization of agriculture in term s of inputs being used for agriculture.       <br/>2.   To find out the extent of support by the government to co-operative societies.<br/>3.   To find out the extent of development in Nigeria as encouraged by marketing co-operatives.<br/>4.   To find out the source of funds for marketing co-operative societies in the area, the economic achievements recorded, their problem and strategies for solving them.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The study will no doubt be of  immense benefits to the marketing co-operative societies in Mbaitolu in particular and for Imo state of Nigeria in general. This is because attention shall be focused on the various problems affecting  their effective performance. Secondly, the study will being to lime light the hidden importance of co-operative societies thus generating a great degree of government support.<br/> 1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS  <br/>          The research questions for the study were made up of the following:<br/>1.   What are the contributions of marketing co-operative societies towards output growth?<br/>2.   What are the contributions of marketing co-operative societies towards the increase on capital development?<br/>3.   What are the various sources of finance for Mbaitolu local government area?<br/>4.   What are the contributions of marketing co-operative societies towards the provision of infrastructural facilities in this area?<br/>5.   What are the various problem confronting rice marketing co-operative in Mbaitolu.<br/>1.5    DEFINITION OF TERMS     <br/>1.     Role: the task or duties of co-operative societies<br/>2.     Economic development: any activities or activity likely to improve the standard of living of individuals and the societies in general.<br/>3.     Rice marketing co-operative society: They market jointly all rice produced by the individuals members <br/>4.     multi-purpose co-operative society: this type of co-operative comes about when a co-operative has different objectives or role to perform.<br/>5.     farmers co-operative societies: these are associations of farmers who come together to produce jointly using co-operative tools.<br/>6.     consumer co-operative: they consume goods and sell to their members.

It was proposed as a result of the evils of the industrial revolution as of (1750 – 1850. It was when the factory owners (the capitalists) exploited workers bitterly in order to maximize profit. During that period    unemployment was rife and were extremely low. There was child labour, shop keepers on their own part sold adulterated goods. The workers lived in crowded shanties in unsanitary conditions. The worked for more than twelve hours in ill ventilated factory buildings that looked like a prison yard<br/>These anti-social effect of the life industrial revolutions resulted in wide spread of poverty and sufferings while others died of malnutrition, disease and starvation. Life was so hard that the decade became known as “hungry forties” it was because of all these problems that great men (workers) started fighting for social reform they retailiated with violence and strikes they condemned the evils of capitalist.<br/>        It was then that the apostles of Robert owen (the Owenties) Dr Willian king, JohnLyod Charles Hawarth, Willaim owenite. Willaim Pare looked for the better way to solve their problems and later proposed the word co-operatives as a solution to wipe out those evils. The gospel spread all over the countries of the world throughout cooperatives movement.<br/>        When they have succeeded in 1750 through the help of Rochadale pioneers of 1844, they carried on the gospel of cooperative. The rochdale pioneers include.<br/>-      Charles fourier<br/>-      Charles Donwin<br/>-      Louise Blank<br/>-      Phillipe scotta<br/>-      Philipe Buchez <br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY      <br/>        Cooperatives societies have spread all over the countries of Africa, more especially in Nigeria it was because of its vital roles towards the development of rural areas that led to its proposal after the F.C strick land report.<br/>        Cooperative society help to reduce the sufferings of the less privileged ones living in the problem of poverty, unemployment and poor standard of living among rural dwellers need a self help organization were they will pool their little resources together to help themselves this will stop total dependence in government assistance by means of forming a cooperative society that is collective action they will be able to solve their individual problems.<br/>        Cooperative is an association of people who comes together to solve their problems through mutual action. It raises its head in metropolitan as well as in cosmetropolitan environment. It was the uniqueness of cooperation and its flexibility permits it to be practiced among farmers, fishersmen, artisans and woman.<br/>        Cooperative societies do not discriminate either in sex, religion or race, it is for all both producers and consumers, men and women the rich and the poor the educated and the illiterates engaged in cooperatives activities.<br/>        Cooperatives societies has reached to various local government areas and was headed by divisional cooperative officers to promote cooperative in the area of the research was carried on to find out the development of Enugu east (ENUGU EAST) Local government area.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The research problem is<br/>        Cooperative as agent of rural development. The development of rural areas cannot be achieved as was expected by rural dwellers. This is because people were much dependent in government to provide all their needs which they cannot be able to solve completely because of voluminous works and other needs they have to attain. Hence government encourages people to form organization in which they should come together to solve their problems.<br/>        Cooperatives society is one of the major organization where people mostly in rural areas emerged together to achieve their set objectives the problem is to access how important cooperative societies it to the rural development.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>          This research has the major objective of finding out the importance of cooperative society to rural development in Enugu East.<br/>Specific objectives include:<br/>-      Identify the help of cooperative society in motivation of rural people to form or join a cooperative society.<br/>-      To know how they have helped in the provision of infrastructure facilities.<br/>-      To access their help so far in educating the rural people.<br/>-      To know how they have helped in providing the farmers with storage facilities.<br/>-      To know whether they organized any market for the farmers.<br/>-      To know how they have helped to solve unemployment problems in Enugu East local government area.<br/>-      To know how they have helped them to raise their income.<br/>-      To know also how they have helped the farmers to receive government assistance.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        There is the need for the development of rural areas through cooperative societies. This study will show the importance of cooperative societies to the rural development in Enugu East local government area as a basis for offering uniformed suggestions for improvement in the rural development.<br/>        It is believed that the findings, suggestions and recommendations of this study will be benefits to increase the importance of cooperative societies to rural development.              <br/>Specifically this study will go a long way to developing rural areas this also may result to the improvement in the development of people as well as increasing their standard of living.<br/>        The individual people would be well educated which will encourage in the establishment of cooperative business enterprise to enhance development. The provision of basic infrastructure facilities will be affordable and both cooperative societies and government would be involved in financing agricultural activities.        The availability of processing industries and storage facilities would be provided which will reduce the wastage of goods.<br/>        Finally, the outcome of this study will be very useful to the development of Enugu East local government entirely.     <br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>•How far have cooperative societies helped in the  provision of infrastructural facilities in Enugu East?  <br/>•Do cooperative society help in educating of the rural dwellers?<br/>•Do cooperatives help in eliminating the middlemen and the extortioners?<br/>•Do cooperative society  organizes market for them?<br/>•Whether cooperative society solve unemployment problem in the area?<br/>•Do cooperative society helps them to receive government grants and subsidy?<br/>•Do cooperative provide storage facilities for them?<br/>•Do cooperative society encourage them to join cooperative societies <br/>•Do cooperative help them to raise their income<br/>•Whether cooperative societies increase their standard of living?<br/>•Do cooperative help them in provision of transport facilities.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The scope of this study is focused on cooperatives as agent of rural development in Enugu East local government area. It means that this research could not be carried out in all the rural areas in Nigeria, the study is limited based on the fact that there is no time and material resources to see to the whole nation.<br/>        The findings may not be valid to the whole cooperatives societies and rural development but believed that what happened to Enugu East may be applied in other rural areas.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Cooperation:     it means the relationship between <br/>individual people or cooperative organizations united together to help themselves through mutual action.<br/>Rural Urban Migration: this also means urban rush, <br/>the movement of people from rural areas to urban areas may be due to the problem of electricity or lack of job and good roads.<br/>Onwernites:       they were people that fought for the <br/>community and alleviate them from their suffering and abolished the evils of capitalism.<br/>Rochdale Pioneers:   they were people that carried <br/>out the gospel of cooperation after the twenties they formed the first modern cooperative societies in England with 28 weavers.<br/>  <br/>\n\nCOOPERATIVES AS AGENT OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (2008-2012) \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, ENUGU STATE)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COOPERATIVES AS AGENT OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (2008-2012) \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, ENUGU STATE)\r\n", "id": 55}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>COOPERATIVE EDUCATION/TRAINING AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF CO-OPERATIVE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN UDI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The study was conducted to examine cooperative education/training and effective management of cooperative business enterprises       (A case study of cooperative societies in Udi Local Government Area).

Cooperative education/training and management of cooperative business enterprises must be tenaciously pursued.<br/>Cooperative provide education and planning for their members elected representative, managers and employees so they can contributed effectively to the development of their cooperatives.  They inform the general public particularly young people and opinion leaders about the nature and benefits of cooperative.<br/>Cooperative education involves member education involves member education involved member education staff and public education.  Cooperative education will result to information dissemination and creation of the needed information.  The purposes of cooperative education.<br/>-      To create and also to creating, forwarding awareness<br/>-      To provide knowledgeable members and physical ability in them.<br/>To produce efficient and result oriented staff.<br/>To produce dedicated leaders who can brings ideals in a positive angle.<br/>To produce dedicated leaders who can brings ideals in a positive angle.<br/>Cooperative education is regarded as the mother of all the principles of cooperative.  Thus, without education, the other cooperative principles cannot be effectively applied. Imparting cooperative education is the responsibility of cooperatives societies education instiutions, government or government agencies responsible for cooperative matters, international cooperative Alliance graduate of cooperative etc.  It is of interest to ntoe that cooperative etc is of interest to note that cooperative education should be handled by knowledgeable persons or expert in cooperative education is meant for the followings persons.<br/>        The general public which can make positive angle in a stand prospective members who understanding that there about members of cooperative organization  progressive of the organization.  Cooperative officers (past) employees also find a merit solutions for the organization.  A member of the society may not withstanding the content of the bye laws of the society to the contrary give notice to the society of which he is a member within a period of two months from his receipt of the copy of the preliminary resolution, indict his intention not to become a member of the new society. Promote better trained management and staff as increased revenue from several activities puts the society in the region of comfort.  Reduced burden on the members and staff to share contribution will be limited to only society.  Cooperative effect will be shared by many members or trained, even to seek an ideas profit.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          Generally, history of cooperatives education in the developing countries of the world reveals that the main cause of rickety foundation of cooperation has been the lack of cooperative education/training.<br/>Lack of cooperative education/training is disloyalty of members, high incidence of over-due and unpaid loans, low attendance at meetings, ignorance of members’ proposals, poor member relations, bad management, low productivity resulting in little or no surplus, poor public image, inability to change with the times and other harmful result.<br/>Lack of education/training and business inexperienced limits the effectiveness of managers, president, secretaries, treasurers and other management committee members.  Quite often, some people come together as members pool their resources together and form a cooperative society without the proper cooperative ideology.  They enter into cooperative business for political or personal interests, without adequate cooperative education/training to equip them for an effective task.<br/>Some cooperative societies, due to their small-size, low membership, find it very difficult to raise fund sufficient to organize or sponsor special training programmes for their management of cooperative business enterprises.  Such cooperative education/training programme includes seminars, conferences or relevant courses institutions of higher learning.<br/>Most cooperative societies do not have serious training programme for their staff. One may still point to inadequacy of fund as a main reason for this situation. One can hardly see any cooperative employee (not government officials)  from around  attending any of the cooperative education/ training. Members can be individual help liable for all the outstanding debts of the cooperative without giving account of positive but it cooperative provide education/ training for their members elected representative managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their cooperatives.  They were concerns of the fact that lack of cooperative educational/ training was one of the causes for the collapse of the early cooperative movement.  Cooperative education/ training helps equip the members with the skills, knowledge and confidence to enable then use,  participate in and control the cooperative move effectively and generally, to become both better cooperative education. Training.  The members were ignorant of the role of cooperative society their rights and responsibilities and there was no provision for education. Training.  Education training is prime necessity for the success of cooperative societies, because the plight of the members was because of the ignorance.  The practice of cooperative education/ training is power  to forward cooperative and it cannot stand without education/ training the benefits of cooperative were derived from people attempting things for themselves or outstanding cooperative societies should embark on sound education / training for all managers and workers.<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The basic objective of this stud is to determine empirically the cooperative education/training and effective management of cooperative business enterprise in specific terms the objectives of the study are:<br/>(i)          To determine the importance of Cooperative Education/Training on cooperative development.<br/>(ii)         To access how the cooperation education/training has affected the effective or ineffective working of the management of cooperative business enterprise in the cooperative sector in Udi Local Government Area.<br/>(iii)        To examine the modalities for proper cooperative education/training and management of cooperative business enterprise.<br/>(iv)       To participate of cooperative education/ training of staff and members.<br/>(v)        To promote the integrate of women and youth in cooperative education/ training.<br/>(vi)       To integrate cooperative education /training with the government.  To answer the need fro mostly in the developing countries and enterprises to provide 5 ½ % of the society education/ training for the advantage of the cooperative.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>          According to the statement of the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) in its 1972 congress, “All Cooperative Societies should make provision for cooperative Education/Training for their members officers and their employees as well as the general public, in the principles and techniques of cooperative both economic and democratic” (Agbo 1992).<br/>         This study aims at solving the problems of acute shortage of managerial manpower.  It also aims at facilitating cooperative development. <br/>Cooperative education / training as brought out by international cooperative Alliance.  It states that” Cooperative society, open to all person able to their services and willing to accept the responsibility of members without gender, racial political or religious discrimination.  The statement of cooperative education / training was the product of a length process of consultation involving thousand of cooperative round the world.  It also aims to reveal cooperative education/ training about their operations to their principles cannot be effectively applied.  Through well designed articulated and functional cooperative education/ training, mass enlightenment and publicity.<br/>1.5       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>(i)          Cooperative is an association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspiration through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise.<br/>(ii)         Education/Training is a process designed to give knowledge and develop skill.  This is the fifth (ICA) cooperative principle which stipulates the provision of Education/Training for members, elected representatives, managers and employees of cooperative societies to the development of their cooperatives.<br/>(iii)        Management of cooperative business enterprise.  The governing body of a registered cooperative society to whom the management of its affairs is entrusted.<br/>(iv)       Management of cooperative will be very much interested in building high volume of reserves another organ of ICA is referred to as committee for technical service.  Member of this see to the technical activities and skill acquisition of developing cooperative education/ training in cooperative societies<br/>   <br/><br/><br/>\n\nCOOPERATIVE EDUCATION/TRAINING AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF CO-OPERATIVE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN UDI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COOPERATIVE EDUCATION/TRAINING AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF CO-OPERATIVE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN UDI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA)\r\n", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND THE ACTUALIZATION OF THE FADAMA III PROJECT<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF THE THIRD NATIONAL FADAMA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN ENUGU STATE)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>In this five chapter research work, an exposé is carried out on the role of cooperative societies in ensuring the success of the FADAMA III project. Chapter one presents an introduction to the research while chapter two consists of a review of related literatures, in which subject matters such as the scope, benefits and implementation arrangement of FADAMA III as well as the importance, problems of cooperative societies and their possible solutions are identified. Chapter three and four consist of the research design and methodology as well as the data analysis and interpretation while chapter five consist of the summary of findings, recommendation and conclusion. Based on the research, it will be observed that the success of the FADAMA III basically depends on the progress of the FUGs and FCAs which are registered Fadama cooperatives, however these cooperatives are still faced with some challenges such as poor awareness, low level of education and poverty level of the members. There is therefore need for more public awareness about the benefits of the FADAMA III project especially in the rural areas. There is also need for a slash down in the members’ counterpart contribution especially for the newly registered FUGs and FCAs particularly in the area of input support.<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND

BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            World Bank (1996) describes poverty in Nigeria as “widespread and severe”. Despite the country’s vast resources, she is still known with low GDP per capita, high unemployment rate, low industrial utilization capacity, high birth rate and agricultural dependence (Jhingan 2005). World Bank (1996) further states that low productivity in agriculture is the cause of high incidence of poverty in the country.<br/>            Agriculture is a major sector in the Nigerian economy providing employment for more than 70% of the population. According to pmnewsnigeria.com, “since the nation’s independence in 1960, agriculture had been the mainstay of the nation’s economy, providing the largest chunk of foreign exchange inflow into the country. Moreover, it contributed about 63% to the nation’s GDP according to official statistics… With the dramatic shift of focus to crude oil exploration and attendant boom of the 1970s, agriculture was displaced as the nation’s main foreign exchange earner. As a consequence therefore, agriculture’s contribution to the nation’s GDP declined to 34% just as unemployment began to make an upward movement.<br/>            Although 80% of the land in Nigeria is cultivable and about 13% is forested, it is sad to note that as at 1990, only 42% of the cultivable area was farmed. Although the United Nations testify of an increase in agricultural output in recent years but this increase has been attributed to the expansion of the area under cultivation rather than from increased productivity. The sector has been hampered by lack of investment in improved farming technology while over farming of fragile soil has worsened the problem of soil degradation.<br/>            In the bid to solve these agricultural problems faced by the nation, different regimes have over the years drawn up various agricultural plans and policies among which include Operation Feed the Nation (OFN), Green Revolution (GR) and Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). The National Fadama Development Project (NFDP) is however a major instrument used in achieving the Government’s poverty reduction objective in Nigeria in recent years. The project which was initiated in the early 1990s is now in its third edition or phase. In the first phase, it had only six participating states with only Jigawa as a “core state”, i.e. a state in which Fadama I was fully implemented. However, the National Fadama Project is currently found in all the 36 states of the federation including the FCT.<br/>            Enugu state is one of the beneficiary states in the FADAMA III project. The state which is a mainland state in south eastern Nigeria shares borders with Abia state and Imo state to the south, Ebonyi state to the east, Benue state to the north east, Kogi state to the north west and Anambra state to the west. The state has good soil-land and climatic conditions all year round, sitting at about 223 metres above sea level and the soil is well drained during its rainy seasons. According to the Wikipedia, “Economically, the state is proportion its working population engaged in farming, although trading (18.8%) and services (12.9%) are also important”. The state has 17 local government areas and according to the State Project Coordinator FADAMA III, Mrs. Amaka Okenwa – Uzoechina, each of the seventeen local government areas has no fewer than 100 cooperative Fadama User Group engaged in producing livestock, crops, processed foods, marketing, storage and distribution.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            The goal of increasing food production and reducing food import has elicited many programmes and policies at the various level of government. The first was the establishment of River Basin Development Authorities (RBDAs) in the early 1970s and by the late 1980s, the development of small-scale irrigation systems in fadama land areas commenced.<br/>            The fadama irrigation concept emerged in one of the World Bank assisted programme with the launching of the National Fadama Development Project (NFDP) in 1993. Kudi, T.M et al (unpublished) citing Cox and Akin (1979) describes the Fadama concept as an age-old tradition in Hausa land where the land that floods on seasonal basis allow for the growth of a variety of crops under small scale irrigation farming system. Many reasons have been advanced for the necessity of supplementing rain fed agriculture with irrigation in Nigeria. This is because the country is endowed with underground and surface water reserves, rich pastures and favourable agro-ecological conditions in the country’s low lying planes with alluvial deposits called fadama. It was in the light of these potentials that the First National Fadama Development Project (FADAMA I) was designed in 1993 to promote simple and low-cost improved irrigation technology under World Bank financing. The widespread adoption of the technologies enabled farmers to increase production by more than 300% in some cases. Evaluation of FADAMA I revealed that the full realization of project benefits was hampered by some specific short falls in project design and implementation, including the lack of involvement of project clients in project planning; project was limited to crop production ignoring downstream value addition activities of marketing and processing and ignoring of other Fadama resource users.<br/>            Government impressed by the achievements of FADAMA I approached the ADF and the International Development Association of the World Bank for support in expanding the achievements of FADAMA I in scope and size. To achieve its aims, FADAMA II was designed with a focus on community driven development with maximum participation of the stakeholders at every stage of the project cycle (Msuya M.M et al: unpublished). Despite the successes recorded in the FADAMA II project, the project still faced some constraints. Adegbite A.D et al (2007) identified some of the problems discovered as, “… inadequate infrastructural and storage facilities, inadequate capital for farm operation, insufficient access to micro-credit facilities and other support services by members of the Fadama endowed communities …” The Third National Fadama Development Project (FADAMA III) is a follow-up on the second phase. This research therefore aims to establish the role co-operative societies have to play in the actualization of the FADAMA III project.<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>            The main objective of this research work is to identify the relevance of cooperative societies in ensuring the success of the FADAMA III project in Enugu state, factors militating against these co-operative societies and possible solution to these challenges faced by the co-operative societies.<br/>            However to ensure efficiency and precision, this, main objective is further splitted into specific objectives which are to:<br/>i.          Analyze the objectives of the Third National Fadama Development Project;<br/>ii.         Identify the project implementation arrangement of the Third National Fadama Development Project as well as to modus operandi.<br/>iii.        Discover and analyze the impact of the FADAMA III project on the life of the people of Enugu state, particularly those in the rural area.<br/>iv.        Find out the factors militating against the full actualization of the objectives of the project;<br/>v.         Identify the role of co-operative societies in the actualization of the FADAMA III project.<br/>vi.        Make suggestions and recommendations that will help improve the contribution of co-operative societies to the actualization of the FADAMA III project.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>            During the course of this research, the researcher intends to provide answers to the following questions:<br/>i.          What is the Third National Fadama Development Project all about?<br/>ii.         What are the objectives of the project?<br/>iii.        How is the project being executed?<br/>iv.        What are the contributions of the project to the development of Enugu state?<br/>v.         What are the roles of co-operative societies in the actualization of this project?<br/>vi.        What are the factors militating against the efficient and effective implementation of this project?<br/>vii.       How can these limitations be minimized if not entirely eradicated?<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The usefulness of the findings of this research cannot be over emphasized. First of all, this research will help the state government with tips on how to effectively use co-operative societies in the actualization of the goals of the FADAMA III project.<br/>            Secondly, the research will provide the organizers and coordinators of the FADAMA Development Project with possible solutions to the challenges currently faced by the project.<br/>            Thirdly, prospective organizers of community development oriented programmes will find this research work a useful guide to the actualization of their prospects.<br/>            Finally, though the researcher restricted this research study to Enugu state, the result of the findings will be of immense benefit to all coordinators and benefactors of the FADAMA III project all over Nigeria, as well as, students conducting similar research work on the same topic or related ones.<br/>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>            Below is the definition some basic concept frequently used during the course of this research:<br/>i.          Co-operative society: This is an association of persons who have voluntarily joined together to achieve a common end through the formation of a democratically controlled organization; making equitable contributions to the capital required and accepting a fair share of the risks and benefits of the undertaking in which members activity participate (Bob-Igwe C.C and Ugwuanyi Lillian: 2006).<br/>ii.         Fadama: This is the Hausa name for irrigable land-usually low-lying plains underlain by “shallow” aquifers found along major river systems. The Fadama concept is an age-old tradition in Hausa land where land that floods on several basis allows for the growth of a variety of crops under small scape irrigation farming system. Such lands are especially suitable for irrigated crop production and fishing and traditionally provide feed and water for livestock.<br/>iii.        Fadama Community Associations (FCAs): These are apex organizations of economic interest groups which derive their livelihood from the shared natural resources of the Fadama land.<br/>iv.        Fadama User Group (FUGs): An FUG is a group of an average of twenty (20) persons who share common economic interest and registered as a Fadama cooperative.<br/>            FUGs and FCAs are the primary beneficiaries of the Fadama Project.<br/> <br/><br/>\n\nCOOPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND THE ACTUALIZATION OF THE FADAMA III PROJECT\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF THE THIRD NATIONAL FADAMA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN ENUGU STATE)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND THE ACTUALIZATION OF THE FADAMA III PROJECT\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF THE THIRD NATIONAL FADAMA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN ENUGU STATE)\r\n", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>IDENTIFICATION AND SOLUTION OF MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS OF FARMERS MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN ANAMBRA STATE<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF ONISHA NORTH L.G.A OF ANAMBRA STATE)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>   The researcher investigated the management problems and solutions of farmers cooperative societies in Onitsha north local government area.

Hence, the well known slogan “self help through mutual help” by cooperators.<br/>        However, cooperatives in Onitsha north are yet to make the desired impact on the communities, there is then the need for an effective management  system that will help direct the activities of the cooperatives towards achieving their objectives, thereby endeavour to examine the extent to which poor management system retards the growth of the farmers cooperative societies in Onitsha north.<br/>        The viability of any cooperative society depends on the finance, educational competence and managerial skills of executives and cooperation of all the cooperatives. Therefore poor management have being the brain behind the low productivity and poor generation of revenue of some of the societies in Onitsha north local government area.<br/>        The importance of good management of farmers cooperative societies cannot be over emphasized, a good management capitalizes on the economic and social needs satisfaction of its members since when individual joins an organization, they often hope to achieve a personal goal but this cannot be possible without achieving organizational goals. Unfortunately, there is bifurcation i.e division of interest among members and executives. They lack effective management skill and most of them have never had the opportunity to attend seminars, workshop and symposium on management cooperatives societies.<br/>        Furthermore, farmers cooperatives society in Onitsha north lack good organizational structure. The principle of democracy in cooperative organization has rendered it playing toy and it has become perpetually unproductive as members with less investment in the cooperative often close their eyes to the risk of poor management strategies in a competitive economy like ours.<br/>        It is worthy to point that the researcher’s attempt to formulae strategies geared towards the successful implementation of the cooperative goals and objectives.<br/>1.2    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY               <br/>        The general objectives of this study is to scientifically and critically highlight managerial problems which affects the efficient functions of farmers cooperative society.<br/>Specifically the objectives of the study includes<br/>i.     analyzing how these management problems abort the well being of members of the cooperative.<br/>ii.    How best these problems could be successfully eliminated.<br/>iii.  The objectives is also o analyze how members react to these problems.<br/>iv.  Finally, this project is aimed at identifying how lack of education contributes negatively on the managerial problems of farmers cooperative society.<br/>1.3    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        The study is intended to investigate the major management problems and solutions of farmers cooperative societies in Onitsha north local government area of Anambra state.<br/>        It is interesting observed that cooperative societies have laudable objectives which they set for themselves but these objectives are never achieved because of the management problems facing them, such as inadequate funding by members, poor and ineffective management of the societies and not having enough members.<br/>1.4    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY      <br/>        The research work is mainly for academic purpose, the reliability of many cooperative societies and the liquidation of some of them suggests that something is wrong, perhaps with their management system.<br/>        Therefore, it is the objectives of the researcher to find out some of the causes of these problems and suggest ways to bring about a lasting improvement to farmers cooperative societies.<br/>        The researcher would look into the problems militating against the effective management of farmers cooperative societies in Onitsha north.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION    <br/>          The following research question will be aimed at finding answer to this study.<br/>1.   Do unavailability of finance constitute a problem to the effective management of farmers cooperative society?<br/>2.   Do lack of committees in decision making constitute a problem of the effective management of farmers cooperative society?<br/>3.   Do lack of trained staff constitute a problem to the effective management of farmers cooperative society?<br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY           <br/>        This study is meant to aid cooperators gain more knowledge of what is expected of them for the success of the cooperative enterprise by:<br/>1.   Determine some of the basic management flaws that are encountered by farmers cooperative societies in Onitshan north local government area.<br/>2.   Determine the extent to which their problems constitute a hindrance to the efficiency of the societies.<br/>3.   Seeking avenues through which such problems can be minimized.<br/>4.   Finally based on the findings of the study, recommendations shows that the inefficiency of management should be rectified for the realization of the societies objectives.<br/>This study also wants to ameliorate the bottleneck preventing farmers in cooperative from realizing the benefits of large scale production, marketing and credit facilities. Other benefits of the study includes:<br/>1.   The enlightenment of cooperators on the need to be properly committed to the cooperative movement. This will help to make cooperators understand what is expected of them in cooperation and how to cooperate for effectiveness.            <br/>2.   It is envisaged that cooperative organizers will gain more insight on how to organize and manage the farmers cooperative societies more profitable after going through their report.<br/>The government will come to see the need to have well trained cooperative leaders to champion the affairs of farmers cooperative societies. They will also be more willing to remove the administrative bottlenecks that militate loan disbursement to farmers cooperative societies. This will come about when the suggestion of this research is implemented<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.     Cooperative Society: This is an association of persons who join together either formally or informally adhoc or permanent basis for legal or illegal or socially accepted or unaccepted actions to fulfill certain aims (Obodoechi, 2011).<br/>2.     Farmers Cooperative Societies: It is a cooperative society that is made up of only farmers to cater for the need of its members.<br/>3.     Farmers Multi-purpose Cooperative Society: This is cooperative society that performs more than one function e.g food production and marketing.<br/>4.     Identification: In relation to this research it shows certain phenomenon that are detrimental to the management of cooperative.<br/>5.     Management: It is act of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling and budgeting in a farmers cooperative society so as to realize its objectives.<br/>6.     Problems: This refers to those objectives and concerns that affect the performance of the management of the society.<br/>7.     Trained Staff: This refers to anybody who has undergone professional training in any cooperative institution.<br/>     <br/>\n\nIDENTIFICATION AND SOLUTION OF MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS OF FARMERS MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN ANAMBRA STATE\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF ONISHA NORTH L.G.A OF ANAMBRA STATE)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IDENTIFICATION AND SOLUTION OF MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS OF FARMERS MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN ANAMBRA STATE\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF ONISHA NORTH L.G.A OF ANAMBRA STATE)\r\n", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CREDIT MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES IN AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATIVE BANK IN NIGERIA <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF BOA, ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project is written to be useful to all who are interested in co-operative organizations, banks and the general public.

As a development finance institution it is government owned (CBN 40% and federal ministry of finance 60%) and supervised by federal ministry of agriculture. The bank was incorporated as Nigerian Agricultural Bank (NAB) in the year 1973 and in the year 1978 was renamed Nigeria Agricultural and Co-operative bank (NACB). <br/>Subsequently in the year 2000, it was merged with the people’s bank of Nigeria (PBN) and took over the risk assets of Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP) to become Nigeria agricultural Co-operative and Rural Development Bank. A plan to reposition the bank into an effective and sustainable national agricultural and rural development finance institution in 2010 led to a further name change to Bank of Agriculture (BOA). Bank of agriculture limited is dedicated primarily to agricultural financing at both the micro and macro levels as well as micro financing of small and medium scale enterprises.<br/>The bank has a 3-tier administrative structure.  The Head Office is in Kaduna and there are six zonal offices located at Abuja, Kano, Bauchi, Enugu, Port Harcourt and Ibadan.  Under the Zonal Offices, there is a network of over 200 branches.  Enugu zonal office is responsible for monitoring and supervision of the activities of the 26 branches in the South-East zone which are distributed as follows:<br/> 26 BRANCHES IN THE SOUTH – EAST ZONE UNDER ENUGU ZONAL OFFICE SUPERVISION<br/>ABIA    ANAMBRA    EBONYI    ENUGU    IMO<br/>Umuahia    Awka    Abakaliki    Enugu    Owerri<br/>Akoli Imenyi    Ihiala

    Orlu<br/> The awareness of the serious decline in agricultural production necessitated the establishment of the bank.  The BOA is not the only financial institution which provides agricultural credit.  Prior to the establishment of BOA, agricultural credit schemes was operated by some agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture, supervising credit scheme, agricultural credit co-operative thrift and loan scheme, farmers multi-purpose co-operative societies.  Most of these institutions were not effective sources for strictly agricultural credit.  There were a lot of evidence that creditors borrowed money for agriculture but diverted it to other ventures.  Again, credit was often extended to only favourites and scarcely to genuine small scale farmers.  Besides, they could not meet the collateral and equity contribution requirements, a situation that compelled a significant proportion of the farmers to seek for other sources of credit.<br/>According to Idachaba quoted from Cardoso, (1987:18) or research carried out showed that 58% of farming related borrowing was from family and friends, 224% from private money tenders, 15% from merchants and only 3% from institutional sources.<br/>It is against this background that the researcher is to investigate how credit will effectively administered in co-operative enterprises.  They will enable us to identify the major problems associated with credit administration in co-operative agricultural banks and seek solution to these problem to ensure continued existence of developing co-operatives.<br/> <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM:<br/>In this sector, co-operative banks mobilizes credit for their members through the savings of members.  It has been observed that they are inefficient in mobilizing and utilization of credits.  Many problems led to this ineffective mobilization of credit.  They are:<br/>-                      Illiteracy and lack of awareness.<br/>-                      High cost of credit delivery due to the fact that farmers are many and are scattered.<br/>-                      Default in loan repayment.<br/>-                      Inadequate funds to lend to the numerous customers.<br/>-                      Diversion of loans<br/>-                      Inefficient management of loan<br/>-                      Faulty loan policy which may sometimes emphasize credit worthiness of borrowers and not viability of projects.<br/>-                      Credit operations of meek money activities without proper organization procedure and planned systematic arrangement.<br/>-                      Absence of regular monitoring and supervision of loans.<br/>The above problems need to be solved for effective performance of co-operatives.<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:<br/>The situation of co-operatives is nothing to write home about, if co-operatives should continue at this rate, they will wind up.  In view of the above, solution have to be designed for these problems.<br/>Therefore, the objective of the study is to find out the various societies existing in the area under review.  To find out various problems being encountered by these co-operatives which tend to hinder their effective and efficient performance as agent of credit.  Finally, to make recommendations and suggest probably solutions that will enable these societies overcome the problems so as to function effectively.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTION:<br/>For the fact that credit is very important in every business activities, therefore, the study is focused on finding relevant solutions to the following research questions:<br/>1.     How do you manage your agricultural credit techniques?<br/>2.     What is the purpose of credit management in agricultural co-operative bank in Enugu South?<br/>3.     What problems are encountered in the administration of credit in agricultural co-operative bank and what are the solutions to these problems?<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The study will assist the loan committed managers in their decision making, as it concerns credit policy and management of credit in form of proper assessment of loan applications, proper supervision of credit and evaluation of project proposals.  It will help the management to see the need to employ professional staff.<br/>Lastly, the study or findings will be of educational importance to the various universities, polytechnics and students of co-operative departments in the various schools.<br/>1.6       DEFINITION OF TERMS:<br/>For clarity of purpose,

Based on this, one might start to wonder what this research topic is all about. Credit cooperation started in Germany. The effort of two men ensured this success history today. There were Herman shultze Delitszch and Fredrich Wilhelm Raiffesen<br/>        Shultz delitszch was a lawyer by training and a member of German National Assembly. In 1850 in eilenburgh, he organized the first ever credit cooperative society in history. Being on urban cooperative society, it was organized among heterogeneous populations, individuals who do not know each other. Because of this, the cooperative had been designed based on the principles of shareholding; material security for loans granted and limited usability. In 1867, the German government passed a cooperative societies act to recognize and protect these societies. In no time, this urban credit cooperative society spread all over Europe and to even America and Canada <br/>                On the other hand, fredrish Wilhelm Raiffeisen who was a solider, railway builder and wine merchant and also a devoted Christian started among the rural dwellers, credit cooperative society. The rural farmers lacked sufficient fund to pay cash for farm equipment and household necessities. In northern Germany, Raiffeisen organized what he called ‘loan societies’. This society was not based on charity but on self help which is hinged on regular thrift saving not on shareholding. Members of that society saved weekly. Obodoechi (2006)<br/> Institute Of Management and Technology (IMT) Enugu<br/>        Imt Enugu came into existences under the then east control state o Nigeria edict no 10 of 1993 promulgated by the administrator of east central state-Aije ukpaboi asika prior establishment of the great IMT, there existence uphill 1969. The colleague of technology offered recourse in engineering, laboratory technology leading to award of ordinary diploma, the cooperative college which offered a certificate course in cooperative studies to cooperative inspectors from the ministry. <br/>        The college of technology was part of the ministry of education and the ministry controlled it. In1970, there arose the need to establish a higher institution of leaning for upgrading and tracing of men and women of technological, managerial and engineering fields. In October 1972, the administrator of the east central state appointed a provisional council, this council was charged with determining and recommending to the government on appropriate structure of an autonomous subject areas indicated by the state and national needs. In April 1973 a report was submitted by the council. Thus on 31st May 1993 the edict No 10 of 1973 titled “THE IMT EDICT 1973” was promulgated. The edict took effect from July 1st 1973 and then gave birth to what is now known as Institute of Management and Technology (IMT) Enugu. With Dr Ukwu as the first chairman of council while Professor M.O Chijioke as the first rector. Mr. B.O Akukuwa as the first registrar. <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>1.     To make student know the need of a common forum that is, where they can solve their financial and material problems such as school fees, house rent etc. <br/>2.     To find out if student of institute of management and        technology are aware of cooperative thrift and credit society programs and the benefit of the educational institute.<br/>3.     To find solutions to the factors militating against       student being members of the society. <br/>4.     They also have to find out the factors hindering them from being members after being aware of the existence         of the program.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>1.     To inculcate investment spirit in student of the         cooperative credit and thrift society.<br/>2.     It also helps to educate student about the existence of      cooperative movement.<br/>3.     Cooperative thrift and credit society also helps to     enhance proper and efficient management of funds among student and thrift in order to provide credit           facilities for them.<br/>4.     To educate student about the special attribute of the        cooperative thrift and credit society. <br/>5.     It encourages cooperative spirit and practice of       cooperative among student.<br/>6.     They also help in funding educational material and   financial uplifting. <br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>1.     Does cooperative thrift contributes to the growth of cooperative <br/>2.     Is cooperative thrift profit oriented society <br/>3.     Do student really understand the cooperative thrift and     credit society.<br/>4.     If cooperative were to be established in institute of   management and technology, would you like to join. <br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of this research work is to assist in creating cooperative movement in our institution of higher learning.  This is with a view to improve the cost and problems faced by students of IMT Enugu in the area of accommodation, feeding, payment of school fees and payment for textbooks and handout etc. cooperative, thrift and credit society helps to achieve all this in higher institution by educating the student about what the cooperative movement is all about its early beginning.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.     Co-Operative:   it is an autonomous body free from governmental or external control and domination I.C.A         of (1995) <br/>2.      Cooperative Movement: this is socio- economic activity aimed at creating and developing cooperative        coniine       dictionary.<br/>3.     Credit: this is money lent by the cooperate society to      its members at low interest rate.<br/>4.     Thrift: this refers to the act of saving by the members     of the cooperative society. <br/>5.     Program: this refers to the cooperative thrift and    credit society. <br/> <br/>\n\nTHE POTENTIALS FOR A CO-OPERATIVE THRIFT AND CREDIT SOCIETY IN HIGHER EDUCATON \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF IMT ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE POTENTIALS FOR A CO-OPERATIVE THRIFT AND CREDIT SOCIETY IN HIGHER EDUCATON \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF IMT ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 60}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND THE ACTUALIZATION OF THE FADAMA III PROJECT IN NIGERIA<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF FADAMA III PROJECT IN IMO STATE)  <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The department objective of the third Fadama III project for Nigeria is to sustainably increase the incomes of Fadama users.

Despite the country’s vast resources, she is still known with low GDP per capita, high unemployment rate, low industrial utilization capacity, high birth rate and agricultural dependence. World Bank further states that low productivity in agriculture is the cause of high incidence of poverty in the country. <br/>        Agriculture is the major sector in the Nigerian economy providing employment for more than 70% of the population. <br/>        “Since the nations independence in 1960, agriculture had been the ministry of the nation is economy providing the largest clunk of foreign exchange inflow into the country. Moreover, it contributed about 63% to the nation’s GDP according to official statistics with the dramatic shift of focus to crude oil exploration and attendant boom of the 1970s, agriculture was displaced as the nation’s main foreign exchange earner. As a consequence therefore, agriculture’s contribution to the nation’s GDP declined to 34% just as unemployment began to make an upward movement. <br/>        Although 80% of the land in Nigeria is cultivable and about 13% is forested, it is sad to note that as at 1990 only 42% of the cultivable area was farmed. Although the United Nations testify of an increase in agricultural output in recent years but this increase has been attributed to the expansion of the area under cultivation rather than from increased productivity. The sector has been hampered by lack of investment in improved farming technology while over farming of fragile soil has worsened the problem of soil degradation. <br/>        In the bid to solve the agricultural problems faced by the nation, different regimes have over the years drawn up various agricultural plans and policies among which include Operation Feed the Nation (OFN), Green Revolution (GR) and Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). The National Fadama Development Project (NFDP) is however a major instrument used in achieving the government’s poverty reduction objectives in Nigeria in recent years. The project which was initiated in the early 1900s is now in its third edition or phrase. In the first phase, it had only six participating states with only jigawa as a “core state”, ie a state in which Fadama I was fully implemented. However the National Fadama project is current found in all the 36 states of the federation including the FCT. <br/>        The aim of Fadama III project is aimed at alleviating poverty in the communities through empowering the Imo people to own productive assets. The ministry has entered into discussion with various investors on an integrated agricultural development and food production in the state that will launch Imo state as major producer and exporter of food in the century. This is in the area of Rice Production, Livestock, Fisheries Vegetable and Fruits, Agricultural Input, Poultry, Cassava, Oil, palm etc. According to the Wikipedia, “Economically, the state is proportion its working population engaged in farming, although trading (18.8%) and services (12.9%) are also important”. The state has 27 local government areas and each of the twenty-seven local government areas has no fewer than 100 cooperative Fadama user group engaged in producing livestock, crops, processes foods, marketing, storage and distribution. <br/> 1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM             <br/>        The goal of increasing food production and reducing  food import has elicited many programmes and policies at the various level of government. Kudi, T. M. et al (unpublished) citing Cox and Akin (1979) describes the Fadama concept as an age old tradition in Hausa land where the land that floods on seasonal basis allow for the growth of a variety of crops under small scale irrigation farming system. Many reasons have been advanced for the necessity of supplementing rain fed agriculture with irrigation in Nigeria. <br/>        This is because the country is endowed with underground and surface water reserves, rich pastures and favourable agro-ecological conditions in the country’s low lying panes with alluvial deposits called Fadama. It was in the light of these potentials that the first National Fadama Development Project (FADAMA I) was designed in 1993 to promote simple and low-cost improved irrigation technology under World Bank financing. <br/>        Government impressed by the achievement of FADAMA I approached the ADF and the International Development Association of the weorld Bank for support in expanding the achievements of FADAMA I in scope and size. To achieve its aims, FADAMA II was designed with a focus on community driven development will maximum participation of the stakeholders at every stage of the project cycle. Despite the successes recorded in the FADAMA II project, the project still faced some constraints. Adegbite A. D. et al (2007) identified some of the problems discovered as “…. Inadequate infrastructural and storage facilities, inadequate cantina for farm operation, insufficient access to micro credit facilities and other support services by members of the FADAMA endowed communities….” Therefore aims of establish the role co-operative societies have to play in the actualization of the FADAMA III project. <br/> 1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY     <br/>        The general objective of this research work is to identify the Relevance of Agricultural Cooperative societies in ensuring the success of the Fadama III project in Imo state. <br/>        Furthermore, to ensure efficiency and precision this specific objectives which are: <br/>i.             Analyze the objectives of the third National Fadama Development Project. <br/>ii.            Identify the project implementation arrangement of the third National Fadama Development project as well as to modus operandi. <br/>iii.          Discover and analyze the impact of the Fadama III project on the life of the people of Imo state. <br/>iv.          Find out the factors militating against the full actualization of the objectives of the project. <br/>v.           Identify the role of agricultural cooperatives societies in the actualization of the Fadama III Project.    <br/>vi.          Make suggestions and recommendations that will help improve the contribution of agricultural cooperative societies to the actualization of the Fadama III Project. <br/> 1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>        During the course of this research, the researcher intends to provide answers to the following questions. <br/>i.             What are the objectives of the project? <br/>ii.            How is the project being executed? <br/>iii.          What are the contributions of the project to the development of Imo state? <br/>iv.          What are the roles of agricultural cooperative societies in the actualization of this project?  <br/>v.           How can these limitations be minimized if not entirely eradicated? <br/> 1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The usefulness of the findings of this research cannot be over emphasized. First of all, this research will help the state government with tips on how to effectively use agricultural cooperative societies in the actualization of the goals of the FADAMA III project. <br/>        Secondly, the research will provide the organizers and coordinators of the Fadama III development project with possible solutions to the challenges currently face d by the project. <br/>        Thirdly, prospective organizers of community development oriented programmes will find this research work a useful guide to the actualization of their prospects. <br/>        Finally, thought the researcher restricted this research study to Imo state, the result of the findings will be of immense benefit to all coordinators and benefactress to the FADAMA III project all over Nigeria as well as students conducting similar research work on the same topic or related ones.   <br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>          Below is the definition of some basic concept frequently used during the course of the research. <br/>i.             Agricultural cooperative: Agricultural cooperatives are association of individuals for achievement of economic and social objectives. Modern cooperatives started with modern industrialization as a weapon of counter measure against capitalism. <br/>ii.            FADAMA: This is the Hausa name of irrigable land usually low lying plains underlain by “shallow” aquifers found along major rivers systems. The Fadama concept is an age-old tradition in Hausa land where land that floods on several basis allows for the growth of a variety of crops under small scope irrigation farming system. Such lands are especially suitable for irrigated crop production and fishing and traditionally provide feed and water for livestock. <br/>iii.          FADAMA Community Association (FCAs): These are apex organization of economic interest groups which derive their livelihood from the shared natural resources of the Fadama land. <br/>iv.          FADAMA User Groups (FUGs): An FUG is a group of an average of twenty (20) persons who share common economic interest and registered as a Fadama cooperative. FUG and FCAs, are the primary beneficiaries of the FADAMA project. <br/>      <br/>\n\nAGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES\r\n AND THE ACTUALIZATION OF THE \r\nFADAMA III PROJECT IN NIGERIA\r\n(A CASE

ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>The origin of Modern Co-operative Societies can be traced back to the middle 30s.  This followed the commission of the stick land report in 1934 on the enactment of co-operative Ordinance was in 1935.  Since then a lot of interests have continued to be generated in this form of business ventures.  The various government and co-operative superior have made some series of an attempt to encourage includes, the revision of co-operative laws and regulations, encouraging the public to form and join co-operative.  Introduction of Co-operative division in the Ministry too place.<br/>A co-operative principle refers to basic truth or general law determining the existence and regulation the conduct of an organisation and distinguishing it from other systems.  The co-operative principles are fundamental and universal rules laid down by co-operative leaders to guide their conduct and lead them on the enduring and successful performance.  The International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) described them as norms they should prevail in the co-operative regardless of what they do and where they exist.  In the previous attempt, which was made by the co-operative superiors in seeing that co-operative improve its quality, by having a principle guiding them.  Those people and their principle are as follows:<br/> ROCHDALE PRINCIPLE IN 1944<br/>They organized a successful consumer co-operative society though it was accepted before that of 1966, which was as a result of amendment.<br/>The International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) a non-governmental association – whose function is to unite represents and serves co-operatives worldwide.  The ICA purposes were to promote co-operatives.  Co-operative Organisation was founded in London in 1885 for twelve countries – Argentina, India, USA and nine European countries.  The headquarters was transferred from London to Geneva, Suitzerland in 1982 to give co-operation a more international partisan image.<br/>The ICA produces a new constitution Tokyo in 1992.  According to article 2 of the constitution (RIC Vol. 852 and 3, 127), the ICA pursue its objective by serving as a forum for exchange of experience and a source of information on co-operatives.<br/>Another Mr. Owen, the Philanthropist, he treated his workers with respect and humility.  He paid their wages, reduces their hours of work, kept his factory clean, put a stop to child’s labour, and started school for workers children.  He opened the first Nursery school in Europe.  He allowed his workers leisure hour for games and recreation.  He used part of his welfare for his workers.  In believing that people work best if they are healthy and happy, he was based on capitalist.  All these he did from 1771 – 1859 after he failed. <br/>Dr. William King (1786 – 1965), he was a medical practitioner in Brighton, an Urdent co-operator and a follower of Robert Owen.  William King made some corrections from Robert Owen’s system.  <br/>He advised workers against Owens utopian home colonization schemes, which he considered too big, too capital, intensive, too unmanageable.  People accepted William’s corrections and organized in Britain co-operative shops from William’s idea.  They tried very well before the Rochdale pioneers which came up in 1844, a group of 28 workers.  They opened up a retail co-operative shop based on sound idea and correct business practice.  They adopted the correct principle and omitted the wrong one.  They started with pre-member education based on weekly discussion meetings lasting several months.  Members made some contributions.  The pioneers were men of practical common sense, not idle dreamers.  They had their dreams to become their masters.  They kept strict account of every transaction and declared their balance sheet quarterly.  This method led them to success and they became a model for co-operatives all over the world.  After this, came the ICA principle, which is the latest up to date.  There are some amendments done from Rochdale principle, which was used for the ICA 1995 latest principle,

origin in the tension and opportunities created by industrialization and urbanization in the nineteenth Century in Europe. Much of the early interested in co-operative structure seemed from deep regards to the social consequence of industrial capitalism, critics of the new order not simply a framework for business organisation but also as a vehicle for the reutilization of radical social and political goals. However, much concepts of c-operative have been erased the claims of earlier social prophets, a residual belief remains that co-operators are motivated by group interest as well as self interest, and that non-economic as well as economic objectives may be pursued.  Other of these propositions present difficulties through not inseparable one’s in terms of applying economic analysis to the study of applying economic analysis to the study of Co-operatives, it is pertinently imperative and a restrictive device of immense capacity that co-operative organisations have paid the way for the new economic and social order not only for those, ‘depressed’ in the economy who (mostly of less privileged) are at the receiving end, the logical and social justice, which they embody, but in our ability to translate them concretely and realistically from social theory into social fact and to make them effective in our daily live. We must always remember that co-operative are organizations of by and for members therefore they are designed to respond to the needs of members. Agricultural Co-operative has created for the economic charge, for increasing in food produce, for building a better or a more just and equitable society.  They serve to give individuals through voluntary co-operation and mutual assistance, control or bit of their destiny to make people in some way asters of their own fate, subjects and not objects of their history.  Co-operatives are of course pragmatic institution noted in reality of concerts goals.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER   ONE<br/>1.0   Introduction                                <br/>1.1    Background of the Study              <br/>1.2    Statement of the Problems   <br/>1.3    Objectives of the Study                <br/>1.4    Research Questions                     <br/>1.5    Significance of the Study              <br/>1.6    Scope of Study                           <br/>1.7    Definition of Terms                      <br/>CHAPTER   TWO <br/>2.1    Brief History of Peace Broiler/Hatchery and Agricultural Engineers (Enugu) FMCS          <br/>2.2    The role of Agricultural Co-operative Organization<br/>2.3    Farming Systems/Agricultural System             <br/>2.4    The Importance of Agricultural Co-operative<br/>2.5    Problems of Agricultural Co-operative     <br/>2.6    Market of Produce                                       <br/>CHAPTER   THREE<br/>3.0    Research Design and Methodology         <br/>3.1    Area of Study                                             <br/>3.2    Population and Sample                         <br/>3.3    Source of Data                                            <br/>3.4    Instrument for Data Collection                       <br/>3.5    Data Collection Procedure                     <br/>3.6    Method of Data Analysis                               <br/>CHAPTER   FOUR<br/>4.0    Presentation, Analysis and Interpretation of Data<br/>4.1    Presentations of Data                                   <br/>CHAPTER   FIVE<br/>5.0    Summary of Findings , Recommendation and Conclusion                                                  <br/>5.1    Summary of Findings                                   <br/>5.2    Recommendations                                               <br/>5.2    Conclusions                                                <br/>Bibliography<br/>Questionnaire<br/>Appendix<br/>CHAPTER   ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>Agriculture, from the beginning of time, the first concern of man has been food clothing and shelter in that order.  Agriculture being one of the oldest industries, its origin can be traced to the earliest human societies.  the existence of man fro  the prehistoric era up to the era ancient civilization depended on the ability of the individual to hunt and gather food for consumption.  Food was, however the basic source of life which provided him energy in his wondering and constant struggle for survival.  However, with the realization that food was basic need for survival, efforts were made by early man to cultivate crops.<br/>In spite of the limitations which agriculture is facing, it still remained the most important sector of the world economy.  Agriculture is a basic industry that supports all industries and all aspects of needs can justify from its role and contributions to nation building.   Between 75 – 80% of working population in rural areas engage in agriculture production (farming).  Some are provide jobs in the industries e.g. textile industry, Breweries and shoe industry.<br/>Agriculture aids in rural development, with the location of industries that utilize agricultural produce in an area other investors go to rural areas to set up factories trade and operate business centers people are employed and paid to earn their living. Agricultural provides industrial raw material, textile mills required cotton, and plastic industries use rubber/latex.<br/>Agricultural involves operational clearing of the land and the breaking-up of surface soil, the sowing for seeds, the removal of the weeds from the farm, the harvesting and storage of crops which are disposed of by marketing and the breeding and rearing of animals.  All these Co-operatives can do in a number of different, which involve amounts of labour, time, expense and productivity.  Agricultural education is an area in agriculture that a concern with helping people to develop a desire to learn and teach agriculture.  This is a change of behaviour towards agricultural practices. <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Agricultural co-operatives are greatly involved in food production so as to improve the social and economic life of the members and the country as a whole.<br/>In spite of these, agricultural co-operative are still experience low food production owning to some distributing factors, as it associated being studied.<br/>1.     High financial commitment in the formation of the agricultural co-operative of different size and types.<br/>2.     Members neglecting their obligations, participating in-group farm work in the farmland weeding, planting, harvesting and marketing of farm produce.<br/>3.     Procurement of farm inputs like high yielding seeds, stem and seeding, agro-chemical disinfectants and fertilizer.<br/>4.     Problems of marketing of produce and efficiently distribution and returns to inputs utilized.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>In food production the study is aimed all examining the role of Agriculture Co-operative food production so as to benefit members and the society as a whole.  The purposes of this study are:<br/>i.      To identify the factor that can cause low food production in agriculture co-operative in (Enugu) North.<br/>ii.      To investigate whether problem identified are associated with the agriculture co-operative society.<br/>iii.     To investigate the farms of supports and incentives provided by the government to the agriculture co-operatives if there are any.<br/>iv.     To find out the ways and methods that can be used in solving the problems of low food productivity.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>To achieve the purpose or objectives of this study the following research questions were formulated.<br/> i.      What are the causes of the low food production among agriculture co-operative in Enugu North Local Government Area?<br/>ii.      To what extent are the problem identified applied or associated with the agriculture co-operative societies being studied?<br/>iii.     Do agricultural co-operative receive incentives from the government?<br/>iv.     What form does the incentives from government take?<br/>v.     What are the ways/methods that can afford possible solutions to the problems of low food production?<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The findings of this research work will enable the society to know what to do in order to improve or enhance the economic activities of the society.  This research work will equally help the Federal government whose set objective is to use co-operative in rural development and increasing the production capacity of the country.<br/>The producer of agricultural products will also benefit because their effective production will be assured through the effective and efficient management of the agricultural co-operatives in food production and there will be an increase in food supply and production in the country thereby leading to a fall in price of goods.  When this is achieved, the consumers and the general public will benefit.<br/>When there is an efficient and effective management of agricultural produce in food production, the co-operative societies especially the rural based ones, it will help in development recommendations of this research work will also be of great benefit to other co-operative societies in the country as it well served as reference material from them.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.     Enterprise<br/>This is institution of businesses that perform services and provides good for its members.<br/>2.     Integration<br/>This is the act and measure towards influencing the level of enlightenment, understanding and consequently, personal emotional feeling of the member towards co-operative in a positive direction.<br/>3.     Patronage Refunds<br/>These are special rights accrued to members in terms of surplus in

primary and secondary data were collected and the data were then presented, analyzed interpreted using textual, tables etc.  Base on the above, it was found out that no genuine co-operative would do without the co-operative principles.  The negligence over the principles of co-operative had made the co-operative principles societies no to function the way it ought to in carrying out the performance of co-operative societies. Through the application of the principle, interpretation of the principles should be well known to members.  It should not be ignored.  Members of the co-operative should show concern to the principles of co-operatives. A copy of the co-operatives law should be made open and well understand by the members. Constant supervision is important in order to keep the society going.  There is every tendency to teach and education the members an co-operatives education. With reference to the finding, the researcher recommends the above solution to the applying in co-operative organization and with that there should be increase in quantity in those societies. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER   ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION                                          <br/>1.1    Background of the Study                                      <br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem                             <br/>1.3    Objective of the Study                                 <br/>1.4    Research Questions                                             <br/>1.5    Significant of the Study                                        <br/>1.6    Delimitation of Study                                    <br/>1.7    Definition of the Terms                                 <br/>CHAPTER   TWO<br/>2.0    Literature Review                                                <br/>2.1    Nature of co-operative Societies                    <br/>2.2    Evolution of Co-operative Principle                 <br/>2.3    Voluntary and Open membership and Democratic     Member Control                                          <br/>2.4    Member Economic Participation                     <br/>2.5    Autonomy and Independence                                <br/>2.6    Education, Training and Information               <br/>2.7    Co-operation among Co-operative                  <br/>2.8    Concern for Community                                        <br/>2.9    Important of Principle                                  <br/>2.10  Problem of Co-operative Principle                  <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    Research Design and Methodology                         <br/>3.1    Research Design                                          <br/>3.2    Area of Study                                                     <br/>3.3    Population of the Study                                        <br/>3.4    Sample Size                                                       <br/>3.5    Sources of Data                                          <br/>3.6    Method of Data Collection                             <br/>3.7    Administration of Instrument                         <br/>3.8    Method of Data Analysis                                       <br/>3.9    Test of Hypothesis                                               <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0    Presentation, Analysis and Interpretation of Data<br/>4.1    Presentation of Data                                    <br/>4.2    Analysis of Data                                          <br/>4.3    Interpretation of Data                                  <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>5.0    Summary of Findings, Conclusion and Recommendation <br/>5.1    Summary of Findings                                           <br/>5.2    Conclusion                                                          <br/>5.3    Recommendation                                                <br/>Reference <br/>Appendix <br/>CHAPTER   ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/> Co-operative refers to as the autonomous association of persons united voluntary to meet their common economic social and cultural needs and aspiration through jointly owned and democratically. Controlled enterprise is traced cooperative include non-profit community organization and businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use its services such as consumer cooperative by the people who work there (workers cooperative) or by the people who live there that is a housing cooperative.   The various government and cooperative superior have made some series of an attempt to encourage the revisions of co-operative laws and regulations, encouraging the public to form and join co-operative.<br/>A co-operative principles are guidelines by which co-operative put their values into values. It is as well referred to the basic truth and general law determining the existence and regulating the conduct of an organization and distinguishing it from other system.  The International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) described them as norms that should prevail in the co-operative regardless of what they do and where they exist.<br/>        Meanwhile these are the principles guiding the co-operatives otherwise known as the co-operative principles.<br/>Rochdale Principle In 1944<br/>The organized a successful consumer co-operative society though it was accepted before that of 1966, which was as a result of amendment.<br/>International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) <br/>This is a non-governmental association – whose function is to unite represents and serves co-operatives worldwide.  The ICA purposes were to promote co-operatives and the  Organisation was founded in London in 1885 for twelve countries – Argentina, India, USA and nine European countries.  The headquarters was transferred from London to Geneva, Suitzerland in 1982 to give co-operation a more international partisan image.<br/>The ICA produces a new constitution Tokyo in 1992.  According to article 2 of the constitution (RIC Vol. 852 and 3, 127), the ICA pursue its objective by serving as a forum for exchange of experience and a source of information on co-operatives.<br/>Mr. Owen, the Philanthropist, from 1771-1859 treated  his workers with respect and humility.  He paid their wages, reduces their hours of work, kept his factory clean, put a stop to child’s labour, and started school for workers children.  He opened the first Nursery school in Europe.  He allowed his workers leisure hour for games and recreation.  He used part of his welfare for his workers.  In believing that people work best if they are healthy and happy, he was based on capitalist<br/>Willian King (1786 – 1965), he was a medical practitioner in Brighton, an Urdent co-operator and a follower of Robert Owen.  William King made some corrections from Robert Owen’s system.  <br/>Willams advised workers against Owens utopian home colonization schemes, which he considered too big, too capital, intensive, too unmanageable.  People accepted William’s corrections and organized in Britain co-operative shops from William’s idea.  They tried very well before the Rochdale pioneers which came up in 1844, a group of 28 workers.  They opened up a retail co-operative shop based on sound idea and correct business practice.  They adopted the correct principle and omitted the wrong one.  They started with pre-member education based on weekly discussion meetings lasting several months.  Members made some contributions.  The pioneers were men of practical common sense, not idle dreamers.  They had their dreams to become their masters.  They kept strict account of every transaction and declared their balance sheet quarterly.  This method led them to success and they became a model for co-operatives all over the world.  After this, came the ICA principle, which is the latest up to date.  There are some amendments done from Rochdale principle, which was used for the ICA 1995 latest principle, which took place in Vienna Austria.<br/>1.2    THE STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The major point of this study is to examine the performance of co-operative societies through the application of co-operative principles with the purpose of the following:<br/>-       TO ascertain the co-operative societies that apply the co-operative principles <br/>-       To examine the extent of enhancement the cooperative principles has undergone in different cooperative societies.<br/>Moreover to raise the cooperative awareness on the importance and necessary of the application of cooperative principles.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The researcher intends to find out how the co-operative principles are being applied in co-operative societies and the factors that are

At this points, co-operative were restricted to serve only the purposes of the paymaster (the white man).  Co-operatives then were not allowed to grow or expand into the hinter lands.<br/>        In Nigeria, the first hint on co-operative emergence occurred during the first World War.  This co-operative which happended to be a consumer co-operative was, modeled the Rochdala of England home of the colonialist.  These early co-operative societies existed to ratio out goods, which were very scared during the World War and died a natural death sown after the World War.<br/>        Therefore, in 1926, the then colonial Agricultural ministry began organizing cocoa formers around Abeokuta and Ibadan in Western Nigeria to market their product especially to Europe where the colonical masters needed tit for their home industries.  This was also the patterned development of co-operative in British colonies.  After this experiment, the Western region of Nigeria embraced co-operative, especially marketing types.<br/>        The Agricultural ministry continued to maintain control and supervision over these Western co-operative societies.  Emboldened by this sequence in co-operative acceptance in the West and the attendant success of the marketing co-operatives which had translated into more raw material for parent companies in Europe, the colonial master appointed Mr, F. C. Strickland to go and understudy the success story of cocoa marketing co-operative in the western region, with a view to enacting co-operative law.  For three month December 1933 to March 1934 – Mr. Strickland carried out spot assessment.<br/>        In this report, Mr. strickland’s report no doubt kick started the co-opeartive activities in Nigeria. On return to Nigeria the first thing he did was to recognize the cocoa farmer societies, who were already excelling in the production and marketing of the best quality cocoa.  Next was to bring these societies under the umbrella of the co-operative law.<br/>        The co-operative societies ordinance No. 39 of 1935 was signed into law by the king of England on 3rd December, 1935 and the regulations approved into force on the 6th February, 1936 from a humble beginning in 1926, co-operative rose to an astonishing of 181 in 1944.<br/>        In 1951 the political landscape of Nigeria changed and every nation under Nigeria was allowed to develop under regions, so co-operatives went the same way West East and North.<br/>        A co-operative is an association of persons who have voluntary came together to achieve a common and through making equitable contribution to the capital required and accepting a fair share of risk.<br/>        It is an undertaking in which members actively participate.  A co-operative is an owner enterprise meaning that members are at the same time the owners and the users of the goods and the facilities provided.<br/>        In 1980, the institution of Management and Technology (IMT) multipurpose co-operative was formed.  It was registered immediately with 36 members.  Many people joint the co-operative in order to save their money and also with the aim of borrowing soft loans from the society.  The chairman of the society when it was registered was Mr. S. Eze structure laboratory <br/>1.2            Purpose of the Study: <br/>Co-operative Society is a dynamic and viable business set-up, it has unique ideologies that under bind the movement and distinguishes them from other form of business.<br/>However, it should be viable in order to carry her duties and responsibility very effective and efficiently.<br/>The purpose of the study are as follows:<br/>i)             To create a sound form or ways or steps of organizing a viable co-operative society.<br/>1.3           Background of the Study:<br/>Co-operative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a joint owned and democratically controlled enterprise.<br/> Organizing a viable co-operative societies enables the society to last long and function effectively and efficiently.  Co-operative itself started from creation.  In fact, co-operative is as old as man.  One Igbo-man has a proverb which buttress this more, “when a man is in difficulty, he seeks for help from another but when animal is, she cannot turn to another.”<br/> In organization a viable co-operative society, there are (10) Ten steps which one must or have to follow before its/her society will be viable.<br/>These very (10) Ten steps are short listed in the Nigerian Co-operative Society’s Decree of 1993.  By Osita Obodoechi on the Cobwebs of Co-operation, 2002, P; 2.<br/>1.4   THEORITICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY.<br/>During the colonial days, the seed of Co-operation was sown but it could only grow slowly.  At this point, co-operative were restricted to serve only the  interest of the paymaster (the white man).  Co-operatives, then, were not allowed to grow or expand to the hinterlands.<br/> In Nigeria, the first hint on co-operative emergency occurred during the 1st world war.  This Co-operative, which happen to be a consumer was modeled along the Rochdale of England, home of the colonialist.  This earliest co-operative society existed to reform out consumer goods which was very scarce during the world war.  Soon after the war ended, the consumer co-operative died a natural death.  It is said that there are many co-operatives in Enugu state which has encountered natural death due to one problem or the other.<br/>Thus, any co-operative society that is viable will not experience natural death.  But can only shake not death.  This problem might be due to lack of adequate management, fraud, lack of training, lack of truthfulness (uncelleurity), not following the appropriate steps, etc.<br/>However, co-operatives ought to be viable mother to carry-out her obligation effectively and efficiently.<br/>1.5     Research Question.<br/>i.             Who is a co-operator?<br/>ii.            What is co-operative?<br/>iii.          Classification of Co-operatives.<br/>iv.          Structures of Co-operatives.<br/>v.           Motives for joining Co-operatives.<br/>vi.          Factors which affect the formation of Co-operatives.<br/>vii.        The viable steps in forming Co-operative societies.<br/>1.6            Significant of Study<br/>This project work enables the society to know that viable co-operatives will help to improve the economic activities of the country or society.  This research work will help equally the federal government to improve the societies, since it is the aim of the federal government to register co-operative societies.<br/> By so doing, other unviable co-operative will benefit from it. Viability will benefit of co-operative is an indispensable element/feature in co-operative development which should not be under rated.<br/>The Ten (10) steps stipulates the best way for any co-operative  to be viable as long as she wants to be.<br/>  <br/>\n\nHOW TO ORGANIZE A \r\nVIABLE CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY; <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HOW TO ORGANIZE A \r\nVIABLE CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY; ", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ACHIEVING SUSTINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION IN ENUGU STATE THROUGH EFFECTIVE STORAGE AND MAREKTIGN SYSTEMS <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research work was carried out mainly to look with the ways of achieving sustainable food production in Enugu state through effective storage and marketing system.

Therefore, for this reason most of the early government’s efforts to develop the countries agriculture were based on export of cash crops like palm produce, cassava, cocoa, rubber and groundnut. This effort were largely in terms of marketing board which were set up to handle all major export crops except rubber and in terms of research institutes for agronomic research into the cooperative especially in the area where lack of meaningful or adequate policy toward food produce was inherited by the nations successive administration after independence. Due to the nation’s lackadaisical attitude, there were storage of both food and the exportation of the domestic crops as it is being experience today, it is the realization of the need to set up the production of cash crop to meet the home or internal demand and export the surplus that prompted the government to change course from their laissez-fair attitude to more directed agricultural policies. Operation feed the nations programmers was an extension based production. Prior to 1973, when oil emerged as the leading sector of Nigeria economy. Agriculture was the main stay as it constituted the major source of employment, government revenue and foreign exchange. It is obvious that agriculture and marketing activities have ensure constant food on the dinning tables of Nigeria families who would gone as a result of starvation; this is because it is n area in which the nation possesses considerable comparative advantages especially through commercial farmer.<br/>        The second decade (1970-1980) of the post independence period in Nigeria witnessed a considerable aggregate of food production, storage and marketing problems brought about by a relative high rate of growth (about 1.5% rev alum) in production storage and or the production side they were those fundamental problems arising from farm resources constraints which caused some families to face the problem of malnutrition especially labour and capital, poor production technology, poor storage facilities and marketing systems. There were, however additional impediment to food production arising from the residual effect of civil war was severe drought that followed (1972-1974). The effect of widening domestic food supply demand gap was reflected in rising food supply demand gap also reflected in rising food prices and an increase food import bill. (Information bal, F.M.A Lagos 1984) in response to the high alarming storage and marketing problem of farmer in Udim. It is domed fit to proffer solution and ensure sustainable food production while the dread disease in farming system of the group directly other would be affected also, and if government understands this critical study, the issues of decrease in the food production will become a history in Nigeria. If the Government should create enabling environments for the farmers with the view of facilitating increase I agricultural produce provision of necessary irrigation system, creation of land availability, establishment of marketing board for the farmer are very necessary and they should educate the marketers on how to store and market their produce finance the farmers by given them loans, grants and always paying attention to the farmers, it will ensure sustainable food production not only in Enugu state sustainable (Nkanu) but in Nigeria as a whole.<br/> 1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>In agricultural produce, farmers and marketers pass through critical problems, especially on escalating lack of storage and marketing strategies to preserve and market available produce, this is precarious that farmers and marketers labour tirelessly in drain almost every season. During the harvesting periods, the farmers have abundance produce, pest and insects damages their farm yield in the area where those produce are being marketed. Economic pollution, tax force, armed rubbery including accidents possess stumbling bode to the nooks and cranny’s of the state. At times, the farmers are forced to sell their produce bellow the prevailing market price because they cannot afford to preserved it, to sell at a better price during the time of scarcity. It is a vivid fact that when there is plenteous harvest, the farmers uses it quickly, wastefully as a result of lack of adequate facilities that will enable them to sale subsequently at their own most advantages. In considering the above philosophies, I come across with the under listed question with a views of ascertaining what the storage and marketing problems of farm produce are in Nkanu West Local Government Area, Enugu state.<br/>1)    What are the storage and marketing incentives and other material and human resources that farmers and marketers need for ideal storage and supplying of their product?<br/>2)    Does government render storage and marketing help to the produces and marketers of consumable items, or does it mean that their concern is insufficient?<br/>3)    Is it that there is management inefficiency of the produce available resource or the marketing board?<br/>4)    What are the estimated costs of securing storage facilities and marketing environment, can poor farmers afford it?   <br/>5)    Are the storage and marketing systems and other supporting services they should have utilized available or not or is it adulate?<br/>6)    What are the likely benefits of the farmers and marketing of their produce and their possible losses for poor storage and marketing systems?<br/> 1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>In a wider sense, the reason for this study is to identify and determine a way to achieve sustainable food production in Enugu state through effective and marketing system specifically. These are the objective of the study:<br/>a)    To determine the factors that can lead to decline in rate of sufficient food production.<br/>b)    To investigate the various factors facing the farmers in adoption of the new innovations.<br/>c)    To determine the factors that can lead to decline in rate of sufficient food production.<br/>d)    To access storage and marketing problems which adversely affect the productivities of farmer’s marketers in Nkanu West Local Government Area of Enugu state?<br/>e)    To check the level of storage and marketing infrastructural facilities.<br/>f)     Facilities available to the producer and marketers in the area of study.<br/>g)    To ascertain the adverse effect of pest and insects on the stored produce as well as government policies on marketing of those produce.<br/>h)    To access the farmers and marketers level of education and ability to store and market their produce.<br/>i)      To make possible findings and recommendations on low to improve storage and marketing strategies to span of the available food ensure adequate and sustainable food production in the study area and Enugu state at large.<br/> 1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>In order to be focused on reaching the destination of this study, the research work is carried out with the following questions.<br/>a)    What are the storage and marketing systems of the farmers/marketers in Nkanu West Local Government Area Enugu state?<br/>b)    In what ways has the system yielded sufficient production?<br/>c)    Have commendable efforts been made to help and promote the effectiveness of the farmers and marketers and on what efforts?<br/>d)    Are these efforts above the reach of the farmers and marketers?<br/>e)    What are the roles played by the government in helping to actualized sustainable food production?<br/>f)     What is the management related procedures adopted by the farmers and marketers in storing or selling their products?<br/>g)    Are there any storage and marketing problems envisaged on the process of production and marketing particularly in Nkanu west?<br/>h)    What are the necessary economic, political and social effects experienced on the process of production and marketing.<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>As this study is emphasis on the ways of achieving sustainable food production in Enugu state through effective storage and marketing system, it will be preferred to the multifarious storage problems unapplied and making system to achieving sustainable food production in the area of study.<br/>    The farmers and marketers will be enlightened with the ways out of their storage and marketing problems. Government would be challenged on the other hand to intervene over the impending danger of sleeping over the study; its outcome will not only serve as a reference material but also, would pass a pillar upon which a more articulated Agricultural and marketing sectors polices is built. The study is also very significant to the researcher as its successful completion is a precondition for the award of college Diploma certificate.<br/>1.6       DEFINITIONS OF TERMS<br/>Sustainable: This is one of the predominant words in<br/>this research study which are used to measure sustaining act of eating food to sustain life/energy (continuous food supply/production).<br/>Productivity: This is a measure of the efficiency of<br/>production. It is the ratio of productivity deals with the large or minimum quantity of output of the farmers and the companies which is offered for sale to the target market which can be bought by the marketing intermediary and the consumers.<br/>Effective Storage System: This is a procedure which<br/>is used to pool the life span of the available food products by the farmers and food productive industries in order to resale at their most advantageous period to maximize profit. This effective storage system always helps when there is abundance of farm produce to keep the farm produce till the period of scarcity.<br/>Suppliers: This is described as an important link in the<br/>companies over all customers values delivery system that provide the resources needed by the producer to produce its goods and services. They deals with the raw materials which need further processing before consumption. <br/>L.G.A: This is local government area which implies the<br/>geographical location where the research study are being conducted; it is used suffix to Nkanu West Local Government Area and some occasions written in full to express the same purpose.<br/> <br/>\n\nACHIEVING SUSTINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION IN ENUGU STATE THROUGH EFFECTIVE STORAGE AND MAREKTIGN SYSTEMS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ACHIEVING SUSTINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION IN ENUGU STATE THROUGH EFFECTIVE STORAGE AND MAREKTIGN SYSTEMS ", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING CO-OPERATIVE LAWS <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT, INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY) <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research work is focused on the study of critically the origin, reasons, importance and the problems affecting the co-operative laws.

L aw started as far back as the origin of man even the bible.  The fall of man in the biblical context is those that neglect the law as far back as the time of Noah and the Ark, and many people in the Bible up till date.<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Co-operative law are those legislative enactment aimed at regulating and directing the activities of Co-operative Societies.  It guides the ruling, formation of co-operative enterprises, so that it enables their activities to be stable, effective and efficient for the successful operation of a given co-operative society.<br/> The Co-operative originated in Nigeria in 1935 under the NO. 39 Ordinance, while the rules follows in 1936.  Both applied the rules follows in 1936.  Both applied to the whole locating, then colony and protectorate of Nigeria.  In 1952, the country was divided into 3 regions, North, West and East and co-operative was made a regular subject.  Each adapted the 1935 ordinance with necessary amendments.  In August, 1977, the then Federal Commissioner for Co-operative and Supply, Alhaji U.A Mutallh, set up a panel  to review and unite the Nigeria co-operative society laws and rules with J.T Catlow Idowu as chairman.  It was General J.B Babangida at the face end of Military rule, decided to sign the draft into a decree, the Nigerian Co-operative Societies Decree No. 90 of 1993.  Being a federal law which superseded all other laws of co-operative society in Nigeria.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>Law generally is seen as a legal enactment to guide the co-operative societies and other societies.  The law is meant to guide the affairs of any co-operative societies sometimes problems will arise.  But it is the duty of the director of co-operative society to appoint an arbitrator or go by himself to settle the disputes.  The directors will appoint an arbitrator to look upon the matter in other to settle the case amicably.   Co-operative should not go to court to settle their disputes because they are not a business enterprises that are dash off to court seeking for justice.  The reason for the exclusion of court is that court cases are expensive and time consuming and often create bitterness. If the co-operative societies go to court their capital will be clearned off and their capital and business suffers due to time constraints on issue not involving the co-operative business.  And so, court cases are deemed time wasting, expensive  and often create bad blood.  If co-operative should go to court their business may be brought to and end or half.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>The motive behind this project is to undertake a study of a critical assessment of the important of studying co-operative laws and rules.<br/>-          To examine the impact of the co-operative law in every co-operative establishment.<br/>-          To examine the law meant for co-operative establishment.<br/>-          To know the limit provided by the law that differentiates it from other terms of business.<br/>-          To suggest ways and means of enhancement.<br/>-          To know that there is provision in the law of co-operative that every registered society must have their bye-laws.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>The following were asked by the researcher duly the period of carrying the research work.<br/>1.     What are the important of law in any society?<br/>2.     Do the students in co-operative economic and management department recognize law?<br/>3.     Do the co-operative members go to court when there is dispute in their midst?<br/>4.     Who settle the dispute in co-operative society?<br/>5.     What are the requirements needed to one to be members of cooperative society.<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>With the above project been carved out by the researcher, the society will get to know and understand that co-operative laws and rules will help to improve the economic activities of the society.  Since it is the federal government that enact the law in which co-operative must follow. Co-operative law is a vital element in co-operative development which should not be under-rated. The law should discriminate between full – rigid genuine co-operative, pseudo co-operative and pre-co-operatives. The law stipulates that all the co-operative should be registered and it must be reformed to reduce federal government control so that a true co-operative movement will emerge.  Co-operative law should take legislative cognizance’s of the higher-class, co-operatives and invest them will freedom to take their own decisions.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Co-operative:<br/>According to OBODOECHI (2002, P. 26), defined Co-operative “as the process of man working in consonance with another to attain a positive result.”   Co-operative entails man in a social frame working, striving to accomplish:<br/>a)    Religious result<br/>b)    Economic result<br/>c)    Political result<br/>d)    Cultural result<br/>e)    Ethnical result<br/>f)     Educational result.<br/>LAW:<br/>These are legislative enactment aimed at regulating and directing the activities of the people.<br/>RULES:<br/>These are rules made by the Director exercised by him, given to him by Section 54 of the law.<br/>AMALGAMATION:<br/>This is the coming together of two or more co-operative societies lawfully to create a new co-operative society by loosing their old identities and become a new co-operatives.<br/>DISPUTES:<br/>This is the quarrel that arises in the society which affects the business activities of the society.<br/>SUBCHARGE:<br/>This is the power to demand payment of money stolen from co-operative society.<br/>ATTACHMENT:<br/>The authority to seize goods.<br/>PRINCIPLE:<br/>This is a bear truth or general law determining the existence and regulating the conduct of an organization and distinguishing it from other system.<br/>EQUITY:<br/>This is a manner in which members are compensated for their involvement  in the co-operative.<br/><br/>\n\nA CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPORTANCE \r\nOF STUDYING CO-OPERATIVE LAWS \r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPORTANCE \r\nOF STUDYING CO-OPERATIVE LAWS \r\n", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>INCREASING AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT  THROUGH THE ACTIVITIES OF COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN ENUGU STATE<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN ENUGU EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The research work on “Increasing Agricultural output through the activities of cooperative societies in Enugu state using Agricultural cooperative in Enugu East Local Government as a case study was carried out to survey the task programmes and policies constituted by government to mobilize peasant farmers into agricultural cooperative and the functional ones more productive as a way of facilitating the attainment of self sufficiency in agricultural output. <br/>        The constraints that affect the achievement of the objectives of those agriculture cooperatives and how it affect agricultural cooperative on Enugu East Local Government Area was identified.  The includes use of crude oil method of farming implements, poor members education and high level of illiteracy among members, inadequate storage facilities and marketing outlet, individualism among Nigeria, leading to unwillingness to pool resources, lack of cooperative and excessive control of government initiative and direction.<br/>        Finally, to control these constraints improve and adequate coordinate have to be put in place between the state and local government authorities.

Work has been carried out tin the state and a lot of research is expected to be carried out; which give rise to this research work. In this direction, much attention has been paid to the neglect and reason to the non preferences of selected agricultural and co-operative societies in Enugu East Local government area of Enugu State.<br/>        A report written in 1982 by Somtochukwu on the Enugu state food journal, states that agricultural cooperative here produced a number of work forces, mostly in the rural area had has equally contributed in the area of solid food production both for man and animals.  Agriculture was the main source of earning in Enugu state in the societies.
