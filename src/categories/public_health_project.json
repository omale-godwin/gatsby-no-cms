Bacillus thuringiensis which is one of the most effective biolarvacide for control of species of mosquitoes and monitoring of larval susceptibility is essential to avoid resistance development. Mosquito larvacidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis was assessed by isolating them from ecologically different soil habitats in and around Enugu metropolis. The isolate organisms were confirmed as Bacillus thuringiensis based on biochemical characterization and microscopic observation. The larvacidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis isolates was tested against the larval of mosquito by using the standard cup bioassay.

Today it is the most successful commercial xenobiotic with its worldwide application when compared with the chemical pesticides; Bacillus thuringiensis has the advantages of being biologically degradable, selectively active on pests and less likely to cause resistance. Safety of Bacillus thuringiensis formulations for humans, beneficial animals and plants explains the replacement of chemical pesticides in many countries with these environmentally friendly pest control agents. <br/>Bacillus thuringiensis was first isolated by the Japanese Scientist Ishiwata (1901) from skilkworm larvae, bombyxmori, exhibiting sotto disease. After 10 years, Berliner (1911) isolated the square gram (+) positive, spore-forming, rod shaped soil bacterium from disease flour moth larvae, Anngasta Kachmiccalla, in the Thuringia region of the Germany and named it as Bacillus thuringiensis. <br/>In the early 1930s Bacillus thuringiensis was used against Ostrinianubilis, the European corn borer. The first commercial product was available in 1938 in France, with the trade name sporeine (Weiser, 1986). It was Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies Kurstaki that was used for the control of the insect (Lepidopteran) pests in agriculture and forestry (Luthy &amp; Ebersold, 1981). New commercial products arrived in 1980s after the discovering of subspecies thuringiensis opened the gate for black fly and mosquito larvae control. <br/>Like all organisms, insect are susceptible to infection by pathogenic microorganisms, many of these infections agents have a narrow host range and therefore, do not cause uncontrolled destruction of beneficial insects and are not toxic to vertebrates. Bacillus thuringiensis is a major microorganism, which shows entamopathogenic activity (Glazer &amp; Nikaido, 1995, Schnepf, et al. 1998) which forms parasporal crystals during the stationary phase of its growth cycle. <br/>Most Bacillus thuringiensis preparations available on the market contain spores with parasporal inclusion bodies composed of δ – endotoxins. In commercial production, the crystals and spores obtained from fermentation are concentrated and formulated for spray on application according to conventional Agriculture practices (Baum, Kakefuda, &amp; Gawron-Burke, 1996). There are many strains of Bacillus thuringiensis having insecticidal activity against insect order (eg Lepidoptera, Diptera, Homoptera, Mollaphage, Coloptera). Only a few of them have been commercially developed. <br/>Bacillus thuringiensis insecticides are divided into three groups, group one has been used for the control of lepidopterans. These groups of insecticides are formulated with Bacillus thuringiensis Subspecies. Kurstaki, group two contains thesandiego and tenebrionis strains of Bacillus thuringiensisand has been applied for the control of certain celopterans and their larvae. Group three contains the Israelensis strains of Bacillus thuringiensis which has been used to control black flies and mosquitoes.</p> <p><em><strong>CRYSTAL COMPOSITION AND MORPHOLOGY</strong></em><br/>The existence of parasporal inclusions in Bt was first noted I 1915 (Berliner 1915) but their protein composition was not delineated until the 1950s (Angus 1954). Hannay (1953) detected the crystalline fine structure that is a property of most of the parasporal inclusion. Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies can synthesize more than one inclusion, which may contain different ICPs. ICPs have been called data endotoxins; however since the term endotoxin usually refers to toxin associated with the other membranes of gram-negative bacteria, comprising a core lipopoly saccharide. Depending on their ICP composition, the crystals have various forms (bipyramidal, cuboidal, flat rhomboid, or a composition with two or more crystal types. A partial correlation between crystal morphology, ICP composition, and bioactivity against target insects has been established (Bulla et al.1977). Hofte and Whitely, 1989, Lynch and Baumman, 1985).</p> <p><em><strong>GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF BACILLUS THURINGLENSIS</strong></em><br/>Bacillus thuringiensis is a member of the genes Bacillus and like the other members of the taxon, has the ability to form endospores that are resistant to inactivation by heat, desiccation and organic solvent. The spore formation of the organism varies from terminal to subterminal in sporangia that are not swollen, therefore, Bacillus thuringiensis resembles other members of Bacillus species in morphology and shape (Stahly, Andrews, &amp; Yousten, 1991). The organism is gram-positive and facultitative anaerobes. The shape of the cells of the organism is rod. The size when grown in standard liquid media varies 3 – 5um. <br/>The most distinguishing features of Bacillus thuringiensis from other closely related Bacillus species. (eg Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus. cereus) is the presence of the parasporal crystal body that is near to the spore outside the exosporangium during the endospore formation, which is shown in figure 1:1 (Andrews, Bibilops, &amp; Bulla, 1985; Andrews, Faust, Wabiko, Raymond, &amp; Bulla, 1987; Bulla, Faust, Andrews, &amp; Goodma, 1995). Bacillus thuringiensis is an insecticide producing variant of Bacillus cereus (Gordon, Haynes, &amp; Pang, 1973) several Bt species also produce Bacillus cereus type enterotooxin (Carlson, &amp; Kolsto, 1993) plasmids coding for the insecticidal toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis have been transferred into B. cereus to make it a crystal producing variant of Bacillus thuringiensis(Gonzalez, Brown, Carlton, 1982) molecular methods including genomic restriction digestion analysis and 16 rRNA sequence comparison support that Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus are closely relocated species and they should be considered as a single species (Carlson, Caugant, &amp; Kolstra, 1994; Ash , Farrow, Dorsch, Stackebrandt, &amp; Collins. 1991; Helgason et al.2000).</p> <p><em><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS SUBSPECIES</strong></em><br/>The classification of Bacillus thuringiensis based on the serological analysis of the flagella antigens was introduced in the early 1960s (de Barjac &amp; Bonnefoi, 1962). This classification by serotype has been supplemented by morphological and biochemical criteria (de Barjac, 1981). Clutill (1977), explains that only 13 Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies were toxic to lepidopteran Larva only. And apparently Nematode (Narva et; al., 1991) enlarged the host range and markedly increased the number of subspecies up to the end of 1998, over 67 subspecies based on flagella H – Serovars had been identified.</p> <p><em><strong>ECOLOGY AND PREVALENCE OF BACILLUS THURINGRENSIS</strong></em><br/>Although our knowledge about Bacillus thuringiensis occurs naturally and it can also be added to an ecosystem artificially to control pest, prevalence of Bacillus thuringiensis in nature can be said as “natural” and can be isolated when there is no previous record of application of the organism for pest control. <br/>The Bacillus thuringiensis which belong to artificial habitat areas are sprayed based insecticides (mixture of spores and crystal). (Stahly et al. 1991). Thus, it is obvious that Bacillus thuringiensis is widespread in nature. However, the normal habitat of the organism is soil. The organism grows naturally as asaprophyle, feeding on dead. Organic matter, therefore, the spores of Bacillus thuringiensis persist in soil and its vegetative growth occurs when there is nutrient available. Moreover Bacillus thuringiensis has recently been isolated from marine environments (Maeda et al. 2000) and from soil of Antarctica also (Foresty &amp; Logan 2000). <br/>However the true role of the bacteria is not clear. Although it produces parasporal crystal inclusions that are toxic to many orders of insects, some species of Bacillus thuringiensis from diverse environments show no insecticidal activity. The insecticidal activities of Bacillus thuringiensis are rare in nature. For example, Iriarte et al.(2000) reported that there is no relationship between mosquito breeding sites and pathogenic action level of Bacillus thuringiensis in the surveyed aquatic habitats. While another study suggested that habitat with a high density of insect were originated by the pathogenic action of this bacterium (Itoqou Apoyolo et al.1995).</p> <p><em><strong>OTHER PATHOGENIC FACTORS OF BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS</strong></em><br/>At the period of the active growth cycle, the strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce extracellular compounds; this compound might yield to virulence. These extracellular compounds include proteases, chitinases phospholipases, and vegetative conseticidal protein (Zhang et al. 1993; Sohneff et al. 1998). <br/>Bacillus thuringrensis also produces antibiotics compounds having antifungal activity (stab et al. 1994). However the crystal toxins are more effective then these extracellular compounds and allow the development of the bacteria in dead insect larvae. <br/>Bacillus thuringiensis strains also produce a protease, which is called inhibitor. This protein attacks and selectively destroys cecropiris and attacisis which are antibacterial proteins in insects, as a result of this, the defence response of the insect collapses. This protease activity is specific, it attacks an open hydrophobic region near C – terminus of the cecropin and it does not attack the globular proteins (Duthambar &amp; Steiner, 1984). <br/>Other important insecticidal proteins which are unrelated to crustal proteins are vegetative insecticidal protein. These proteins are produce by some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis during vegetative growth.</p> <p><em><strong>MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS</strong></em><br/>Colony forms can help to distinguish Bacillus thuringiensis colonies from other Bacillus species. The organism forms white, rough colonies, which spread out and can expand over the plate very quickly. Bacillus thuringiensis strains have unswallon and ellipsoidal spores that lie in the subterminal position. The presence of parasporal crystals that are adjacent to the spore in another cell is the best criteria to distinguish Bacillus thuringiensis from other closely related Bacillus species. The size number, of parasporal inclusion and morphology may vary among Bacillus thuringiensis strains. However, four distinct crystal morphologies are apparently the typical bipyramidal crystal, related to crystal proteins (Aronson et al. 1976). Cuboidal usually associated with bipyramidal crystal (Ohba&amp;Aizawi 1986), amorphous and composite crystals related to cry4 and cry proteins (federicet al. 1990), and flat, square crystal related to cry3 proteins (Hernstadet al. 1986, Lopezmeza &amp; Ibarra, 1996 The classification was based in part on the possession of parasporal bodies. Bernard et al.(1997) isolated 5303 Bacillus thuringiensis from 80 different countries and 2793 of them were classified according to their crystal shape. <br/>Bacillus thuringiensis vary’s based on geographical or environmental location. Each habitat may contain novel Bacillus thuringiensis isolated that have more toxic effects on target insects. Intensive screening programs have been identified Bacillus thuringiensis strain from soil, plant surfaces and stored product dust samples. Therefore many strain collections have been described in the literature, such as Assian (Chak et al. 1994, Ben – Dov et al. 1997, 1999) and Maxican (Bravo et al. 1998). <br/>Therefore the aim of this study is to isolate Bacillus thuringiensis from soil sample and to isolate Bacillus thuringiensis against larva of mosquito or to determine Bacillus thuringiensis against larva of mosquito.</p>\n\nBIOCONTROL POTENTIAL OF BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS ISOLATED FROM SOIL SAMPLES AGAINST LARVA OF MOSQUITO<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BIOCONTROL POTENTIAL OF BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS ISOLATED FROM SOIL SAMPLES AGAINST LARVA OF MOSQUITO", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>HEPATITIS C VIRUS AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AIDS ATTENDING CLINIC</strong></p> </div> <p><strong>(A Case Study Of Unth Itukuozalla)</strong></p> <p>A total of 50 blood (30 pregnant and 20 HIV) samples were obtained from pregnant women and PLWHA attending clinic at UNTH Ituku-ozalla.

HCV is one of several viruses that can cause hepatitis. 'Hepatitis' means inflammation of the liver(Ryan and Ray,2004).It is unrelated to the other common hepatitis viruses (for example, hepatitis A or hepatitis B). HCV is a member of thehepacivirus genus in the familyFlaviviridae. There are at least six distinctly different strains of the virus which have different genetic profiles (genotypes). In the U. S., genotype 1 is the most common form of HCV. Even within a single genotype there may be some variations (genotype 1a and 1b, for example). Genotyping is important to guide treatment because some viral genotype respond better to therapy than others (Wilkins et al. 2009).<br/> According to Hepatitis C NSW (2010), here are some of the things that can happen once the body contract hepatitis C.<br/> The body may deal with hepatitis C of its own accord and you may never get sick.About 25% of all people who contract hepatitis C will clear the infection (although this happen less commonly in people with HIV). For a range of reasons, hepatitis C infection is eradicated from the body in these people, usually within 12 months of having been infected.<br/> Hepatitis C may remain present in the body. About three quarters of people who contract hepatitis C will be chronically infected. This means that they have detectable hepatitis C virus (measured by a PCR test) in their blood for a period of longer than twelve months. People in this group may be at risk of developing liver problems over time.<br/> The genetic diversity of HCV is one reason that it has been difficult to develop an effective vaccine since the vaccine must protect against all genotypes. It is difficult for the human immune system to eliminate HCV from the body, and infection with HCV usually becomes chronic. Over decades, chronic infection with HCV damages the liver and can cause liver failure. Up to 85% of newly-infected people fail to eliminate the virus and become chronically infected. Infection is most commonly detected among people who are 40 to 60 years of age, reflecting the high rates of infection in the 1970s and 1980s. There are 8,000 to 10,000 deaths each year in the U.S. related to HCV infection. HCV infection is the leading cause of liver transplantation in the U.S and is a risk factor for liver cancer.<br/> Most of the signs and symptoms of HCV infection relate to the liver. Less commonly, HCV infection causes conditions outside of the liver. Symptoms are generally mild and vague, including a decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, fever. Headache, muscle or joint pains, and weigh loss.Hepatitis C after many years<br/> becomes the primary cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. About 10–30% of people develop cirrhosis over 30 years (Meisel, et al. 1995).<br/> HCV infection can cause the body to produce unusual antibodies called 'cryoglobulins'. These cryoglobulins cause inflammation of the arteries (vasculitis) which may damage the skin, joints, and kidneys. In addition, these patients may develop Raynaud's phenomenon in which the fingers and toes turn color (white, then purple, then red) and become painful at cold temperatures(Iannuzzella, and Vaglio, 2010).<br/> Two skin conditions, lichen planus and porphyria cutaneatarda, have been associated with chronic infection with HCV. HCV also is associated with B-cell lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system.<br/> Doctors use various tests to determine if a person has hepatitis C. One type of test measures antibodies in the blood, indicating that a person been exposed to HCV; the two most common antibody tests are called ELISA and RIBA. Viral load tests measure how much HCV genetic material is present in the blood; the two most common viral load tests are called PCR and bDNA.<br/> Who to test for hepatitis c virus<br/> According to MMWR (1998) Persons who ever injected illegal drugs,<br/> Persons who were ever on chronic (long-term) hemodialysis;<br/> Persons with persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase level<br/> Persons who were notified that they received blood from a donor who later tested positive for HCV infection;<br/> Persons who received a transfusion of blood or blood components and organ transplant before July 1992; and<br/> Healthcare, emergency medical and public safety workers after needle sticks, or mucosal exposures to HCV-positive blood<br/> Children born to HCV-positive women.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 OBJECTIVES</em></strong><br/> i.

Investigation into the microbial flora of wound began in the late 19th century and since then; improvements in techniques have facilitated the recovery, identification and enumeration of a wide variety of microbial species. Most wounds support relatively stable polymicrobial communities (Bowkler, et.al; 2001) often without signs of clinical infection (Hansson,et al; 1993).<br/> However, potential pathogens may be present and the delicate balance between colonized wound and an infected wound depends on the interplay of complex host and microbial influences (Emmerson, 1998). The development of wound infection has deleterious effect on<br/> patients by causing increased pain, discomfort, inconveniences and can lead to life threatening conditions or even death.<br/> Major challenges encountered with antibiotics in clinical use are resistance to antibiotics which leads eventually to failure of the treatment (Blair 2004). Infectious diseases are known to be treated with herbal remedies throughout the history of mankind; even today, natural substances continue to play a major role in primary health care as therapeutic remedies in many developing countries (Jonathan, et.al; 2007). Over the years, there have been reports of the production of more potent antibiotics e.g. third and fourth generation of cephalosporin by pharmaceutical companies which are not readily available and expensive. Problems of various antibiotics include low efficacy, side effect which has lead investigations into natural and potent antibacterial seeming to be the right step to take. The invasion of pathogenic organism is on the rise as a result, effects are been made to develop antibacterial agent from natural sources for better<br/> therapeutic effect (Gills, 1992). The therapies have drawn the interest of both public and medicinal communities. Current research has been focused on herbal and aromatherapy product. However, a number of their product such as honey has shown therapeutic promise.<br/> The presence in honey of various inhibins as described by (Doid and Dzaio, 1937) has been reported by several investigators. Honey was used to treat infected wound as long as 2000 years ago before bacterial were discovered to be the cause of infection in c.50 AD, Dioscorides described honey as been “good for all rotten and hollow ulcers” (Gunther, 1959). More recently, honey has been reported to have an inhibitory effect to around 60 species of bacterial including aerobes and anaerobes, Gram positive and Gram negative (Molan, 1992). The current prevalence of the therapeutic use of ancient remedies, include honey committee on science and technology.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</em></strong><br/> 1. To determine antibacterial potential of honey.<br/> 2. To investigate the mechanism of antibacterial action of honey.<br/> 3. To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of honey on bacterial isolates from wounds of human beings.<br/> 4.

There are also the urban environments of Gore and Mataura. The rural environment is characterised by the compatibility of land uses, expanses of open space, privacy for inhabitants, a minimum of signage, low background noise levels and a high quality roading network. Commercial and industrial activities are generally located where the environment and landscape can absorb the effects of these activities. Gore is the largest urban environment in the District and it is largely residential in character.</p> <p>It is also characterised by compatibility of land uses, generous open space (including parks and schools), low levels of light spill and low background noise levels. The District centre for retail and commercial activity is situated in Gore. When compared with the balance of the urban environment, the commercial area has increased signage, noise and light levels, larger buildings, and increased traffic and pedestrian activity.Land Use</p> <p>The compatibility of land uses and its ability to absorb the adverse effects of activities is as can be expected for a rural retail/commercial sub-regional centre. The central commercial area however continues to maintain much of the character that it developed in its early years, including a wide main street, continuous building facades, provision of verandas and a high amenity for pedestrians. Areas of industrial activities have higher levels of noise, lighting, heavy vehicle movements, bulk storage of hazardous substances and larger buildings than other parts of the District.Land Use</p> <p>Mataura is the other urban environment within the District, being predominantly industrial in character, resulting in higher noise and odour levels than Gore. Mataura residential areas are somewhat similar to those comparable locations in Gore with the exception of the dominance of industrial activity that is located in Mataura. Smaller settlements (Waikaka, Pukerau and Mandeville) provide rural servicing and residential activities and as such have a wider range of land uses in proximity one to another.Land Use</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF LAND USE ACTIVITIES ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE ENVIRONMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF LAND USE ACTIVITIES ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE ENVIRONMENT", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF URBAN HOUSING (A CASE STUDY OF OWERRI MUNICIPAL)</strong> </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <div>Poor waste management has been a major problem to human existence and it affects both rural and urban areas. Various methods of waste disposal exist and this study assessed the waste man-agement practices among residents of Owerri Municipal, Imo state, Nigeria. It was a descriptive cross sectional study in which a total of 282 residents of Owerri Municipal were selected by multistage sampling technique and studied using self and interviewer administered questionnaires.</div> <div>The results showed that 90% of respondents were aware of waste management while 97.5% had posi-tive attitude towards it. The major types of waste generated from households were food residues (97.1%) and vegetable products (95.4%). Also poor waste management practices among residents include open dumping, practiced by 66.3% of the residents and burning as practiced by 62.4% of respondents. The commonest means of waste transport to final disposal site was by wheel barrow.</div> <div>Gender and educational status of respondents significantly influenced their knowledge, attitude and practice of waste management (p &lt; 0.05). Good waste management is pivotal to sustainable healthy living conditions in any environment. The residents of Owerri need health education, reg-ular supply of refuse collection facilities and designated final dump sites. These will encourage strict adherence to proper and appropriate waste management practices among them.</div>\n\nASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF URBAN HOUSING.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF URBAN HOUSING.", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE PROBLEM OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIAN CITIES (A CASE OF OWERRI MUNICIPAL AREA COUNCIL).</strong> </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong></p> <p>Solid waste management (SWM) in many low- and middle–income countries is sometimes driven by the informal sector. Unfortunately, contributions of the sector to SWM are not acknowledged in many developing countries. This situation often arises from inadequate awareness and lack of advocacy for these development contributions. This article reports on the impact of a study conducted by final year geography undergraduates on the informal waste management sector in Nsukka urban area, Nigeria. The purposes of this exercise were to stimulate development intervention on behalf of the sector to improve perceptions, attitudes and performance; to impart a range of development research skills, and to expose the students to the business opportunities provided by SWM and recycling. Informal waste sector workers and government officials responsible for SWM were interviewed, and some commercial data on recycling operations were collected. Findings of this study indicate that such advocacy initiatives were effective in increasing students’ awareness of opportunities and interest in working in the informal waste sector to promote better SWM and development in Nigeria. Lessons from this university case study are also drawn for other developing countries struggling to achieve the poverty reduction and job creation Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p> <ul><li>“These contributions are also evident in several Nigerian cities (see for example, Adeyemi et al. 2001; Agunwamba 2003; Nzeadibe and Eziuzor 2006; Afon 2007; Imam et al. 2008; Nzeadibe and Iwuoha 2008), although such contributions have tended to be approached from varying viewpoints among the cities. On the other hand, the need to improve the governance of solid waste in Nigeria has been well recognised (see for example, Agunwamba 1998; Federal Ministry of Environment 2000; Ayotamuno and Gobo 2004; Adama 2007; Imam et al. 2008; Nzeadibe et al. 2010). Regrettably, little thought has been given in earlier investigations to advocacy 1 as a strategy for improving the capacity of both the formal and informal waste sectors to deliver better solid waste and resource management (Twebaze 2008; Nzeadibe 2009a). </li> </ul>\n\nTHE PROBLEM OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIAN CITIES.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEM OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIAN CITIES.", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ANALYSIS OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE IN BREWERY INDUSTRY (A CASE STUDY OF CONSOLIDATED BREWERY (33 EXPORT) AWO-OMAMMA IMO STATE) </p> <p><strong><em>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0 INTRODUCTION </em></strong></p> <p>1.1 Background Of The Study<br/>1.2 Statement Of The Problem<br/>1.3 Objective Of The Study<br/>1.4 Significance Of The Study<br/>1.5 Research Questions<br/>1.6 Research Hypotheses<br/>1.7 Limitation Of The Study<br/>1.8 Scope Of The Study<br/>1.9 Definition Of Terms</p> <p><strong><em>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0 LITERATURE REVIEW </em></strong><br/>2.1 Theoretical Background</p> <p>2.2 Definition Of Salesmanship<br/>2.3 Classification Of Salespeople<br/>2.4 Role And Objectives Of Personal Selling<br/>2.5 Characteristics Of Professional Sale People<br/>2.6 Information Gathering Functions Of The Sale People<br/>2.7 Knowledge And Skill Of Sales Persons<br/>2.8 Principles Of Professional Selling</p> <p><strong><em>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY </em></strong><br/>3.1 Research Design<br/>3.2 Population And Determination Of Simple Size Population<br/>3.3 Source Of Data<br/>3.4 Sample Size Calculation<br/>3.5 Method Of Investigation</p> <p>3.6 Questionnaire Distribution<br/>3.7 Method Of Questionnaire Distribution<br/>3.8 Techniques For Data Analysis</p> <p><em><strong>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0 DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS </strong></em><br/>4.1 Data Presentation<br/>4.2 Data Analysis<br/>4.3 Testing Of Hypotheses<br/>4.4 Decision Rule</p> <p><strong><em>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0 SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION</em></strong><br/>5.1 Summary<br/>5.2 Conclusion<br/>5.3 Recommendation<br/>Bibliography<br/>Appendix</p>\n\nANALYSIS OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE IN BREWERY INDUSTRY.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE IN BREWERY INDUSTRY.", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> PARASITOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SOME READY TO EAT FRUITS SOLD </div> <p><strong>(A Case Study Of Oye Emene Enugu State Nigeria )</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Some locally available fruits (garden egg, orange, banana, guava, avocado, pawpaw and pineapple).sold in Oye Emene Enugu, Enugu State was examined for parasitological contamination.

In certain part of the world, fruits are the major dietary staple. Apart from being a rich source of vitamins, and minerals, the production of fruits also contributes significantly to regional and national economics through national and international trade. The term fruit has many different meaning depending on the context.<br/> A fruit is a ripened ovary together with seeds of a flowering plant. Fruits are the means through which flowering plants disseminate seeds (Lewis, 2002).<br/> In cuisine when food items are called “fruits” the term is most often used for those plants fruits that are edible, sweet, and fresh examples are: apples, and oranges.<br/> Fruits are cultivated in areas where the environmental factors are suitable for their growth. Emene in Enugu state is considered one of the areas that have good cultivating land for great yield of fruits and this is done usually during rainy season or use of irrigation during dry season. Irrigation water is achieved by different sources like lake, stream, river, ponds etc. which may be polluted with animal and human feaces. Due to high number of eggs, cyst and larvae of human intestinal parasites present in the waste<br/> water, the use of excreta polluted water is a health risk to both the farmers and the consumers that eat the produce raw and fresh, like apples, guava, pear and mango (Scolf, 1992).<br/> Pollination is a vital part of fruit culture, and in few species, they may develop in the absence of pollination/fertilization, a process known as “parthernocarpy” such fruits are seedless (Mauseth &amp;James 2003). Many foods are botanically fruits, but are treated as vegetables in cooking and food preparations. Examples are: Tomatoes, eggplant, pumpkin and pears etc. (Mcgee and Harold 2004). Ethylene causes ripening in fruits.<br/> There are three types of fruits<br/> 1. Simple fruit<br/> 2. Aggregate fruit and<br/> 3. Multiple fruit<br/> Simple fruit can be either dry or fresh, Example carrot, wheat, tomato, avocado, banana etc.(Schelegel,2002).<br/> The examples of an aggregate fruits are pineapple, bread fruit, etc. some fruits have coat covered with Spikes or hooked burrs, either to prevent themselves from being eaten by animals, using them as dispersal agent. eg. unicorn plant (Heiser and Charles 2003). Many fruits are used to make beverages, such as fruit juice, (orange juice, apple juice, grape juice<br/> etc).or alcoholic beverages, such as wine or brandy. Apples are often used to make vinegar. Mcgee (2004) fruits are contaminated with parasites and some parasite infections which have direct life cycle and do not need an intermediate host to infect a new host are via feacal-orally transmitted parasites. Infections acquired through direct ingestion of infective egg or cyst is intimately linked with level of personal hygiene and sanitation in the community. Factors like the lack of latrine and adequate sewage disposal facilities have been known to contribute to the spread of the infective states of the parasites thereby bringing about a wide spread contamination of foods. Infection can be acquired through contaminated unwashed fingers, insects, circulation of currency and by wind during dry season. Contamination of fruits with eggs and cyst especially those hawked by fruit vendors may also serve as a source of infection to consumers of such fruits items. These parasites includes: entamoeba histolystica, Giardia duodenace, Trichuris trichura, Ascaris Lumbricoides and Benterobius vermiculais. (World Health Organization [WHO],2000).<br/> Amoebiasis is known to cause about 450 million infections per annum in developing countries with an incidence of about 50 million and 100,000 deaths. Giardiais is more common in children and has a world wide prevalence of about 1-30% (Wov and Paterson, 1986). Ascaris is the commonest nematodes of man especially in tropical Africa with a prevalence of about 40% in Enugu State<br/> (Reonthalaer, 1988). And may be as high as 96-100% in the rural community in Enugu State.The resistance capacity of the eggs and cyst of these parasites is a feature of profound influence on the epidemiology.<br/> Eggs of Ascaris can remain viable for up to six years. (Njom,2002). Many people who eat fresh fruit as part of an overall health diet are likely to have reduced risk of some chronic diseases. Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables reduce risk for stroke, diabetes, certain cancers such as (mouth), heart, diseases, developing kidney stone, and decreases bone loss.<br/> Fruit reduces the risk of neural tube defects, spina bifida and anecephaly during fetal development<br/> (Ayer, 2001). Fruits are very important in human consumption especially health wise. Parasites that affect fruits need to be controlled in a proper process in order not to affect those that are of medially important. The major way of selecting the appropriate intervention stops to reduce population to pathogenic microorganism on fruits is to identify sources of contamination and ecology of the pathogens as it is affected by processing practices. Organism like; Samonella, cryptosproridium, cyclospora, Giardia, are among the disease causing organisms that have been transferred via fresh fruits (Sushow, 1997).The use of disinfectant like chlorine, in wash water can also help to prevent both host harvest disease and food borne illnesses.<br/> The evaluation of these medically important parasites found in fruits will depend on the knowledge of the factors contributing to the spread of such parasites including the activities of fruit vendors at Orie emene market and then affect on the distribution of these parasites.</p> <p><strong><em>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</em></strong><br/> 1. To determine the parasite of medical importance in fruit sold at Orie Emene market in Enugu State.<br/> 2. To determine whether washing of fruits with untreated water eliminates the parasites of medical importance (pathogenic parasites) from them.<br/> 3. To determine whether fruits are safe to be eaten without washing them as some people do.</p>\n\nPARASITOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SOME READY TO EAT FRUITS SOLD<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PARASITOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SOME READY TO EAT FRUITS SOLD", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA FROM FOOD VENDORS AND SOME VEGETABLE AVAILABLE </div> <p><strong>(A Case Study Of Ogbete Market Enugu)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Safety of food is a basic requirement of food quality. A total of 25 street food samples (Jollof rice, egwusi soup, ugu, water leaf and green), were randomly purchased from five different vendors in Ogbete main market Enugu. The samples were transported in ice to the laboratory. The samples were bacteriologically analyzed using pour plate technique and sub-culture. Pour plate techniques was done by carrying out serial dilution of the sample after which the first tube and the last tube were picked and 1ml of each sample was pipette into a Nutrient agar, the plate was then incubated for 24 hours at 37oC after which the plate were examined for growth. Sub culture was done using bacteriological agar. All the screened food samples had varying levels of bacterial growth ranging from 1.0 X 105 to 3.0 X 106 cfu/ml. ninety percent of the sampled foods had bacterial counts above the acceptable limits (104 cfu/ml) and 10% of the samples had bacterial counts less than (&lt;104 cfu/ml). Six bacterial species were isolated from the foods sampled. Staphylococcus arueus, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio spp, Salmonella spp, Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. More than one pathogenic micro organism were isolated from jollof rice and water leaf. The findings revealed that street foods are potential vehicles for transmitting food borne illnesses thus the need to develop practical strategies geared toward street food safety.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p>Title page <br/> Certificate page<br/> Dedication <br/> Acknowledgement <br/> Table of contents <br/> List of tables <br/> Abstract</p> <p><strong><em>CHAPTER ONE</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><em>1.0 INTRODUCTION</em></strong><br/> 1.1 Aim and Objectives</p> <p><strong><em>CHAPTER TWO</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><em>2.1 LITERATURE REVIEW</em></strong><br/> 2.2 Food hygiene<br/> 2.3 Factors that contribute to food borne illness<br/> 2.4 Features of common food –borne pathogens <br/> 2.5 Food- born diseases <br/> 2.6 Pre-disposing factors to food-born illness <br/> 2.7 Prevention of food born illness</p> <p><strong><em>CHAPTER THREE</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><em>3.1 MATERIALS AND METHOD</em></strong><br/> 3.1.1 Hard ware <br/> 3.1.2 Soft ware<br/> 3.2 Methods <br/> 3.3 Identification of isolates</p> <p><strong><em>CHAPTER FOUR</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><em>4.1 RESULTS</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>CHAPTER FIVE</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><em>5.1 DISCUSSION</em></strong><br/> 5.2 Conclusion <br/> 5.3 Recommendation<br/> References<br/> Appendix</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong><em>1.0 INTRODUCTION</em></strong><br/> Bacterial are group of microorganism all of which lack a distinct nuclear membrane (and hence are considered more primitive than animal and plant cells) and most of which have a cell wall of unique composition. Most bacterial are unicellular; the cells may be spherical (coccu) rod – shaped (bacillus), spiral (spirillum), comma – shaped (vibrio) or corkscrew-shaped (spierocheate). Generally, they range in size between 0.5 and 5um. (Elizabeth and Martin, 2003).<br/> Food is any substance that people or animal eat or drink or that plants absorb to maintain life and growth. Food is any substance consumed for nutritional support for the body; it is usually of plant or animal origin. (Ezeronye, 2007). Food consists of chemical compounds which heterophilic living thing consumes in order to carry out metabolic processed. They are also substances which when introduced to the digestive system under normal circumstances contribute to growth, repair and production of energy.<br/> (Ezeronye, 2007). Foods are classified into six essential nutrients known as protein, carbohydrate, vitamin mineral, fat and oil, water.<br/> PROTEIN: - One of a group of organic compounds of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen (sulphur and phosphorus may also be present). The protein molecule is a complex structure made up of one or more chains of amino acid, which are linked by peptide bonds. Proteins are essential constituents of the body; they form the structural material of muscles, tissues, organs, etc. and are equally important as regulators of function, as enzymes and hormones, proteins are synthesized in the body from their constituent amino acids, which are obtained from the digestion of protein in the diet (Elizabeth and Martin, 2003).<br/> CARBOHYDRATE: - One of a large group of compounds, including the sugar and starch, that contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and have the general formular CX (H20) Y- Carbohydrates are important as a source of energy: they are manufactured by plants and obtained by animals from the diet, being one of the three main constituent of food. All carbohydrates are eventually broken down in the body to the simple sugar glucose which can<br/> then take part in energy producing metabolic processes. Excess carbohydrate, not immediately required by the body is stored in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. In plants carbohydrate are important structural materials (e.g. cellulose and storage products (commonly in the form of starch). (Elizabeth and Martin, 2003).<br/> VITAMIN:- Any of a group of substances that are required in very small amounts, for healthy growth and development: they cannot be synthesized by the body and are therefore essential constituents of the diet. Vitamins are divided into two groups, according to whether they are soluble in water or fat. The water soluble groups include the vitamin C; the fat soluble vitamins are vitamins A, D, E and K. Lack of sufficient quantities of any of the vitamins in the diet results in specific vitamin deficiency diseased (Elizabeth and Martin, 2003).<br/> FAT:- A substance that contains one or more fatty acids (in the form of triglyceride) and is the principal form in which energy is stored by the body (in adipose tissue). It also serves as an insulating material beneath the skin (in the subcutaneous tissue) and around certain organs (including the<br/> kidney). Fat is one of the three main constituents of food; it is necessary in the diet to provide an adequate supply of essential fatty acid and from the efficient absorption of fat –soluble vitamins from the intestine. Excessive deposition of fat in the body leads to obesity. (Elizabeth and Martin, 2003).<br/> A vendor is a person selling something (en.Wikipedia org/Wiki/vendor). The world Health Organization (WHO) Indicated that food-borne diseases most of which are of microbial origin are perhaps the most widespread problems in the contemporary world and this is responsible for about one third of death world wide, through infectious conditions with adverse effects can reduce economic productivity. Poor sanitary condition in most of the local markets and the environment being highly polluted and charged with spoilage and pathogenic flora is likely the source of contamination of food items sold by such vendors. (Oweghe et al., 2001). It is known that poor hygienic conditions in a food environment may encourage the multiplication of pathogenic organisms in food (Egeonu, 2002). It has been observed that Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus grow to oxygenic levels in food at 300c (Egeonu, 2003). Therefore microbiological examination of foods and food contact surfaces may provide<br/> information concerning the quality of the raw food, and the sanitary conditions under which the food is processed (Michael et al; 2004). Microorganisms live throughout the kitchen and can easily move around by attaching themselves to people easily move around by attaching themselves to people, food and equipment. Bacteria may pass from equipment to food which has not been properly cleaned and sanitized before being used to prepare another food. Examination of food consumed and also wholesomeness. This implies that the food to be consumed by humans should be pure and free from contamination especially by pathogenic and spoilage micro organisms. Failure to ensure the safety and wholesomeness of the food consumed by the public might lead to some illness. To reduce contamination by microorganisms to a minimum level, and obtain good keeping quality of the products, the raw materials should regularly be monitored and examined.<br/> Food contacts surfaces are a major concern for food service facilities in controlling the spread of food-borne pathogens, surfaces such as bench tops, table, etc. may have bacterial on them from contact with people, raw foods, dirty equipments or other things such as cartons that have been stored<br/> on the floor. If the bench tops are not properly cleaned, any food on them will be contaminated by the bacterial (Kamil, 2005).</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 AIM</em></strong><br/> The overall aim of this work is to access selected foods sold by vendors in Ogbete main market Enugu for bacterial contamination.<br/> OBJECTIVES<br/> 1. To isolate and identify bacterial species associated with food contamination.<br/> 2. To determine the microbial load of isolated bacteria.<br/> 3. To establish the public health implication of consumption of such foods.</p>\n\nISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA FROM FOOD VENDORS AND SOME VEGETABLE AVAILABLE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA FROM FOOD VENDORS AND SOME VEGETABLE AVAILABLE", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> PREVALENCE AND ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY OF GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA IN THE URINE OF CARITAS UNIVERSITY STUDENTS </div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>In order to access the prevalence and sensitivity pattern of urinary pathogens, 60 midstream urine samples from students of Caritas University were investigated using cultural methods.

They are differentiated by their cell wall structure. The following characteristics are displayed by gram negative bacteria as follows Cytoplasmic membrane Thin peptidoglycan layer(much thinner than gram positive) Outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide outside the peptidoglycan layer Porin exists in the outer membrane, which acts like pores There is a space between the layer of peptidoglycan and the secondary cell membrane, called the periplasmic space If present, flagella have four (4) supporting rings instead of two No techoic acid or lipopolysaccharide<br/> Some examples of gram negative bacteria include; Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Pseudomonas species, Klebsiella species, Proteus species, Helicobacter species, Mosoxella species, Cyanobacteria species, Spirochetes species.<br/> They also constitute a serious problem in urinary tract infections in many parts of the world. Appropriate antimicrobial treatments are often critical to decreasing morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients having the infections caused by the pathogens. Gram negative bacteria are non-spore forming bacilli that grow rapidly on ordinary laboratory media under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It has been estimated that symptomatic urinary tract infects (UTI) occurs in as many as 7million visits to emergency units and 100,000 hospitalised annually. UTI has been the most common hospital acquired infections, accounting for as many as 35% of nosocomial infection. It is the second most common cause of bacteraemia in hospitalised patients (Nacem, 2000). UTI is known to occur in all populations but has a particular impact on females of all ages and males at two extremes of life, immuno-compromised patients and anyone with function or structural abnormalities of the urinary and excretory system.<br/> UTI is known to be the microbial invasion of any of the tissues of the urinary tract reaching from the renal cortex to the urethrameatus (Nicolle, 2000). It is also known to be the presence in two consecutive urine samples of greater than 100rods (105 ) organisms per ml of a single bacterial strain in the urinary tract. UTI can be categorized in ascending or descending. Infections which are confined to the urethral or the bladder are ascending and referred to as uretitis or cystitis respectively. On the other hand, the pathogens spread from one or other infected body site to the kidney down along the ureter to the bladder. Such descending UTI cause severe kidney infection, a condition called pyelonephritis (Parsons, 1958). This is potentially more serious; infections to the urethra are called urethritis and to the prostrate gland are called prostitis. This classification is the presence or absence of symptoms, reoccurrence or absence or presence of complicating factors which are host factors facilitating establishment and maintenance of bacteraemia or worsening the prognosis of UTI`s engaging the kidney.<br/> Majority of pathogens are gram negative species with predominance of members of Enterobacteriace (Neu, 1992). Escherichia coli accounts for majority of urinary tract infections in young women but other gram negative<br/> rods of different genera such as proteus species and pseudomonas aeruginosa an aerobic gram negative rod is also troublesome. As a urinary tract pathogens because of its resistance to antimicrobial medicine make it difficult to treat successfully (Nester et al. 1998).<br/> Antibiotics are used for the control of bacterial infections in human. Generally, gram negative bacteria are sensitive to many antimicrobial agents but strains from different patients and carriers differ in the pattern and degrees of sensitivity to different drugs. Increasing antimicrobials resistance in bacterial pathogen is a worldwide concern. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary tract infectious agents is also increasing (Mathai et al. 2001 : Karaloswsky et al. 2001) and its treatment has become more complicated due to increasing resistance and empirical therapy leading to treatment failures of most associated with gram negative bacteria (Blondeau et al. 1999). The present study investigated the pattern of gram negative uropathogens and their antimicrobial resistance pattern among the clinical isolates to the commercially available antibiotics that are often prescribed in urinary tract infectious cases</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 Aims and objectives </em></strong><br/> To find out the prevalence of gram negative organisms in the urinary tract among caritas university students. To investigate their antibiotic sensitivity pattern to enable formulation of drugs for urinary tract infection in our community. To determine the age and sex prevalence. To determine the prevalence of bacterial strains and their antimicrobial susceptibility in urine. To find the pathogenic bacteria commonly responsible with UTI and susceptibility patterns this will help the clinicians to choose the right empirical treatment.</p>\n\nPREVALENCE AND ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY OF GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA IN THE URINE OF CARITAS UNIVERSITY STUDENTS  <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREVALENCE AND ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY OF GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA IN THE URINE OF CARITAS UNIVERSITY STUDENTS  ", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF PIPE BORNE WATER AND OTHER SOURCES OF WATER </p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>Comparative examination of three main sources of water supply in Independence layout Enugu was carried out with a view to determine their levels of contamination of bacteria.

From time immemorial, man has restorted to the use of this unique commodity for domestic and other purposes. Most of our water supplies are from surface water which include: rivers, streams, lakes, oceans and seas and there water bodies are likely to be polluted with domestic and Industrial as well as agriculture waste, As populations increase, the problem become more serious and as such, water can endanger the health and life of human beings because when polluted by fecal materials it becomes potential carrier of pathogenic organism (Carpenter, 1977). Water, is of course, absolutely essential to life, not only human life but all life, animal and vegetable. Most of the biochemical reaction that occur in metabolism and growth of living cells involved water, and all take places in water. (Camp et al,1974).<br/>Man uses water not only for drinking purposes but also for bathing, washing, laundering, heating, air conditioning, agriculture, stock raising and gardens, Industrial processes and cooling water power and steam<br/>power, fire protection, fishing, swimming and wild life propagation and navigation. Natural water contain not only then natural flora but also micro – organisms from soil and possible from animals or sewage. Surface waters in streams or pools and stored waters in lakes and large ponds vary considerably in microbial content. (frazier, 1978) water is broadly divided into three types viz., surface water which include: streams, rivers, lakes seas, and oceans (Kelman et al, 1957). The ground water, well, bore hole, many people have defined the ground water in different ways: ground water is non saturated water that occurs where all pores in the soil or rock counting materials are saturated (pelezer et al, 1992). The atmospheric water, which include rainfalls. All water bodies consist of a variety of bacterial and other microorganisms like the Algaes, fungi, which inhabit these natural water bodies. Some of these micro –organisms are indigenous to thus natural water while others are transient, entering the water from external environment (Pelezar and Reg, 1997).<br/>The generality of bacteria are mostly commonly found ordinarily in fresh water some of which include: pseudomonas, Archacbacter, and vibrio these are gram negative, the gram-positive bacterial which are found in<br/>water include: micrococcus Archacbacter and actinomycetes (Gebharal, 1975). Tap water, as one of the water sources is mostly used domestically, it is observed that tap change sometime the water tap will be clear this calls for load, in order to be sure of its portability (Bonde, 1977). The increase in drinking water from different sources especially in Enugu state has made necessary to investigate the microbial content of water. Water is a potential carried of pathogenic organisms that can endanger human life. Most of drinking water sources are often contaminated with different pollutants like faeces, animal and plant wastes, making such water unfit for drinking if not treated. The pollution of water with pathogenic organisms and other pollutants can only be detected by carrying out microbiological assessment of such water. Most human disease such as typhoid paratyphoid cholera, amobiasis, Trichinosis, gastroenteritis, salmonella shigellosis, diphtheria, giadia, dracunculus etc are known to be water borne disease. (Ewington et al, 1971).<br/>Water born disease are those disease which have water as their vehicle of transmission these disease are capable of destroying a whole community if not checked. Therefore, the quickest ways to prevent out break of these disease and to determine the portability of such water sources is to<br/>determine the microbial load or content if the microbial content is nor within acceptable limit, such water sources should be condemned immediately (Fair et al, 1970).</p> <p><em><strong>1.1.

They help the body to fight diseases. More than 3,000 years ago ancient people stumbled over the discovery that some moulds could be used as a cure. The egyptians, the chinese, and indians of central American would use mold to treat rashes and infected would. At that time they didn’t understand either diseases or treatment. As time went on, people began to gain some insight of disease. In the 1860 Louis Pasteur Shaw that many disease were caused it bacteria. Later he discovered that we may be able to fight germ and other microbes. It was two German doctors, who were first to make an effective medication form microbes. Kudo if and Emmerich and Oscar has conducted their experiment in the 1890. They proved that germ that would for another. All the men did was to take the germ from infected bandages and grow then in a test tube. They would then isolate a particular germ that caused green in factions in open would. This germs was bacteria called Bacillus pyoicyaneus. They put then into another test tube containing other type of bacteria, it was then it happened that the bacillus pyocyaneus wiped out the other disease germ. The germs that was killed were those that caused cholera, typhoid, diphtheria and anthrau. From this the two men created a medication that they called pyoanase, it was the first antibiotics used in hospitals.<br/>In 1928 Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist, discovered penicillin, the first antibiotics. He was keeping in a petn dish when a speck of mold fell in, it cause the mold to grow on the nutrient agar used to feed the bacteria. Surpassingly, it stopped the growth of the bacteria. Fleming through the mold called penicillin notatum produced a substance that killed the bacteria and so called it penicillin. However, he was not able to entrant it from broth in which he grew the mold.<br/>In 1945, Waksman used the word antibiotics for the first time and proposed that it can be defined as a chemical substance of microbial origin that possesses antibiotic powers. He discovered a drug called streptomycin. It onginated frommicrobes found in soil and was a cure for many intestinal diseases. Now antibiotics like penicillin and streptomycin was discovered. Each was effective against certain disease, but scientist wanted more. Doctors however, anted broad spectrum drug. That is a single antibiotics that could cure many disease <br/>The search proved successful one laboratory discovered Aureonycin, which is a drug that does the job of penicillin and streptomycin. Another laboratory discovered chloromycin. <br/>In 1949, yet another laboratory came with one of the effective antibiotics ever found, terranycin. This drug could be used against many bacteria disease (Katzung, 1994).</p> <p><strong>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVE </strong><br/>1. To identify causative organism that are delectious to mans health. <br/>2. To determine the potency of the different antibiotics. <br/>3. To know the type of organism sensitive to the different antibiotics.</p> <p><strong>1.3 HYPOTHESIS </strong><br/>H0- Streptomycin is more effective <br/>H1 – Streptonyin is not effective <br/>H2 - Chloramphenicol is not effective <br/>H3- Chloramphenicol is not effective <br/>H4- Gentamicin is more effective <br/>H5 –Gentanicin is not effective <br/>H6 – Comparing the strength of the three antibiotics.</p> <p><strong>1.4 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong><br/>Due to the problem encountered in Enugu Urban (obiagu), most people abuse antibiotics owing to the general belief that antibiotics can be used in the treatment of all kinds of diseases. This can result to drug resist. Accumulation of these drugs can lead to internal denage. Hence this study which compares the antimicrobial strength of three antibiotics.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY </strong><br/>This work will be limited to the maximum inhibitory concentration and know the organism sensitive to the different antibiotics under certain temperature.</p> <p><strong>1.6 LIMITATION OF STUDY </strong><br/>Limited time in making research for the project work. <br/>2) Inharailability of equipment and reagents in the course of carrying out the work. </p> </div> </div>\n\nCOMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ANTIMICROBIAL STRENGTH OF THREE MOST COMMON ANTIBIOTICS USED<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ANTIMICROBIAL STRENGTH OF THREE MOST COMMON ANTIBIOTICS USED", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH HAWKED SUYA- MEAT </p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This project work is carried at the isolation and characterization of pathogenic bacteria from hawked suya meat, were bought in full from the sellers and was collected in raps of aluminum foil. It was then taken to the laboratory for analysis the samples were homogenized and serial dilution of the sample was made out using 5 ml sterile pipette and test tubes. The dilution were then cultured on different media, macconkey agar, nutrient agar and blood agar end later incubated at 370c for 24 hours. Discrete bacteria colonies were observed and each colomy was gram stained and examined microscopically. Biochemical test were carried out to confirm the particular bacteria present. Bactering isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus, lactobacillus, streptococcus and Escherichia coli. Most at this microorganisms isolated are pathogenic and are toxic when ingested in contaminated suya meat. They are capable of causing illness. For instance staphylococcus aureus produce air exotizcin and can with stand temperature of 1000c for 30 minutes. When ingested, if cause intoxication manifesting in 4-5 hours with acute diarrhoes vomiting and gastroertrities lasting 6-8 hours. </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>Meat is an animal product. It is that part of animal that provides major source of protein in west African food. <br/>There are different types of meat from different types of animals, eg pork meat (pig) multon (goat) beef (cow).<br/>Meat can be served as prepared meat product eg corn beef, fried meat, cooked meat and suya, meat (smoke meat). Meat is perishable food and its composition is ideal for the growth of wide range of spoilage bacteria. Public concern has vison due to numerous food scandals such as those surrounding bovine spongiform encephalopathy and roof and mouth disease epidemics and food borne disease which remain substantial burden . we can meet those challenges with an improved and global food safety control system. One possible improvement would be a repid and accurate detection system for microbial spoilage. This technique should ideally also be non destructive and give result in real time for application in highly automated food processing environment.<br/>Suya meat is produced by smoking the raw beet with the addition of some syices, salt, oil, groundnut cake and flavors. The meat is first sliced into smaller pieces and the spices are rubbed onto it, it is later oven driedor over local source of heart. This allows the meat to get dried properly with the right taste before is gold to the consumers. <br/>This is gold at a specific joint or howked when it is Gold at joint it is constantly kept warm over fire source. The hawked saya meat is carried about in open basin from place to place thereby exposing it to dust and other effects of the environment so doing harmful organisms find their ways into the meat there by coursing for poisoning. <br/>Food poisoning is an illness with acute gastro ertritis as a major symptom caused by the ingestion of food counting my harmful micro organizer or harmful substances. Tomatari (1983). <br/>Some of the micro organisms present in suya causes food poisoning when consumed are Salmonella typhi staphylococcus aureus clostridum butilinum, clostridium preferring Bacillus cereces streptococcus progenies. <br/>Some of these micro organisms in meat cause off shavours which make the meat to be unfit for eating and also reduce the taste value. <br/>AIMS OF OBJECTIVE <br/>This project research is designed to isolate and identify the common spoilage organisms of suya meat often production thereby ensuring the safety of the population at risk in eating containineted suya meat</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS </strong><br/>HO: Hawked suya meat sold around ESBS metropolises contain pathogenic microorganisms <br/>H1 Hawked suya meat sold around ESBS metropolies does not cantinas pathogenic micro organisms.<br/>HI Hawked suya meat sold around ESBS, metropolies contain micro organisms but the load is not enough to cause disease.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY </strong><br/>The significance of this work is to enable those producers to improve the hygiene of the food (suya meat) and a good knowledge of safe food handling practice, suitable protective clothing to be worm end it will also enable us to be aware of various pathogenic organic and infection they transmit through food (suya meat) . As a result of this, the prevention of contamination of food is to be adhered to .This can be achieved by <br/>-keeping high risk food at temperature that will inhibits the growth of bacteria <br/>- Ensuring that during preparation, food is in the damger zone foras short time as possible.<br/>- Using suitable preservation such as salt and sugar.<br/>- Using various packing method like glass wares.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong><br/>Pathogenic organisms are organization that are referred to as specific health hazards associated with gusto intestinal disturbance counting foxiness.

Hepatitis was described in the Babylonian Talmud in the fifty century BC, and was referred to by Hippocratic over 2000 years ago. Despite this ancient knowledge, it was not until 1963, that the first human Repetitious virus was isolated, Hepatitis B. This was followed quickly by the purification of Hepatitis A in 1973, and more recently by the isolation of viruses C, D, E and G. These viruses are known to infect the human liver (Anderson et al; 2001).<br/>However, there are more than twenty other viruses, which infect the human liver. These are not considered “Repatitis viruses” as these other viruses tend to infect organs other than the liver more seriously’. These include common viruses such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Mumps, Rubella, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as well as rare ones such as Rassa fever and yellow fever viruses.<br/>Any infection that results in inflammation of the liver is called Repatitis (Greek Repaticus, liver). Incidentally, not all “hepatitis” is caused by viruses. “HEPATITIS” means “inflammation of the liver”, and can be caused also by other types of infection (bacteria fungi etc); toxic drugs; poisons; alcoholism and so on (Drexott etal; 2005).<br/>But of interest is one Repatitis virus – one of the most common infections diseases, causing an estimated 1.5millon deaths world wide each year – Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is caused by the Repatitis B virus (HBV), a double – stranded circular DNA virus of complex structure. Hbv is class ivied as an orthoropadnavirus within the family hepadnaviridae. HBV was originally recognized as the age responsible or serum Repatitis the most common form of partially transmitted viral Repatitis and an import cause of acute and chronic infection of the liver. This why hepatitis b is some times called seum Repatitis. The virus was formerly and anilines referred to as Australian antigen. The reason being that it was first isolated room the blood of an Australian aborogie and is associated with HBV. (procott et al 2005.<br/>Hepatitis B remain one of the major cause of human suffering in the world despite a through understanding of its transmission and prevention. Serum form undivided infected with hepatitis B contains three district antigen particles: a spherical 22nm particle, a 42 nm spherical particle ( counting DNA and DNA polymer able) called the Dane particle, and tubular or filamentous particles that vary in length. The small spherical and tubular particles are the unassembled component of the Dane particle- the infective form of the virus. The unassembled particles. Contain hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) whose presence in the blood is (a) an indicator of Repatitis B infection (b) the basis for the large scale screening of blood for the hepatitis B virus, and (c) the basis for the first vaccine for human use developed by recombinant DNA technology (Evans, 1997 <br/>The Hepatitis B virus is normally transmitted through blood transfusion, contaminated equipment, drug users unsterile needles, or any body secretion (saliva, soren, sweat, breast milk, urine) The virus also can pass from the blood of an infected mother through the placenta to infect the fetus. Each year an estimated 200, 000 people in Nigeria are infected with Australian Antigen (HBV) about 1000 person die yearly from hepatitis related cirrhosis and about 5000 die from HBV related liver cancer. (HBV is second only to tobacco as a known cause of rumen cancer). Worldwide, HBV infects over 200 million people (Schlesinger &amp; Schlesinger, 2001). The clinccal signs of Repatitis B vary widely, most cases are symptomless. However, sometime fever, loss of appetite, abominal discomfort, nausea, fatigue, and other symptoms gradually appear following an incubation period of 1 to 3 months. The virus infects liver Hepatic cells and causes liver tissue degeneration and the release of liver associated enzymes (transaminases) into the blood team. This is followed by jaundice, the accumulation of bilirubin (a breakdown product of raemoglobin in the skin and other tissue with a resulting yellow appears. The distinctive yellow jaundice the Hepatitis B usually imparts to its victims skin has made it an rasity detectable disease through recorded history. Frequently, acute hepatitis B in anicteric and symptomatic, although acute liver failure may develop. The virus persists in about 10 percent of infected immouno compent adults, and in as many 90 percent of infants infect peninatally depending on the ethnic group of the mother. About 350 million people worldwide are persistent carries of hepatitis B. actually one in twenty infection results in chronic hepatitis, defined as persistent hepatitis virus six mouths after the onset of the acute illness. Chronic HBV infection can be entirely begin with normal liver blood tests (“Chronic Carrier State”) or may be an aggressive inflammatory process (“Chronic active hepatitis”), which can lead to severe scarring (“Cirrhosis).<br/>Approximately 25 percent of all patients with chronic hepatitis will progress to cirrhosis and about 20 percent of those with cirrhosis will develop hepatocellular carcinoma. That is to say, the risk of liver cancer (hepatoma) is high in cirrhosis caused by HBV. <br/>Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide (Seeger &amp; manor; 2000)<br/>During the first phase of chronicity, virus replication continues in the liver and replicative intermediates of the viral genome may be detected in DNA extracted from liver hiopsies. Makers of virus replication in serum include HBVDNA (this indicated virus presence and activity), DNA polymerize (determines the presence of HBVDNA in liver cell, and a soluble antigen, hepatition.be antigen (\\HbeAG), which is secreted by productively infected hepatocytes. In those infected at a very going age this phase may persist for life but, more usually, virus levels decline over time. Eventually, in most individuals, there is immune clearance of infected hepatocytes associated with seroconverision low replication, the viral senome may integrate into the chromosomal DNA of some hepatocytes and these cells may persist and expand closely. Rarely , seroconversion to anti-HBs follows clearance of virus replication but, more frequently, HBSAg persists during a second phase of chronicity as a result of the expression of integrated viral DNA. <br/>VIRAL REPLICATION <br/>With respect to replication of the HBV, the fundamental process of viral infection is the expression of the viral replication cycle in a rost cell. The steps for the infection process involving HBV usually include the following:<br/>Enter a host <br/>- contact and enter susceptible cell.<br/>- Replicate within the cell.<br/>- Sprea d to adjacent cells.<br/>- Cause cellular injury. <br/>- Engender a host immune response<br/>- Be either cleared from the body of the host, establish a presistnt infection , or kill the host. <br/>- Be shed back into the environment (prexote it al; 2005).<br/>VIRAL SPREAD <br/>Mechanisms of viral spread very, but the most roates include bloodstream. The presence of viruses in the blood is called VIREAMA&gt;HBV is spread through blood, body secretion, needles, placenta as well as sexually. This os to say that transmission as through parental routes. Therefore, transmission of HBV can occur from person to person as a result of transfer of blood by any prouder which breaks the skin or mucous members HBV spread mainly parentally, in most cases seen in adults , HBs (Australian Antigen) has been identified in almost every body fluid f infected persons- saliva tears semen, cerebrospinal fluid, ascetic fluid, breast milk synovial fluid, gastric juice, urine and rarely in faces. This disease is, therefore, a major occupational hazard of medical personnel. It is commonly seen in people who receive multiple blood transfusion or blood product intravenous drug abusers, homosexuals and the sexually promiscuous.</p> <p><strong>1.2 PURPOSE OF STUDY </strong><br/>The need for study can never be over emphases having considered the above, this study serves the following purpose or objectives. <br/>1. To obtain a general view of the group of individual affected whether children or adults. <br/>2. To show circumstances which dispose to viral hepatitis and suggest means of reducing the incidence. <br/>3. To review the management of these patients with regards to vestigation done and treatment. <br/>4. To understand the complex or exorbitant nature of the structure of the hepatitis B virus as well as the debilitating effect it has on the patient <br/>5. Also compare and contrast primary data from this study with secondary from the library <br/>6. To how rate of progression to chronicity as well as make known the daily activities that will not result in contacting HBV.</p> <p><strong>1.3 SIGNIFIGANCE OF STUDY </strong><br/>This study done to known the existence or widespread of this disease among patience in Nation Orthopedic Hospital Enugu. Or to understand and show the prevalent Hospital in question .the significance of this study can never be over emphasicum this is because in developing countries such as HBV is indisputable essential in the life of that country especially in their hospitals. Many children are infected by hepatitis B virus at on early age a significant portion of apparently healthy individual are chronic carriers of HBsAg, that is the Australia Antign. The significance of this study is seen in the light of having a better knowledge and understanding or better still widening our scope of the chronically and pathogenically of HBV.</p> <p><strong>4.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong><br/>A study of this nature surely must have problem which result in it. Hepatitis B is a viral disease that is spread through all body fluids, that is to say that one can contact this disease by exchange to body fluid with infected person. Looking at our society and hospital there are cases where by unscreened blood is transfixed to a patient case of multiple sex partner people having unprotected sex, making use of sharp objects without any care.

It is an exceptionally good source of protein which is of a high biological value in promoting the growth of children (ihekorany and Ngoddy, 1985). Milk is described as a good of outstanding interest, which is designed by nature to be complete good for very young mammals (fox and Cameron, 1980). <br/>Milk contains a wide variety of constituents and contains most of the food factors associated with bacterial nutrition. Milk as a single food is of high nutritional value and is associated with spoilage microorganisms. At the time milk leaves the udder of the healthy cow, it contains few bacteria these stem from milk ducts and cistern. During the milking process, bacteria are usually added from various sources. In hand milking the sources are air the hair of the animal manure, the milkers equipment such as pails, feed and machine, most of these environmental factors are less important. However, the milking equipment may serve as an important source of contamination if it is not carefully cleaned and sanitized (ihekoronye and Ngoddy, 1985) . <br/>After milk has been drawn it is rapidly cooled to 45 of prevent contaminants from multiplying. To eliminate pathogens from milk the process of pasteurization is applied. This involves application of heat below the boily point (fraizer and westhoff, 1978).</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong><br/>Mike as a food of high nutritional value is highly associated with microorganisms. As a result of this contamination of raw milk, it not sterilized and taken directly or used for production of milk products, causes disease to man and also contribute to the spoilage of milk and milk products.</p> <p><strong>1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY. </strong><br/>AIM: The aim of the study is to evaluate the micro-flora of raw milk <br/>Objectives: The objectives of the study are <br/>i) To isolate and identify micro organisms that are contaminate raw milk. <br/>ii) To determine of the milk is tubercle bacilli free <br/>iii) To assay for the presence of coliform as an index of pathogens.</p> <p><strong>1.4 HYPOTHESIS </strong><br/>Ho: All fresh raw milk from healthy cows are free from marshal contamination both pathogenic and non- pathogenic <br/>H1: All fresh raw milk from healthy cows are net free from microbial contamination both pathogenic and non- pathogenic.</p> <p><strong>1.5 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Milk is know to be heavily contaminated by microorganisms if net properly handled.

The sample were extracted using equal volume of sterile distilled water and serially diluted appropriately and the cultured for the growth of microben. The growth were further suspected to biochemical tests, characterization for confirmatory diagnosis organism isolated include staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perferingens, Clostridium botulism and vibroi parahamolyticus.<br/>The evaluation show that Abakaliki Garri have more microbial spores than others. This can be because of handler or jute bag or moisture which help in the increase of the microbial load. This was involve the microbial analysis of Garri produced from four major production sites namely: Nkalafi Okwuo imene Aba and collected from the major marketing site Ogbetet main Enugu. The sample digest were extracted wing equal oplungs of sterile distilled water and serially distilled appropriately and the cultured for the growths of microben.

During preparation, food may be contaminated with microorganisms. Unless the growth and metabolism of this microorganism are controlled, they are capable of altering the condition of food resulting in food spoilage. Microorganism are organisms that cannot be seen by an invaded eyes, their size are within the range of (NM) micrometer to (nm) Nanometre and their activities on food produce food poisoning food poisoning ie an illness that result from the consumption of contaminated food containing toxin screted into it by contaminated microorganism or contaminated by microorganisms when the body release their toxin (Okoli, 1991). Also the (Kay and Dennis 1986) defined food poisoning as any substance applied to the body externally or taken internally that can cause injury to any part of the body or cause death.<br/>In Garri preparation the cassava is pealed, washed, grated then follow by dehydration under pressure, finally frying, packaging and storage. These process if not handle in a good hygiene condition or good environment, microorganism will contaminated it and will result in food can lead to the death of many people which can reduce the working force and increase poverty rate due to heavy hospital bills. To avoid this problem, this research work is designed to know the microbial organisms of Garri in Ogbete market. The microbial organisms present will be analyzed to see if it can cause food poisoning. From the analysis the list of microorganism present or microorganism contamination on garri can be control effectively and our Garri will be save for consumption at anytime.<br/>The intoxication from nature source is that found naturally in contain plants or animals (Frazien and Westhof. 1978). The intoxications caused by bacterial are of two types by clostridium botulinum, staphylococcal intoxication, caused by a toxin in the food produced by staphylococcus aureus. In the production of food, such as in the fermentation of garri, the fermentation reduced the cyanile toxicity in the cassava which if present in large quantity causes food poisoning. The processing of cassava involves the contamination of the cassava if it is not properly processed.</p> <p><strong>1.1 AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>To evaluate he microbial organisms of garri in Ogbete market. Ot characterize for microbial organism of Garri if any to relate the above to personnel hygiene and environmental hygiene.</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>The sources of contamination many include:<br/>1. High moisture content of Garri before storage enhances growth of mould.<br/>2. Transportation during rainy reason caused wetness of the jut bag which brought about mould growth.<br/>3. Seller probably a pathogen carrier of any classification. Some sellers have some infection which are contagious and can contaminate the Garri on sale<br/>4. Open air exposure and duration of sale past production. The microbial load in the air can raise above toxic level became of some air borne organism and if Garri is kept in such environemnt it will be contaminated.<br/>5. Storage for longtime may enhance deterioration. Keeping Garri in storage room for longtime will affect the nature of the Garri.</p> <p><strong>1.4 HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>HO the Garri on sale at Ogbete market have no microbial lead<br/>Hi The Garri on sale at Ogbete market have some bacterial load.</p> <p><strong>15 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong><br/>This study is based on the fact that Garri which is the staple food of man may caused a lot of harm to his life. This is due to the unhygienic condition of the environemnt during processingg, storage and further exposure to the market in which Garri is sold. These microbes can leads to food poisoning and other intoxication (ailment) which can lead to loss of man power and loss of life. Therefore this work is to stem down ugly trend which may even affect our socioeconomic life by educating the people that are involved inteh processing, storage and selling of Garri about personnel hygiene on the product and how it can be store.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE / LIMITATION</strong><br/>The scope of this work is to evaluate the microorganism in Garri on ale at Ogbete market.<br/>The work has some limitation because of the school laboratory used which is not kept to standard and the truefulness of the seller at Ogbete market regarding the source of Garri supplied.</p> </div> </div>\n\nEVALUATION OF MICROORGANISMS ON GARRI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF MICROORGANISMS ON GARRI", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF SWEET ORANGE CITRUS SINENSIS ON STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND ESCHERICHIA COLI ISOLATED FROM WOUND INFECTED </p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>The antibacterial activity of sweet orange(citrus smensin) on staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli isolated from would infection was studied.

The average zone of inhibition exhibited by these drug on S. aureus were 8.95mm for Drovid 6.74 mm for ciprofloxacin while on E coli the average zones of inhibition were 8.63mm for Drovid 6.67mm for Enythrompcin 4.47mm for anbtpicillin and 6.57mm for ciprofloxacin. The result of the sensitivity pathen of both orange extant and antibiotics on S aureus and E coli showed that some of the isolated organisms were susceptible while some were resistance to both orange extract and antibiotics. The result should that the zone of inhibition of the orange extract were minimal on both S. aureus and E coli when compared to the zone of inhibition of the tested antibiotics on both organisms through the inhibition level of orange extract invitro (outside the body) is minimal, its active ingredient vitamin C boosts the immune system invivo (insove the body) by increasing the production of B and T cells and other white blood cells including those that destroy micro organisms.</div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>Sweet orange is a strum belonging to the plant family ruracea with a botanical name citrus simrnsia. They are berries but because or their unusual structure, they are called fresperidiums. Sweet oranges originates in southern China thousands of yeast’s ago. Now they are most popular and wide spread of the citrus fruits. Citrus saneness (sweet oranges) can be grown is most parts of the tropics where than five months and where there is fairly even distribution of rainfall throughout the year. The trees can be grown from seed but its more usual to buy budded citrus sincensis from private nursery men or form official Agricultural sources. Citrus saneness is a spreading ever green, some time spiny trees up to 12m fall with ovale elliptic leaves which are commonly 7-10cm long dark green and routed at the base. They are carried on short articulated petioles with very narrow wins. The leaves are strongly scented the white sweet smelling flowers are smaller than those of the group. The rounded fruits are up to 12cm in diameter. Deep yellow to orange or in humict climate remaining green when ripe. Sweet oranges (citrus saneness) are trotrical crops. They are also annual crops (Cobley 1976) <br/>In a typical sweet orange, the excerpt and mesa carp are leathery and protect the juicy inner tissue deceived from the endocarp from damage and desiccation. The epidermis of the fruit has a thick cuticle and varying number of stomata, the excerpt or flavedo is a layer of irregular photosynthctically active parenchyma cells which is green in young fruit and becoming orange or greenish when they nature. The mesocarp is thicker than the exocarp and consists of inter cellular space. The mesocarp is know as the albedo. It is rich in vitamin C sugar cellulose and in pectin. The mesocarp and excarp together form the bird of the fruit. The center of the fruit is occupied by the development carpels of the ovary which are disposed around the pithy axis in form of several closely packed segments. Each segment develops from a single carpal and is surrounded by thin, transparent endocarp or “ray” form which multi-cellular hairs grow to fill each segment. Each huge cell or pulp vesicle of these hairs fills with juice and they form the edible part of the fruit for which the crops are grown. The seed lies on axle placenta close to the central axis and in the nature fruit is about 40- 45 percent juice 30 percent rind and 30 percent pulp and seeds which taken together consists of about 90 percent water 5-10 percent sugar 1-2 percent petunias various acids, essential oil proteins and minerals.<br/>Generally the fruit contains 80-90 percent of sugar and acids with relative proportion varying between other species of citrus. Citric acid is the abundant acid in the sap. Pectin in the juice gives it a cloudy colloidal appearance. Cilrus nsinensis contain mineral salts, glycosides, small amount of protein and vitamin (cobley 1976) it is a good source of cirus are citrus paradisc (grape fruit) citrus limon (lemon) citrus aurantatifolia (lime) citrus aurantinum (sour orange) citrus reticulate (tangermie and maudanine) citrus grandis (pummelo) and citrus medical (citron) The sugar and acids vary between species. <br/>The medical potency of sweet orange (citrus smeasin) is due to its high content in vitamin C which is believed to stimulated the production of white blood cells, primarily neutrophib, which attack foreign antigens such as bacteria and viruses. It also boost the body’s production of antibodies and interferon, the protein that helps protect us from viral invaders and cancer cells. (Uddoh, 1998). The importance of vitamin C from citrus fruits in prevention of scurvy was scientifically proven in 1756 by John Lind (Rudolph et al 1978)<br/>The skin is normally an effective barrier to pathogens, but skin may be broken example by wounding, surgery or the “bites” of insects etc. Wounds may admit any of the variety of potential pathogens capable of causing systemic disease (disease affecting the entire body) or localized disease. Bacterial pathogens can enter via “bites” (singleton 1995). Marmoin et al (1973) state that there are many organisms associated with wound infections, which are, propionibacterium, Klebsiella, staphylococcus, Escherichia coli etc. superficial infection are skin pustutes, boils, carbunictes, impetize, penphigus, neonatorum, sycosis barbae, paronychia styles, blepheritis and conjunctivitis” infections of accidental and surgical wounds.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>Most wound infections are infected by staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and other micro organisms (Bhata et al 1998) vitamin C is said to play important role in protection agaisnt bacterial and viral infection (Okaka et al 2002). The uptake of orange juice which is rich in vitamin C stimulates the production of white blood cells premarily neutrophils which fight agiasnt bacteria and virus and speeds the healing of wound (Rudolph et al 1978).<br/>It is therefore necessary to carryoput a research work to determine the antibacteria activity of sweet orange on S. aureus and E. coli involved in wound infections<br/><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</strong><br/>1.

And if the results are favourable then consumption of sweet orange will be advocated, which is safer than consumption of medical drugs which often have side effect to the individuals taking them, As a preventive therapy (since it raises the immune system of the individuals involves). It is naturally safer to the sweet orange, which is a good item.</p> </div> </div>\n\nANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF SWEET ORANGE CITRUS SINENSIS ON STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF SWEET ORANGE CITRUS SINENSIS ON STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> ANAEMIA IN PREGNANCY <p>(A Case Study Of Pregnant Women Attending Antenatal Clinic At University Of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (Unth) Enugu</p> </div> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>The study on anaemia in pregnancy is aimed at determining packed cell volume (PCV), Haemoglobin (Hb) level and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of pregnant women, as well as the selferity, significance of maternal, age, educational level, occupation and gestational age to the occurrence of anaemia in pregnancy managed, diagnosed and admitted at the university of Nigeria teaching Hospital (UNTH) Enugu. The result showed that most of the patient had moderate to secure anaemia and that the cases were commonest in the age range 25-29 years. Most of the patient were housewives and low level civil servants who lived in middle and lower class residential area ad who had no formal education. Anaemia in pregnancy was seen to occur most commonly in the third trimester. It occurred all through the year, but mostly in the wet season and had the greatest positive association with malaria and nutritional deficiency. Anaemia in pregnancy was seen not to be rampant in our today’s society due to the small number that tested positive Anaemia in pregnancy was also seen not to have any effect on birth weight of babies.</div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong><br/>DEFINITION: </strong>The world health organisation (WHO) index for anaemia in pregnance is when the haemoglobin level in the peripheral blood is Hg/dl or less. However, from practical experience in tropical obstetrics it is generally accepted that anaemia in pregnancy Exist when the Haemoglobin level is less than in loglde or the packed cell volume less than 30%</p> <p><strong>EPIDEMOOGY:</strong><br/>Anaemia in pregnancy presents a world-wide problem but it is uncommon in developed world. the importance of anaemia in pregnancy in the tropics lies firstly in its greatly increased incidence, and secondly in the seventy of the anaemia with which the patients commonly present for treatment. Both combine to make this complication of pregnancy a major cause of matanal and fetal death in the tropics. A third important problem posed by anaemia in the tropics is polymorphism. In almost all cales, the anaemia is caused by multiple factors whole individual importance varies from area to area. This makes rational prophylaxis and treatment much more difficult. Complicaion of pregnancy in the for at belt of West Africa, between January and April 1955. it was directly responsible for more than 20% of all matanal deaths in patients under the car of the Department of obstetrics, university college Hospital, Ibadan. It also contributed to many other deaths from Antepartum haemorrhage, postpartum haemorrhage and puerperal sepsis. In Nigeria it is a frequent complication, its incidence is high and its severity is staggering. The clinical feathers of anaemia in pregnancy in Nigeira are different from those encountered in temperate countries not only because of the severity of symptoms but also because of the concomitant autuminosis such as marked glossitis, Angular stomatitis and associated gross hepatomegly. Agbola A. (1991)</p> <p><strong>CLASSIFICATION</strong><br/>Anaemia in pregnancy could be mild, moderate or severe based on the haemoglobin level in the peripheral blood as well as the clinical manifestations and the management would differ for each.</p> <p><strong>TYPES OF ANAEMIA HB LEVEL </strong><br/>Mild Anaemia in pregnancy 9-Hg/dl<br/>Moderate Anaemia in pregnancy 7-9g/dl<br/>Severe Anaemia in pregnancy 7g/dl</p> <p><strong>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</strong><br/>For haemoglobin and Red blood cell synthesis, iron, folate, vitamin Biz and Vitamin c, trace elements like cobate and copper, and proteins are required. Erythroporetin produced by the renal parenchyma stimulates the bone marrow to increase erthropesis which is one of the noticeable physiological changes in pregnancy. Barnes, F.C (1994).<br/>In the non-pregnant female, the total body is about 3.5-kg. 2/3 of this is Haemoglobin another ¼ is in the body stores and the remaining is in the tissue and plasma. Iron is stored in the liver and spleen as femitin and in bone marrows haemosiderin. Iron in the serum is bound to transfer in, a B1 – globulin and transfers is only 1/3 saturated with iron. A good diet provides about 10-15mg of iron per a day and only 10% of this is absorbed. Iron is mainly absorbed in the duedenuim and to some extent in the upper jejunum. The absorption is influenced by dietary phosphates, phytaces, ascorbic acid, sugars especially frutole, Hell in the stomach and gastric factors namely factors I, II and II, iron is lost in the bile, urine, fences, sweat and during menstruation. About 1-2mg of iron is lost daily.<br/>In normal pregnancy, iron demand is increased many folds. The fetus need about 350mg, the placenta about 100mg: the increased material haemoglobin mass about 350mg and that from lactation about 150mg. In adding the pregnant women still excretes iron but on the credit side about 225mg of iron is available as a result of the amenorrhea of pregnancy is about 15%. The increased iron requirement is not uniformly spread over the period of pregnancy but as pregnancy advances from 28 weeks onwards, the increased demand is noticed as a resultant drop in PCV or HB concentration it no iron supplementation has been given Abidu, O, Sofola (1990).</p> <p><strong>COMPLICATIONS</strong><br/>In the absence of effective treatment, anaemia develops progressively as the pregnancy advances.<br/>The following complications may occurs;<br/>I<strong>. CONGESTIVE CARDIA FAILURE:</strong> This is the main effect of anaemia muscle oxygen lacse. The most dangerous period is during the first 12 hours after delivery.<br/>II. SHOCK: Severely anaemic women readity go into shock as a result of very small amount of blood loss and motality in such patients.</p> <p><strong>TREATMENT</strong><br/>This disease cannot be cured, but can be managed for some extent. Air travel during pregnancy should be avoided, especially in unpressurised air crafts sinle the resultant anorexic may cause splenic or other vital organ infection of anaemic pregnant women in our environment should be examined for worms and ova of hookworm. However infestation of hookworm can be prevented by good food and personal hygiene and also protecting the slein from penetration for the worms by wearing fast wears.<br/>Blood transfusion is given with caution in cases where the anaemia is severe, that is HB less than 5g/dl or PCV less than 5% or in cases where moderate anemia co-existing with seplis or Haemorrhage is discovered late after 36 weeks or in labour or immediate pos-partum<br/><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br/>The project work is aimed at the following:<br/>1.

The fungal count for pap I and II ranged from 8.2 x 105 to 2.5x1012 and 8.2x106 to 3.6x1010 respectively. The bacteria isolated from stee pingwere Lactabacillus species Bacillus specie, Corynebacterium, streptococcus specie and clostridium species. The fungi were Aspergillus species fusrarium specie, pencillium specie sachanomyces specie and candida specie. The bacteria spp isolated from stored pap were lactobacillus species, streptococcus specie Eubacterium specie, Pseudomonas specie, Baccillus specie, streptococcus specie, Lactobacillus specie, Leucomostoc specie for pap I and II respectively. The fungi isolated were Aspergillus specie, Pensillum specie, fusarium specie, sacharomyces specie, candida specie, Debaryomyces specie for pap I and II respectively. The pap stored without changing water developed an off flavour after 48 hours and is not fit for consumption. On the other hand, the pap stored while changing water is fit and better for consumption. </div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong><br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Cereals have been known to man from the earliest times porridge prepared from cereals are eaten in different parts o the world, especially in developing countries where they may present the basic diet. This porridge could be baked to enhance the taste, quality and improve digestibility (Oke 1967, Adeniyi and Potter 1978, Uno and field 1981).<br/>Corn (zea mays) is one of cereals which is an important raw material in human diet. In Nigeria, maize is grown mainly in the southern part of Nigeria while sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and millet (perinisetum typhoideum) are grown in the northern part of the country. A fermented cereal product is known as paplogi). Corn is processed into traditional food such as paplogi) Umo and fields 1981).<br/>Pap is a fermented non-alcoholic starchy food and is a major staple food widely consumed in west Africa. It is a sour fine past beverage which when cooked produces a thin semi solid porridge. Pap (Ogi) porridge has a smooth texture and a sour taste resembling that of yoghurt,. In Nigeria, some states such as Anambra, Imo, Enugu and Abia refer to it as Akamu but Ogi is a Yoruba name but most state of Nigeria, it refers to maize pap. On the other hand, sorghum pap is known as Ogi baba while millet pap is known as Ogi gero in Yoruba (Banigi 1977, Onyekwere and Akinrele 1977).<br/>Pap logi) can be consumed with variety of other product including with bread, steamed been cake (moi-moi), fried bean cake (Akara), fried yam and plantain etc. it is used as a main meal for adult and sick patients and it is suitable for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Pap is widely used as the first native food given to babies at wearing to supplement breast milk and is a major breakfast cereal for pre-school children and adults. It is consumed as a main meal for convalescing patients because it can easily be digested. As a wearing food, it is utilized mainly by low income earners category, it is estimated that about 25 million or more adults eat it about 4-5 days weakly (Banigo 1972). Milk and sugar may be added to improved the taske and nutritional quality. Pap is cooked and turned into a stiff gel called Agidi which is similar to kenkey, a fermented shanian product (Muller 1988, withby 1968). Some Yoruba indigens beliwved that pap is capable of stimulating the production of breast milk in Nursing mother (Bassir 1962). However, there has been no qualitative evidence of support of this belief.<br/>In spite of it’s important in the Nigeria diet, pap manufacture is essential a home based industry. There are at present no large scale factory operation for the production of pap. The manufacture is carried out on a small scale by some house wives as a commercial venture in many parts of the country. The cleaned grain free of dirt and impurities steeped in eastern ware, plastic or enamel pot for 1-3 days at room temperature, this is followed by wet milling and sieving. Twenty-four (24) hours of sleeping leads to a greater depletion of the fermentable carbohydrate. After sieving, the coarse material obtained is wash with water to separate more of the starch. The filtered slurry is allowed to sediment and undergo further fermentation for 1-2 days at room temperature. The coarse matter which is separated is used ad animal feed while the sediment (Pap) is boiled to obtain.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>Microorganisms are involved in the processing of pap especially during fermentation and equally during storage. Few organisms are found in the pap, if it is properly stored. Their presence in pap during storage leads to irregular of flavour and loss of nutrients (van veen and steinkrans 1990). This is the result of their metabolic activity in the stored pap.<br/>The tradiitonal method of pap production using various grains encourage significant nutrient losses, Losses m,ay occur during steeping, milling and sieving.

This work will serve as a survey on how Nigerians in general will react towards the operation of National health insurance scheme. Many researchers have made numerous proposals on how the scheme should be operated, but now the scheme has started. It will be proper to examine the market reactions, acceptability and its effect on the economy.<br/>Moreover since the Logan “health care for all by the year 2000” is within its reality, it is felt that for such to be achieved, National health insurance scheme should take place. And the government, ministry of health and the general public should control the scheme. It has been noted that health insurance is more advanced and modern alternative to the tax-financed.<br/>Nat with standing, this work gave a view of what National health insurance is, its forms, its benefits and other important aspects that will put a layman through on what National health insurance is. It was noticed that as government has taken up the scheme, it will encounter a lot of challenges and difficulties. This research work included recommendations on how the government could subdue such difficulties and challenges of health are delivery.</p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY </strong><br/>Since 1981 when the Nigerian medical Association held a conference in Calabar and Dr. E.M Umez Sroums delivered aa paper on “National health insurance” A practical approach to health care financing in a developing economy. He said that there has been growing need for National health insurance scheme in Nigeria. This issue has engaged the attention of medical doctors, insurance executive, the federal government of Nigeria, and Nigerian Newspapers which have carried a member of headlines on the topic. <br/>But now the scheme has become a reality. The federal government lunched the scheme on 6th June 2005. Base on the establishment of the scheme, the purpose of providing health insurance which shall entitle insured persons and their dependents the benefit of prescribed good quality and cost effective health services as set out in this Decree. That is Decree of 2000. The body established for the management of the scheme are: <br/>A governing council which shall subject to the decree, which has general control of the scheme. The council shall consist of the following members:<br/>The chairman who shall be appointed by the head of state. Commander in chief of minister of health. Others are: each person to represent ministry of health, fiancé, government of the federation, Nigeria labour congress, N.E.C.A, private health care provided to carryout a research on this subject in order to highlight the problems militating against the scheme or problems which the scheme will face. Its prospects and make recommendations which will ensure the success of the scheme here in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS </strong><br/>A lot have been done by various groups and bodies in order to come up with a benefiting scheme that will achieve an effective goal of health care for all Nigerians, which has been in highlights of government programmes. <br/>There are problems that night hinder the effective national health insurance scheme in Nigeria.<br/>i) Inadequate public Enlightment on the need for national health insurance service.<br/>ii) The population of Nigerians did not welcome the scheme <br/>iii) Non introduction of phase by phase structurally scheme.<br/>iv) Its marketing strategies and means of operating the scheme <br/>v) Non support of masses in response to the scheme for seminar.<br/>In order to improve health care delivery system in Nigeria; the researcher must ensure that this research will problems that might hinder the effective National health insurance scheme in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>Based on the problems surrounding the scheme. This work will examine. <br/>i) How far insurance industry has gone in seeding to the effective of National health insurance scheme in Nigeria.<br/>ii) The out come of various committees established to make that National health insurance scheme to be a successful one in Nigeria.<br/>iii) To know the peoples reaction and market acceptability of the scheme.<br/>iv) To recommend through these research work proper guidelines and means which the scheme will operate in our country for a complete market acceptance by all Nigerians.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This projects will be of great importance to all Nigerians who for long shares same view that our Nation Nigeria need to adopt a health care insurance that will fair of loss cost, efficient and effective in the administration and operation.<br/>However, on more pronounce detail, this study’s importance on individual basis that will be of help if its recommendation are adopted to facilitate the immediate acceptance of National health insurance by all, it will create health care finance awareness on a model way which will encourage personal contribution of ideas fiancé and materials towards ensuring a good health care delivery to all.<br/>Organization, institutions and business entities who spent huge amount of money for there employees and families for health insurance will becomes operational in Nigeria. This will be achieved of such scheme is adopted in line with the research recommendation and the little amount saved will be channeled to other profitable venture.<br/>Nigerians will also fire the study beneficial, if the guideline and recommendation are adopted in establishing National health insurance scheme in Nigeria which will obtain its health for all by the scheme.<br/>The health sector will witness efficiency the scheme will eliminate corruption indiscipline, fraud and ensuring death reduction from, all health, this in variable will lead to an increase in Nigeria citizens due to in improving bur artic and depressed health care delivery system will on establishing National health insurance scheme will fined Nigeria a worthy place to live and their money.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Scope and limitation of the study</strong><br/>This work for easier understanding and implementation covers all analytical research aimed within the country for the establishment of health insurance including the held since 1990 till date for the establishment of National health insurance scheme. As National health insurance scheme has introduced now there are some problems that its prospects and problems that its prospects and problems in the economy. During the project some problems faces the research they are:<br/>Financial constraint <br/>Time constraint <br/>Knowing how the public will react as the scheme has been introduced today.<br/>To identifying the suitable type of National health insurance in operating such scheme.<br/>How to engage a massive support from all Nigerian if the response to the scheme is now. <br/>Its marketing strategies and means of operating such scheme.<br/>Those problems as mentioned will be relayed in details how each a constraint to this research work.<br/>Financial contrant <br/>Due to lack of enough fund, the researcher could not meet all required financial obligations which the work demands, this never, resulted to a few limitations.<br/>Time constraint<br/>As we know time is never on anyone’s side, so it was a constraint to our research work because there was other programmes such as examination quiz and other academic works which fell exactly within the period of our research work and all these programmes plus the research demanded till the same and equal attention.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Definition of terms </strong><br/>i) Insurance company: A company registered or demand to be registered under the companies and Allied Matter Decree of 1997.<br/>ii) Health: It is a sound of bodily or mental condition of a person. <br/>iii) Health insurance: The ability to get health services when required without having to pay fully at the time of need either because payment has previously been made by regular contributions by the insured or his/her employer or both.<br/>iv) Health care delivery: The act or process of administering effective medication and hospitalization to sick people in a community at a reduce rate.<br/>v) Capitation: Registered payment on personal basis to a doctor for giving health service to a person concerned when necessary.<br/>vi) National health insurance scheme: It is a body corporate established under Act 35 of 1999 by the federal government of Nigeria to improve the health of all Nigeria at an affordable cost. </p> </div> </div>\n\nNATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME IN NIGERIA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME IN NIGERIA ", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>PREVALENCE OF TRICHOMONA VAGINALIS AMONG ADULTS </p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>The prevalence of Trichomonas Vaginalis among adult in “Osumenyi” in Nnewi south local government Area of Anambra state was carried out. This was done using a stotal of one hundred adults from there different clinics viz ;- Health center, family planning and Antenatal Clinic in Osumenyi; in Nnewi South L.G.A of Anambra State. the general prevalence was 37 (37%) positive cases out of the 100 samples used. The highest number of positive cases were seen in Health centre Clinics, Osumenyi with (20%) positive cases, followed by family planning clinic, Osumenyi with (14%) positive cases and the least in Antenatal clinic in Osumenyi with (4% positive cases. The parasitic organism was confirmed using wet mount preparation of urine and genital secretions. The organism trichomonas vaginalis was identified by its Jerky swaying motion or jumpy movement. It was observed that the prevalence was highest in adults in the age range 31-45 years with 19 cases (19%) positive, followed by the age range 16-30 years with 10 cases (10%). Next was in aga-range 46-60 years with 5 cases (5%) and least in age-range 61-75 years with 3 cases (3%)</div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>Donne first discovered and named Trichomonas Virginalis in 1836.He found the orgnaism in genital secretions 7 women and men, but it was initially regarded as non-pathogenic (Donne, 1936). Trichomonas vaginalis is a pear-shaped, flagellaatic, motile protogoa, with an undulating membrance. It is about 10-20 Hm wide, and oxide. The organism is propelled by four anterior flagella with a flagellium attached to an undulating membrance (Heine, 1993). I. Vaginalis is a eukaryrote, anaeobic and does not contain mitochoria in its cytop[lasm but instead contains specialized granules called hydrogenosomes throguh out the region of the cytoplasm with a slender posteriorly protruding regid rod called axostyle (Nester, est el, 2001 and Rultyle, 1983). I. Vaginalis exist only as a trophozoile and do not take o a cyst from (Lossick, 1990). Due to the organism’s unique energy metabolism,s the organism bears a strong resemblance to anaerobic bacteria (Petriu, 1998). In wet mount preparation of vaginal secretions, the live organism can often be recognised by its unmistakably swaying motion (Nester et al, 2001). I. Vaginalis grows best under anearobic conditions and at elevated PH levels. Masimum growth and metabolic functions are greatest at PH of 6.0 (Spence, 1992) In accord with its anaerobic state, sthese interesting cytoplasmic double –bounded organelles (hydrogenosomes) remove the carboxyl group (CooH) from pyruvate and trasnfer electrons to hydrogen gas (Nester et al, 2001). I. Vaginalis derives its glucose into oseccinate, acelate, malate, and hydrogen. In addition it produces some carbondioxide but nost via the kreb cycle pathway (Dyall and Johnson, 2000).<br/>I. vaginalis causes sexually transmitted inecxtion (STI) called Trichomoniasis. This infection is the most common nonviral sexually transmistted disease in the world. Trichomoniasis, sometimes referred to as “Trich” is primarily an infection of the urogenital tract,. Which infects both men and women. The urethra is the most common site for I. Vaginalis infection in men. The organism can aslo be detected in the epididymis, semen and urine (Krieger, 1981). I. Vaginalis was first located in prostatie secretions from husbands of infected women (Drummond, 1936). In women, vagina is the most, common site of the infection the organism may be isolated from the cervix, vagina, bartholins glands, bladder and occasionally. The upper sreproductive / urinary tract (Reing, 1990). Over 95% of infections have been isolated from vagina and only 5% from the urinaryu tract of adult women (Grys, 1964) the urethra and skene’s glands are infected in 90% of cases. There have also been instances where organisms were isolated from bladder urine (Thoniason, 1989). Infected men are usually asymsptomatic carriers of the organisms (Krieger, 1995) which most symptomatic I.Vaginalis infection occur in women (Wolner- Hanssen, 1989). It ranks third after bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis among the diseases that commonly cause vaginal symptoms (Nester, et al, 2001). According to World Health Organisation’s annual, estimates, There are an estimated 7.4 million trichomoniasis cases each year in the united states, with over 180 million cases reported world wide (Weinstock et al, 2004). WHO in 1999 states that the infection rates have been reported by some researchers to be as high as 67% in Monogolia in 1988 (Schwebke, et al, of 40 – 60% in Africa and 40% in indigenous Australians. Trichomoniasis rates are also high in inner city populations in the united states. I . vaginal is was originally considered a commensal until in the 1950s when the understanding of its role as a sexually transmitted infection began to involve (Swygard, et al, 2004). Trichomoniasis often leads to vaginitis, an acute inflammatrory disease of genital mucosa.<br/>This infection is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight and increase in infant mortality. It also pre-disposes individuas to HIV/AIDS and cervical cancer (Cohen, 2000 and Upcroft and Upcroft, 2001). Among both women and men, I. Vaginalis is emerging as one o the most important factors in transmission and acquisition of HIV infection (Sorvillo, 1998). In women, the health complications include increased risks for the following, infertility, development of a typical pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infection following gynecologic suggery and cervical inflammatory neoplasia. There have also been high rates of correlation between trichonioniasis and pregnancy complication in women (Cotch, 1997). In men, I vaginals has been linked to main factor in infertility and as a common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men (Sch webke 2002, and soper, 2004). Minkoff, et al (1984) identified a strong association between I vaginalis infection and prefern rupture of membrane. Several studies have showns I. Vaginalis to be a rish factor for tubal infertility (El-Shazly, 2001). Sorvillo (1998) states that I.Vaginalis may amplify HIV – I transmission by increasing subceptibity in an HIV-1 negative person and the infectiousness in an HIV-1positive patient. He further stats that I. Vafinalis is emerging as one of the most important cofactor in amplifying HIV transmission particularly in African American Communities in the united state (Sorvillo, 2001). The association of trichomoniasis with HIV amplification is seen among men as well (Hobbs, 1999). I. Vaginalis has a significantly increased incidence of HIV transmission (Jackson, et al, 1998). I vaginalis elicits an aggressive local cellular immune response with a heavy influx of target cells in HIV. This response may increase a seronegative individual. Conversely in an HIV-seropisitive individual, punctuate haemorrhages, That are frequently associated wit I vaginalis infection, increased shedding and subsequent transmission of the virus (Cohen, et al, 1997).<br/>In women, the infection is often characterised by vaginal i.e a thin foamy yellow – green, frothy vaginal discharge, vaginal odour, sometimes macodoros, pains with sexual intercourse, pain with urination and vulvovaginal sorness (Itching) (Rein, 1990, and Nester et al, 2001). (Common clinical signs include vulva erythema, inflammation excess of white blood cells seen on a wet mount preparation of vaginal discharge, numerous polymorphonuclear nuetrophils (Similar in size with Trichomonads) and occasional red blood cell (Rein, 1980), motile trichomonads in the wet mount preparation and a vaginal PH above 5.0, most of which overlap with Baterial vaginosis (Rein, 1984, and Wolner-Hassen, 1989). The wall of the vagina and vulvu are diffusely red and slightly swollen (Nester et al, 2001). I vaginalis infection is a persistant disease of genitourinary tract, characterised with foul odour, serve cases, puncstuate or scattered pinpoint haemorrhagos are present. It may also cause preumonies bronchitis (public Health Agency of Canada. (PHAC) 2001, and MC Laren, et al, 1983). These symptoms usually appear within four to twenty days of exposure. In men, the infection is more difficult to detect as the majority of infections remain a symptomatic and readily available diagnotic techniques are inadequate this is problematic since long tewrm carriage of I vaginalis in a symptomatic men have been documented up to 4 months (Kreiger, 1993). Most men seeking treatment do so because of htier infected partners (Hager, 1994). Up to 50% males are usally a symptomatic with the organism persisting in their prostate gland or seminal vesicles (Krieger, 1995). Symptoms in men typically include Urethral discharge, dysuria, mild prurities licting burning after intercourse (Kreiger 1995, and Latif, 1987). These may casue Urethritis, prostatis, reversible sterility and semen PH is 78.1 – 8.0 (Gopalkrishnan, 1990). This changes have been attributed to the mechanical trauma by the moving protozoa, but toxins or exotoxins have not be ruled out by the organism. The frothy discharge is probably due to gas produced by the organism (Nester, et al, 2001).<br/>The life cycle of I. Vaginalis is still poorly understood. The trophozoite lives in close association with the epithelia of the urogenital tract (Latif et al, 1987) and reproduces by longitudinal binary fission (Nester et al. 2001). I vaginalis is distributed world wide as a human parasite and has no other reserviors (Nester et al, 2001) the mode of transmission is by intimate or direct copntact with vaginal and urethral discharges of infected persons during sexual intercourse rarely occurs by intimate contact with contaminated articles. The highest rate of infection with multiple sex partners and congenital infection is possible (That is from infected mother to infant at child birth althought infrequent). New born girls can acquire the infection from their infected mothers through birth canal. In such cases, the infection tends to remain a symptomatic unstil puberty (Nester et al, 2001, Bradley, et al, 1993 and public Health Agency Canada (PHAC) 2001). The organism can survive for hours on moist objects such as damp towels clothes and bathtubs of infected women (Lossick, 1989 and Nester et al, 2001). Nonsexual transmission is extremely rare sine i. Vaginalis infection is generally rstricted to a specific sites namely the urogenital tract Ithomason (1989). The only known nonviral form of transmission is through perinatal acquisition. Approximately 5% of female babies born of infected mothers contract the infection (Bramley, 1976). Nevetheless, I. Vaginalis infection in children should at least raise the question of sexual abuse and p[ossible exposure to other sexually transmitted diseases (Nester et al, 2001). Evidence for sexual transmission of I. Vainalis is very strong as prevalence is highest among patients with increased sexual acitivity and mul;tiple partners. Approximately 14-65% of male partners of infected females are also infected (Krieger, 1995, and Sena, 2003). The incubation period before symptoms arise is 4-28 days and years for persistat infection (PHAC, 2001). There is high percentage of a sympstomatic carriers especially among men and this fosters tranmission of the disease (Nester et al, 2001). Asymptomatic infected individuals factors in trichomoniasis transmission. Many studies have shown that treatment of the male partner (s) of infected women improves bsoth cure rates and recurrence rates (Hager, 1980 and lyng, 1981).</p> <p><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>1. To determine the prevalence of I. Vaginalis among adults in”Osumenji” in Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra state.<br/>2. To determine the age level which are msore susceptible to the infection<br/>3. To determine the sex with higher prevalence of the infection</p> <p><strong>1.2 HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>Ho - The prevalence of I. Vaginalis is higher in women than in men.<br/>Hi - The prevalence of I vaginalis is not higher in women than in men<br/>H2 - The prevalence of I vaginalis occurs more in young adults than in older people.</p> <p><strong>1.3 LIMITATION/SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is limited to adults in “Osumenyi” in Nnewi south local Government Area of Anambra state.</p> <p><strong>1.4 LIMITATION IN THE STUDY</strong><br/>1 There is high cost of the materials involved in the practical work.<br/>2 Also, many individuals failed to willingly give out specimens for analysis due to unawareness and superstitious belief among people ind developing countries when a survey needs volunteers for a case study.<br/>3 Optimal diagnostic method for detecting trichomoniasis among men are unavailable, contributing to low detection inmmen (Krieger, 1993).</p> <p><strong>1.5 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>Trichomoniasis is a prevalent sexually transmitted disease (STB) pathogen that will not go away because we ignore it (Bowden and Garneth, 1999). Moreover, according to Duboucher (2003), data collected suggest that trichomonads are overlooked parastites and may be mplicated in various pathologies. Therefore it I pertinent to determine the prevalence of I. Vaginalis among adults.</p> <p><strong>1.6 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The ressults project research revealed high prevalence of I. Vaginalis among adults, therefore, there is need for screening of the adult population from time to time.

Every year, 200-300 million people are due to the disease. Most of the victims are children under five (5) and pregnant women in areas of stable malaria (intence malaria) transmission. Malaria also poses a risk to travellers, tarists and immigrants and exotic cases of malaria are<br/>There are four species of Plasmodium which infects humans. although infection is generally cases occur in the USA and other countries which are otherwise free of malaria transmission. Falciparum, and Plasmodium vivaz, which are found throughout malaria belt. Plasmodium malaria is widely distributed but less common Plasmodium Ovale is rare but it tends to replace P. Viax in west Africa where it has been linked with Lack of Duffy blood group by (John Murray, 1880).<br/>The life cycle of the malaria (Plasmodium protozoa) includes of the malaria (plasmodium protozoa)includes three basic stages. The first stage occurs in the mosgintos body (Exogenous stage). The second and the third stages take place in a persons body (exogenous stage) the first stage begins where the mosginto bites Samoan who has malaria. Plasmodium enter the insects body and reproduce in its stomach. The protozoan young tin their way into the mosguito saliva. The second stage occurs after the mosquito bites another person. Plasmodia.<br/>During the third stage, each plasmodium invades a red blood cell, where it multiples again. The infected blood cells eventually rapture and release large numbers of plasmodia, which invades additional red blood cells. This invasism, multiplying and cell rupture by, the parasites continues, causing the periodic attacks of fever that are typical of malaria. An attack occurs each time the red blood cells rupture. Some plasmodia develop further in human blood and are able to reproduce in a mosquitoes body. They enter the insects body when the mosquito bites a person their life cycle begins again.</p> <p>Figure: THE LIFE CYCLE OF THEMALARIA PARASITE</p> <p>Human malaria can be transmitted only by female anopheline mosquitoes. In addition to transmitting malaria, anophelines also transmits filariasis and some viral disease, but other mosquitos are more important as vectors of the two latter infections. The Anopheless belong to the order of Diptera, sub-order Nematocera, family culicidae sub-family culicinae and tribe Anophelim in the zoological classification.. within the tribe Anophelin, the germs anopheles has several sub-genera. (Ketchum 1984).<br/>There are about 400 species of Anophelese mosquitoes throughout the world, but only some 60 species are vectors of malaria under natural conditions: of these some 30 species are of major importance. Natural susceptibility or resistance of Anapheles to infection with a defined species of malaria parasite is largely unexplained though it is certainly related to biochemical processes in the body of the mosquito and to its nutritional requirements. Among the main factors determining whether a particular species of Abophelese is an important vector, the frequency of its feeding on man (in preference to animals) is of particular relevance. The other factors are the mean longevity of the local population of an anpheline species and its density in relation to man. Thus, a particular species of Anopheles may be an important vector in one area of the world and of no importance in another area. Although Anopheles mosquitoes are most frequently seen in tropical or subtropical regions, they are found in termperate climates. They life expertance of the mosquito depends on enviroenmntal conditions.<br/>The external morphology of both female and male anophels provides the main criteria for recognising both the genus and the species of these mosquito. The successive stages of growth and metamorphosis of the mosquito are the egg, lava, pupa and finally the adult or imigo.<br/>In general, malaria is yound in regions lying roughly between latitute 60N and 400 of the equator. The impart of malaria on any population depends upon its epidemilogical pattern. Nigeira has endemic and stable malaria (Meneudez, 1995).<br/>CLASSIFICATION = (Beadle 1977) classified malaria parasite as follows:-<br/>- Phylum - Protozoa<br/>- Class - Sporozoa<br/>- Order - Coccidida<br/>- Sub-order - Haemosporina<br/>- Family - Plasmodidae<br/>- Germs - Plasmodium<br/>Thus plasmodium (protozoa: Haemo sporina) secure malaria to man and it is atransmitted by female Anopheline mosquitoo during blood meal.</p> <p>Malaria cause by Four species of Plasmodium.<br/>Malaria cause by P. Falciparium is refered to as Falciparium malaria, formely known as subtertian (ST) or malignant tertian (MT) malaria. It is the msot widespread, accounting for up tpo 80% of malaria cases worldwide. P. Falciparum is the msot pathogenic of the human malaria species with untreated infections causing severe disease and death, particularly in yousng children, pregnant women and no-immune adults. According to (Trigg and kondrachine, 1998) P. Facciparum causes yearly 300 million to 500 million cases of clinical illness and 1-5 million to 2.7 million deaths in sub-saharan Africa, plus 5-20 million clinical cases and 100,000 deaths else where in the world 80% of them in Asta.<br/>In a pregnant women, Normal immune responses are reduced during pregnancy. In areas of stable malaria transmission, a pregnant women will have acquired partial immunity to malaria. This will protect her against serious clinical Falciparum malaria but not present heavy parastic infection of the placenta and anaemia (often severe) which can result in a low birth weight baby which may not survive.<br/>Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax is referred as vivax, formerly known as benign tertian (BT) malaria.<br/>Malaria caused by Plasmodium Ovale is referred to as ovale malaria, formerly known as ovale tertian malaria. While that of Plasmodium malaria is referred to as malariae malaria, also referred to as quartan malaria.<br/>Infections caused by P.Vivax, P. Ovale or P.malarine are rarely life – threatening according to parasite cells does not occure and parasitic densities are lower. In vivax and ovale malaria, parasites numbers rarely exceed 50000 /N/ or 2% of cells infected, and in quatan malaria (P. malaria) parasite numbaer are usually less than 10,000/ML with only up to 1% of cells becoming infected.<br/>P.Vivax and Ovale malaria has a common feature “Relapses” due to the delayed development of pre-erythrocytic (PE) schizonts from hyprozoites in liver cells. While P. Malariae has a feature of repeated malaria attacks due to recrudescence caused by small numbers of erythrocytic forms of the parasite persisting in the host, possibly as a recent of parasitic antigenic charge.<br/>A serious complication infection with P. Malariae is “ne phrotic syndrome” which may head to renal failure. It occurs more frequently in children and is caused by damage to the kidneys following the deposition of antigen anti-body completes on the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney.</p> <p><strong>1.1 AIM AND OBJECTIVE</strong><br/>1. The aim of this research project is to demonstrate the incidence of malaria infestation caused by different species of plasmodium<br/>2. To identify the commonest species of plasmodium implicated in the attack.<br/>3. To identify stages of plasmodium in the patients.<br/>4. To confirms the population at risk<br/>5. To make recommendation that would assist in the reduction or eradication of malaria especially among children in Enugu metropolis and the society ins general.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong><br/>The major problem with diseases in developing world has been the failure to set realistic priorities with respect to both research and control. As clinical diagnosis fail to effectively lay emphasis on species specificity in malaria attack, and as there are today increasing cases of chloroquine resistant in malaria therapy, a good knowledge of species specificity may help to claudicate the lathert causes of the problems in malaria therapy. Finding from this work will clearly identify the followings:<br/>1. The different species of plasmodium treatment<br/>2.

The virus is typically called Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because it destroys the Immune system of the individual which is responsible for protecting the individual from disease. The immunodeficiency associated with, HIV infection can be enormous, and it is the major cause of death, due to the disfucntion of immune system. The problem with AIDS is , sits neurological dementia complex. HIV is a lentivirus, a subgroup of retrovirus. The family of virus is known for lafency, persistent viremia, infection of the nervous system and weak hot immune system. Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is small ultra-microscopic organism that infect living things and uses them to make copies of itself when one’s Immune system is damaged by HIV, AIDS take place (Gallants, 1999).<br/>HIV was first recognized in 1981 in Homosexual men in New York city. In the united states the HIV is now known to have originated from chimpanzees, transmission from chimps to human. Initially, there was wild speculation about what might be the cause of AIDs, but in 1982, the centre for disease control had convincing epidermological evidence that AIDS was caused by a new infectious agents.<br/>Dulbecco et-al (1983, located small quantities of the new virus named Lymphademopalty virus (LAN) but enough to be used an antigenina blood test which showed that AIDS patients were infected with the virus. WHO, (19097), responded that the number of patients living with AIDS has escaculated, a figure of 9000 was confirmed by may 1997. In African AIDs was first responded in 1982. In Nigerian it was first responded in 1986, among commercial sex workers in Lagos and calabar. In 2003 the seroprevalence has been on the increase, despite the comprehensive and successful prevention effort in many part of the would, 4. 1 million new HIV infection was expected to have occurs In 2003 alone, which could have been contributed by an estimated 9,020 to 10,000 infection per day.<br/>Currently, the health problem in Nigerian considering reports from various hospitals particularly, the tertiary hospitals, place AIDS infections in Nigerian at a very serious state. the potential and propensity for widespread is enormous and the debilitating and negative effect n the economy, the population category affected the working class and the dependents which constitute the penultimate individuals to the working class. HIV infections in this direction and orientation should be healed as a national emergency in Nigeria.<br/>Meanwhile, Dr. Robert Gallo’s laboratory begin recovering a virus from AIDS patient, and reported the finding in the science journal. A number of these vinal isolated was introduced together into continuous cell cultures to see if a strain of the virus could replicate in the cells one did replicates and Gallo’s named the virus HILV. III because of the resemblance to two human T-lymphotropic viruses. (Neser, 2001).<br/>By 2004, it was shown that many esymtomatic people was infected with virus and could transmits it and that the epidemic was far more extensive than previously suspected. Blood test was generally available for routine testing to donate blood. Thus markedly improving the safety of blood transfusion and products prepared from pooled blood (peiperls, 1995)</p> <p><strong>1.1 Hypothesis</strong><br/>H.O: There is significant difference in the result of Westernblots (WB), Enzymes Linked Immuno (Elisa) and Radiommuneoassay kit among HIV carriers.<br/>HI: There is no significant difference in the result of Enzymes linked – immurosorbentassay (Elise), Western blots (WB), and Radommunoasay kit (RIA) among HIV carriers.</p> <p><strong>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br/>To evalulate the current techniques used in the diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).<br/>To help recommend the best and most reliable one essaying HIV</p> <p><strong>1.3 Statement of problems</strong><br/>The major problem with HIV/AIDs in developing would has been the failure to set realistic priorities with respect to both research and control.<br/>As clinical diagnosis fail to effectively by emphasis on the virus attack is they are increasing case on HIV infection.

The infestation of fungal organism on bread depends on the kind and number of the agent present and upon the environment about them. this statement makes it clear that micro organism infest foods having suitable environment condition for their microbial activity. This project work is centered on knowing the fungal micro-organisms that infests bread which emails the isolation and identification of the fungal organisms, the source of contamination a known standardized system called hazard analysis critical control point which ensures hygienically produced breads. The material and method email the collection of bread samples from five different shops AT Artisan market, Enugu, the method used is the isolation technoloque and the identification of filamention fungi and yeast by wet mount and fluorescence microscopy. The result obtained were gotten by counting the colonies grown on the culture medium (Nutrient agar) and the mean of duplicate was then calculated, some fungal micro organisms seen viewed unbder the microscope are as follows; <br/>Mucon SpP <br/>Aspergillus flarus <br/>Aspergillus fumigatus <br/>Penicillium Spp <br/>Rhizopus Spp</div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong><br/>1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION. </strong><br/>Food can be contaminated with spoilage on pathogenic organisms ( micro). Infestation of these fungal organisms spoil the product so that it is not fit to eat; it also changes the taste so that the product is not desirable. The concept of food infestation of fungal organisms is based on the consipteration for fiutres of consumption. Infestation is defined as the over presence alone has led to its growth and microbial activity. Pathogenic organisms however can cause food poisoning. Food poisoning can arise through infatuation of food by organisms (micro) which secrete toxins which B their consumed. The cost of fungal infested bread resulting to spoilage is also great with loss of money due to wastage of the raw materials. Also considering the usefulness of this product in the community with the management of money being spent it has also helped in the sense that since it is regarded as a fast food it is being bought and consumed directly without further preparations done. Effect of contaminated bread in the society can lead to an epidemic of gastrointestinal disorder where by that particular environment that consumed the contaminate bread become affected there by developing stomach upset. As a result of this a lot of consideration should be given to breads that are sent into the community to be sold and this is done by the standardized system called HACCP ie hazards Analysis critical control point. This method is now generally considered as a choice for ensuring safety of foods (jay 1996 de Boer and Beumer 1999) hazzard analysis critical control point involves identifying places in the production process where hazzard could occur. i.e. the CCp (critical control point” and putting monitoring procedures in place to prevent these hazards occurring even with this system in place samples still need to be tested for the presence of micro organism. <br/>Detection of most of the micro organisms requires growth of the organism on selective media which can take a number of days from isolation to identification. These method are sensitive and gives qualitative information on the number and nature of the micro organism. Present in a food sample. However, conventional methods require several day to produce result because they rely on the ability of micro organisms to multiply to visible colonies (De Boser and Beumer 1999). Presentation of bread commonly involves the use of propionates and sorbates and sometime henzoates. Preservatives are added to retain on to increase the shelf life by preventing the micro-organism responsible for the contamination of that food. There alter natives to preservatives have been bought also. The chief types of microbial spoilage of bread as a result of fungal infestation will also studied which is moldiness. Rapines is also another type of bread spoilage but unfortunately it wont be studies due to the fact that it is caused by bacterial organism which unfortunately is not a fugal organisms and as a result is not in the scope of study for this research work. Also a spoilage not so common called CHALKY BREAD caused by a yeast like Fungi, will be diseased.</p> <p><strong>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This project is based on the isolation and identification of the fungi organism responsible for the spoilage of bread.

It consist of two atoms of hydrogen combined with one atom of oxygen. Water is a tasteless, odourless and colourless mobile liquid except in large volume where it appears blue. It has a melting point of OoC (320f) and a boiling point of 1000C (2120f). water is a basic necessity of life, in the absence higher animals survive only but a few hours or days. It has several uses such as washing cooking, food processing ,swimming, and among others. Out of these uses, drinking of water seems to be the most sensitive as it could have a direct deleterious impact on health of human beings. <br/>Therefore, drinking water should be potable free diseases, or toxic substance (Beren 1991) .<br/>Water is portable when it is colourless. Odourless, or tasteless and also free from poisonous, corroding, staining substances as well as disease casuiong oirganisms (Cruich 1972). The problem of providing safe and adequate water is as old as life on earth. Water can be made unifit or unsafe for drinking it contamination occurs either by nature or activities of human beings. <br/>Perhaps the greatest danger associated with drinking water is contamination by human excrement (Forest 1979). In most cases, the pollution/contamination is hardly severe and is not particularly detrimental to health. <br/>Thus a few substances and microbes that are health hazard do occur in water, and can cause illness or even death. From microbiological point of view, the pathogens most frequently transmitted through water supply ranges from ultrasmall virus to the microspic bacteria and relatively large cysts entemoeba instolytica. These organism cense infectrons of intestinal trach, when consumed censing amebic dysentery, and Gardia lamblia is a protozoa responsible for Giadiasis. Defective plumbing for example was the cause of out break during the world fair in Chicago 1933 (Garelick 1987) water borne disease cause acute diarrhoe, often last 2-3 months. The most common water borne disease can be by bacteria includes typhoid fever, paratyphoid. Asiatic cholera and bacteria dysentery.<br/>Other disease that may be transmitted by water include brucellosis, shige /losis, these disease are consuming. Untreated water (Hetolett 1921) various countries of the world and the world Health organisation (WHO) has set up standards for water quality against which the level of pollution can be assessed. The world Health organization (WHO) National Agency for food and Drug Administration control (NAFDAC), standard for potable water include the following, that in 100ml of water coliform bacteria should be absent, total plate count of bacteria growth should be 100 CFU/ML of water. Hence the sanitary Quality of water should not be over looked since contaminated water can cause health hazards when consumed. <br/>According to guideline for drinking water quality of WHO (1998)<br/>TABLE 1<br/>WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION STANDARD FOR DRINKING WATER</p> <p>PH 5.0 – 9.0<br/>COLOUR 15 Hazen unit<br/>Dissolved solids 500 mg/l<br/>Total Hardness 500 mg/l<br/>Calcium 75 mg/l<br/>Iron 0.3 mg/l<br/>Chloride 200 mg/l<br/>Nitrate 45 mg/l<br/>Coliform 10 colonies</p> <p><strong>1.1 AIMS / OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The objective of this projects is to make comparative analysis of Enugu state water cooperation provide against supplies.<br/>To identify contamination microbial advice on measures to control pollution of water bodies etc.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong><br/>The treated water produced by Enugu state water co-operation could be contaminated by defective plumbing which cause the rush of water out of the pipe forming pull mixed with sewage matters.

So as not to endanger the health and welfare and also for the social and environmental effects, it may have on people; people have been suffering from one disease to another without knowing the problems of their illness, the situation and due to distress or dirty environment. Cleanliness is next to Godliness.<br/>Similarly, Iheke (2010) sees sanitation as the process of keeping places clean and hygienic especially by providing a sewage system and a clean water supply. Sanitation refers to all conditions that affects the health of people in a geographical area. Billions of people still live without access to sanitation facilities and are unable to practice such basic hygienic as washing their hands with soap and water.<br/>Disease related to poor sanitation and water availability cause many people to die of sickness like cholera, diarrhea, malaria, typhoid, which damages the body tissues. Children are most vulnerable to health hazards and consequently are affected the most. In 1998, 2.2 million people died because of poor sanitation, which the vast majority were children.<br/>In 1950 the world health organizations expert committee on environmental sanitation defines environmental sanitation as the control of community, water supplies, excreta and waste water disposal, refuse disposal, vector of diseases, housing conditions, food supplies and handling conditions, food supplies and atmospheric conditions and the safety of the working environment. Environmental problems have grown in complexity especially with the advert of radiation and chemical hazards. Meanwhile the world needs for the basic sanitation services (like drinking water supply, excreta and waste water disposal), have greatly increased as a result of rapid population growth and highly expectations.<br/>There has been considerable awareness of water supply in institution, but the problems of excreta and waste disposal have receive less attention. In Enugu State College of Education (Technical), every where is littered with pure water polythene, pieces of papers and so on, without proper disposal. In order to focus attention of these problems. Sanitation exercise should be done daily to keep the environment clean by employing labourers that will help keep the school clean. Environments should be formulated in order to kill dangerous animals like snake, scorpion etc.<br/>In school hostels, there are problems of over-crowding and these affects the health of the students in the hostel. More than 200 students share four (4) toilets. Mostly girls in hostel have inadequate sanitation facilities. With this premise, the researchers seek to find out the implication of sanitation practices on students health in Enugu State College of Education (Technical). Inadequate sanitation and water in school jeopardize not only the students health but also their attendance. Girls in particular area likely to be kept out of school, if there is no sanitation.<br/>Seminars should be organized in institutions to help educate students more, especially girls in the hostel on menstrual hygiene, sanitation hygienic practices, cleanliness in the surroundings. To make everywhere conducive for teaching and learning, lack of skills and this have hindered the educational prospects of girls residing in the hostel. Flies petch on dirts, toilet etc and later petch on uncovered foods and all this are dangerous to human health.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENTS OF PROBLEM:-</strong><br/>Control of pests, waste disposal had become a problem in our environment because of poor sanitation practices. Diseases related to poor sanitation and water availability causes many people to die of sickness like cholera, diarrhea, malaria, typhoid which damages the body tissues.<br/>However, it is not clear on the extent in which school management and student union government (SUG) have contributed in curbing poor sanitation practices. The problem of this study is to find out the strategies which could be employ to provide facilities to students to reduce dirtiness.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:-</strong><br/>The purpose of this study is to find out the implication of sanitation practices on students health in Enugu State college of Education (technical). Specifically this study was to:<br/>1. Identify the causes of poor sanitation practices on student’s health in Enugu State College of Education (Technical)<br/>2. Determine the extent in which the school management have contributed in providing facilities that will enhance sanitation practices in Enugu State College of Education (Technical) Enugu.<br/>3. Find out the strategies that could be employed to curb dirtiness in Enugu State College of Education (Technical).</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The findings of this study will enable the students in Enugu State College of Education, to better understand and cultivate a clean environment because cleanliness is next to Godliness. The finding will help the following people:<br/>The students to know the needs of hygiene or health practices, because cleanliness in next to Godliness and also enable to have a sound health, if sanitation is practiced by the students, sickness and diseases will be reduced.<br/>To the school management: The findings will help the school management to provide adequate facilities that will enable the labourers to keep the environment clean and tidy, also provide fund for buying disinfectant and Antiseptic, and also paying the labourers.<br/>Government:- The findings will help the government, to formulate a policies that will enable their follow students keep the environment clean and regulations on the school. Also they serve as a mediator between the management and the students.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS:-</strong><br/>In order to find answers to the objective of this study, the researchers formulated the following research questions.<br/>1. What are the causes of poor sanitation practices on students health in Enugu State college of Education (Technical)?<br/>2.

The method of data collection was by primary data sources, while the results gotten from the test are the secondary sample.<br/>Chapter three shows the sample collected from different materials of the River (sample A, sample B and sample C). sample were tested for physical biological &amp; chemical parameters.<br/>Chapter four shows the presentation of the Result gotten from the experiment while chapter five is the conclusion, summary and recommendations made.</div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><em><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION</strong></em><br/>Since the beginning of concern over the possible consequences of global warming, it has been widely recognized that changes in the cycling of waters between land, sea and air could have very significant impacts across many sectors of the economy, society and the environment. The characteristics of many terrestrial ecosystems, for example are heavily influenced by water availability, in the case of aquatic ecosystems, the quantity and quality of water in rivers and aquifers is fundamental to human, aquatic life and many activities. Most obviously agriculture use, industry use, power generation, transportation and waste constraint on economic development. Consequently, there have been a great many studies into the potential effect of climatic change on hydrology (focusing of cycling of water and water quality aspects with its proper analysis and assessment).<br/>The majority of these studies have concentrated on possible changes in the water balance for example, the quality of stream water, impacts of the changes in the gravity of water such as the reliability of a water sources (supply) or the risk of contaminated source. This study focuses on techniques adopted to determine the quality of water, by carrying out chemical text, biological text and physical text on Otammiri River to ascertain its quality and beneficial use of water.<br/>Water And The Hydrologic Cycle<br/>Water begins its never ceasing cycle as vapour in the atmosphere as well as the water in the lakes and oceans, provides protection against extremes of both heat and cold. Hydrologic cycle refers to the complete movement of water from the atmosphere and below the earth surface. It includes water precipitation as rain, snow, hail or dew, it journey over around and through obstacles above on and below the earths surface and its eventual evaporation and return to the atmosphere. It is the longest water purification system known to man.<br/>Water<br/>Water is essential for man’s existence, it is needed in large quantities and in all wholesomeness despite the requirements for potable supply, water is needed for power generation, irrigation, recreation, industrial production processes and in waste disposal. The importance of water made it possible for nature to distribute it all over the regions of the earth. The planet earth contains about 70% water in form of oceans, seas, rivers, lakes and ground water. Water provided for human consumption should receive minimum possible treatment, though the best supply is one which needs no treatment at all. Public health is vulnerable to the danger of incidence of diseases, mainly through water borne, water related and water washed diseases. These diseases include cholera, typhoid and para-typhoid fever, malaria, yellow fiver, schistosomosois and guinea worm. Consequent to the incidence of disease, water treatment processes become a preciosity that require careful while handling. For an acceptable quality of water supply the international standard for drinking water established by World Health Organization (2007) states that water intended to human consumption must be free from organisms and from concentration of chemical substances that may be hazardous to health. Supplies of drinking water should be pleasant to drinking as circumstance permit.<br/>The quality of water must be wholesome and palatable. Wholesome water must be free from organisms, poisonous and excessive amount of mineral, turbidity taste, odour, and must be well aerated.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This project laid more emphasis on the assessment of the contribution of hydrologic cycle to the water quality of Otammiri River. To understand how contamination of the River occurs, it is necessary to understand the contributions of the hydrologic cycle to the Rivers, the water quality along its profile from the confluence of Otammiri and Nworie River. Water bodies can be fully characterized by the three major components; hydrology, physic-chemistry and biology. Therefore this project describes a complete assessment of water quality based on appropriate monitoring of these components.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The aim of this project is to provide understanding of;<br/> The assessment of the contributions of hydrologic cycle to Otammiri River from the broadest perspective.<br/> Water quality potentials of Otammiri River<br/> Physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water<br/> Water quality control and management.<br/> Water quality in the environment, sources of contamination, effects of common impurities in water and self purification of water.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The scope of this project is the proper assessment of the contribution of hydrologic cycle to Otammiri River which include;<br/>a. Assessment of existing surface water (Otammiri River during rainy season as a case study)<br/> Effects of common impurities in water<br/> Water quality and characteristics of water<br/> Beneficial use of water<br/> Study methodology, decision on quality parameters for analysis.<br/> Data presentation, calculation and discussion.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</em></strong><br/>While there is a considerable amount of water quality data collected for the experiment, the timing and frequency of samples does not provide a definite information on the degree which water quality is based. The following was needed to determine the water quality conditions.<br/> Three different samples would be collected from difernt reaches of Otammiri River<br/> The samples should be taken undisturbed and moved to the laboratory immediately for proper analysis.<br/> The presence of the following should be determined; copper, zinc, magnesium, iron, sulphate, phosphate, nitrite, chloride and sulphite.<br/> Also, the following should be determined; pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, alkalinity, total hardness, turbidity, total coliform, etc.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/> This project provides an account on how to make hydrologic cycle and water quality fit for human use.<br/> The various treatment method of contaminated water<br/> It provides information on how the River is being contaminated along the reaches of the river.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>In the course of carrying out this project, some difficulties were encountered which includes;<br/> Unavailability of research material like test books<br/> Unsteady power supply that delayed the laboratories experiment<br/> Difficulties encountered when analyzing different water sample<br/> Non availability of equipment needed for water quality analysis.</p> </div> </div>\n\nASSESSMENT OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF HYDROLOGIC CYCLE TO THE WATER QUALITY PROFILE OF OTAMIRI RIVER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF HYDROLOGIC CYCLE TO THE WATER QUALITY PROFILE OF OTAMIRI RIVER", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>APPRAISAL OF THE IMPACT OF EMPLOYEES HEALTH AND SAFETY ON PRODUCTIVITY </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Unilever Nigeria Plc Aba)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>The purpose of the study was to establish ways in which employee’s health and safety. Productivity systems and teamwork could be used to enhance employee commitment to Unilever Nigeria Plc. The objectives of my study were to examine the commitment of the management of Unilever Nigeria Plc towards employee health and safety, to examine how employee health safety and teamwork affect employee commitment, to establish ways of implementing employee health and safety policies. The research questions for my study were what is the level of Unilever Nigeria Plc commitments to employee health and safety? Why the employees are upset about the existing employee health and safety policies? Is it affecting their teamwork? How can employee health and safety be implemented in the organization? And what is the best alternative means of getting the employers and employees to comply the implementation of employee health and safety policies? The methodology that was employed in the study looked at various sources of data, the sampling design, the procedures and the methods that were used in data collection, processing and analysis. The results and findings on the primary data are translated based on frequencies, percentage and weights of the study variables corroborated with qualitative data. In the presentation, illustration in form of tables, graphs, pie-charts, percentages as well as quantitative discussions have been used. The study shows that management of employee health and safety together with teamwork is a vital ingredient for achieving employee health and safety together with teamwork is a vital ingredient for achieving employee commitment to the organization. Much of the literature was based on reviews from the developed countries. </div> <div> <div> <p><strong><em>1.0 INTRODUCTION</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>Most managers of human resources have the view that the employees are the greatest asset of the organization among the production variables (man, machine, money and materials resources) of the organization. Ironically, man is also seen as very problematic to deal with. Man is a rational being very consequently exhibits series of impeditable behavior. Even since Fredrick Winslow Tailors systematic study of management techniques, considerable research have been on the behavioural aspect of organization and members of what can motivate them. <br/>Every business organization has a profit motive and profit is the outcome of productivity. The higher the productivity, the lower the unit cost of production which translate into more profit which of course is most desired by organizational members. A individuals joints a firm in the hope that he would receive a good and adequate medication, free from occupational hazard and most importantly satisfy his own needs or personal goal or objectives. Unilever Nigeria Plc like any other organization has one of the greatest challenges of its human resources, managers as that of influencing employees towards achieving organizational objectives. Because of the profit maximization interest of multinational companies aligned with the declining revenue acting from investment Unilever has places, its own remuneration packages, working environment, fringe benefit like meal subsidy, medical facilities, transport allowances, pension and gratuity benefit etc aimed at motivating staff, increase their satisfaction and enhance their performances. The issue now is what is the relationship between employee’s good health and safety on productivity?</p> <p><em><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></em><br/>Lack of health and safety policies for employees in organization like Unilever Nigeria Plc leaves them exposed to high risk work hazards resulting in injuries which affect morale towards work, levels of teamwork spirit, and consequently, employee commitment towards work has deteriorated, this manifest itself in the form of lack of initiative and existence of counter productive work behaviours.</p> <p><em><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong></em><br/>To establish ways in which employee’s health and safety management systems and teamwork can be used to enhance employee commitment to Unilever Nigeria Plc. In order to investigate the research proposal, the researcher will guide by the following objectives:<br/>a. To examine the commitment of the management of Unilever Nigeria Plc towards employee health and safety (EHS)<br/>b. To examine how employee health and safety and teamwork affect employee commitment.<br/>c. To establish ways of implementing employee health and safety policies in Unilever Nigeria Plc.<br/>d. To put in place a system of getting the employers to comply with the employee health and safety policies.</p> <p><em><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong></em><br/>The study will resolve the following questions:<br/>a. How committed is the management of Unilever Nigeria Plc to employee health and safety?<br/>b. How do employee health and safety and teamwork affect the commitment of employees towards their work?<br/>c. How can employee health and safety be implemented in the organization?<br/>d. What is the best alternative means of getting the employers and employees to comply the implementation of employee health and safety?</p> <p><em><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>1. The study will help the management of Unilever Nigeria Plc revise the human resource policies in the organization to cater for health and safety of the employees.<br/>2. The study will provide teamwork for the implementation and consolidation of employee’s health and safety policies in Unilever Nigeria Plc.<br/>3. The study will help boost teamwork and the commitment of employees towards organizations. Unilever Nigeria Plc is a monopolist in the electricity distribution industry in Uganda and hence the results of this study will be representative of what happens in that industry.</p> <p><em><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>There are many manufacturing firms in Nigeria but for the purpose of this study, the researcher chooses to study two industries in Nigeria, they are Unilever Nigeria Plc and PZ Industries Ltd because they are the leaders in the manufacturing at most needed things in Nigeria for (example) soap, cream, perfume and omo and so on. In these industries, they have different department which are:<br/>a. Marketing department <br/>b. Personnel department <br/>c. Administrative department <br/>d. Accounting department <br/>e. Sales department <br/>f. Purchasing department <br/>g. Safety and health department <br/>Among all, I have discussed two department namely safety and health department and marketing department.<br/>Employee Safety and Health Department: Safety, health and environment make sure that workers are in a safe hand by making sure that any worker who is injured will be given a adequate treatment immediately. <br/>Marketing Department: They ensure that the goods being manufactured in these industries are sold out to the masses in a very good price.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The following factors limits or hinders the study of the project and the possible means to overcome these problems were explained in the project work. However, the researcher while conducting the research work experienced financial problem couple with time factor. Again it was not easy to travel to all states for first hand information. Most of the findings are based on the experiences from Unilever Nigeria Plc Aba, which of the purpose at this study has been taken as a proper representation of the state in the country.<br/>More to that, most of the workers interviewed do not keep up to date statistic or record of data needed, whereas, some employees of Unilever Nigeria Plc were reluctant to provide the researcher with the needed information due to fear and ignorance of the research work. At the preliminary library research carried out by the researcher, it was discovered that they way up to date, material literature on the employee’s health in the country could not be found easily. Above all, lack of handy transport facilities renders the researchers movement limited to just the Unilever Nigeria Plc cited in Aba, Abia State.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS </em></strong><br/><strong>Employee:</strong> An employee is somebody /person employed for wages or salary, a person working for another person.<br/><strong>Safety:</strong> The state of being safe, that is free from danger or harm.<br/><strong>Employer:</strong> A person who employs others, an employer is a person who employs others and paid them either wages or salary.<br/><strong>Health:</strong> The state of being well, being free from sickness. It an employee is healthy, he can perform his/her job effectively. <br/><strong>Productivity:</strong> Output efficiency and yield from employee protection at work place.<br/><strong>Management: </strong>A special process entailing responsibility for effective economical planning and regulating of the operations of an entry in fulfillment of a given purpose of tasks.</p> <p><em><strong>1.9 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF UNILEVER NIGERIA PLC</strong></em><br/>Unilever Nigeria Plc corporate mission, which is to add vitality to life, is the very heart of Unilever. We seek to ensure that when people choose our brands, they are choosing vitality. The journey to achieve this began back in the 19th century. Unilever Nigeria Plc is a public liability company quoted on the Nigeria stock exchange since 1973 with Nigeria currently having 49% of equity holding.<br/>Unilever Nigeria Plc was incorporated as Lever Brother (West Africa) Ltd. On 11th April 1923 by Lord Leverhulme, but the company’s antecedents have to be traced back to his existing trading interest in Nigeria and west Africa generally, and to the fact that he had since the 19th century been greatly involved with the soap business in Britain. Unilever Nigeria Plc started as a soap manufacturing company, and is today one of the oldest surviving manufacturing organization in Nigeria.<br/>After series of merger, the company diversified into manufacturing and marketing of food, non-soapy detergent and personal care product. It brought in lipton Nigeria Ltd in 1985, Cheesebrough Ponds Industries Ltd. in 1988. The company changed its name to Unilever Nigeria Plc in 2001.<br/>Over the years, it has been a socially responsible and responsive organization that takes strategic action for the improvement of communities and environment in which it operates. The company has made provision for assistance in held of health, education/ children welfare and potable water/hygiene as part of its social responsibility programme in the Nigeria communities.</p> </div> </div>\n\nAPPRAISAL OF THE IMPACT OF EMPLOYEES HEALTH AND SAFETY ON PRODUCTIVITY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPRAISAL OF THE IMPACT OF EMPLOYEES HEALTH AND SAFETY ON PRODUCTIVITY ", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF INVENTORY IN GOVERNMENT HEALTH INSTITUTION </p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong><br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></em></p> <p><br/>Inventories occupy the most strategic position in structure of working capital of most business enterprises. It constitutes the largest component of current asset in most business enterprises. In the sphere of working capital, the efficient control and management of inventory has paired the most serious problem to the health institutions. The turnover of working capital is largely governed by the turnover of inventory, that is the rate of working capital is largely governed by the amount of inventory which is largely provided by the government. It is therefore quite natural that inventory which helps to maximize profit occupies the most significant place among current and profit assets.<br/>The American usage of the word ‘inventory’ is synonymous with the British use of the word ‘stock’, this synonym is evident in the definitions of inventory and stock by the Oxford Dictionary. The Oxford English Dictionary defined inventory as follows:<br/>1. A list, catalogue, detailed account<br/>2. A lot or stock of goods, etc which are or may be made the subject of an inventory.<br/>3. The aggregate of goods and some specified kind of goods which a trader has on hand as provision for the possible future requirement of customers.<br/>The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) defined inventory thus, the term inventory in used to designate the aggregate of those terms tangible personal property which are held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in the process of production for such sale or currently consumed in the production of goods and services to be available for sale.<br/>According to the Nigerian Accounting Standard Boards (NASB) stock includes those finished goods and livestock waiting sale, work-in-program, raw materials and supplies to be consumed in the production of goods and rendering of services.<br/>Many understand the word inventory as a stock of goods, but the generally accepted meaning of the word ‘goods’ in the accounting language is the stock of finished goods only. In a manufacturing organization, however, in addition to the stock of finished goods, there will be stock of partly finished goods; there will be stock of partly finished goods, raw materials and stores. The collective name of these entire items is ‘inventory’.<br/>Inventory management is aimed at maintaining a minimum investment in operations to maximize profitable operations. To maintain a large stock of investment to ensure a smooth and efficient operation of the firm.<br/>The effect of inventory management on government health institutions like UNTH Enugu cannot be over emphasized; this is because asset of many institutions represents considerable percentage of the total invested capital. The control, accounting and management of an efficient inventory management system is of a special interest to both management, suppliers and other users of accounting information.<br/>Therefore, poor inventory management leads to expiration of drugs, loss of quality sequel to poor storage system with resultant reduction in efficacy of the drug. This might even lead to death of some patients. There may be stock out and lot more effect of poor inventory control and management.<br/>Inventory control is concerned with the acquisition, control, handling and use of inventories so as to ensure the availability of inventory whenever needed, providing adequate provision for contingencies, deriving maximum economy and minimizing wastages and losses.<br/>Hence, inventory control refers to a system, which ensures the supply of required quantity and quality of inventory at the required time. Inventory control can make or break a company. This explains the usual saying that inventories are the grave yard of business.<br/>The aim of a sound inventory control system is to ensure the best balance between two much and too little. Too much inventory carries financial rises and too little reacts adversely on continuity of sequence.<br/>In health institutions such as UNTH Enugu, inventory control is more than just procurement and usage. The proper controls and processes can save millions in health care cost by enabling health institutions to efficiently order and store just the right amount of supplies needed for patient care while tackling cost, tier pricing and patient charges associated with supplies.<br/>Inventory management and control helps facilities identify, control and manage their inventories by keeping accurate records of all inflow, outflow and movement of inventory (drugs) in a user friendly environment. The proper tracking data allows for accuracy in patient charges and on audit trail to identify cist charges.<br/>The intention of this research work therefore aimed at studying the management and control of inventories (drugs) in government health institutions with special reference to University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>A large proportion of the government health institutions are faced with similar problems. These problems hinder the growth and development of institutions in this country. The problems include<br/>1. Unsatisfied clients/patients arising from poor qualify drugs.<br/>2. High rate of obsolescence, wastages and theft of drugs.<br/>3. Poor quality of inventory control leading to out of stock of essential drugs in the hospital.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>1. To ensure an effective and efficient management and control of inventory (drugs) in government health institution leading to effective service delivery.<br/>2. To reduce obsolescence and wastages of drugs.<br/>3. To reduce out of stock syndrome prevalent in government hospitals.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</em></strong><br/>1. To what extent has effective management and control of inventory aid in effective and efficient service delivery of hospitals?<br/>2. How far do effective inventory management reduce obsolescence and wastages of drugs experienced in hospitals?<br/>3. To what extent do good inventory management help in reducing out of stock syndrome prevalent in government hospitals?</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 FORMULATION OF HYPOTHESES</em></strong><br/>Ho: proper management and control of inventory does not have a significant effect on effective and efficient service delivery of hospitals.<br/>Hi: Proper management and control of inventory has a significant effect on effective and efficient service delivery on hospitals.<br/>Ho: Proper management and control of inventory does not reduce obsolescence and wastages experienced in hospitals.<br/>Hi: Proper management and control of inventory reduce obsolescence and wastages experienced in hospitals.<br/>Ho: There is no relationship between inventory control and stock out experienced n hospitals.<br/>Hi: There is relationship between inventory control and stock out experienced n hospitals.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The significance of the study is mainly attributed to the need for measuring result of inventory operations for a particular period such as month of year. This study will point out the importance of inventory control and management in government health institutions.<br/>This study will also create an opportunity for existing and prospective employers and employees to benefit from the use of modern inventory control and management techniques that will be recommended. To students, it will improve their theoretical and practical knowledge of inventory management and control in government health institutions.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The management and control of inventories cover physical control, accounting control and management policies and procedures relating to inventory. This study is based on government health institutions but due to time, the school system and financial constraints, this research has selected a sample from eth population of health instructions.<br/>The study sample selected for this study is University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) in Enugu, and the study shall cover their ordering method, procurement method, storage and issue of drugs including the cold chain system and the inventory management and control techniques that aid in the achievement of the organizational goal.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The absence of any previous empirical study on the management and control of inventories drugs in the program of UNTH is a significant limitation to this study.<br/>These absences of an existing body of study on this area in the institution posses a special problem of the absence of previous reference or primary data from the scratch through questionnaire administration and designed to supplement available secondary data. However, financial constraints are expected to present a very serious limitation to the study since it would limit the researcher’s data material and the presentation of existing evidence.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 DEFINITION OF OPERATIONAL TERMS</em></strong><br/>Inventory – Stock of materials or product. In this, inventory refers to drugs.<br/>Inventory Management – The official system designed by the management of a company to monitor control and manage the stock of inventories and assets under its possession.<br/>Inventory Control – Supervision of the supply and storage and accessibility of items in order to incur on adequate supply without excessive supply.<br/>Cold Chain System – A popular term for continuous maintenance of low temperature required for biological example vaccines from the time of manufacture to shipping, warehouse and storing before administration.</p> <p><strong><em>1.10 HISTORY OF UNTH</em></strong><br/>The UNTH Ituku Ozalla, Enugu, has come a long way. The hospital began in the 20th century as a standard hospital for Africans built by the colonial administrators. It later metamorphosed into a general hospital on attainment of Nigeria’s independence in 1960.<br/>However, at the end of the Nigerian civil war in 1970, the then government of east central state transformed it into a specialist hospital with effect from July 1, 1970.<br/>At this time, the hospital has a total of 50 doctors, 10 wards and 300 beds and a chest bay of 60 beds. There are also 350 nurses working in the hospital. Today, the situation has changed drastically. The bed capacity of the hospital in the permanent is over 500 beds and the number of its personnel both professional and non professional has increased tremendously.<br/>By decree number of 23 of 1974, the Federal Ministry Government took over the hospital, but left the management in the hands of the council of the University of Nigeria Nsukka. The University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital became independent in July 1976 with the appointment of autonomous management board.<br/>The physical constraints of the old site of the hospital mad eit impossible for needed expansion to be implemented. It was also appreciated that the old site was<br/>developed and used as a general hospital, and therefore, could not longer cope with the challenges of a teaching hospital.<br/>Consequently, the approval of the then Federal Ministry Government for the construction of a new complex for the teaching hospital was ought and it came as welcome relief. Today, this site, which is the permanent site of the UNTH at Ituku Ozalla is permanent and gully functional. It is located 21 kilometers from Enugu capital city along Enugu, Port-Harcourt Express way.<br/>All services rendered at the old site has now been moved into the permanent site with effect from 8the January, 2007. The hospital covers an area of about 200, acres while the entre parcel of land about 306 hectares (747acres).<br/>There is now a room for expansion and this is hoped to assist in solving the accommodation needs of the hospital once and for all.<br/>The new hospital complex is also better equipped under the Federal Government assisted by VAMED engineering equipment programme which has elevated it and some other teaching hospitals in the country to an international standard.<br/>The UNTH has broad objectives of services, teaching and research. The hospital tries to achieve these through provision of in-patient and out-patient services to its clients through her highly trained staffs, provision of adequate clinical materials for service and training as well as equipment of research, provision of teac<br/>facilities for training her students and other persons in the health delivery team and conduct and promotion of research in all matters pertaining to health.<br/>Altogether, there are 41 main departments in the hospital with three outpost. They are:<br/>- Comprehensive Health Centers at Obukpa near Nsukka Enugu State<br/>- Abagana in Njikoka Local Government Area of Anambra State.<br/>- Isuochi in Abia State.<br/>There are 9 training school/programmes in the hospital they have school of nursing, midwifery, medical laboratory science, nurse anesthetists, community health, post ophthalmic nursing, pre-operative nursing, cardiothoracic nursing and medical records. These schools operate currently at the old site but plans are already on the ground to provide structure for them in the new site as soon as possible</p>\n\nMANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF INVENTORY IN GOVERNMENT HEALTH INSTITUTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF INVENTORY IN GOVERNMENT HEALTH INSTITUTION", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>PATIENT HEARTBEAT AND TEMPERATURE MONITOR </p> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong><br/>1.1 BACKGROUND</strong></em><br/>Heart beat rate means the number of heartbeats per unit time, usually expressed as beats per minute (bpm). The human heart pounds to pump oxygen rich blood to the muscles and carry cell waste products away from the tissues. Heartbeat rate can vary according to the demand of the muscles to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide changes such as during exercise or sleep. It also varies significantly between individuals based on age, fitness and genetics. This means that the heart must beat faster to deliver more oxygen rich blood. During exercise routines, the heartbeat rate gives a strong indication of how effective the exercise is to the body.<br/>The patient monitoring systems is one of the major improvements in the global health care program because of its advanced technology. A patient monitoring system measures the heartbeat and body temperature by using embedded technology. This advancement in technology is highly needed because many sick patients at the hospitals die because of high fever and heart attacks. The trend of cardiovascular disease has shown that heart beat rate plays a key role in determining the possibility of a heart attack while an increase in the body temperature can induce fever on a patient. Heart diseases<br/>such as heart attack, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and congenital heart disease are the leading causes of death for men and women in many countries. Most of the time, the aged people of the society are more prone to heart disease problems than the younger ones. For people who live alone with no one to monitor their health condition, this device offers an opportunity to them for a constant monitoring of their health status, it is developed to monitor and alert the doctors about the heartbeat and temperature condition of a patient. It is developed to give patients a timely and proper heath care.<br/>These days it is not easy for doctors and the nurses to remain close to a patients bed side to monitor their heath condition. In the past, a huge and fixed monitoring device was used (only in the hospitals) to know the health status of a patient when on a bed. These monitoring devices are only available in the hospitals and are constantly on the patient’s body. Many of them are not user friendly so it is important that the doctors and family members will have a handy device that can always monitor their patients when they are not around. One of the vital things to monitor on a patient is the body temperature. This has to do with the measurement of the body's ability to generate and get rid of heat. Temperature monitoring is one of chief indicators of the normal functioning of health. The nature of the human body<br/>is to keep its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. Normal human body temperature depends upon the place in the body, from which the measurement is made, and the time and level of activity of the person. The typical body temperature is 37.0 °C ± 0.4°C (98.6 ° F ± 0.7°F). When the body temperature is high, the blood vessels within the skin expand (dilate) to carry the excess heat to the patients skin surface. One may begin to sweat, and as the sweat evaporates, it helps to cool his/her body. When one is too cold, the blood vessels narrows (contracts) so that blood flow to the skin is reduced to conserve body heat. This may cause an involuntary shivering in some people due to cold which is a rapid contraction of the muscles. This extra muscle activity helps to generate more heat. Under normal condition, thus keeping one's body temperature within a narrow, safe range. Body temperature is regulated by neural feedback mechanism which operate primarily through the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus contains not only the control mechanisms, but also the key temperature sensors. Under control of these mechanisms, sweating begins almost precisely at a skin temperature of 37°C and increases rapidly as the skin temperature rises above this value. The heat production of the body under these conditions remains almost constant as the skin temperature rises. If the skin temperature drops below 37°C a variety of<br/>responses are initiated to conserve the heat in the body and to increase heat production. These includes: Vasoconstriction to decrease the flow of heat to the skin, Cessation of sweating, shivering to increase heat production in the muscles, Secretion of nor epinephrine, epinephrine, and thyroxin to increase heat production.<br/>Another vital thing to monitor in a patient is the heartbeat rate. It is very important that the heartbeat is to be normal. That is 72 BPM. If there is any abnormality, then the patient is in distress. Heartbeat rate means the number of heartbeats per unit of time. The normal heartbeat rate of a resting person is about 70 bpm for adult males and 75 bpm for adult females. The average heartbeat per minute for 25-year old ranges between 140-170 beats per minute while for a 60-year old it is typically between 115-140 beats per minute and body temperature is 37 degree Celsius or 98.6 Fahrenheit. . Normally it is difficult to keep track of the abnormalities in the heartbeat count of by manual means. Patients are not well versed with the manual treatments, which the doctors normally use for tracking the count of the heartbeat. Thus, there must be some kind of device which would help patients and their family member to keep track of their health by themselves. This sole reason is why this project presents a heartbeat and temperature<br/>monitoring device using radio frequency (RF.). The concept of developing an RF. based patient monitoring device is to have a simple home and hospital based pulse and body temperature monitoring device for sick person’s that are in critical condition and needs to be constantly or periodically monitored by clinician or family.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 WHAT IS A PATIENT HEARTBEAT AND TEMPERATURE MONITOR USING RF.?</em></strong><br/>A patient heartbeat and temperature monitor using RF. is a radio frequency based pulse wave and body temperature monitoring system, which allows the control of a sick person’s condition in real time. The system monitors the heart beat and temperature of a patient simultaneously and if the patients heartbeat rate or body temperature is abnormal, the system alerts sends an alert to the doctor or patient’s family members to quickly examine or diagnose the patient’s condition and take early precaution to save the patient’s life. The alerts sound can be triggered at any time as long as there is a deviation in the health condition of the patient from the normal, such that the status of the patient can be known on time. The system consists of a sensor, which monitors the patient and sends a signal to a microcontroller, which processes it to determine the temperature and heartbeat rate of the<br/>patient before sending an alert to a receiver using radio frequency. The receiver has to be in the possession of the patient’s doctor or family members. This project can also be used by athletes who engage in physical exercise and by medical professionals. Individuals, such as athletes, cyclists or those who are interested in monitoring their heartbeat rate and body temperature to gain maximum efficiency from their training can also use this project. It can be used during physical exercise and healthcare.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 PROBLEM DEFINITION</em></strong><br/>The human health is one of the most important concerns in the world today. Anything/everything becomes meaningless when one becomes sick and dies due to improper Medicare. For health reasons, people, governments and several voluntary bodies spend a lot of money to ensure a better health condition for themselves and the entire populace. Scientists and Engineers are always at work to device a means of supporting/sustaining a sound health condition for all through the invention of numerous technologies both Electrical/Mechanical gadgets that are in use for health care delivery today. The heart is a very delicate organ in the human body (once it stops beating, nothing else matters). Thus, If early actions are taken (and on time) the heart condition can be managed effectively and many patients can be cured and<br/>saved. The problem of patients slumping and dying is associated with cardiovascular arrests and can be checkmated this sensitive and highly effective device (the patient heartbeat and temperature monitor). This device has an outstanding advantage that it is easy to handle and access. Heartbeat rate and body temperature monitors are part of the most vital tools needed in first aid kit for saving lives. Unlike the x-ray, the heartbeat and temperature monitor does not impose any hazard to the human health. There devices in the market which can provide raw measurement data of the patients to the doctors, but the patients may not be able to interpret the medical measurement into a meaningful diagnosis due to their limited medical background. On the other hand, if raw medical data is delivered to the doctor, time is wasted and may pose a problem, but in emergencies waste of time can never be tolerated. It is tough to share data over large area within a short period. Most of the products available in the market have this drawback of limitation in flexibility and portability. If the heat that is produced from metabolism cannot be checkmated on time, it will cause a turbulent body temperature, which could be worse than 40°C and lead to headache, vertigo, low blood pressure, high energy consumption, unconsciousness and crocking up of body temperature regulation function. On the other hand, when the produced heat is less than<br/>the dissipating heat, the body temperature cannot hold on and it will result to a decrease in metabolism.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</em></strong><br/>The major aim and objective of this design [of a patient heartbeat and temperature monitor using RF.] is to help the doctors and family members to keep track of the heartbeat condition of their loved ones [as well as their body temperature] in the case of an abnormality in the health condition (for those with heartbeat defects and those that run excessive high temperature beyond normal). If any varied change takes place, it is notified. This notification through RF. Channel would to take an appropriate action at an instance of time, thereby alerting the appropriate persons..</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT</em></strong><br/>There are various instruments available in the hospitals to keep track of the internal body changes, but many of them have limitations regarding to maintenance, cost, size of instruments, and mobility. This project is so significant because it is mobile, small in size, cost effective, very easy to use, highly efficient performance, portable and light in weight etc. It uses RF. to help both the patient and the concerned doctor to take an appropriate action.<br/>It is beneficial in terms of cost. It saves time and is very helpful to patients who lives alone. It offers a freedom of movement to patients. It has a low power consumption though the stability of its wireless data communication is still to be enhanced. To some degree, the wireless data communication via RF has anti-jamming ability.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</em></strong><br/>This project operates at a 30 feet’s distance on open space. It is designed to operate with an alkaline battery of a minimum of 9 volts to a maximum of 12v consumes 50mA. It uses a buffer, temperature sensor, AT89c51 Microcontroller and a led display with buzzer for the alert. The hardware and soft ware of the system is oriented towards the AT89c51 single chip microcontroller. Hence, reducing the size of the device. A regulated 3.7v RF. operates in the frequency range of 415 MHZ per second used for data transmission, which can easily penetrate over three floors of a building and go over 30 feet’s in open space.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 PROJECT REPORT ORGANIZATION</em></strong><br/>The organization of the project report is well detailed and vast in its coverage.

This domestic waste management disposal is of national and international concern. From analysis in question 1 it is proved that ESWAMA helped to control and manage waste disposal in the society. The result of finding here indicates that ESWAMA was established to develop and implement policies of the management solid and liquid waste disposal on the people’s environment. This shows that illegal waste disposal is dangerous to health and environment. It is also indicated that improper waste disposal contribute to health problems. It remedies shows that waste management activities by the ESWAMA individual and families has a great impact to people’s health and environment. </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background of the Study</strong><br/>The generation and disposal of waste is an intrinsic part of any developing society. Waste, both from domestic and commercial sources has grown significantly in the society over the past decade. Every time a householder shops at the store, and open market he contributes to the mountain of waste. It is possible to quote figures which show that the production of waste amounts to millions of tons. The percent of Nigeria’s population living in cities and urban area has more than doubled in the last 15 years.<br/>According to Hornby (2005) domestic waste is something that is not or no longer used and is to be thrown away or disposed off. It is also any material lacking direct value to the producer and so must be disposed.<br/>The management of waste is a matter of national and international concern. The cities, urban areas experience continuous growth which contributes to enormous in generation of solid and liquid waste. <br/>According to Mowee (1990) there is no doubt that a dirty environment affects the standard of living, aesthetic sensibilities, health of the people and thus the quality of their lives. The corollary is that improper disposal or storage of this waste can constitute hazards to the society through the population of air, land and especially water, Mowee (1988). <br/>According to UK Environmental Protection Act, (1990) hereinafter, EPA, defined waste as “any substance which constitutes a scrap material or an effluent or other unwanted surplus substance from application of any process”. Any substance or article which requires to be disposed of as being broken, worn out, contaminated or otherwise spoiled (75 EPA 1990).<br/>Ilegbune (1994) states that domestic waste includes that from domestic premises, caravan sites residential homes, educational establishments (schools) and nursing homes and (probably hospitals). It can be organic or non-organic. <br/>Waste management simply means the collection of keeping, treatment and disposal of waste in such a way as render them harmless to human and animal life, the ecology and environment generally. Domestic waste management has become an area of major concern in Nigeria today. It appears to be a loosing battle against the harmful consequences of unguided waste and the attainment of clean healthy environment for all Nigerians. It is common sight in Nigeria today to see heaps/accumulation of festering waste dumps in our states, urban and commercial cities.<br/>Since the inception of the administration, there have been concerted efforts to achieve sustainable waste management in the state. The efforts culminated in the establishment of the Enugu State Waste Management Agency (ESWAMA) in 2004. The Agency was set up to replace defunct Enugu State Environmental Protection Agency (ENSEPA), which failed to meet the challenges of modern day waste management. This repositioning occurred to enable it give more focused service delivery and to restore the past glory of Enugu State as a very clear city through sound waste management.<br/>ESWAMA was established to develop and implement policies on the management of solid and liquid wastes that would promote the health and well being of the people. The residents are also required to pay approved sanitation rates through designated banks in various zones, when presented with demand notice.<br/>Nnamani (2000) states that sanitation is an act of working out ways to improve the health consideration of a given environment is necessary to overcome the impact of man’s negative activities on the environment.<br/>World Health Organisation refers sanitation as the control of all those factors in man’s physical environment which exercise or may exercise a deleterious effect on his physical development, health and survival.<br/>According to Nnamani (2000) Government intention on designating the last Saturday of every month as a sanitation day is to tackle in serious manner the insurmunting problem of ever-increasing waste generated from domestic, commercial recreational and those from working offices.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of Problem </strong><br/>Waste management process in the society is the root development; no country or society can develop in isolation of proper waste management, whereas, there is indiscriminate disposal and dumping of waste in Enugu State. Now how would this bad attitude could be controlled in the society.<br/>Since proper waste management is credible to create a change and impact on the environment and peoples’ health how would people cooperate with the effort of the ESWAMA as an agency and what could be peoples’ reaction over their job. <br/>ESWAMA as an agency has been empowered by the government to check the illegal dumping of waste at roadsides, enclosures, streams in neighbourhoods and drains. How would government motivate them to carryout their job/responsibilities with dedicated effort and without much stress, in order to promote healthcare and environmental development in the society.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the Study</strong><br/>The objective of the study includes: <br/>1 To discover the ability of the ESWAMA as an agency to control and manage waste disposal in the society. <br/>2 To find out the effect of domestic waste disposal in the environment and peoples’ health.<br/>3 To find out the effect of waste management process by ESWAMA.<br/>4 To discover the solution to domestic waste disposal in the society.<br/>5 To find out how government help to motivate ESWAMA in order to carryout their job objectively.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions </strong><br/>1 Does ESWAMA (Enugu State Waste Management Agency) help to control and manage waste disposal in the society?<br/>2 Does improper waste disposal create any effect on the people’s health and environment? <br/>3 Does Waste Management process or activities has any impact in peoples health and environment? <br/>4 Does waste disposal in the environment/society has any solution? <br/>5 Does government in any way help to motivate ESWAMA in order to carryout their job objectively?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Hypothesis </strong><br/>H1 ESWAMA help to control and manage waste disposal in the society. <br/>Ho ESWAMA does not help to control and manage waste disposal in the society.<br/>H2 Improper waste disposal creates effect on the peoples’ health and environment. <br/>Ho Improper waste disposal does not create effect on the peoples’ health and environment.<br/>H3 Waste management activities by the ESWAMA has a great impact to peoples’ health and environment. <br/>Ho Waste management activities by the ESWAMA has no impact to peoples’ health and environment. <br/>H4 Waste disposal in the environment has a solution/remedy.<br/>Ho Waste disposal in the environment does not have solution/remedy.</p> <p>H5 Government helps to motivate ESWAMA in order to carryout their job objectively. <br/>Ho Government does not motivate ESWAMA in order to carryout their job objectively.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope of the Study</strong><br/>This study is restricted to Ngwo town in Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Significance of the Study </strong><br/>Waste management by the ESWAMA has been credited with the ability to control and manage domestic waste disposal in the society.<br/>As the topic of the study implies “Domestic Waste Disposal, Effect and the Solution in Enugu State”. Therefore, this study intend to find out the effect of domestic waste disposal and how waste management is being carried out by the ESWAMA through their activities (sanitation).<br/>The result of researches will enable the society to know the impact of sanitation and embark on it, for health care. People will get to know the value of ESWAMA in the society. <br/>This study also indicate the role of waste management in people’s health and environment thereby improving health care and environmental sustainable development.<br/>Now that the much emphasis is been placed on the domestic waste disposal, this study/work is most appropriate for it’s aim at finding out how effective people react as a result of waste management in the society. </p> <p><strong>1.8 Definition of Terms</strong><br/>Domestic waste disposal <br/>It is any substance which constitutes a scrap material, an effluent or unwanted surplus substance arising from the application of any process.<br/>Effect A change produced by an action or a cause; a result or an outcome.</p> <p>Solution<br/>A way of solving a problem, dealing with a difficult situation.<br/>Operational Definition <br/>Domestic waste disposal <br/>This is any material lacking directive value to people of Ngwo Town (Ngwo metropolis) and so must be disposed of.<br/>Effect<br/>A change produce through domestic waste disposal from Ngwo town metropolis.<br/>Solution <br/>A way of solving, controlling and managing domestic waste disposal of Ngwo town metropolis.</p> </div> </div>\n\nDOMESTIC WASTE DISPOSAL EFFECT AND THE SOLUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DOMESTIC WASTE DISPOSAL EFFECT AND THE SOLUTIONS", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>EFFECTIVE MOTIVATIONAL PROGRAMMES AND PRODUCTIVITY IN GOVERNMENT PARASTATALS </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Imo State Health Management Board)</p> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION.</strong></p> <p>There is clearly and widely accepted belief that the economy of this counting is weak. This has in effect caused such as untold economic hardship to the populace, such that has never been experienced in the history of Nigeria since its independence. It is an acknowledged view that the economy of the entire world is undergoing recessional period. This is much noticeable and hard- feet in the third world countries of which Nigeria is one. <br/>Nigeria is much up of thirty- six (36) state and Abuja as the federal Capital territory (FTC) and she practices mixed economy ideology system. This is an inheritance from her colonial masters. This resulted to her economic structure in relation to ownership of factors of production being divided into sectors. Earlier before the outset of the third commendable and the standard of living was fairly high, as the purchasing power of our currency was also high. The factors that led into the buoyancy were the revenue that was constantly earned from the sales of crude oil. <br/>The second factor was that the nation’s agricultural productivity was also higher than what is obtainable now. Some of the resultant effect of high flow of revenue from crude oil was that people became reluctant to work and displayed a great deal of non- chalet attitude towards the continuation of their agriculture and small sale industrial operations. This subsequently led to a decrease in productivity of goods and services. It further resulted in an increased dependence on imported oil. Thus, there existed a great disparity between our foreign exchange earnings and our expenditure of which the later was greater. <br/>The emergence of the oil, glut, made it clear that Nigerian’s economy is hanging on a balance. This situation led to the introduction of the structural Adjustment programmes other wise known as ‘SAP’ by the Babangide administration. This was designed to help bring the rumblings economy its shape. The main strategy here is to reduce the rush for foreign goods, increase production locally and to restructure the entire economy to operate at a greater degree of indecency from foreign influence. The role of effective management of financial, material and human resources cannot therefore be underestimated as one of the means of achieving these economic goals. The government is doing her best through viable policy plans and strategies to influxes substantial materials and financial resources of the two arms in production and ultimate economic stability. <br/>On the note, its very important to recognize that for economic growth to be achieved, full and effective consideration must be given to the well being of the individual workers that required to carryout their respective activities in the economic system. When workers are being taken care of, there is the tendency for increased productivity. If productivity increases, there will be the urge for generating more revenue (that is profit) from taxes to the government. Undertaking higher motivational programmes on the individual workers can only do this as it effects human resources management among other factors of production. <br/>It is the objectives of the study to examine the extent if positive effect that could be achieved through effective motivational programmes on productivity unique semi- independent government sector called prostates.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong><br/>There is an ‘Igbo’ adage which says that ‘a collectively owned goat starves to death’. But why? This adage goes to explain the differences that have been existing in efficiency, effectiveness and productivity between the private owned and government establishments. <br/>The main functional area of these parastatals is centered on provision of services of various types such as healthcare, information dissemination, electricity supply and so on. Competition between these private organizations that offer the same services in the parastatals and the parastatals themselves therefore exists.<br/>People seems to patrnize private sectors than the public sectors, Reasons, being that the private sectors that offer similar services are more efficient and also offer them with keen interest. Typical examples are a situation where people patronize private owned hospitals. The question now is ‘why do people drift away from patronizing public set up.’? <br/>A caused interview confirmed some serious complaints by the members of the public over the uncaring and non-chalet attitudes of these government hospital workers. <br/>Conversely, a very close fact finding investigation within the workers confirmed these allegation further questioning as to why workers behave that way, gave the investigator these impressions and they include the following;</p> <p>- High degree of frustration and stigma in the work place. <br/>- Wrong timing in administration of salaries, wages and fringe benefits and other various ills that have befallen the workers which involve bribery, corruption, inefficiency and ultimately downward plunging of productivity which would continue unless something is done to remedy these problems.</p> <p><strong>1.3 RESEACH QUESTIONS. </strong><br/>-Is motivation really a means of achieving the desired result in an organization?</p> <p>- Dose it mean that effectiveness of production depends on the motivated factors of employees? <br/>- Has efficiency be improved since some motivated system was introduced?</p> <p><strong>1.4 PURPOSE / SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY. </strong><br/>The basic motive of this study is to find out the role which effective motivational programmes have played in the continues decrease in productivity in government parastatals, despite that the government has from time to time invested a substantial amount of financial, material and human resources in them. <br/>Furthermore, the purpose of this study is also to look into the internal components of these human resources with special reference to the motivational efforts made by the management for the workers which will ultimately determine their behavior and attitude to work. The efficient and effective utilization of mind and motivation. <br/>Lab our is the most sensitive factor of production. It is human and it needs substantial economic, social and spiritual support to survive. Therefore, it is important to observe the efficient success and survival of other factors of production and the organization as a whole.<br/>The ultimate achievement of goals and objectives of an organization is to maximize profit with the available lab our given them the required thins to motivate them. <br/><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY. </strong><br/>The main reason why this research is carried out in wider perspectives is the researcher’s concern over the wider spread outcry by the entire populace of this country over the present state of the economy. In the light of this, both individuals and governments towards reviving the determine are making various efforts and sacrifices are being made by both individuals and governments towards reviving the deteriorating economy.<br/>Psychologically, people’s attitude towards work desire for personal betterment and achievement, and confidence in future, affects a nation’s economic growth by learning what kind of attitude and motivations people have on the kind of effect upon economic behavior and status. <br/>Therefore, high productivity is a vital component of a growing economy and all avenues must be exploited towards achieving this objective. <br/>The need for the study therefore, becomes stronger and consequently concentrates on the desire to find out how and to what extent effective motivational programmes could help in making workers to increase their productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.5 ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Low productivity could be traced to be caused by many economic variables such as lackadaisical attitude of the workers, which would be due to lack of motivation.<br/>Hence the researcher assumes the following;</p> <p>- That through adequate budgetary, allocations and subsidies these parastatals are provided with adequate financial resources. <br/>- That the government makes every effort to provide all the material resources required to maintain the efficient and effective functioning of these parastatals. <br/>- That the lab our –factor component of the parastatals are knowledgeable, skilled and experienced enough and that their job allocations are unique with their personal potentials.<br/>- That the public will be willing to patronize these parastatals if they were assured of adequate and efficient services commensurate with the value of their income expended for such services.</p> <p><strong>1.6 LIMITATIONS OF SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is carried out with the geographical boundaries of Imo State of Nigeria. The focus of study in the wider economic perspective is the public arm of the economy, owned and controlled by the government, which operate under the name ‘parastatals.’ The parastatals, which is selected as a case study of this research is in Imo State Management Board.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFFINITION OF TERMS. </strong><br/>1) MOTIVATION: This is an individual’s inner state that causes the person to behave in a way that ensures the accomplishment of some goals. <br/>2) MANAGEMENT: Is the process of reaching the organizational goal by working with and through people and other organizational resources.</p> <p>3) MOTIVATION STRENTH: This is an individual’s degree of desire to perform a behavior.</p> <p>4) MOTIVATION FACTORS: These are the set of items that influence the degree of job satisfaction. <br/>5) ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS: This refers to the degree to which the organization accomplishes its objectives.</p> <p>6) PRODUCTIVITY This is the relating of input to output to defect whether the organization is moving forward or not.</p> <p>7) EQUITY: This is the right an ordinary shareholder has to the share in the profit of the organization.</p> <p>8) RESEARCH: This is part of the company’s activities concerned with discovering new products for the company and for making technical improvements in existing ones. <br/>9) HERARCHY OF NEEDS: By maslow’s ‘state of Human Needs’ he described hierarchy of needs as the arrangement of human needs in an order in which individuals generally strive to satisfy themselves.

A recurring debate within contemporary academic circles, criminologists, health workers and prison experts, is to ensure an appropriate health template for proper prison administration that will reflect its objectives. Even though crime and other vices need to be deterred, it should be to the extent that inmates health should be adequately taken care of during and after imprisonment; it is therefore needful to be logical and rational in terms of health delivery while in custody.</p> <p>Seven years into the new millennium, health for all prison inmates in Nigeria and many African nations has remained mirage. Recent assessment of African Prison Health systems indicates a gloomy picture of weakness in performance (African Regional Health Report, 2006). The inability to provide quality and equitable access to prison health care services through much reliance on western health care framework have further widening the existing health inequalities in many African countries and the Nigerian prisons in particular. This scenario has also the poor and the rich, urban and rural dwellers, inmates and the “free” at different axis of the production spectrum of health care delivery in Nigeria. A good example of this unfavourable equation becomes obvious when the health of special groups like the prisoners is critically examined (Health in African Prisons, 1999). Evidence has linked major determinants of health in modern populations to socioeconomic, political and cultural factors and as such inequalities in health have remained problematic across cultures, socio-economic class, gender or ethnicity (Bambra et al., 2005). In the social sequence of events, prison inmates are most times from the poorest sectors of the society, and suffer more from inequitable access to effective health care services. This experience also exacerbates existing health problems of inmates (de viggiani, 2007). Hence, the current drive towards realizing the health related millennium development goals requires more forceful drive from the Nigerian government. Health is political and the power exercised over it is part of the wider economic, social and political system (Bambra1, et al., 2005). Thus, achieving both qualitative and quantitative health among special groups like prison inmates may be far from realization going by the slow attitude of prison officials and the government in particular in addressing the health needs of prisoners. Hence, this paper attempts a sociological discourse of prison health within the social context producing it. This was done by discussing prison health in Nigeria as a social product. The paper further suggest plausible model on which optimum prison health in Nigeria could be realized.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The unsavory nature of Nigeria prisons health care system leaves one in doubt, with too many questions and fewer answers; being that majority of persons become susceptible to diseases and infections than when they never went behind bars and commit more heineous crimes. Officers and men of Nigeria prisons epitomize have not taken the health of prison inmates seriously which many are certainly not satisfied with their conditions of service delivery health wise. Interestingly, prison still remains indispensable in correcting, reforming and rehabilitating “perceived convicts” in Nigeria. It is worrisome that recommendations and suggestions made to government for prison health reforms are yet to be implemented.</p> <p><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objectives of the study are to examine health care delivery system for inmates of the Nigeria prison. Other specific objectives of the study include;</p> <ol><li>To examine the health condition of prison inmates.</li> <li>To assess the environmental condition of Nigeria prisons.</li> <li>To assess the benefit to effective health care delivery in Nigeria prisons.</li> <li>To examine the Nigerian prison reforms.</li> <li>To examine the challenges to achieving an effective health care delivery system for prison inmates.</li> <li>To recommend ways of improving health care delivery in Nigeria prisons.</li> </ol> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What are the health conditions of prison inmates in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the environmental conditions of Nigeria prisons?</li> <li>What is the benefit to effective health care delivery in Nigeria prisons?</li> <li>What are the Nigerian prison reforms that would improve health care delivery?</li> <li>What are the challenges to achieving an effective health care delivery system for prison inmates?</li> <li>What are the ways of improving health care delivery in Nigeria prisons?</li> </ol> <p><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>H0: There are no challenges to effective health care system in Nigerian prisons.</p> <p>H1: There are challenges to effective health care system in Nigerian prisons.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study would greatly benefit the Nigerian prison service and the federal government as it would reveal the benefits of effective health care system and the challenges of achieving effective health care system in Nigerian prisons across the country. the study would also be of immense importance to students, researchers and scholars who are interested in developing a further study on the subject matter.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is restricted to health care system delivery system to prison inmates in Nigerian prison using the Nigerian prison service Ado ekiti, Ekiti state as a case study.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Financial constraint:</strong> Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview)</p> <p><strong>Time constraint:</strong> The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Because of the large number involved, and the fact that most of the hospital had no maternity, only two hundred and fifty expectant mothers were used. Eight specific objectives and corresponding research questions and six hypotheses were stated and used for the study.</p> <p>The instrument for data collection was a questionnaire which had three sections. The personal data of the respondents, fourteen questions each on nutritional knowledge and practice respectively. The questionnaire responses on knowledge were two-point scale of Yes and No while that of practices were in three-point scale of “Practice Always”. “Do not practice” and “Practice Rarely”. Data were analyzed using correlation analysis, percentage, ANOVA and multiple t-test of paired comparison. The results showed that all the hypothesis of the study were rejected. The mean (x) percentage of the subjects who indicated knowledge of what constituted good nutrition was greater than those who indicated regular practice. Some correlation existed between the subject’s knowledge of nutrition and their nutritional practice. Education, age and parity influenced their knowledge and practices of nutrition. Based on these results some recommendations were made such as:- (a) Health educators and nutritionists should be invited to give health talks to pregnant women during antenatal clinic. (b) The age, educational level</p> </div> <div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Nutritional knowledge has been proven to play a very vital role in adopting optimal nutrition practices in the health of every expectant mother.As a matter of fact, health and nutritional status of the population of a nation is an important indicator of development of the country. A nutrition survey carried out in India observed that the nutritional status of pregnant and lactating and infants is not satisfactory. This is probably due to lack of basic knowledge regarding proper nutrition and wrong customs prevalent in the community besides non availability and low intake of food.In Nigeria, there are some adverse socio-cultural and economical factors that produced negative consequences and reduce women’s access to effective ante-natal services needed to reduce maternal morbidity andmortality. The most important of these are the low socioeconomic status of women that deny them access to appreciable decision-making with regard to their reproductive functions, high level of female illiteracy which is a leading cause of poor health seeking behaviour for maternity services among Nigerian women and high rate of poverty that predominantly affects women leading to inadequate dietary intakes, high rate of pregnancy complications and women’s reduced access to evidence based maternity services ( Ogunjuyibe, 2000).Maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy is an important determinant of birth weight. High rate of Low Birth Weight (LBW) in developing countries has been attributed to poor maternal nutrition (Ogunjuyigbe et al., 2008) Pregnancy is a time of tremendous physiological change that demands healthy dietary lifestyle choices. Growing foetus draws a lot of energy and nutrients from the mother to enhance physical and psychological development (Ojo and Briggs, 2010). In developing countries like Nigeria, it is essential to states that low birth weight stems primarily from the mother’s poor health and nutrition, and inadequate nutrition during pregnancy accounts for a large proportion of growth retardation (Hareyan, 2005). Malnutrition has been recognized as one of the underlying factor for maternal death during the process of procreation. The causes of malnutrition are multidimensional and multi-factorial with poverty, food inadequacy and maternal illiteracy being the main culprit of the menace in developing countries. The health of the mother and her nutritional status can influence the health and survival of the child because of the biological links that exist between her and her child during pregnancy and lactation (Ogunjuyigbe et al., 2008).</p> <p>There is an important factor under nutrition that is responsible for high infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate and also for low birth weight of infants. Appropriate nutritional practice on the other hand plays a pivotal role in determining optimal health and development of infants. (Bamji Ms, 2003). There is abundant epidemiological evidence that poor prenatal nutrition predisposes the offspring to diseases in its later life.Inadequate nutrition is the predominant factor leading to malnutrition, which can be expressed as either under nutrition or over nutrition. Under nutrition occurs when there is not only inadequate energy but also a lack or imbalance of specific food components and nutrients. In addition to sufficient energy, adequate supplies of macronutrients and micronutrients are required to promote optimum growth. The proportions and amounts of these nutrients may change according to the various stage of growth.There have been considerable changes in human lifestyle all over the world in the recent decades. Especially in recent years, the lifestyle has rapidly been changed. These changes appeared in diet, types of food, cooking time, etc. Nowadays processed foods are rapidly replacing organic food. Another change is the rapid increase in the number of restaurants and in people's tendency to eat fast food. Proper nutrition is one of the most important aspects of lifestyle(Amamoto and Andoyama, 2004) Epidemiological evidence shows that there is an increased incidence of diseases such as (Cardiovascular diseases, obesity, high blood pressure and cancer), which can be attributed to changes in lifestyle as well as changes in nutritional habits. Nutritional education is also one of the important aspectsthat play a big role in nutritional knowledge by raising awareness and ultimately the health of the society (Stampfer et al.,2000) In order to remain healthy and physically active and enjoy a healthier life style it is necessary to obtain good nutritional knowledge and implement it. The knowledge, attitude and practice must be considers in expectant mothers in order to promote society health.From time immemorial it has been recognized that the pregnant and lactating women form oneof the most nutritionally vulnerable segments of the population; the ill effects of maternalunder nutrition affect not only the mother but also her offspring.In order to bring about change in the level of nutritional knowledge and practices prevailing people regarding nutrition, an attempt was made here to provide an awareness regarding nutritional knowledge practices among the mothers who are visiting a private and government hospitals. </p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The most important factor responsible for high infant mortality rate is under nutrition, maternal mortality rate and also for low birth weight of infants. Nutrition is a multi-sectoral issue that needs to be tackled at various levels. Nutrition affects the development as much as development affects nutrition. It is therefore, important to tackle the problem of nutrition through direct nutrition intervention for vulnerable groups such as pregnant mothers. Adequate knowledge regarding various aspects of feeding practices during pregnancy and during infancy is very essential especially among females as they are going to influence the feeding practices of this vulnerable group. This led to the study on nutrition knowledge and practice among expectant mothers. </p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> The main objective of this study is to examine the nutritional knowledge among expectant mothers, but the researcher intends to achieve the following sub objectives; </p> <p>i)             To outline common pregnancy outcome with poor maternal nutrition</p> <p>ii)           To ascertain the relationship between dietary intake, physical activity and maternal nutritional status. </p> <p>iii)          To enumerate factors associated with deterioration in maternal nutritional status. </p> <p>iv)         To examine the role of contraception in maternal nutrition, and the preventive measures, treatment of micronutrient deficiencies. </p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher in null and alternative statements.</p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>age of expectant mothers at pregnancy has no significant influence on level of nutritional knowledge</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong>   age of expectant mothers at pregnancy has a significant influence on level of nutritional knowledge</p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>  there is nosignificant relationship between dietary intake, physical activity and maternal nutritional status of expectant mothers.</p> <p><strong>H2:</strong>  there is a significant relationship between dietary intake, physical activity and maternal nutritional status of expectant mothers.</p> <p><strong>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is unbelievable to discover that many expectant mothers in this era still lack the fundamental idea or basic knowledge of nutrition during pregnancy.It is believed that at the end of this study the findings will be of utmost benefits to every expectant mothers and women as it serves as a means of curtailing the effects of malnutrition on their reproductive health. The ministry of health will make a great deal from the findings as it serves as a material for onward sensitization within cities and communities.  The findings will be relevant to those who intend to carry out a similar research topic as it has contributed to the existing literature.Finally, the research will serve as a fuel of new reasoning and further research work in nutritional knowledge and practice among expectant mothers, and to health science students, lecturers and the general public. </p> <p><strong>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is centered on examining nutritional knowledge and practice among expectant mothers.

According to one of the breast cancer journals (www.webmd.com) the size, stage, rate of growth and other characteristics of the tumor determine the series of treatment. Treatment may include surgery, drugs, chromosomal therapy and (radiation and immunotherapy) surgical removal of the tumor provides the benefits with surgery alone being capable of producing a cause in long term disease free survival. Several chemotherapy regime are  commonly in addition to surgery. Most forms of thermotherapy  kills cells that are dividing rapidly anywhere in the breast that were missed by the surgery which usually extends survival somewhat, although, radiation exposure to the heart may cause heart failure in the future. Some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones such as estrogen and progesterone which makes it possible to treat them blocking the effects of these hormones.</p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Breast cancer surgery in the 18th century, because of its visibility, breast cancer was the form of cancer most often described in ancient documents, because autopsies  were rare, cancer of the internal organ were essentially invisible to ancient medicine, breast cancer however could be felt through the skin and in its advanced state often developed into fumigating lesion, the junior would become necrotic (die from the inside causing the tumor to appear to break up) and ulcerate through the skin, weeping fetid dark fluid.  The  oldest description of cancer was discovered in Egypt and dates back to approximately 1600BC. The Edwin Smith pangrus described eight cases of tumors or ulcers of the breast that were treated by cauterization, the writing says about the disease, there is no treatment for centuries, physicians describes similar cases in their practices with the same conclusion. Ancient, from the time of Greeks through the 17th century was based on humoralism and thus believed that breast cancer was generally caused by imbalances in the fundamental fluids of black biles, alternatively, patients often saw it as divine punishment.</p> <p>In the 18th century, a wide variety of medical explanations were proposed, including a black of sexual activity, physical injuries to the breast, curdled breast milks and various forms of lymphatic blockages, either internal or due to restrictive clothing. In the 19th century, Scottish surgeon John Rodman said that there is a fear of cancer’s tendency to run in families. Although, breast cancer was known in ancient times, it was uncommon until the 19th century when improvements in sanitation and control of deadly infectious diseases result in dramatic increase in life span. Previously, most women had died too young to have developed breast cancer. Additionally, early and frequent child bearing and breast feeding probably reduced the rate of breast cancer development in these women who did survive to middle age. Ancient medicine believed that the cause was systematic, rather than local and because surgery carried a high mortality rate. The referred treatment tended to be pharmacological rather than surgical. Breast cancer journal (www.webmd.com).</p> <p>According to society of women’s health research in the US (2005) both incidence and death rates for breast cancer have been divining in the last few years in native Americans and Alaskan, the research also indicated that breast cancer  remains the most feared disease even though heart disease is exaggerated than the risk of breast cancer. According to “world cancer report 2008”, breast cancer caused 455,503 deaths worldwide (13.7% of cancer deaths in women) breast cancer is more than 100 times common in women than in men, although, males tend to have poorer outcome due to delay in diagnosis.</p> <p>The Federal Capital Territory like other states in Nigeria had suffered great pain from this deadly disease even before the establishment of National Hospital Abuja on the 22nd of May 1999 by the federal government of Nigeria and was commissioned by the former head of state, his Excellency, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar and opened its door to patients on the 11th Oct. 1999.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Breast cancer is one of the dangerous disease that affect women in the world, causing pains in the faces of our mother and even men in the society at large.

The biological effects of ionizing radiations are of concern here as evidence shows that medical uses of radiations have harmful effects (Hendee and Edwards, 1996). According to the neuroradiologist Mark Pfleger (http://healthyoutlook.dephealth.com, 2011) patients and the community need to understand the safe use of radiation, and to become more active participants in their own healthcare. Quinn et al. (1997), Bushberg et al. (2003) and Kiguli-Malwandde et al. (2006) report that radiographers and clientele are not very awareness of radiation doses, and that there is a lack of communication between radiographers and patients relating to radiation and its possible effects. X-ray utilization in human medicine leads to exposure of the patient and the radiographer. Although the radiation dose is low in diagnostic examinations, attention is usually given in order to minimize unnecessary exposure for members of the public and occupational workers. Exposure to ionizing radiation cannot be avoided in medical imaging facilities. Radiation exposure over a long period of time (years) produces stochastic effects (NCRPM, 1980). There is no threshold level of radiation exposure below which it could be said with certainty that cancer or genetic effects will not occur. Doubling the radiation dose doubles the probability that a cancer or genetic effect would occur (Kondo, 1993). The steps needed to prevent accidental exposures to any part of the body include adequate training of personnel, enlightenment of non-radiation workers in the vicinity of radiation sources (Belyakov et al., 2001), monitoring and control of radiation exposures, putting up warning signs, and proper disposal of radioactive. Radiation protection is the science and art of protecting people and the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. It is also described as all activities directed towards minimizing radiation exposure of patients and personnel during x-ray exposure. In developing nations , more recent studies show that about 3.6 billion imaging studies per year are carried out world-wide, leading to an increase of 70% in worldwide collective effective dose for medical diagnostic procedures. More concern has recently been appeared in recent studies that the knowledge of referring doctors about radiation doses incurred during diagnostic radiological procedures is deficient. Such information may be of particular relevance when the expansion of imaging technology is considered. All radiology field workers require appropriate monitoring, as well as protection tools and equipment. They must also receive education and training appropriate to their jobs. The level of training should be based on the level of risk. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) assumes the responsibility of providing guidance in matters of radiation safety. The ICRP has given the recommendations for the system of radiological protection in its ICRP Publication No, 60 (1990) which is based on the following general principles: No practice involving exposures to radiation should be adopted unless it produces a sufficient benefit to the exposed individual or to society and in relation to any particular source within a practice, the magnitude of individual doses, the number of people exposed and the likelihood of incurring exposures where these are not certain to be received should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The European Commission has addressed the importance of training in radiological protection (RP), publishing a guideline with specific recommendations for accreditation of training programs for interventional procedures. Medical use of radiation may exceed natural background as a source of population exposure. In countries with advanced health care systems, the annual number of radiological diagnostic procedures approaches or exceeds one for every member of the population</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>This meta-analysis aims to analyze worldwide factors significantly affecting radiographers’ compliance with the Radiation Protection (RP) to reduce radiation effects on hospitals in worldwide setting. RP requires compliance of radiographers because the radiographer plays a central role, as she/he cares for the patient before, during and after the radiographic examination and/or radiological intervention Andersson, et al. Radiographer is the key person involved in radiation exposure. Radiographers need to be more aware of their roles in ensuring total compliance to standard radiation safety in their institution. Compliance levels should be higher to protect the technologist and patient. It is in view of this that the researcher intends to investigate the knowledge and awareness of radiation exposure and safety practice among patients undergoing medical imaging in selected hospitals in F.C.T, Abuja.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The knowledge and awareness of Radiation exposure and safety practice among patients undergoing medical imaging in selected hospitals.

Incidences of drug abuse and related anti-social behavior have tremendously increased in recent years. This has become a matter of concern to the government, parents, teachers, Non-governmental organizations and all other relevant agencies. Parents do not recognize the extent of drug use and as a result, some young people think they can use drugs with impunity. Most parents believe that it is the responsibility of teachers to check drug abuse among school going youths and still most of them delude themselves that their children are safe and secure. Drug abuse is not confined to young people in certain geographical areas or from particular social-economic backgrounds. It affects the nation as a whole-both urban and rural areas. The concept of “drug” has been defined as any chemical substance which affect living organism. Such a substance may be used to fight infections and illness or minimize pain, fatigue, anxiety or at times to achieve certain level of euphoria. WHO (1952) defined “drugs” as any substances that when taken into a living body produce reactions or modify its psychological and physiological functioning. On the other hand “drug abuse” has been defined as any use of drugs for nonmedical purposes almost always for altering consciousness. Drug abuse denotes substances that change the mental or physical state of a person and that may be used repeatedly for that effect leading to abnormality. WHO defined “Drug dependence” as a “state” arising from repeated administration of a drug on a periodic or continuous basis in order to experience its psychic effect and sometimes to avoid the discomfort of its absence.(Kilonzo, 1996:170). However, experience shows that drug abuse has been on the medical and nonmedical drug which is the concern of this study. For the medical drugs, using them without prescription of the medical personnel or using them contrary to the prescriptions of the medical personnel is considered as abusing the medical drugs. For example some people use symptoms of diseases as a means of buying and using different drugs or for quicker recovery as some think, they use drugs not asprescribed by the doctors, i.e. use drugs for four times instead of three times or three times instead of two times per day. For the non-medical or illicit drugs, they include heroin, cocaine, cannabis, opium etc. When these are used it is said that drugs are abused because their uses are not for the purposes of treating, preventing and diagnosing diseases. Cigarette smoking is one of licit drugs which commonly abused by people.The main effect of using cigarette is nicotine which causes cancer of lungs, gangrene chest pain, death etc.Also alcoholism from the medical point of view indicates a disease caused by chronic, excessive drinking resulting to dependence on alcohol. Physiological definition of alcoholism classifies it as a drug addiction recognizable by the occurance of a withdrawal syndrome when the drinking is stopped. Mbatia (1996:61).In a nutshell alcohol like the other drug abuses, affect the quality of the people’s lives and affect people in both developed and developing countries. Alcoholism and drug abuse are a growing problem in Nigeria affecting people at different levels and groups including street children, prostitutes, the youth, men and women. Ironically drug abuse is no longer a problem confined to the slums and youths in the urbancenters but also in schools, prisons and the rural areas. In this view drug abuse affect almost everybody in the society but the researcher wants to investigate the danger of drug abuse among youths. </p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Drug abuse is one of the top problems confronting the nation today especially among the youth. Incidences of drug abuse and related anti-social behavior have tremendously increased in recent years. This has become a matter of concern to the government, parents, teachers, Non-governmental organizations and all other relevant agencies. It is more prevalent than parents suspect. Parents do not recognize the extent of drug use and as a result, some young people think they can use drugs with impunity. </p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is dangers of drug abuse among the youths.  But for the successful completion of the study; the researcher intends to achieve the following sub-objectives.</p> <p>1.   To identify the causes which make the youth to abuse drugs in Nigeria</p> <p>2.   To find out the impacts of drug abuse among youth in Nigeria</p> <p>3.   To ascertain the relationship between drug abuse and the youth psychological behavior</p> <p>4.   To recommend remedial measures of drug abuse among youth in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>For the successful completion of the study, the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher;  </p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>  there are no causes which make the youth to abuse drugs in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H1:  </strong>there are causes which make the youth to abuse drugs in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H02:</strong>there are no relationship between drug abuse and the youth psychological behavior</p> <p><strong>H2:</strong>there are relationship between drug abuse and the youth psychological behavior</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of benefit to the youth.

Lastly, conclusion, It is evident that from the findings, majority of the students of BIU know how to perform breast self examination and they do it confidently while some others are not sure of the appropriate steps to follow in performing BSE. It was also evident that the tendency of the students performing breast self examination (BSE) at the required time is very low and their reasons could be as a result of not knowing how to do it, ignorance, lack of interest, the study also made recommendations inform of strategies to curb unfavourable attitudes towards breast self examination<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT <br/> CHAPTER ONEINTRODUCTION <br/>Background to the Study                <br/>Statement of the Problem        <br/>Research Questions      <br/>Purpose of the study      <br/>Significance of the study         <br/>Delimitation and scope of the study -        <br/>Limitation of the study -        <br/>Definition of terms         <br/>CHAPTER TWO REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE <br/>2.1    Overview of Breast Self Examination<br/>2.2    Breast Self-examination: Background<br/>2.3    Practice of Breast Self-examination<br/>2.4    Impact of Socio-Demographic Parameters on Breast Self-examination<br/>2.5    Role of Nurses’ in Breast Self-examination<br/>2.6    Barriers to Breast Self-examination<br/>2.7    Implications for Practice<br/>CHAPTER THREEMETHODOLOGY <br/>Research Design <br/>Population of the Study        <br/>Sample and sampling technique        <br/>Research instrument     <br/>Validity of the Instrument      <br/>Reliability of the Instrument   <br/>Method of Data Presentation and Analysis       <br/>CHAPTER FOUR DATA ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS <br/>Research questions       <br/>Discussion of Findings  <br/>CHAPTER FIVE SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS <br/>Summary    <br/>Findings      <br/>Conclusion <br/>Recommendations         <br/>REFERENCE      <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1    Background of the Study <br/>Breast Self-Examination (BSE) is a technique in which a lady examines her own breasts by seeing and feeling with fingers to detect breast lump. The purpose of breast self-examination is to increase familiarity with breast, to detect presence of lump in the breast at an early stage and to look for any abnormal changes in the breast Deaton, J.G. (1988). Self examination of the breast each month between the 7th and 10th day of the menstrual cycle is the simplest yet extremely important way to detect breast cancer at the early stage of growth Abudu, E.K et al., (2007). The BSE technique involves palpation of the breasts for lump with the tips of the fingers, rather than the flat of the hand. The woman would be in the erect position, either sitting or standing and while lying down. It has been observed that women can detect 95% of breast cancers and 65% of early minimal breast cancers through BSE Brunar, L.S. and Suddarth, D.S. (1988).<br/>Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women worldwide Bray, F., MacCarron, P. and Parkin, M. (2004). Globally, it has been reported that breast cancer ranks as the fifth cause of death from cancer overall, although still the leading cause of cancer mortality in women (the 411,000 annual deaths represent 14% of female cancer deaths) Parkin, D.M et al., (2005). The WHO estimated that 1.2 million cases of breast cancer are diagnosed worldwide each year which represented 10% of all diagnosed cancers and constituted 22% of all new cases in women in 2000 making it by far the most common cancer in women Anderson, B.O., Braun, S., Lim, S., Robert, A., Taplin, S.S., et al. (2003). In Nigeria, breast cancer has been reported as the most common cancer in women and the second leading cause of death Adebamowo, C.A. et al., (2000).. Late presentation of patients at advanced stages of when little or no benefit can be derived from any form of therapy is the hallmark of breast cancer in Nigerian women Okobia, M.N et al., (2006). The peak age incidence of breast cancer in Nigeria is reported to be between 45 - 50 years Abudu, E.K et al., (2007). In contrast to Europe and America where it was reported to be 65 - 75 years. Some cases have been reported below 30 years in Nigeria Okobia, M.N. and Osime, U. (2001). The three screening methods recommended for breast cancer include Breast Self-Examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography. Unlike CBE and mammography which require hospital visit and specialized equipment and expertise, BSE is inexpensive and carried out by women themselves. Although mammography remains the best diagnostic tool in the detection of breast cancer, it is not routinely performed in Nigeria because of cost, high technology equipment and expertise required. Mammograms miss most breast lump in the younger age groups; this is likely to happen in Nigeria where cases below 30 have been reported Anyanwu, S.N. (2007).<br/>To reduce the burden of breast cancer in Nigeria, it is necessary to first determine the level of knowledge and practice (skill) relating to breast self-examination as a breast cancer prevention strategy especially among our teaming youths who at this stage of life can continue this practice to adulthood. Therefore this study was aimed to identify the level of knowledge and practice of breast self-examination among female undergraduates in Idahosa University in Nigeria.<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem<br/>Although a lot has been done on the awareness and practice of BSE, not much has been done among undergraduate, as most of the studies have been directed toward relatively young ladies. Again, the late presentation of many ladies with breast cancer to hospitals has continually become a major issue of great concern. In view of the importance of Breast Self Examination (BSE) in the early detection of breast cancer and the fact that it is cost effective and more readily available than any other method of early detection of breast cancer in our environment.<br/>1.3    Objectives of the Study<br/>1.    To examine the impact of breast self examination<br/>2.    To assess whether female undergraduates know the benefits of breast self examination<br/>3.    To determine the level of attitude and practice of BSE among female undergraduate<br/>1.4    Research Questions<br/>1.    What is the impact of breast self examination?<br/>2.    Does female undergraduates know the benefits of breast self examination?<br/>3    What is the level of attitude and practice of BSE among female undergraduate?<br/>1.5    Scope of Study<br/>This study deals more on the subject matter i.e the attitude and practices of breast self examination among female undergraduates of tertiary institution and also extends to the relationship of breast self examination and is extended to possible breast disease. It would provide information that will enhance awareness and the impact breast self examination.<br/>1.6    Significance of the Study    <br/>The rate of breast cancer is of great concern to ladies. This research would provide information that would enhance awareness of the importance of breast self examination.<br/>It would afford the ladies the opportunity of checking and any abnormal condition. This work would also serve as framework of reference for future researchers who might conduct inquiries or research into similar topic.<br/>1.7    Limitations of Study<br/>     In this project, the researcher encountered some difficulties such as lack of sufficient fund to execute the project. The time frame given for the project was not enough to permit more extensive work. Inadequate stock of materials on the topic was another constraint.<br/>    Moreover, since people behave differently even under the same situations and circumstances, one cannot deny that temperamental differences may affect the result of the study.<br/>1.8    Definition of Terms<br/>Breast: Breast is either of the pair of mammary glands extending from the front of the chest in pubescent and adult human females and some other mammals also either of the analogous but rudimentary organs of the male chest especially when enlarged.<br/>Self Examination: Self-examination is the act of examining your own body to check whether or not you have any signs of a particular disease or illness. <br/>Breast self-examination is invaluable for detecting cancer in its very early stages.<br/>Attitude: A predisposition or a tendency to respond positively or negatively towards a certain idea, object, person, or situation. Attitude influences an individual's choice of action, and responses to challenges, incentives, and rewards (together called stimuli). <br/>Undergraduate: An undergraduate is a college or university student who is not a graduate student. <br/>Cancer: Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes.<br/><br/>\n\nATTITUDE AND PRACTICES OF BREAST SELF EXAMINATION AMONG FEMALE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS OF TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ATTITUDE AND PRACTICES OF BREAST SELF EXAMINATION AMONG FEMALE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS OF TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PUBLIC HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IN NIGERIA 1986-2016</strong></p> <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>Conventional wisdom holds that health is central to human general well-being, as well as a prerequisite for increased productivity, and overall economic growth and development of an economy. This explains why governments across the globe are making enormous efforts to achieve good health for all and Nigeria is no exception. Regrettably, despite government’s efforts to improve the health situation of the citizens through massive health care expenditure, the Nigerian health outcomes (such as life expectancy and mortality rate) are still considered one of the poorest and most miserable in the world. Thus, the study follows a causality approach to examining the relationship among government health expenditure, health outcomes, and economic growth in Nigeria during the period 1986 – 2016.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>The reform of health delivery system is one of the essential elements of overall development of a country. Most common policy response to the demand for improved healthcare is to increase the public health expenditure. However, taking into account the complexity of the determinants of health outcomes, it can be naïve to presume a direct positive relation between public health expenditure and health outcome. The Governments in developed countries with better health indicators have large growing public health expenditures; nevertheless the role of public expenditure in health care provision has been constantly debated.  Conventional wisdom holds that health is central to human general well-being, as well as a prerequisite for increased productivity, and overall economic growth and development of an economy. Health is also a driving force upon which other human capitals such as education, skills, etc, rely on. Oni (2014) posits that healthy workers lose less time from work and are more productive when working. According to (WHO, 2005), good health has the consequence of widespread economic growth, and an escape of ill – health traps in poverty. As pointed out by Barro (1996), health is a capital productive asset and an engine of growth. Therefore, it is rather instructive to appreciate how dramatic the improvements in World’s Health have been over the past decades. In 1950, some 280 out of every 1000 children in developing countries died before their fifth birthday. By the year 2000, the number had reduced to 126 per 1000 in low-income countries, 39 per 1000 in middle-income countries, and 6 per 1000 in high-income countries (Todaro and Smith, 2006). This is the result of total eradication of some important killer diseases such as small pox as well as some major childhood illnesses such as rubella and polio, through the use of vaccines. Following the reports of the World Health Organization (2005), about fifty percent of economic growth differentials between developed and developing nations are attributed to ill-health, and low life expectancy. This is because developed countries spend higher proportion of their Gross Domestic Products (GDP) in providing health care services to their citizens, while some of the developing countries exhibit great variability in health care expenditure. The reports also show that there exists very great variability in the performance of health system at each income level, and in each country. According to the same report, both developed and developing countries were ranked according to the proportion of income spent on health care. While Singapore was ranked 6th, Costa Rica was 36th with Colombia, Chile, and Morocco as 22nd, 23rd and 29th respectively. However, it should be noted that all of these developing countries ranked higher than the United States. This is an indication that much can be done with relatively modest income. The Nigerian economy has been backward for the past two decades despite its independent status since 1960. The petroleum rich Nigeria economy long hobbled by political instability, corruption and poor macroeconomic management, is undergoing substantial economic reform under the new civilian administration. Nigeria’s economy is struggling to leverage the country’s vast wealth in fossil fuels in order to displace the crushing poverty that affects about 57 percent of its population. Economists refer to the coexistence of vast natural resources wealth and extreme personal poverty in developing countries like Nigeria as the “paradox of plenty” or the “curse of oil” Nigeria’s exports of oil and natural gas - at a time of peak prices - have enabled the country to post merchandise trade and current account surpluses in recent years. Reportedly, 80 percent of Nigeria’s energy revenue flows to the government, 16 percent covers operational costs, and the remaining 4 percent go to investors (Odusola, 1998). Health is a very important aspect of an individual’s wellbeing, and since individuals make a nation, therefore, healthcare could be regarded as one of the necessary conditions to achieving a sustainable longterm economic development. Health can be defined to mean general physical condition i.e. condition of the body or mind especially in terms of the presence or absence of illness, injuries or impairments. The issue of health is a very sensitive one because it deals with not just humans but with human body. Without a good health condition it is almost impossible to carry out any economic activity and if at all there is any it will certainly not be efficient and so we really have to take this subject seriously (Cremieux, et al., 1999). It has been established in the literature that improvement in health care is an important prerequisite for enhancing Human Capital Development (HCD) in any and every economy. According to Siddiqui, Afridi and Haq (1995), they opined that improved health status of a nation creates outward shift in labour supply curve/increase productivity of labour with a resultant increase in productivity of investment in other forms of human capital. Thus, the level of government expenditure on health determines the ultimate level of human capital development which eventually leads to better, more skilful, efficient and productive investment in other sector of the economy (Muhammad and Khan, 2007). The financial commitments of government to the health sector are both the recurrent and capital expenditure on health. The capital expenditure of government decrease from N7.3million in 1970 to N4.88 million in 1972 before it rose again to N126.75 in 1994. It dropped sharply to N79.2 million in 1982. From 1982 to 1987, capital expenditure on health declined from N72.9m in 1982 to an all time low of N17.2m in 1987. This development is occasioned by the fact government was more preoccupied in the business of paying workers salaries with less attention being paid to capital expenditure. In 1988 there was a significant rise to N297.96m. By 1991, the statistic dropped to N137.3m but plummeted to N33.72m in 1992. The figure rose steadily from N586.2 million in 1993 to N17,717.42m, N33,396.97m and N34,647.9m in 2003, 2005 and 2007 respectively the capital expenditure on health stood at N64,922.9m in 2008 and N79,321.09m in 2011. The recurrent expenditure on health also follows a similar trend. It rose gradually from N12.48m in 1970 to N59.47m in 1977 but fell to N40.48m in the successive year. The pattern of health expenditure at this period is a reflection of both the product of the disposition of government policy towards health issue and the determination of the Federal Government to improve the health care system with the wind fall of oil revenue. Recurrent expenditure nosedived into N15.32m in 1979 before it rose to N52.79m, N84.46m N82.79 million in 1979, 1987 and 1983 respectively. From 1984 to 1986, recurrent expenditure rose from N101.55m to N134.12m when the recurrent expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure stood at 77.4 percent. The value of recurrent health expenditure reduced significantly in 1987 to N41.31m before it rose steadily from N422.80 in 1988 to N24,522.27m in 2001. This figure rose again from N40,621.42 in 2002 to N44,551.63, N58,686.56 and N72,290.07 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. Recurrent expenditure on health stood at N18,200.0 million in 2008 and N21,542.9m in 2011. Economic theory has established a positive mutual interaction between the health of a worker and his productivity. First, it is widely known that a healthy worker is more fit both physically and mentally, to contribute to production as well as increase productivity more than a sick worker. On the other hand, a sustainable growth and development of an economy can offer the people the access to a better nutrition and disease treatment opportunities. This explains why governments across the globe are making frantic efforts to achieve good health for all. Thus, following the recommendations of the United Nations (UN) that countries should budget at least 8 to 10 percent of their GDP as a benchmark expenditure on health, the Nigerian government has been making efforts to increase its expenditure on health. The government tried to meet up with the benchmark by increasing the total expenditure on health from N84.46bn in 1981 to N134.12bn in 1986. By 1987, it dropped to N41.31bn, and skyrocketed to N575.30bn in 1989. In 2002, the total expenditure on health has risen to N40, 621.42bn, and dropped to N33,267.98bn in 2003, and later appreciated to N104,810.08bn in 2010. Between 2011 and 2014, the total expenditure rose to N113, 766.30bn, in 2011, N122, 722.60bn in 2012, N131,678.87bn in 2013 and N140,635.10bn in 2014. A cursory look at these figures reveals that health as an important facilitator of economic growth has attracted the attention of the government, and has as well received a fair share of the country’s gross domestic product over these years</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Better health condition improves or shift labour supply curve to the right, increase the level of production and advancement in the performance of macroeconomic variables. Moreover, the extent of share of government expenditure on health to some extent determines the ultimate level of human capital development which then metamorphosizes to a better skillful efficient productive investment in other sectors of the economy. Increase in budgetary allocation to social services is required in developing countries especially Nigeria. In Nigeria, despite the relative huge budgetary allocation for health sector, this has not really manifested in the health status of an average Nigerian. The health status of Nigerians is consistently ranked low. Nigeria is ranked 74th out of 115 countries based on the performance of some selected health indicators. ( World Bank, 1999). Nigeria over all heath system performance was equally ranked 187th among the 191 member states by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2006 (National Health Policy, (2008). The infant and child mortality rate in Nigeria are among the highest in the world. It is in view of the above that the researcher intends to investigate the public health expenditure and health outcomes in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is pertinent to say that the main objective of this study is to investigate public health expenditure and health outcomes in Nigeria 1986-2016, but to aid the successful completion of the study the researcher intends to to achieve the following specific objective;</p> <p>(i)                  To examine the relationship between public health expenditure and health outcomes in Nigeria;</p> <p>(ii)                 To ascertain the relationship between literacy rate and health outcomes in Nigeria; and</p> <p>(iii)                To assess the relationship between environmental factors and health outcomes in Nigeria.</p> <p>(iv)               To evaluate the impact of public health expenditure on the life expectancy level of Nigerians.</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The researcher formulated the following research hypotheses to guide the study through;</p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>there is no significant relationship between public health expenditure and health outcomes in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>there is a significant relationship between public health expenditure and health outcomes in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H02: </strong>there is no significant relationship between environmental factors and health outcomes in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H2: </strong>there is a significant relationship between environmental factors and health outcomes in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of importance to the ministry of health as the study seek to elaborate on the merit of adequate and prudent investment in the public health sector.

As a result accident remains the only major source of morbidity and mortality which many continue to view in extra-rational terms such as ‘luck’, ‘chance’ and ‘act of God’. If accidents are of such unique nature that its causation defies human understanding, control and prediction, it might be argued that it should be analysed not only by scientists and theologians and philosophers but by astrologers and soothsayers as well. On the other hand, if the causation of accidents does not differ substantially from other events, it is important that it should be subjected to rigorous and sophisticated scientific methodology. In fact, accident research is a branch of study that has evolved out of such lack of conceptual clarity (Anderson, 2005).</p> <p>An accident is a happening that is not intended, foreseen or expected that can cause an injury and sometimes death. Accidents sometimes result from negligence. Accidents and injuries are common, especially among young children aged 1 – 4 years of age. Accidents are happening that are usually unintended and unforeseen. It is therefore important that you, the health workers, are aware of these possible unpleasant and unintended happenings and should play a big role first in the prevention and secondly in their management. We shall discuss both accidental and Non-accidental injuries. Accidents are a major cause of death and disability. About 14,000 people die in the UK, most of them in England and more than 700,000 will be seriously injured in England alone. They cost the UK an estimated £150 billion every year. For children and young people, accidents are the greatest threat to life (UNICEF, 2008).</p> <p>A review of literature of accident research reveals that inadequately trained professionals whose nature of work made them deal with accident phenomenon largely contributed in the early period of accident research (Anderson, 2005; Boden, 2014). Consequent to this ‘much of the accident research and theorisation are based on primitive rather than sophisticated methodology. Gradually, terms like chance, luck or act of God failed to find any mention in the accident literature and safety professionals proposed various theories and models of accident causation.</p> <p>However, according to Robertson (2015), an accident is an undesirable incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term “accident” and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity. Primary school people are most times exposed to road traffic accidents, school accidents, and home accidents. It is on record that every year more than 67,000 children experience an accident in the kitchen and 43,000 of these are aged under four. (Merrill, 2013).</p> <p>There are basically two classifications of accident – physical and non-physical examples. Physical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions or falls, being injured by touching something sharp, hot, electrical or ingesting poison. Non-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a secret or otherwise saying something incorrectly, forgetting an appointment, etc. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO, 2014), more than 337 million accidents happen on the job each year, resulting, to occupational diseases, in which more than 2.3 million deaths annually.  In contrast, leisure -related accidents are mainly sports injuries.</p> <p>Predisposing factors to the causation of accidents are of two types: Environmental factors and Childhood factors. Environmental Factors are things in the child’s environment at home and outdoor that may predispose or lead the child to get an accident. For example; poorly arranged furniture in the house can make a child fall and injure his or herself, unprotected cooking place can lead to child burns. Fruit trees or ladders in homes may attract a child to climb and result in a fall. Similarly pools of water outdoor including unfilled quarry with accumulation of water may lead to drowning. A final example is the overcrowded city slums are particularly bad environment for children. Childhood factors on the order hand, are factors centred on the child. They include the normal curiosity, exploration nature and imitation of a child, a child still learning and has no experience that can land them into accidents. Boys are more explorative and get into accidents more frequently than girls. But girls are more affected by accidents in cooking place at home than boys. Abnormal factors in a child that can lead into accidents include: a child with epilepsy, a child with a handicap (Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, 2012).</p> <p>The prevention of childhood accidents is identified as one of the key indicators in the 2013-2016 Public Health Outcomes Framework. Three published guidance documents from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) outline recommendations for all those with a strategic role to play in injury prevention, including clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), local authorities and their partners (Kendrick , Hayes  &amp; Ward, 2012). Unlike safeguarding, there is currently no requirement for primary healthcare teams to undergo training in unintentional injury prevention. This is an important recommendation of the NICE guidance (NICE, 2010).</p> <p>The following are some of the concepts in accident prevention:</p> <p>Primary prevention: removal of circumstances causing injury – eg, traffic speed reduction, fitting stair gates for young children, reducing alcohol consumption.</p> <p>Secondary prevention: reduces severity of injury should an accident occur – eg, use child safety car seats, bicycle helmets, smoke alarms.</p> <p>Tertiary prevention: optimal treatment and rehabilitation following injuries – e.g. effective first aid, appropriate hospital care.</p> <p>Clinical roles for health professionals in accident prevention include advice to patients: health workers are well placed to identify accident risks or medical conditions conferring risk and to advise accordingly. Accidents are one of the main causes of death among children aged 1-5 years. About 100,000 children are admitted to hospital annually in the UK and 2 million attend emergency departments. In a typical CCG with a population of 100,000, this equates to approximately 3,300 emergency departments visits and 200 hospital admissions for child injuries.</p> <p>In terms of numbers of people killed or injured, this is an important area for accident prevention in Nigeria and worldwide. Although the figures are still high, statistics for Great Britain suggest that the situation is gradually improving. For the year ending June 2013:</p> <p>1,730 people were killed, a 3% drop from 1,785 in the previous year.</p> <p>185,540 people were injured, 7% fewer than the previous year.</p> <p>Total reported child casualties (ages 0-15) fell by 12% to 15,920 for the year ending June 2013 with those killed or seriously injured down 11% to 2,080.</p> <p>Common causes of these accidents included speeding, drink driving, not wearing seat belts or careless driving. Around a third involved someone driving during their work. About 10% of those killed were inexperienced drivers. Higher speed both increases the risk of collision and the risk of serious injury to the driver or others. Even a modest speed reduction helps reduce both the number and the severity of accidents, e.g. pedestrians hit at speeds below 30 mph receive mainly survivable injuries but this changes to mainly fatal injuries at speeds of between about 30 mph and 40 mph (Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, 2011).</p> <p>Children commonly drink poisonous substances or drugs left in their reach. The more attractive colours of the substance or drug the more the risk of being taken and ingested by the curious, explorative learning children. The effect of the poisoning material depends upon the quantity drunk or ingested and the chemical nature of substance or drug. And also to some extent the size or age of the child, nutritional status and when the stomach is empty in a hungry child or a child who has some food contents in his or her stomach. Large amounts are dangerous, while an empty stomach allows easy absorption of the poison and a stomach with food delays absorption of the poisonous substance or drugs (UNICEF, 2008)</p> <p>For health workers, important points when advising on child accident prevention are:</p> <p>Offer practical advice, not just general education – e.g. advise about car seats or home safety equipment.</p> <p>Use an evidence-based approach where possible and dispel myths – e.g. some parents wrongly believe that cooker guards and baby walkers are safe.</p> <p>Promoting safety does not require overprotection (‘wrapping children in cotton wool’) – this would delay development and increase the risk of obesity.</p> <p>Promote sensible precautions in line with the child’s level of development.</p> <p>This work will however investigate accidents and the health of primary school pupils in Erei, Biase Local Government Area of Cross River State, Nigeria.</p> <p>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Accidents constitute a major health challenge amongst primary school children. According to World Health Organization (2016), every year the lives of approximately 1.25 million people are cut short as a result of road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury. Other statistics on road accident are as follows: About 1.25 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes; road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among young people, aged 15–29 years; 90% of the world’s fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have approximately half of the world’s vehicles; Half of those dying on the world’s roads are “vulnerable road users”: pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists; without action, road traffic crashes are predicted to rise to become the 7th leading cause of death by 2030; the newly adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’s has set an ambitious road safety target of halving the global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2020.</p> <p>More than 90% of deaths that result from road traffic injuries occur in low- and middle-income countries. Road traffic injury death rates are highest in the low- and middle-income countries of the African region including Nigeria. Even within high-income countries, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crashes.</p> <p>Over the years, efforts have been directed by individuals, communities, government and international bodies towards the prevention of accidents amongst primary school pupils. There is no prove of the contrary that all effort put in place to prevent accidents among school children is still not enough as cases of road, school and home accidents still prevail among primary school pupils.</p> <p>It therefore becomes imperative to investigate deeply into the underlying causes of accidents among school pupils in order to arrive at possible solutions to the problem, thus this work on accidents and the health of primary school pupils in Erei, Biase Local Government Area of Cross River State, Nigeria.</p> <p>1.4    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The major objective of the study is to examine accidents and the health of primary school pupils in Erei, Biase Local Government Area of Cross River State, Nigeria. The specific objectives of this study are:-</p> <p>To examine road traffic accident and the health of primary school pupils in Erei</p> <p>To ascertain school accident and the health of primary school pupils in Erei</p> <p>To investigate home accident and the health of primary school pupils in Erei</p> <p>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Findings of this study will be significant to the following group of people: Parents, mothers, children, health and health related organizations, individuals, public and private, school authority.</p> <p>To parents, findings of this study will create awareness and raise critical consciousness of the people on the need to confront the occurrence of accidents among primary school children.</p> <p>To individuals, especially primary school pupils, this work will provide proper information and advice on how to prevent road, school and home accidents.</p> <p>Above all, to school authority, information gathered from the study will serve as a guide on policy making and training of their pupils on the three major forms of accidents and their prevention.</p> <p>To other researchers and scholars, this work will provide current information on accident and the health of primary school children, thus serving as a reference material.</p> <p>1.6    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>           To guide this study, the following research questions were formulated:</p> <p>To what extent does road traffic accident affect the health of primary school pupils?</p> <p>How does school accident affect the health of primary school pupils?</p> <p>To what extent does home accident affect the health of primary school pupils?</p> <p>1.7    DELIMITATION (SCOPE OF STUDY)</p> <p>The study is limited in scope to accidents and the health of primary school pupils in Erei, Biase Local Government Area of Cross River State, Nigeria. It is also limited to the three sub-variables adopted for this study thus:</p> <p>Road traffic accident and the health of primary school pupils in Erei</p> <p>School accident and the health of primary school pupils in Erei</p> <p>Home accident and the health of primary school pupils in Erei</p> <p>1.8    LIMITATIONS</p> <p>The following factors posed limitations to the research study:</p> <p>The uncompromising attitude of some respondents in giving candid opinion set a limitation to the research study.</p> <p>The project was self-sponsored and money was needed to type the questionnaire, travel to the research area and meet other needs.</p> <p>Another constraint of the study was inadequate time allotted for the completion of the research study. The researcher worked under the College time framework that was not enough for a coherent research.</p> <p>Difficulty in reaching respondents residing in some sampled villages within Erei Community was another challenge. The research had to cover some distance before getting in contact with her respondents.</p> <p>1.9    OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>HEALTH: Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well being of an individual and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (WHO)</p> <p>SCHOOL AUTHORITY: These are the board of management of a particular school who gives guidelines of expected standards of behaviour, dressing, academics integrity and attendance as well as consequences for violating those standards.</p> <p>EFFECT: This refers to a strong impression, result or impact of something.</p> <p>ACCIDENTS: happenings that are usually unintended and unforeseen.</p> <p>ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENT: Accidents occurring on the road.</p> <p>SCHOOL ACCIDENT: Accident involving school pupils while in school.</p> <p>HOME ACCIDENT: Accidents that takes place at home.</p>\n\nACCIDENTS AND THE HEALTH OF PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ACCIDENTS AND THE HEALTH OF PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>Arthritis is a disease that affects the Joints. It is usually associated with ageing. Arthritis according to Ebong, (2009) is a chronic degenerative condition of the joint. The disease causes extreme joint pains and inflammation of the joint, thus, limiting movement. Although arthritis is more common in old age, it can affect all humans irrespective of age (Medilexican int’l 2004-15 update)</p> <p>According to Pfizer (2014) the word arthritis is derived from the Greek words: “arthrons”, meaning a joint and – “itis”, meaning inflammation. Inflammation typically involves redness, heat, swelling and tenderness. Arthritis is not a single disease with a single cause. There are several types of arthritis. A further explanation on arthritis by Peters (2009) asserts that, there are more than 100 types of arthritis. It’s a condition that affects more than 46 Million United State adults, and the number that is expected to increase to 67 Million adults by the year 2030.</p> <p>Most types of arthritis are caused by a combination of several factors working together. These include the genetic make-up, a previous injury, a physically demanding job especially one with repetitive movement, obesity that places extra weight on the joint and severe blow or strain. Ebony (2013) stated that arthritis is the most important cause of disability, resulting from autoimmune diseases. Micro-organism such as bacterial or viral infection invasion at the knee and ankle often times triggers the inflammation.</p> <p>Arthritis are of various types namely; osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout arthritis and juvenile arthritis. This study discusses three common types namely: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid, and gout arthritis. Diagnostic techniques include history taking, physical examination and observation of the joint to establish swelling, stiffness and limitation of movement. There are no known treatments for most types of arthritis. Thus management of arthritis includes physical and occupational therapy. Exercise and consumption of nourishing foods helps in the prevention and relief of joint pains. Other forms of care include the use of heat in the form of wax bath. Therapeutic management is mainly for the relief of pains.</p> <p>Following the United States report in 2014 by Pfizer recording high number of adult with arthritis and a future generation doubling the figure, it becomes necessary to research into few types of arthritis commonly found in Ikot Effiong Nta Community, Calabar Municipality with a view of offering solution to this occurrence.</p> <p>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>          Research has shown that arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions are contributors to illness, pain and disability and highly prevalent, they place a significant burden on the community. It accounts for a large number of deaths among adults especially the ageing or those whose lifestyle is sedentary.</p> <p>Despite the effort made by relevant professionals like Rheumatologists, Nutritionist occupational therapists and other physicians to curb the occurrence of arthritis, higher incidence of arthritis is still observed. It becomes pertinent to ask if arthritis is obviously not avoidable or controllable. The high incidence of arthritis can be related to poor knowledge of the value of exercise or inadequate nutrition?</p> <p>Arthritis can deform adults and impede movement due to severe pains and swollen joints. Based on the high incidence and effect of arthritis, the researcher intends to examine arthritis and the health of the aged in Ikot Effiong Nta, Calabar Municipal Area of Cross River State in order to advance solutions to prevent its occurrence.</p> <p>1.4    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>          The major objective of the study is to describe arthritis and the health of the aged in Ikot Effiong Nta, Calabar Municipal Area of Cross River State.</p> <p>The specific objectives will be:</p> <p>To identify osteoarthritis and the health of the aged.</p> <p>To examine rheumatoid arthritis and the health of the aged.</p> <p>To discuss gout arthritis and the health of the aged.</p> <p>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This work will be of immense importance to the aged, government/non-governmental agencies and other researchers.</p> <p>To the aged, findings of this study will help identify the causes and effect of arthritis on health and seek immediate attention towards preventing it occurrence.</p> <p>The research findings will assist Government and Non-governmental agencies in providing facilities such as recreational centers, medical aids to ameliorate disabilities and mortalities due to arthritis.</p> <p>Finally, findings of this work will also serve as a bed-rock (framework) for further studies by being a handy and standard reference material.</p> <p>1.6    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>How does osteoarthritis affect the health of the aged in Ikot Effiong Nta?</p> <p>To what extent does rheumatoid arthritis affect the health of the aged in Ikot Effiong Nta?</p> <p>How does gout arthritis affect the heath of the aged in Ikot Effiong Nta?</p> <p>1.7    DELIMITATION (SCOPE OF THE STUDY)</p> <p>          This study is limited in scope to arthritis and the health of the aged in Ikot Effiong Nta Community, Calabar Municipal Area of Cross River State.

A quantitative and cross-sectional community based study design was employed. Data was collected using structured questionnaire administered to 901 women aged 15–49 years through a stratified two-stage cluster sampling technique. Multinomial logistic regression model was employed to identify predictors of delivery care. More than three-fourth of slum women gave birth at public healthcare facilities compared to slightly more than half of the nonslum residents. Education, wealth quintile, the age of respondent, number of children, pregnancy intention, and cohabitation showed net effect on women’s preference for places to give birth. Despite the high number of ANC attendances, still many pregnant women especially among slum residents chose to deliver at home. Most respondents delivered in public healthcare institutions despite the general doubts about the quality of services in these institutions. Future studies should examine motivating factors for continued deliveries at home and whether there is real significant difference between the quality of maternal care service offered at public and private health facilities.</p> <p>1. Introduction</p> <p>Assurance of healthcare for all segments of the population with special attention given to the health needs of women and children was one of the top priorities in the Ethiopian Health Policy [1] . The endorsement of MDG 5 in the HSDPs is an indication of the commitment or political will of the government towards reducing maternal mortality across the nation [2] . Yet, Ethiopia’s health system is underdeveloped and underfinanced [3] . While some progress has been made in providing basic health services to poor women and their children, the progress may be uneven because many people are not reached with services [4] .</p> <p>Ethiopia’s total health expenditure as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) has remained stable at 4.3% for years. With emphasis given to publicly funded healthcare, out-of-pocket payment constitutes 42% [5] . The public health sector is the main provider of primary healthcare and serves two-thirds of the population who cannot afford private healthcare. The main objective of the public sector service provision, as stated in the National Health Policy, is “to give comprehensive and integrated primary health care services in a decentralized and equitable fashion” .</p> <p>Childbirth and its process are one of the most significant life events to a woman . The time of birth as well as shortly thereafter is the most dangerous period in a child’s life especially in the developing world. Hence the choice of place of delivery for a pregnant woman is an important aspect of maternal healthcare. The place of delivery is an important factor often related to the quality of care received by the mother and infant for influencing maternal and child healthcare outcomes. In Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, though the private health facilities (hospitals and clinics) outnumber public clinics , only 20% of deliveries take place in the private sectors and 17% of mothers deliver at home .</p> <p>This study aims to systematically explore the differences and the factors that influence women’s preferences for places to give birth in Addis Ababa. It is envisaged that a clear understanding of such factors is key in building a responsive maternal healthcare system and improving health outcomes in Ethiopia.</p> <p>2. Research Design and Methods</p> <p>2.1. Sampling and Data Collection</p> <p>Addis Ababa, the study area, is divided into 10 subcities and each subcity is further divided into several small administrative units called Kebeles. In the 2007 Ethiopia Housing and Population Census, Kebeles were further subdivided into enumeration areas (EAs). An EA is a geographic area consisting of a convenient number of dwelling units which was used as a counting unit for the census. The average number of households (HHs) per EA in urban Ethiopia is 169. The number of clusters (EAs) in Addis Ababa was about 3865 [3].</p> <p>Because of the different levels of political or administrative structures and wider geographic areas, cluster sampling technique was employed for this study. The study employed a stratified, two-stage cluster design. Since Addis Ababa is entirely urban, stratification was achieved by using the subcities (10 strata). Using the 2007 Population and Housing Census data, in the first stage 30 enumeration areas (EAs) were selected independently from all the strata with probability proportional to (EA) size (PPS) of households. In the second stage, 906 households were selected with PPS of households in each EA. The systematic random sampling of the eligible households was done based on the number of households recorded during the complete listing of households in each EA during the last EDHS 2011 [3]. To minimize sampling errors that may arise due to changes in the years after the last enumeration (complete household listing), approaching the subcity and Kebele administrations as well as community members in the respective EAs was an important step in the survey process. It was necessary to be aware of and be sensitive to the various community level dynamics in the study area. Hence, the demolition of significant portions of four EAs from four strata due to the city’s reconstruction process was the major change reported and verified by the first author. Three EAs were replaced by other randomly selected three adjacent EAs and remaining households of the fourth EA were completed from a section of a randomly selected adjacent EA.</p> <p>In this study verbal face-to-face interview was administered using a structured questionnaire. Recall bias was taken into consideration during the development of the questionnaire. Therefore, women were asked about their most recent or last birth and the date of birth of the child was asked. Ethical clearance was obtained from the National Research Ethics Review Committee of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ethiopia. The target population was all women of 15–49 years of age who have experienced at least one birth in the last 1–3 years before the date of data collection, December 2013–January 2014.</p> <p>2.2. Description of Variables</p> <p>The independent variables for this study were selected based on a modified version of the Behavioural Model of Health Services. The model distinguished three sets of factors related to healthcare seeking behaviour of individuals: the predisposing, enabling, and need factors.</p> <p>Under the predisposing factors, demographic variables such as age, number of living children, current marital status, and pregnancy intention related to last childbirth and social structure variables such as education, occupation, and ethnicity were considered at individual, household, and community levels. As regards pregnancy intention, women were asked about their recent births whether they wanted it then, wanted it later, or did not want to have any more children at all. In the analyses, the intention status of the birth was further defined as a dichotomy variable: intended for births wanted by then versus unintended for being either mistimed or unwanted by then. Women’s education was defined here as the highest level of schooling attended regardless of whether the woman completed the level.</p> <p>Under the enabling factors, individual and family resource indicator variables including housing tenure, health insurance, and wealth quintile were included. Those who visited health facility for ANC were also asked whether there was an organization or agency that either partially or fully covered their expenses and the responses were grouped as “yes” or “no.” Housing tenure was categorised as the house in which the respondent lives is either owned by her or not owned by her, that is, owned versus rental. The type of residence was categorised as slum and nonslum residences based on the five indicators including access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, sufficient living area, durability of housing, and secure tenure (housing tenure) developed by United Nations Human Settlements Programme</p> \n\nFACTORS DETERMINING THE CHOICE OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES BY PREGNANT WOMEN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS DETERMINING THE CHOICE OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES BY PREGNANT WOMEN", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>It is obvious that immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions for reducing global child morbidity, mortality and life time disabilities (Lee, 2003) (Chen et al, 2004). Worldwide, immunization prevents more than 2.5 million child deaths each year (WHO/UNICEF and World Bank, 2009, WHO 2009). Global public health has greatly improved through the widespread use of vaccines, preventing millions of childhood hospitalizations and deaths each year rating immunization as a number one public health intervention (CDC, 2010 CDC 2009). Before the advent of immunization programs, infectious diseases such as measles, diphtheria, smallpox and pertussis were leading causes of child mortality (Stern et al., 2005). Tetanus toxoid vaccine is given to pregnant women to prevent against neonatal tetanus, which can be a major cause of infant deaths (KDHS 2014).</p> <p>In the United States there has been a remarkable achievement in the control of vaccine preventable diseases resulting in decline in morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine preventable diseases (CDC 2010). In Africa, there has been tremendous improvement in the overall immunization coverage, though at a relatively slower rate (WHO 2004, WHO 2014). However, some African countries like Ghana, Morocco and Gambia have registered success in reaching coverage of over 90% (Ghana News Agency 2012, WHO 2014, UNICEF, 2014). The introduction of the immunization programme has led to continual reduction of vaccine preventable disease incidence.</p> <p>Despite the remarkable achievements and improvements in immunization services, the agenda remains largely unfinished with large numbers of children (24 million) remaining unreached, unvaccinated or under-vaccinated (WHO, UNICEF &amp; World Bank 2009). One-fifth of the world’s children which is about 22.4 million infants, are not immunized against VPD and 70 percent of these children come from 10 countries, Nigeria being one of them (WHO/UNICEF 2014), (UNICEF/WHO 2011), (UNICEF Australia 2013). One of the causes of high mortality rates in Nigeria are vaccine-preventable diseases. Previous studies have explored factors associated with implementation of childhood immunization programs, however most of these studies focused on the demand side factors. Some of the most cited demand-side factors that have been shown to influence functioning of immunization programs include parity, household income, ethnicity, place of delivery, mother’s level of education, distance to health facility, culture, religion, age and forgetfulness of guardian due to preoccupation with other activities, (Abdulraheem et al 2011.,Bbaale, 2013,Barman et al, 2009)(Bates, 1994)(Calhoun et al., 2014)(Kariuki, 2004) Mutua et al., 2011, Maina et al,. 2013, Ndiritu et al. 2007, Njeru, 2011, Ophori et al, 2014, Odusanya, et al 2003). There are relatively few studies examining supply-side factors influencing implementation of childhood immunization programs in the Nigerian context, particularly in predominantly rural areas. This study aims to fill this gap. The relatively poor health indices and large size of the county makes it a reasonable choice for understanding the factors influencing implementation of immunization programs in primary healthcare facilities in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Immunization program is a key strategy for prevention of child and neonatal deaths and lifetime disabilities. Immunization prevents 2.5 million child deaths each year (WHO, 2009). Despite the global improvement in vaccine coverage that has seen 84% of children around the world receiving this life-saving intervention, 10 million children in low and middle level countries die before reaching age of five (Arevshatia et al, 2007) (WHO 2014). Full immunization potential has not yet been realized in many countries where 22.4 million Children around the globe are not fully immunized. Majority of not fully immunized children 70% are from 10 countries, Nigeria being one of them (WHO/UNICEF 2014). Low immunization coverage remains a challenge even in a committed country like Nigeria. This study sought to identify intervention targets for improving immunization coverage by investigating factors affecting the implementation of immunization in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State, Nigeria. The focus was to identify factors contributing to missed immunization and ways to reduce the number of missed opportunities for immunization at the health facilities. Much effort has been made to provide vaccines through the GAVI alliance, enabling states to acquire the recommended vaccines. In Nigeria for instance, vaccines are made freely available to the public, yet over 20 percent of Nigerian children are not immunized each year. There is a need to identify strategies for improving implementation of vaccination programs in the country, particularly at primary health care level in predominantly rural areas and this study aimed to fill this gap.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>   <strong>Research Objectives </strong></p> <p>The general objective or main objective of this study is to examine the factors affecting the implementation of immunization in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State, Nigeria. The specific objectives are:</p> <p>i)             To understand the factors affecting the implementation of immunization in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State.</p> <p>ii)           To identify the problem of immunization in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State.</p> <p>iii)         To understand the attitudes of parents toward immunizing their children in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Research Questions </strong></p> <p>The following are some of the questions which this study intends to answer:</p> <p>i)             What are the factors affecting the implementation of immunization in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State?</p> <p>ii)           What are the problems of immunization in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State?</p> <p>iii)         What are the attitudes of parents toward immunizing their children in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State?</p> <p><strong>1.5   Significance of the study </strong></p> <p>The findings of this study are of great significance to immunization program managers and policy makers in geographical areas with large rural populations. It provides a basis for rational interventions to improve vaccine delivery in primary healthcare facilities, improve vaccination coverage indices and reduce the burden of childhood infectious diseases. The results are of benefit to the county health management team by providing actionable information relevant for planning and policy making to improve delivery of childhood vaccines in the county. This study contributes to the broader literature addressing how to improve implementation of childhood immunization programs in rural areas by providing an empirical analysis of challenges faced by program implementers. Specifically, this study seeks to contribute to the literature related to the identification of intervention targets for increasing the effectiveness of immunization programs in primary healthcare facilities in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Assumptions of the Study </strong></p> <p>        This study investigates the factors affecting the implementation of immunization in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State, Nigeria. It will therefore be carried out in the four regions (north, south, east and west) of the local government area.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Limitations of the Study </strong></p> <p>Health care institutions always have very busy schedules and work in shifts. This was seen as one of the limitations of identifying appropriate time periods to administer surveys. This was addressed by obtaining phone contacts of health facility managers and scheduling interview dates ahead of time. The study might have also been affected by the way respondents would answer questions in the data collection tool, they could have chosen answers that are socially desirable to be seen as performing well.</p> <p><strong>1.8   Definition of Terms </strong></p> <p>The following terms were used in the course of this study:</p> <p><strong>Immunization</strong>: is the process by which an individual's immune system is stimulated through exposure to an immunogenic agent known as vaccine (a substance that stimulates the immune system is said to be immunogenic)</p> <p><strong>Implementation: </strong>Is a specified set of activities designed to put a plan or strategy into practice. In this study, it refers to the set of activities put together in the immunization program to ensure that children are vaccinated and thereby increase immunization coverage.</p> <p><strong>Immunization programs</strong>: is a set of activities designed to ensure all eligible children and women. In a specific location receive timely vaccination and become immunized against specific vaccine-preventable diseases. The programs include childhood immunization and maternal immunization.</p>\n\nFACTORS AFFECTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IMMUNIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS AFFECTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IMMUNIZATION", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>A nation’s development is largely depended on the quality of education available to its citizens. Primary education is the foundation on which further education is built (Vegas and Petrow, 2008). Primary education has two main purposes. The primary aim is to produce a sane and numerate society that is capable of dealing with the problems. The second purpose is to serve as a foundation on which further education is built (Akanle, 2007).</p> <p>Nutrition is a fundamental pillar of human life, health and development across the entire life span (FAO/WHO, 1992). From the earliest stages of foetal development, at birth, through infancy, childhood, adolescence, and into adulthood and old age, proper food and good nutrition are essential for survival, physical growth, mental development, performance and productivity, health and well-being (WHO, 2000). Evidence has shown that four (4 )% of the total children born in developing countries die of malnutrition before they are five years old (Toriola, 1990) and that the most affected are usually the children of illiterate parents in low socio-economic status that have low purchasing power in the economy (Adekunle, 2005). Studies have shown that poor feeding and or recurrent infections as a result of poverty leads to stunted growth, substantial brain impairment, low intellectual competence and capacity to learn in children (Kerr et al., 2000; Ivanovic <em>et al., </em>2002; Chang <em>et al., </em>2002; Braveman and Gruskin, 2003; Liu <em>et al., </em>2003; Adebisi, 2013).</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that poor feeding practices are associated with stunted growth and delayed mental development (Mendez and Adair, 1999); and that there is a relationship between impaired growth status and both poor school performance and intelligence quotient (PAHO, 1998). The relationship between timely and quality dietary intake, brain size and academic performance has been documented (Strupp and Levitsky, 1995; Florey <em>et al.</em>, 1995), and that a significant correlation exists between head circumference and intelligence quotient (1Q). This is an indication that there is difference in human brain size which could be relevant in explaining the differences in intelligence and academic performance, although genetic and environmental factors like socio-economic, socio-cultural and psychological factors could be direct or indirect co-determinants of both intelligence and school performance (Vernon <em>et al</em>., 2000; Wickett <em>et al.</em>, 2000).</p> <p>Head circumference is a physical index of both past nutrition and brain development and a good predictor of later intelligence of a child (Botting <em>et al.</em>, 1998). Traditionally, family status variables such as socio-economic status and parents' level of education have been regarded as predictors of children's academic achievement (Joan, 2009). Head circumference (HC) has been defined as an anthropometric indicator of both nutritional background and brain development (Ivanovic <em>et al., </em>2004). Findings by other authors reveal that poor prenatal and postnatal HC growth results in poor outcomes in terms of the acquisition of cognitive and academic abilities by the child, and this group is followed by those children with prenatal brain compromise but satisfactory postnatal HC growth (Frisk <em>et al., </em>2002).</p> <p>Low maternal education is associated with slower fetal growth, and this effect appears to be stronger for growth of the head than for growth of other organs (Silva <em>et al., </em>2010). Maternal intelligence quotient, home environment, ethnicity, and family size have been described as important predictors of child intelligence quotient (Cornelius <em>et al., </em>2009). A 1-cm decrease in HC predicted a 1-point decrease in the Stanford–Binet composite score (Cornelius <em>et al., </em>2009). Mother‘s educational background, gestational age, and HC at age 2 years could explain the achievement of appropriate schooling at age 8 years (Charkaluk <em>et al</em>., 2011). Findings by other authors suggest that abnormal brain development after prenatal injury or postnatal nutritional deficits are responsible for cognitive deficits in preterm children (Abernethy <em>et al</em>., 2004). For all age and sex groups, Head circumference (HC) has been defined as an anthropometric indicator of both nutritional background and brain development (Ochiai <em>et al., </em>2008). However, this study seeks to examine nutritional status of primary school children in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem </strong></p> <p>Nutritional deprivation in children negatively impacts the attainment of their full growth potential and mental development. Many children, especially in developing countries, are however deprived of a balanced nutrition which is a basic human need. The United Nations World Food Program documented that 66million children go to school hungry every day in these developing countries, with up to 23 million in Africa alone. Globally, up to 400 million children have to go to bed hungry. Nutritional deprivation with consequent under nutrition which is an underlying factor in about 50% of childhood mortalities worldwide, thus, still remains a cause for public health concern. Within the last decade, the health of hitherto ignored school aged children has come up on the global agenda. Their nutritional status has been shown to be prime in achieving health as under nutrition negatively affects cognition, immune response (with increased risk of morbidity and mortality from disease) and growth with a long term effect on the quality of life, contribution to the workforce and economy of any nation.</p> <p>Food security which is the ability to obtain safe, nutritious foods in socially acceptable and sustainable ways is important as children who frequently experience food insecurity are more likely to experience hunger and under nutrition. Africa’s indigenous foods are healthy and nutritious but unfortunately, diets offered to many children in developing countries are noted to often lack in variety, which is a key to specific optimal nutrient adequacy. Peculiar feeding characteristics of different African populations thus need to be studied to document area specific feeding patterns as a prelude to measures that will correct inappropriate and inadequate feeding practices. There is a paucity of data on the feeding pattern of children in the area of study. This study is thus important for evidence on food security or otherwise, and the health of the index population, with consideration of possible factors that may influence the status. The outcome of this study is expected to draw attention to the needs of school children in public schools for targeted interventional policies.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Research Objectives </strong></p> <p>The general objective or main objective of this study is to examine nutritional status of primary school children in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria. The specific objectives are:</p> <p>i)             To assess the influence of nutritional status on academic performance of primary school children in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State</p> <p>ii)            To investigate the influence of anthropometric parameters on academic performance of of primary school children in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State</p> <p>iii)          To study the influence of parental social economic status on academic performance of primary school children in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Research Questions </strong></p> <p>The following are some of the questions which this study intends to answer:</p> <p>i)             What is the influence of nutritional status on academic performance of primary school children in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State?</p> <p>ii)            What is the influence of anthropometric parameters on academic performance of primary school children in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State?</p> <p>iii)          What is the influence of parental social economic status on academic performance of primary school children in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State?</p> <p><strong>1.5   Research Hypothesis      </strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses were postulated to guide the conduct of this study;</p> <p>i)                           There is no significant difference between academic performance of the school children and nutritional status.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Significance of the Study </strong></p> <p>It is therefore hoped that results of this study will assist parents and other stakeholders in understanding the influence of some anthropometric parameters on academic performance of these pupils. This will also help policy makers in the design and implementation of nutrition education program at primary school level. The study will create a data base on the influence of some anthropometric parameters and social status on academic performance of primary school children within Ikorodu metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Scope of the Study </strong></p> <p>        This study shall be carried out among the primary school children in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State. Teachers from Ewuren Community LEA Primary School shall be selected for this study.</p> <p><strong>1.8   Limitation of the Study </strong></p> <p>The researcher encountered some challenges in the course of carrying out the field work and these challenges were the constraints that worked against the optimal realization of what I am set out to achieve. These challenges include:</p> <p><em>Time:</em> Students did not have enough time to respond to the questionnaire because they were in a hurry to attend one of their compulsory lessons and this will not allow the researcher to get the adequate information needed from the research instrument.</p> <p><em>Communication:</em> It was observed that some of the students find it difficult to interpret the questionnaire so there was need for an interpreter to conduct the survey.</p> <p><strong>1.9   Definition of Terms </strong></p> <p>The following terms were used in the course of this study:</p> <p><strong>Nutritional status:</strong> Refers to the physical well-being of the child in weight and height.</p> <p><strong>Socio-demographic factors: </strong>These include age, gender, birth order, etc.</p>\n\nNUTRITIONAL STATUS OF PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>According to the medical dictionary, infant is a child during his or her first year of life till 5 years old of life. Then, infant mortality is the number of death which occurs among the young once. Infant mortality rate which is also known as (IMR) correlates very strongly with life expectancy t birth by region and is among the best predictors of state failure.</p> <p>IMR is therefore also a very useful indicator of a country level of health development and is a component of the physical quality of life index.</p> <p>Due to the improvement in the care and general management of diseases among the children and the prevention of this diseases which has lead to a better life for the infant, and some common challenges infancy is now the subject of this project. The diseases accounting for infant mortality is statistically analyzed carefully.</p> <p>The study of infant mortality is of great economic, social, political and cultural importance for the determination of future population in humanity.</p> <p>Also, this research gives the life expectancy at birth, which to a great extent helps in making population projection. The most important among the population policies are fundamentally related to those of health and mortality.</p> <p>In Edo state Irrua comprises of towns and also with a great population.  The entire infant mortality rate in this project covers both male and female.</p> <p>Irrua specialist teaching hospital comprises of several unit, which includes; the administrative unit the medical unit, the medical unit, and the general nursing unit.</p> <p>For the study of infant mortality, we refer to infant (children between the ages of 0-5) years of life. The death that may occur between this early years receives more attention since infant mortality takes a relatively heavy toll on life, both a fair and low death rate implies a substantial number of infant death because infant contains large portion of total population.</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>This research work is being carried out to detect the rate of infant mortality (IMR)</p> <p>In Edo state using Irrua specialist teaching hospital as a case study and to know the causes of this mortality and the most common killer diseases of infants that has taken place in Irrua specialist teaching hospital as a case study.</p> <p>1.3 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS:</p> <p><strong>HO</strong>: There is a significant difference between the rate of male infant mortality and female infant.</p> <p>HI: There is no significant difference between the rate of male infant mortality and female infant.</p> <p>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to ascertain the total number of death that occurred from 2005-20010 in Irrua local government area.</p> <p>Also, the study shows which among the male and female infant are mostly affected by this death.</p> <p>The study also looks at the diagnosis of the diseases that constitutes to the infant mortality.</p> <p>  1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Though the topic of this research is a wide topic (an analysis of infant mortality) as a result, it infant mortality will mainly be taken into account.</p> <p>Therefore the scope of this study is restricted on Irrua west local government in Edo state. The decision to particularize the research in Irrua is due to the respect of infant. Mortality problem in this town with the statistical test that will be carried out on the effect will give the suggestion and valid inferences will be made to reduce this infant mortality rate.</p> <p>     This project is limited to Irrua specialist teaching hospital due to the data collected from it well organized recording department.</p> <p>1.6 LIMITATION</p> <p>Lack of finance which is the most common problem a researcher will encounter in carrying out a research constitutes the inability of getting more information from one place to another to collect this data.</p> <p>The method adopted in collecting this data is secondary which may subject to no or little error.</p> <p>Though, to collect the data is not an easy job but with all the effort put together, it was possible to achieve.</p> <p>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <ul><li>Still birth: Still birth is a situation was by a baby is born dead.</li> <li>NEO Natal death: this is the death of babies after birth.</li> <li>Pre-Natal mortality: this is the period of the early death that starts from Festus too late birth before birth takes place.</li> <li>Exogenous death: these are the death caused by external factors such as accident.</li> <li>Endogenous death: these are the death caused by physical factors such as illness of any sort.</li> <li>Lactation: this is the period in which mothers/nursing mothers breast feed their babies.</li> <li>Live birth: the world health organization (WHO) defines live birth as  any born human  being who demonstrate independent signs of life including breathing, heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsations</li> </ul>\n\nTHE RATE AND CAUSES OF INFANT MOTALITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE RATE AND CAUSES OF INFANT MOTALITY", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Breastfeeding is the very first stage of improving child’s survival. Breast milk as food for infants is very beneficial for the all round growth of a child. It enhances the physical, mental, and social growth of a child. Breast milk contains many nutritional values like antibodies which boost the immunity of a child, prevents child mortality and morbidity. Breast milk has an enormous impact on the health of infants, most especially those who weighed less at birth. It has been discovered that breast milk is far more nutritious than processed milk. Aside from the benefits of breast milk on an infant, breastfeeding creates an inevitable bond between a mother and her child (Heckman J.J, 2011).</p> <p>World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) recommended breast milk as an ideal food for infants, and that is why in the past decades, these organizations have been encouraging mothers worldwide to embrace the practice of breastfeeding, particularly exclusive breastfeeding (EBF).</p> <p>Exclusive breastfeeding according to WHO entails feeding an infant with just breast milk (and syrups if need be) for six months and after that period of time give the infant complementary food (Cattaneo et al., 2000). It has been revealed by a study that infants who are not fed with breast milk at the first 60 days of their birth are likely to die from infection than those who are breastfed (WHO, 2014). Exclusive breastfeeding has a dual advantage on both a child and his mother. Apart from ensuring the good health of a child, it saves cost for the mother; as well as prevent her from breast cancer and other related diseases.</p> <p>However, despite the recommendation of Exclusive breastfeeding by WHO, the rate of Nigerian mothers who practice EBF is fluctuating. A study proved that the rate of children between ages 1-5 who are exclusively fed dropped from 18% in 2003 to 12% in 2008 and 12% in 2010 and returned to 18% in 2010; consequently increasing the rate of child mortality (NPC and ICF macro, 2008). It was still discovered in this study that the number of people who are enlightened about EBF in the urban areas of Nigeria is higher than those in the rural areas and this poses a threat on the importance of EBF (NPC and ICF Macro, 2009).</p> <p> Not minding the enormous benefits of EBF, Nigerian mothers for reasons best known to them do not practice EBF. Some of them who sluggishly try to practice it might just do it partially not up to six months, while some could be based on their cultural beliefs as some traditions in Nigeria see EBF as being unnecessary and some this obnoxious idea of their breast sagging due to breastfeeding.</p> <p>Based on the many factors that could hamper the practice of breastfeeding in Nigeria, this study is aimed at discovering the attitude and perception of nursing mothers in Uyo LGA. To know their thoughts on the practice of  exclusive breastfeeding .  </p> <p><strong>1.2      Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Due to the reduction in the rate of breastfeeding among nursing mothers in Nigeria, particularly nursing mothers in Uyo LGA, this study discovered some problems associated with this.</p> <p>One of such problem is the high level of poverty in the country. Some nursing mothers have this notion that it is only the rich mothers that can practice EBF; reason being that a mother who is breastfeeding must feed very well. She is expected to feed at least 8 times in a day. Considering the economic situation of things, which mother has the food in her kitchen to feed up to such number of times?</p> <p>In addition to the aforementioned point, in many homes in Nigeria, some mothers are the bread winners in their homes. This makes them go out to hustle for money; thereby not having the needed time for to breast feed their babies.</p> <p>Another problem of this study is the fact that some cultural beliefs in Nigeria kick against EBF. A good example is the Yoruba culture which so much belief in the giving of an infant some herbs to keep the child healthy. They belief it is unnecessary to feed a child with just breast milk.</p> <p>Also, the problem of poor sensitization of nursing mothers on the nitty-gritty of EBF poses a challenge, as some nursing mothers have various negative feelings about EBF. This is common to nursing mothers who live in the rural parts of the country.</p> <p>These are some of the problems observed could affect the attitude and perception of nursing mothers in Uyo LGA towards EBF.</p> <p> <strong>1.3      Aims / Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The major aim of this study is to know the attitude and perception of nursing mothers towards exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in Nigeria (a case study of Uyo LGA).</p> <p>Other specific objectives include:</p> <ol><li>To examine the factors that can hamper the practice of EBF in Uyo LGA.</li> <li>To ascertain the extent at which nursing mothers in Uyo LGA are well enlightened about EBF.</li> <li>To determine whether EBF can drastically reduce the rate of child mortality in Nigeria.</li> <li>To determine ways nursing mothers in Uyo LGA can be encouraged to practice EBF.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4      Research questions</strong></p> <ol><li>What are the attitude and perception of nursing mothers in Uyo LGA towards EBF?</li> <li>Are there factors that can hamper the practice of EBF in Uyo LGA?</li> <li>Can EBF drastically reduce the rate of child mortality in Nigeria?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5      Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>There are no factors that can hamper the practice of EBF in Uyo LGA.</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>There are factors that can hamper the practice of EBF in Uyo LGA.</p> <p><strong>1.6      Significance of the study/ Justification of the study</strong></p> <p>This study is meant to educate the general public, especially nursing mothers on the benefits of EBF.</p> <p>It is also meant to inform the government that they have a role to play in enlightening the general public, especially nursing mothers on the need to practice EBF.</p> <p>This study will be of immense benefit to other researchers who intend to know more on this topic and can also be used by non-researchers to build more on their work.

Of the tese, about 110 patients tested positive to Hepatitis B virus. The test done was a routine test in which HBsAg was screened for in the blood sampling the patients. This is usually the test done in screening for HBV in patients in Orthopedic Hospital Enugu as the reag into were always readity available . for easy collection and analysis of dfata the patients were studied under five (5) variable age, Donicile occupation and education. The last variable education was not studies  as it was not possible to obtain a comprehensive analysis of the educational status of the patent. For age, the patients were grouped into seven (7) different age groups between 1 to 70 years with 10 yeard interval between each age group that is 1-10, 11-20 and so on. Infection was highest amongst young women within 21-30 age group. Tyhius accounted for 37.5% of the 200 population and 17.5% of the 110 infected  population. It was lowest amongst two age group 1-10 and 60-7-0 as they both made up 2.5% apiece of the infected population.

It may occur with limited or no symptoms, but often leads to jaundice, anorexia (poor appetite) and malaise. Hepatitis is acute when it lasts less than six months and chronic when it persist longer. A group of viruses known as the hepatitis viruses cause most cases of hepatitis worldwide, but it can also be due to toxins (notably alcohol, certain medications and plants), other infections and autoimmune diseases. The hepatitis virus is found in the blood and other body fluids and is transmitted from person to person, the most common routes of infection includes blood transfusions and blood products where there is no screening for blood-borne viruses, medical or dental interventions in countries where equipment is not adequately sterilized mother to infant during childbirth, sexual transmission (in the case of hepatitis B), sharing equipment for injecting drugs, sharing straws, notes etc. for snorting cocaine (cocaine is particularly alkaline and corrosive), sharing razors, toothbrushes or other household articles, tattooing and body piercing if done using unsterile equipment (Ahmedin et al, 2004).</p> <p>The hepatitis B virus is spread between people through contact with the blood or other body fluids (i.e. semen, vaginal fluid and saliva) of an infected person, while the hepatitis C virus is spread through direct contact with infected blood. Very rarely it can also be passed on through other body fluids (Redmond, 2007). Many people infected with hepatitis B or C rarely displays any symptom, although they can still transmit the virus to others.</p> <p>Hepatitis B is a major disease of serious global public health proportion. It is preventable with safe and effective vaccines that have been available since 1982. Of the 2 billion people who have been infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) globally, more than 350 million have chronic (lifelong) infections. Over 20 million people are infected annually with this virus (Mohammed et al, 2003). Hepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver and is the most common blood-borne (direct contact with human blood) infection. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions, and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized. The world health organization (WHO) estimates that about 3% of the world populations (200 million people) have so far been infected with the Hepatitis C virus. Almost 50% of all cases become chronic carriers and are at risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer (Ahmad, 1998).</p> <p>Viral hepatitis during pregnancy is associated with high risk of maternal complications. There is a high rate of vertical transmission causing fetal and neonatal hepatitis which can have serious effects on the neonate, leading to impaired mental and physical health later in life. A leading cause in maternal mortality is also said to be the most familiar cause of jaundice in pregnancy. Peri-natal transmission of this disease occurs if the mother has had acute Hepatitis B infection during late pregnancy, in the first postpartum or if the mother is a chronic HBsAg carrier. Hepatitis C transmission occurs predominantly around time of delivery and pregnancy. Using this background information, the epidemiology of viral hepatitis during pregnancy is essential for health planners and program managers. Thus, the current study aimed at investigating the prevalence and the possible predisposing factors for Hepatitis B and C viruses among pregnant women using the University of Benin Teaching Hospital as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/> Viral hepatitis during pregnancy is associated with high risk of maternal complications and has become a leading cause of foetal death. Hepatitis one of the major and common infectious diseases of the liver world wide is caused by a small enveloped DNA virus, the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Nigeria is classified among the group of countries endemic for HBV infection. Currently about 18 million Nigerians are infected. Many of these people may not be aware of the infection and hence fail to seek appropriate medical attention therefore progressing to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Similarly when pregnant women are involved they constitute a serious health risk not only to their unborn child but also the society at large. </p> <p><br/><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/> The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <ol><li>To provide an overview on hepatitis virus infection.</li> <li>To examine the prevalence of hepatitis virus infection among pregnant women.</li> <li>To identify the consequences of hepatitis virus infection on pregnant women.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is hepatitis virus infection?</li> <li>What is the prevalence of hepatitis virus infection among pregnant women?</li> <li>What is the consequences of hepatitis virus infection on pregnant women?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/> The following are the significance of this study:</p> <ol><li>The results from this study will educate the general public especially the pregnant women on the prevalence and prognosis of hepatitis virus infection of pregnant women.</li> <li>This research will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of the effect of personality trait on student’s academic performance, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/> This study will cover the prevalence of hepatitis virus infection with special focus on hepatitis B and C.</p> <p><br/> 1.8 <strong>LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong><br/><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<br/><strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Moreover, a recent population-based study of cancer survival in Africa, Asia and Central America found unacceptably low breast cancer survival rates in African countries especially in Gambia where the 5-year age-standardized relative survival did not exceed 12%.[4]</p> <p>Globally, breast cancer has been identified as a leading cause of death globally (1,2). There are more than a million new cases of breast cancer resulting in about 875,000 deaths each year, with high mortality rates in developing countries (3). In Nigeria, breast cancer has been reported to account for 56.6% of all cancer diagnosis between 1995&amp;2002 (4). The burden of the disease has been on the increase and affected women often present late in hospitals when it has reached advance stage (5). Its cure at this stage becomes seriously compromised; the poor survival rate has been linked to late detection and diagnosis(6). Cancer is a disease process that begins when an abnormal cells is transformed by the genetic mutation of the cellular Deoxyribonuleic acids (DNA)(7). Breast cancer is neither painful nor cause any discomfort in its early stage. It usually present as a painless breast lump. There are diverse risk factors that may affect each woman's susceptibility to the disease(3).</p> <p>Besides poverty, low public awareness of breast cancer is a barrier to breast cancer control in LMICs where women seek medical help late and cancers are often diagnosed at advanced stages when very little can be done in terms of curative treatment. The Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI) panel[5, 6] has recommended implementation strategies to optimize breast cancer management in LMICs concerning health-care systems, breast cancer diagnosis, treatment and early detection. For early detection, efforts must be devoted to improve community awareness. Civil society, represented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), can play an important role in breast cancer control.[7]</p> <p>In Ghana, 2,062 new breast cancer cases and 1,137 breast cancer deaths were estimated annually (16.5% of all women cancer deaths), with age-standardized incidence and mortality rates of 25.8 and 15.2 per 100,000 women, respectively (Globocan 2008).[1] Sixty percent of cases were detected at late stages (IIB, III and IV).[8] The available data on median age are limited and mainly hospital based. Clegg-Lamptey et al. reported a median age at diagnosis of 43 years on a sample of 66 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. The age range was broad, from 20 to 84 years.[8] Surgery still represents the main form of treatment for breast cancer in the country[9] and as in other African countries some cultural beliefs and mysticisms surround the disease.[10].</p> <p><strong>1.2 Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>To date, little research has been done regarding the impact of awareness programs in breast cancer control in Nigeria and even less at the community level in rural areas. hence there is need to assess the impact of breast cancer awareness programmes on the prevention of breast cancer amongst Nigerian women.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The major objective of the study is the impact of breast cancer awareness programmes on the prevention of breast cancer amongst Nigerian women.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research questions</strong></p> <p>(1) what is breast cancer</p> <p>(2) How can it be prevented?</p> <p>(3) what effect does breast cancer awareness programmes have on the prevalence of breast cancer?</p> <p><strong> 1.5 Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>Our study aimed to assess the impact of breast cancer awareness programmes on the prevention of breast cancer amongst Nigerian women.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>The research focus on the impact of breast cancer awareness programmes on the prevention of breast cancer amongst Nigerian women.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>1.

In country like Brazil, her Ministry of Health stipulates that in addition to consultation and prenatal care, breathing and relaxation techniques should be taught for better control of labour and general well-being (2). Different exercise programmes are available for pregnant mothers; these exercises include aerobic exercises such as dancing, walking and swimming. Another type is Kegel exercise; this involves tightening of pelvic muscles to control urine flow (3).</p> <p>Exercise has been known scientifically and physically to promote blood circulation to the mother and the foetal vital organs such as the brain, liver and heart etc; exercise also improve pelvic bone and muscle tone thus enhancing normal safe delivery of baby during labour (5). Exercise is an activity requiring physical effort done to improve health, it is a physical or mental activity that is done to stay healthy or become stronger. Exercise session in antenatal clinic should be designed to stimulate interest in the physical changes occurring to promote body awareness and to facilitate physical and mental relaxation.</p> <p>Heggard states that women who practiced more than one type of sports or leisure time physical activity had 24% of reduced risk of preterm delivery, which compared with women with no sports activity (12).  It must be noted that before asking a group to perform antenatal exercise on the floor, the correct way of getting down and up again must be demonstrated side-lying in the coma position with pillows under arm and knee is usually comfortable position in pregnancy. The pregnant mothers should get up from lying by bending the knees, rolling on to one side then using the arms to push up into a sitting or kneeling position to prevent strains on both the back and the abdominal muscles. Muscles of good tone are more elastic and will regain their former length more efficiently and more quickly after being stretched than muscles of poor tone. Exercising the abdominal muscles antenatally will ensure a speed to normal postnatally, effective pushing in labour, and the lessening of back ache in pregnancy (13).  Exercise during pregnancy are of utmost concern for most medical care giver, educators, the general public as well as pregnant mothers and their family (14). Regular and moderate exercise in early pregnancies is healthy for the mothers and their babies (7,15,16).  Mother’s health physiotherapist is the ideal choice to teach the physical skills required or parenthood.17 However in areas where there is no physiotherapist available, midwives may find themselves responsible for physical preparation as well as parent education in antenatal classes or as one-to-one basis (5).</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Prenatal exercise is of benefit to every pregnant mother. Exercise can reduce the length of labour, shorten the recovery time and even help with post-partum weight management (5). The physiotherapists in the hospital always come to the clinic as early as possible but they usually meet only few pregnant mothers because they come late to the clinic for the exercise as they see little or no need for prenatal exercise. The purpose of this study is to study how pregnant mothers perceive usefulness of antenatal exercise as it is being performed in the antenatal clinics. There is need to find a way to change the perception of pregnant women about antenatal clinic through training, seminars and health talks on important of exercises in pregnancy and antenatal clinics.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Objective of the study</strong></p> <p>The objective of the study is to research the perception of exercise and recreation among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>What is the meaning of exercise and recreation?</p> <p>What is the importance of exercise in pregnant women?</p> <p>How can perception of pregnant women about  exercise during pregnancy be positively improved?</p> <p><strong>1.5  Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>Exercise during pregnancy has the following importance:</p> <p>- Fast labour.</p> <p>- Weight loss in obese pregnant women.</p> <p>- Relief of fatigue, swelling and back pain.</p> <p>Therefore, this study will help in educating pregnant women on the importance of exercise during pregnancy, which has great advantage on the their health.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>The study focus on the Perception of  exercise and recreation among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>1.

It is the word used to describe the act of termination of pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a foetus or embryo prior to viability. The term “Abortion” most commonly refers to the induced removal of human pregnancy. It could mean a plan or arrangement which takes place in the foetus before it can develop properly.<br/> In Nigeria, as in all parts of the world, women experience unplanned pregnancy. Some of these women seek to terminate their pregnancies by safe medical methods or by other unorthodox methods available. The procurement of abortion is by no means a new phenomenon in Nigeria. The main reason why young girls and women procure abortion is always changing. Increasingly, women procure abortion due to desire to avoid premarital births and to control family size (Aboyeji, 2003).</p> <p>However, abortion as it is used in this study is the act of terminating or stopping the development of a child in the womb of a woman either by medical operation or self medication.<br/> Abortion, when induced in the developed world in accordance with local laws is among the safest procedures in medicine. Notwithstanding, unsafe abortion occurs in approximately 70,000 maternal death and 5 million cases of disabilities are recorded yearly, globally (www.wikipedia.com). Abortion is an age old practise, it was universally practised but not universally accepted. It was seen as a social evil, one that brought down the curse of the gods. The evil notion that primitive people heard about was so profound that it was believed in some tribes that abortion committed by a married woman could cause the husband to be sterile especially when the husband is not responsible (Olaitan, 2003).</p> <p>The above reasons did not stop the practise of abortion among primitive people. Women in the olden days would rather have their pregnancy terminated than to have the child to be raised in slavery.  Pregnancies involving members of the same family were aborted because it was seen as a taboo. Lactating women who become pregnant had the pregnancies aborted to ensure the flow of milk for the living child. Primitive men used crude, traumatic and often ineffective means to terminate pregnancy which led to the deaths of the victims. Today, abortion continues to be practised whether forbidden or accepted for a variety of social, political, economic and religious reason that are not completely different from those given by primitive men (Boyd, 2006).</p> <p>Over the years, due to advanced science and technology, man has been able to tackle problems more effectively than primitive men. Modern man has been able to eradicate lots of diseases from the face of the earth and invented easier and faster means of cooking and transportation which is seen as less primitive, why is he still very primitive in the way he solves the problem of unwanted pregnancies? Abortion is seen by many in the world today as immoral and ungodly, an act that calls for a punishment from both God and man. Many others still see abortion as a means of regulating the population and balancing the socio economic needs of the family. For this above reason, abortion has been the centre of many legal, social, political and religious debates in the countries all over the world (Jones, 2004).</p> <p>Abortion is a life threatening issue, one that has claimed the lives of thousands of young women and girls all over the world, therefore, it is an issue that concerns everyone in the society no matter what your stand is on abortion. Consider a young girl of fourteen who gets pregnant and is desperate for a solution. Since she is unable to face the consequences of pregnancy at this age, she may not even know who is responsible for her pregnancy after realising she is pregnant due to obvious signs of pregnancy (nausea, insomnia, etc). She may decide to procure an abortion either on her own or with the aid of someone in order to cover shame. The image is frightening that a young girl of such a tender age, both physically, psychologically, and emotionally immature finds herself on an operating table where she gives her body and life to the sharp instrument of an abortionist.</p> <p>On the other hand, this young girl may decide to procure an abortion herself or may find herself in the hands of quacks such as half-baked nurses, medical school dropouts, traditional medicine practitioners and other paramedical quacks which could lead to loss of life or sustenance of severe complications which may affect the womb. In this situation, who is to blame for her death? Is it her teachers, parents, peers, the young girl herself, the abortionist or the society at large? The plight of these young adolescents at this period of life is pitiable because they probably have been exposed to sexual intercourse at a very young age. They also may have indulged in sex without being aware of the consequences of their action which in fact speaks of ignorance and innocence.</p> <p>Again, these young girls may have been lured into sex by older members of the community seeking pleasure. These individuals may deceive these young girls to engage in premarital sex. In whatever way abortion is performed on these young girls, whoever the abortionist is and whatever reasons these girls have to procure abortion, the fact still remains that these young girls are dying daily in their thousands and nothing has been done to remedy the situation.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Abortion has claimed the lives of hundreds of women and rendered many of them infertile in Big Qua Community due to its attendant effects and complications which include menstrual dsisorders rupture of the uterus or womb, recurrent abortion or miscarriages, septicemia, splitting of the cervix, adjacent organ damage, perforation of the uterus and even death. It is against this background that government has made provision for free antenatal care/services and treatment of the under fives so that women who are living with low income standard can afford medical services and retain their pregnancy to term.</p> <p>In spite of all these services, it has been observed that women age 15 -49 years in Big Qua Community still indulge in abortion. From observation and data gathered, abortion in totality leads to perforation of the uterus, formation of adhesion thus resulting to menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea which eventually metamorphose to infertility or barrenness.</p> <p>Consequently, it becomes pertinent to ask; could the refusal of women aged 15-49 years in Big Qua Community to stop abortion be due to lack of knowledge on the dangers associated with abortion or ignorance of the consequences in terms of infertility? An attempt to answer this question prompted the researcher to examine abortion and the health of females (15-49 years) in Big Qua Community, Calabar Municipal Area of Cross River State.</p> <p><strong>  1.3    Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The major objective of this study is to analyze the increase in mortality rate as a result of abortion among young women of childbearing age (15-45yeras) in Big Qua Community, Calabar Municipal Area of Cross River State.</p> <p>The specific objective:</p> <p>    To determine the effect of threatened abortion on the health of females (15-49 years).</p> <p>    To find out the extent to which criminal abortion affect the health of females (15-49 years).</p> <p>    To evaluate the effect of septic abortion on the health of female(15-49 years)</p> <p><strong>1.4    Research questions</strong></p> <p>    To what extent does threatened abortion affect the health of females (15-49 years)?</p> <p>    How will criminal abortion affect the health of females (15-49 years)?</p> <p>    How will septic abortion affect the health of females (15-49 years)?</p> <p><strong> 1.5    Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>          Findings of this study will be of immense benefit to doctors/nurses and all health workers, students and married women.To doctors/nurses, it will help them understand the reasons why women submit to abortions of any kind. This will provide information for the development of information education and communication (IEC) materials to effectively educate women and general public on abortion in general and the dangers of illegal abortions.</p> <p>To students, it will enable them to understand why they should not indulge in abortion because of the short and long term complications and dangers associated with it. It will also enable them know the relationship between abortion and infertility.</p> <p>To married women, the study will enlighten them on the consequences of abortion and equally provide hope for those who are already victims as new methods of achieving pregnancy/fertility are made known to them.</p> <p><strong>1.6    Delimitation of the study</strong></p> <p>This study is limited in the scope to abortion and effect on the health of women of childbearing age (15-45 years). It is also limited in scope to Big Qua Community in Calabar Municipal Area in Cross River State.</p> <p>It is also limited to three major types of abortion which were adopted as sub-variables for this study as follows: threatened abortion, criminal abortion and septic abortion.</p> <p> <strong>1.7   Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p>In any meaningful undertaking, there are some problems that can hinder the speedy and successful completion of such a task. Therefore, major limiting factors in this work were ; the short time allotted for the completion of the work and the uncooperative attitude of some respondents to provide the researcher with necessary information. Since the researcher topic has some social implications.</p> <p><strong> 1.8   Definition of terms </strong></p> <p>For easy understanding of some medical terms used in this work, there is need to define them to ease clarification:</p> <p>    Infertility: the inability of a couple to bear a living child despite living together and having unprotected sexual intercourse and wishing to have a child for at least one year</p> <p>    Abortion: Is the termination of pregnancy before the embryo/feotus (baby in the womb) attain the age of viability (maturity)</p> <p>    Threatened abortion: The condition in pregnancy before the 20th week marked by bleeding and cramping uterus sufficient to suggest that miscarriage may result.</p> <p>    Criminal abortion: Illegal termination of pregnancy</p> <p>    Septic abortion: Is a form of miscarriage that is associated with a serious uterine infection</p> <p>    Fertility: The ability to procreate.</p>\n\nAN ANALYSIS OF THE INCREASE IN MORTALITY RATE AS A RESULT OF ABORTION AMONG YOUNG WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ANALYSIS OF THE INCREASE IN MORTALITY RATE AS A RESULT OF ABORTION AMONG YOUNG WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE", "id": 54}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>Hospital acquired infections (HAIs) continue to be a threat to hospital admissions and workers thus contributing to mortalities and morbidities. Sophistication and type of services given by health facilities may determine health worker’s attitude towards combating these infections. The objective of this study is to compare knowledge, attitude and practice of HAIs among health workers at the three levels of health care in Nigeria, particularly the primary level that has to do with the resident as well as the health workers of Egor in Edo State. Nosocomial infections (Nls) are new localized or systemic infections that develop in patients receiving medical care in a hospital or other healthcare facilities. The infections are not incubating or present during a patient’s admission into the healthcare facility and are identified at least forty-eight to seventy-two hours following the patient’s admission. Episodes of Nls are recognized in hospitalized patients world-wide and are prevalent in all age groups. They are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and parasites present in the air, surfaces or equipment and are often transmitted by indirect and direct contact. Some of the pathogens are resistant to antimicrobial agents. The burdens of Nls include prolonged duration of hospitalization for patients resulting in increased costs of healthcare and deaths. Implementation of safe patient care activities is the role of healthcare workers such as physicians, dental health care workers and nurses. Therefore these healthcare workers should be familiar with practices to prevent the occurrence and spread of Nls. It has been documented in the literature that at the time of their graduation from their professional education, healthcare professionals have sufficient knowledge to practice patient safety and infection control guidelines. However, the evidence suggests otherwise since healthcare workers including nurses are implicated in the transmission of nosocomial infections. With nurses having the most contacts with patients; understanding of their knowledge, attitudes and practice patterns with regard to the spread of Nls may provide one approach by which this health care issue would be addressed.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Nosocomial or hospital acquired infections (HAIs) is a serious global public health issue, causing the suffering of about 1.4 million people across the world at any given time (WHO 2007). Susceptibility to these infections has been associated with use of invasive devices, extremes of age, immune status and infection control practices (Haley et al 1985, Emori and Gayness 1995, Vincent et al 1995).They often increase costs of health care both for patients and health services alike (Coello et al 1993, McCuckin et al 1999, Kim et al 2001). The World Health Organization offers several definitions of a nosocomial infection/ hospital –acquired infection:</p> <p>An infection acquired in [a] hospital by a patient who was admitted for a reason other than that infection . An infection occurring in a patient in a hospital or other health care facility in whom the infection was not present or incubating at the time of admission. This includes infections acquired in the hospital but appearing after discharge, and also occupational infections among staff of the facility.</p> <p>As a general timeline, infections occurring more than 48 hours after admission are usually considered nosocomial.  Nosocomial infections are also divided into two classes, endemic or epidemic. Most are endemic, meaning that they are at the level of usual occurrence within the setting. Epidemic infections occur when there is an unusual increase in infection above baseline for a specific infection or organism. Epidemiological studies report that nosocomial infections are caused by ubiquitous. pathogens such as bacteria (Lepelletier et aI., 2005), viruses (de-Oliveira et aI., 2005) and fungi(Trick et aI., 2002) present in air, surfaces or equipment. Nosocomial infections occur worldwide, both in the developed and developing world.  They are a significant burden to patients and public health.  They are a major cause of death and increased morbidity in hospitalized patients.  They may cause increased functional disability and emotional stress and may lead to conditions that reduce quality of life.  Not only do they affect the general health of patients, but they are also a huge burden financially.   The greatest contributors to these costs are the increased stays that patients with nosocomial infections require.  The increased length of stay varies from 3 days for gynecological procedures to 19.8 days for orthopedic procedures.  Other costs include additional drugs, the need for isolation, and the use of additional studies.  There are also indirect costs due to loss of work.</p> <p>Nosocomial infections are most frequently infections of the urinary tract, surgical wounds, and the lower respiratory tract.  A World Health Organization prevalence study and other studies have shown that these infections most commonly occur in intensive care units and in acute surgical and orthopedic wards.  Infection rates are also higher in patients with increased susceptibility due to old age, underlying disease, or chemotherapy.</p> <p>Patients are exposed to a variety of microorganisms during a hospital stay, but contact between a patient and an organism does not necessarily guarantee infection.  Other factors influence the nature and frequency of infections.  Organisms vary in resistance to antimicrobials and in intrinsic virulence.  Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites can all cause nosocomial infections.  There are multiple ways of acquiring such an organism.  The organisms can be transferred from one patient to another (cross-infection).  They can be part of a patient’s own flora (endogenous infection).  They can be transferred from an inanimate object or from a substance recently contaminated by another human source (environmental transfer).  The organisms that cause most hospital acquired infections are common in the general population, in which setting they are relatively harmless.  They may cause no disease or a milder form of disease than in hospitalized patients.  This group includes Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, and Enterobacteria.  Factors that increase a patient’s susceptibility to nosocomial infections include young or old age, decreased immune resistance, underlying disease, and therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.</p> <p>The organisms that cause nosocomial infections are often drug-resistant.  The regular use of antimicrobials for treatment therapy or prophylaxis promotes the development of resistance.  Through antimicrobial-driven selection and the exchange of genetic resistance elements, multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria emerge.  Antimicrobial-sensitive microorganism that are part of the endogenous flora are suppressed, while the resistant strains survive.  Many strains of pneumococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and tuberculosis are currently resistant to most or all antimicrobials which were once effective.</p> <p>Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of needle stick injuries and blood-borne pathogens as they perform their clinical activities in a hospital.3  They are exposed to blood borne pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses, from sharp injuries and contacts with blood and other body fluids.</p> <p>Many nosocomial infections are caused by pathogens transmitted from one patient to another, by way of healthcare workers who have not washed their hands, or who don’t observe simple hospital hygiene measures, and also between patients (Horn et al 1988). Consequently, it is important to note that approximately one-third of hospital-acquired infections may be preventable (Comptroller and Auditor General 2000)</p> <p><strong>1.2  Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at menace of occupational hazards as they carry out their clinical activities in the hospital.  Nosocomial infections have been acknowledged as a problem disturbing the quality of health care and a principal source of adverse healthcare outcomes. It has been recognized in the literature that within the realm of patient safety, these infections have serious impact. Increased hospital stay days, increased costs of healthcare, economic destitution to patients and their families and even deaths, are among the many negative outcomes (Emori et aI., 1991; Starfield et aI.,2000; Angus et aI., 2001; Zhan &amp;Miller, 2003; CDC, 2005; Engemann et aI., 2005; Elward, et aL, 2005: Klevens et aL, 2007; Kaye et aL, 2009; Edwards et aI., 2009; Scott II, 2009). $26 million (Anderson et aI., 2009). These findings are indicative of the enormous economic burden associated with nosocomial infections.</p> <p>Epidemiological studies report that nosocomial infections are caused by ubiquitous pathogens transmitted, at least in part, by healthcare workers through direct and indirect contact.</p> <p>In 1938, Price established that microorganisms recovered from human body could be divided into two categories: the resident Hora (microbiota), or transient flora (Price, 1938). The resident</p> <p>microbiota, also commonly referred to as normal flora consists of bacteria mostly found in the</p> <p>superficial cells of the skin and mucous membranes; and in linings of the orifices of digestive, respiratory and reproductive systems (Black, 2012). It has been demonstrated in several immunological studies that resident microbiota exhibits protective functions against invasion, or</p> <p>outgrowth, of pathogenic microorganisms and its depletion or aberration may lead to opportunistic infections (Fujimura et aI., 2010). However, these bacteria may cause infections in non-intact skin.</p> <p>The most overriding species of resident microbiota is Staphylococcus epidermidis.</p> <p>Transient microbiota are microorganisms present, under definite conditions, in any of the</p> <p>locations where resident microbiota are found. Some of these microorganisms take possession of the superficial layers of the skin. They are more amenable to removal by routine hand hygiene and such microorganisms are often acquired by healthcare workers during direct contact with patients or contaminated environmental surfaces, within the patient’s surroundings. The most common types of transient bacteria are the Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, {3eta-hemolyticStreptococci, Serratia mercescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</p> <p>Enterobacter species, Candida albicans and Clostridium difficile (Black, 2012). These are the</p> <p>organisms frequently implicated in nosocomial infections (Monarca et aI., 2000; CDC 2002;</p> <p>Lepelletier, 2005; Ribby et aI., 2005 &amp;Hayden et al., 2006) and some of the strains are resistant to antibiotics (Lodise et aI., 2002; Conly et aI., 2004; Abba et al., 2005).</p> <p>Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that transient bacteria are often acquired by</p> <p>healthcare workers during direct contact with patients, or contaminated environmental surfaces,</p> <p>within the patient’s surroundings (Monarca et aI., 2000; Lepelletier, 2005; Ribby et aI., 2005 &amp;</p> <p>Hayden et aI., 2006). Epidemiological studies suggest that nosocomial infections can be transmitted through direct person-to- person contact between infected patient. healthcare workers, non-infected patients and by indirect contact through equipment, supplies, medical procedures, or air (CDC, 2000; WHO 2002). The affected body systems depend on the virulence of the pathogens, accessibility of the pathogen to the patient and susceptibility of the patient to the pathogen (CDC, 2000). The most common types of nosocomial infections affect the urinary tract, surgical wounds, respiratory system and blood stream (WHO, 2002). Studies that have examined the impact of nosocomial infections caused by antibioticresistant pathogens at a single center in Egor L.G.A  and some laboratories that served hospitals in Edo state, showed that infections caused by antibiotic challenging pathogens were associated with amplified mortality rates, increased lengths of hospital stay and higher healthcare costs compared to the nosocomial infections caused by pathogens susceptible to antibiotics.</p> <p>These findings sustain the notion that nosocomial infections present massive economic encumber to the public and the healthcare system.  In response to the realization of the degree of the problem, various agencies including federal and state governments, and professional societies – both nationally and internationally, have devised measures aimed at reducing the incidence of nosocomial infections. For example, Center for Infection Control and Epidemiology developed guidelines for hand-hygiene in healthcare settings and made recommendations for infection control practices which were based upon the obtainable evidence surrounding the best practices for patient care (Boyce at aI., 2002).</p> <p>Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in cooperation with</p> <p>government and non-government organizations throughout the world, has synchronized efforts and resources to help minimize the occurrence of nosocomial infections; and recommend activities that increase quality of patient care. In this regard, healthcare workers have been fostered to implement strategies that would call attention to measures aimed at prevention of the transmission of nosocomial infections. For that reason, healthcare professionals have been encouraged to participate in in-service continuing education on topics related to measures deemed necessary to reduce the transmission of nosocomial infections.</p> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO), in conjunction with CDC, set prevention of nosocomial infections as main concern by developing a practical guide (manual) for the prevention of nosocomial infections globally (WHO, 2002). Some recommended strategies included in the manual were: the use of hand decontamination, personal hygiene, exploitation of masks and gloves; and proper methods of handling soiled clothing when healthcare workers perform patient care activities. The manual also recommends methods for preventing environmental transmission</p> <p>including cleaning the hospital environment, use of hot  superheated water, disinfection of patient equipment, sterilization, and prevention of transmission of pathogens (for example, HIV, Hepatitis- B, Hepatitis-C viruses, and M. tuberculosis) to staff. Above a/l, the manual recommends that hospitals provide sufficient resources by training staff in infection control programs such as appropriate patient isolation and sterilization techniques and yearly work-plans and manuals for infection control practices that are approved by infection control committees (WHO, 2002). Such initiatives by the CDC suggest the importance with which nosocomial infections should be addressed (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidodlhip/prevention). Conversely, despite the development of the above policies and recommendations, the incidence of nosocomial infections and their collision on healthcare costs, morbidity and mortality stay unabated (Anderson et aI., 2009 &amp;Scott II, 2009)  and healthcare workers are concerned in the transmission. The centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services instituted a“payment reform” program  where the eventual reimbursement system will not cover costs for preventable infections (nosocomial infections) acquired in the course of treatment (Johnson, 2009). Moreover, the federal government requires that healthcare institutions’ statistics on nosocomial infections be made available to the public and hospitals with highest rates of nosocomial infections will be penalized (DHHS, 2009). Furthermore, the Healthcare Reform Law has instituted measures that incentivize hospitals and other healthcare facilities to improve their programs for reducing nosocomial infections. Findings from several epidemiological studies divulge that healthcare workers such as physicians, dentists and nurses are implicated in the transmission of nosocomial infections.</p> <p>It has as well been reported that transmission frequently occurs during the performance of medical procedures, when these healthcare workers fail to follow aseptic precautions. Thus, noncompliance with recommended guidelines by healthcare workers expose patients to an abundance of pathogens (Monarca et aI., 2000; Boyce et aI., 2002; Cohen et aI., 2003; Harrel et aI., 2004; Pittet et aI., 2004; Miner et aI., 2004; Szymanska, 2004; de Oliveira et aI., 2005; Lam et aI., 2004; Kurita et aI., 2006; Rautemaa et aI., 2006; Racco et aI., 2009; Eriksen et aI., 2009 &amp;Costello et aI.,2010).</p> <p>A study conducted by Casewell and Philips (1977) demonstrated that nurses could contaminate their hands with colonies of bacteria during clean patient care activities such as lifting patients, taking pulse, blood pressure, oral temperature or touching patients’ hands, shoulder or groin (Casewell and Phillips, 1977). Stone (2001) documented that patient contacts result in 18</p> <p>contamination of hands by pathogens and that washing hands significantly reduces hand</p> <p>contamination and infection rates (Mortimer et al., 1966; Stone, 2001). In a controlled trial study at a neonatal unit, Mortimer and colleagues (1966) found only 10 %acquisition rate of Staphylococcus aureus by babies where nurses washed their hands between patient contacts; and a 14% acquisition rate of the same pathogen by babies during the first 20 days when the nurses</p> <p>washed their hands between patient contacts. The rate increased to 43% when the nurses</p> <p>washed their hands only when they felt that the practice was clinically indicated (Mortimer et aI., 1966). These findings affirmed the ease with which healthcare workers could transmit</p> <p>microorganisms and consequently, the spread of nosocomial infections.</p> <p>Price (1938) and Lepelletier et al. (2005) observed that transient bacteria that colonize the</p> <p>superficial layers of the skin are easily acquired by healthcare workers during direct contact with</p> <p>patients or contaminated environmental surfaces (Price, 1938 &amp;Lepelletier et aI., 2005). likewise, McBryde et al. (2004) and Michalopoulos et al. (2006), recognized that healthcare workers contaminate their hands or gloves with various pathogens, including resistant strains. While performing procedures that involve touching hospitalized patients’ intact skin or their immediate environment. Exclusively, 17% of transmission of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) to the healthcare workers’ gloves occurred after get in touch with patients, patients’ clothing or patients’ bed (McBryde et aI., 2004). additional studies that investigated the modes of transmission of nosocomial infections in neonatal intensive care units showed that each hospitalized neonate or its immediate environment was touched 78 times during a 12-hour shift. Explicitly, more than half of the contacts were carried out by nurses (Cohen, et aI., 2003). In the light of these statistics, it is incumbent upon healthcare workers to enhance their knowledge of options as regards the alleviation of the transmission of nosocomial infections. It has been documented in the literature that at the time of their graduation from their</p> <p>professional education programs, nurses should have acquired sufficient knowledge to practice</p> <p>patient safety and infection control guidelines (Smith et aI., 2007; Cronenwett et aI., 2007).</p> <p>Besides, their expertise with regards to knowledge, attitudes and practice to control the spread</p> <p>of infection is also well evidenced by their success in licensure exams and other significant</p> <p>assessments, which test their knowledge of infection control practices and the application of skilled safe patient care activities, over the course of their academic journey (Sherwood et aI., 2007; Smith, 2007). hence, the continued presence of nosocomial infections raises an enigma which may only be explained by other factors. fascinatingly, studies that investigated the responsibility of institutional support and the spread of nosocomial infections showed that low staffing levels lead to high workload and increased healthcare workers’ non-compliance with recommended hand hygiene practices (Huggonet et aI., 2007). Furthermore, existing studies show that the lack of proper equipment and surveillance systems for the monitoring of infections further increased the episodes of nosocomial infections (Monarca et aI., 2000; Chen et aI., 2003, Garretson et aI., 2004; Lo et aI., 2008 &amp; Saint et aI., 2008). Thus, it is plausible that this paradox could be explained through a thorough examination of socio-cognitive perspectives with regards to knowledge; or behavioral aspects such as attitude that could affect the healthcare workers’ on-the- job practice; or ecological factors that include organizational support or architectural design of healthcare facility.</p> <p><strong>1.3  Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>On the whole, accessible data show that needle stick injuries and blood borne pathogens are serious threats to patients, HCWs (Healthcare workers)  and to the host community.</p> <p>Health workers , regardless of specialty, engage in the most direct contact with clients in healthcare settings. Also, existing literature has documented specific examples where nurses are implicated in the transmission of nosocomial infections {Casewell &amp;Phillips, 1977; Ehrenkranz et aI., 1991; Lucent et aI., 2002; Waters et al., 2004; Lepelletier et al., 2005; de-Oliveira et aI., 2005;Pessoa-Silva et aI., 2007). A review of literature has shown that health workers educational programs incorporate courses and instructional approaches that include methods aimed at preparing the Health care practitioner in protocols designed for infection control and as such the reduction and transmission of nosocomial infections. Furthermore, their expertise with regards to knowledge, attitudes and practice to control the spread of infections is well evidenced by their success in licensure exams and relevant assessments over the course of their academic journey (Sherwood et aI., 2007; Smith, 2007). Paradoxically, the evidence highlights otherwise: that is, unabated levels of the spread of nosocomial infections (Anderson et aI., 2009; Scott II, 2009) and the role of healthcare workers including nurses, in the transmission of nosocomial infections (Pittet et aI., 2004; Miner et aI., 2004; Eriksen et aI., 2009; Racca et aI., 2009; Costello et aI., 2010). Additionally, there is some evidence that suggests that the spread of nosocomial infections could be related to a breakdown in knowledge, attitude and practices among healthcare workers (Godin 1996; Pessoa-Silva et aI., 2005; Pittet et aI., 2006). What has not been established is if thisbreakdown is prevalent in novice registered nurses, suggesting the novice registered nurses’ inability to apply their knowledge in awork setting, or that it is in the more experienced registered nurses, suggesting either adecrement of knowledge (Ribby et aI., 2005; Lam et aI., 2004; PessoaSilva et aI., 2007; Suchitra et aI., 2007; Sax et aI., 2007) or a change in attitude and or sloppy practices possibly associated with stressful behavioral interactions with colleagues, workload or other organizational factors (Godin, 1996; Larson et aI., 2000; O’Boyle et aI., 2001; Chenot &amp; Daniel, 2010). With health workers having the most contacts with patients, understanding their knowledge, attitudes and practice patterns with regard to nosocomial infections may be an important mode by which this health care issue may be addressed.</p> <p>This study will expose the level of awareness, attitude and practice of standard precautions among the HCWs and hence could be used as a baseline for intervention.  It will also identify gaps which would be recommended for correction through interventions.  This study could be used to monitor trends of events concerning knowledge, attitude and understanding among health care workers in Egor, Edo State, by reviewing from time to time, the incidence of needle stick injuries and the morbidity and mortality pattern.  It will also identify gaps in the standard precaution practices among these HCWs and the results from the study will be used for the planning of health education intervention programme.  It will also provide reference material for the academic society as well as further research.</p> <p>The purpose of this study was seven· fold:</p> <p>    a) To investigate the level of knowledge, attitudes and perception of health workers with regards to the spread of nosocomial infections in Egor, Edo States .</p> <p>    b) To ascertain the attitude, knowledge and perception of health care workers in Egor, Edo towards standard precautions.</p> <p>    c) To compare the knowledge and perception in novice and experienced healthcare workers with regards to the spread of nosocomial infections;</p> <p>    d) To determine the level of practice of standard precautions among health care workers in Egor, Edo State.</p> <p>    e) To investigate the level of organizational support as reported by the health workers;</p> <p>    f) To examine if a relationship exists between organizational factors or support and the level of health workers’ knowledge, and understanding with regards to the spread of nosocomial infections.</p> <p>    g) To determine the level of immunization of the health care workers against infectious diseases such as HBV.</p> <p>    h) To describe the action taken by the health care workers when they are exposed to occupational hazards and injuries.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the Study</strong><br/><br/> It has been recognized in several epidemiological studies that healthcare workers such as physicians, dentists and nurses are caught up in the transmission of nosocomial infections.</p> <p>Literature that has explored the knowledge, perception and practices of nurses and other health workers is limited. As a result, it is vital to further investigate the impact of knowledge, understanding and practices of novice and experienced graduate nurses with regard to the level of the spread of nosocomial infections. The findings from this study will add to the existing literature and may be used in developing interventions to reduce the spread of nosocomial infections.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>There are six research questions for this study.</p> <p>    a) What is the overall level of Knowledge, Attitudes and Perception among healthcare workers with regards to the spread of nosocomial infections?</p> <p>    b) Is there significant difference in the level of knowledge between novice and experienced</p> <p>healthcare workers with regards to the spread of nosocomial infections?</p> <p>    c) Is there significant difference in attitude between novice and experienced healthcare workers</p> <p>with regards to the spread of nosocomial infections?</p> <p>    d) Is there significant difference in practice of safe patient care between novice and experienced</p> <p>healthcare workers  with regards to the spread of nosocomial infections?</p> <p>    e) What is the level of organizational support as reported by healthcare workers?</p> <p>    f) What is the level of immunization of the health care workers against infectious diseases?</p> <p>Theoretical Framework</p> <p>Vacant social cognitive models propose that determinants that shape human behavior are acquired through socialization and may be susceptible to change. When reviewing the literature, three theories were found to offer a strong theoretical framework for research in this area: the social cognitive theory (SCT), the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Theory of Reasoned Action I</p> <p>Theory of Planned Behavior (TRAlTPB) (Ajzen, 1980; Bandura,1989; Rosenstock et al. 1988).</p> <p>The Social Cognitive Theory stems from the Social Learning Theory and was suggested by Alfred Bandura in 1986. This theory is based on the notion of a triad model that takes into account the communications between three factors: environment, personal cognition and behavior. A central belief of the Social Cognitive Theory asserts that behavior is uniquely determined by each of the three factors and that response penalty mediate behavior. Additional, the theory asserts that people are most likely to learn and model behavior observed in persons with whom they identify through a phenomenon commonly referred to as “vicarious capacity”. Vicarious capacity is defined as an observational leaning mechanism governed by attention span, retention process, motor facsimile development and motivational processes (Bandura, 1991 and Glanz et aI., 2002).Bandura asserted that people learn by modeling behaviors from significant others; and that behavior is determined by symbolizing capability, forethought, self-regulation, self-reflection, and vicarious capability. The theory also states that a bi-directional interaction occurs between the environment and personal characteristics and is thus central to the development of human prospect, beliefs, and cognitive competencies (Bandura, 1991 and Glanz et aI., 2002). In the context of Bandura’s Social-Cognitive theory, the healthcare facility would be the environment where directional and personal interactions between the healthcare workers such as the experienced health worker would interact with the novice health worker. It is therefore possible to postulate that the health worker with less experience will model the behaviors of the more experienced health worker. Some constructs of the Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory are applicable to the Health Belief Model (HBM) – a psychological model that explains and predicts health behaviors by focusing on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals (Glanz et aI., 2002). Health Belief Model was first developed in the 1950s by social psychologists Hochbaum, Rosenstock and Kegels. The model uses constructs that represent perceived threats and net benefits such as perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action and self-efficacy. The model asserts that these constructs account for aperson’s “readiness to act” (Rosenstock, 1988). The literature reviewed suggests that it is possible to apply the constructs of the Health Belief Model to studies that explore health behaviors such as health prevention and promotion, and compliance with recommended guidelines for infection control. The behaviors of health care professionals, and in particular nurses, are also regulated by social and moral standards. Through foresight, the individual can think through the consequences of a behavior without actually performing the behavior oneself (Bandura, 1989). It is known in some studies that positive health behaviors by healthcare workers may decrease the occurrence of the unabated nosocomial infections (Aly et aI., 2005; Pittet et aI., 2004). For example, if a health worker internalizes the notion that prevention of nosocomial infections is essential he I she will take precautions in order to improve on the outcomes of the admitting disease or condition, and improve the delivery of quality standard of care.</p> <p>Furthermore, a study that examined fulfillment with hand-hygiene practices among medical staff showed that the frequency of healthcare workers’ hand-hygiene was greatly influenced by role models (Lankford et aI., 2001). In this observational study, the researcher noted that healthcare workers were less corn plaint with hand hygiene protocols when high ranking person such as physician or nurse did not carry out hand hygiene practices. This observation implied that the effect of role model is significant in negatively influencing healthcare workers’ compliance with recommended guidelines.</p> <p>Another theory with tenets applicable to this area of study is the Theory of Reasoned Action /</p> <p>Theory of Planned Behavior (TRArrPB) developed by social psychologists Ajzen and Fishbein in 1967. This theory explains how attitude and motivation influences human behavior. The theory proposes that “intent’ is the most important determinant of a person’s “behavior”; and furthermore, that an individual’s intention to perform a behavior is dependent upon the “attitude” toward the performance of the behavior. The theory also contends that behavioral beliefs and normative beliefs influence the individual’s motivation to comply with show of a certain behavior.</p> <p>According to Ajzen (1991), behavioral beliefs link the behavior to an expected outcome while normative beliefs are considered as the perceived behavioral expectations of individuals within a group. Altogether these referents lead to actual behavior beliefs control and may drive the individual’s intention to perform the behavior (Ajzen, 2006). Another assumption of the TRAlTPB theory is that human beings are rational: they make systematic use of information available to them and consider the implications of their actions before they decide to engage or not engage in certain behaviors. They (human beings) have normative beliefs which arise from perceived behavioral expectations of individuals such as co-workers; for example, nurses. Therefore, the stronger a person’s intention to perform a particular task (behavior) is, the more likely the person will perform the behavior (Ajzen, 2006). In the context of this study, it is possible to think that health workers could be influenced by colleagues or friends and peers at the work settings. What is unclear is whether they are influenced in a positive or negative way. Additionally, it is possible to speculate that the health care workers would be influenced by cognitive factors such as decrement in knowledge. Any decrement in knowledge might lead to healthcare workers’ non- compliance with recommended guidelines and protocols while performing patient-care activities. What is also unclear from the literature is whether there is a decline in the knowledge and skills gained during their course of study or whether these workers become non-compliant over time due to modeling after other noncompliant colleagues during their performance of patient care activities. This non-compliance would lead to the spread of nosocomial infections.</p> <p><strong>1.6  Implications of the Study</strong></p> <p>The findings in this study suggest that the strong educational standards, set in place, should be continued and enforced. Furthermore, monitoring of adherence to and compliance with established guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by healthcare workers should be sustained. Additionally, the fundamental role of healthcare institutions to provide support in the form of adequate staffing and equipment should be intensified.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>As with many research projects, this study has several limitations. Even though some of the advantages of online surveys are the instantaneous data collection and savings, in both time and money, the approach may lead to many limitations. One of the primary limitations is the generalizability of the results to all heath workers. Cook and Campbell (1979) pointed out that people tend to report what they believe the researcher expects to read or report what reflects positively on their own abilities, knowledge, beliefs or opinions (Cook &amp;Campbell, 1979). The questionnaire used in this study was constructed from emergent themes in the reviewed literature and established guidelines set by a task force committee on Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. The knowledge and skills items related to information the respondents ought to have mastered during their academic joumey, or reinforced through work related experiences and continuing education.

According to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) report, anemia affected 1.62 billion (24.8%) people globally (WHO, 2008). Approximately 51% of pregnant women were expected to be anaemic in 2001(G.C.). The prevalence in developing countries was 56% and 18% in developed countries (Bick et al., 2006). The most recent global estimates suggest that the prevalence of anemia is 41.8% among pregnant women and 30.2% among non-pregnant women (WHO, 2008; Bhutta et al., 2012). In Africa, 57.1% of the pregnant women were anaemic. According to Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey (EDHS) report of 2011, the numbers are stated to be lower putting the prevalence of anemia in pregnant women at 22% at the country level and 24.9% in Oromia Regional State encompassing the study area (CSA, 2011). The risk of anemia is high in women who are premenopausal and/or pregnant. This is mainly due to menstrual blood loss, increased demand to support the fetus, puerperal blood loss, and it is usually exacerbated by nutritional insufficiency that is common in developing countries (Bick et al., 2006). Anemia contributes to almost 120,000 maternal deaths globally and indirectly to almost a fifth (18%) of the burden of maternal mortality. In addition to maternal deaths, there are several adverse health outcomes associated with anemia including preterm delivery, intrauterine fetal death, stillbirths, neonatal mortality, low birth weight (LBW) and poor cognitive development in the offspring (Bhutta et al., 2012; Melku et al., 2014). In developing countries, maternal anemia during pregnancy is a product of many factors, such as maternal malaria, intestinal parasitic infection, recurrent infection, reduced dietary intakes, parity and micronutrient deficiencies just to name but few (Bhutta et al., 2012; Ugwuja, et al., 2011; Haidar, 2010). Among the micronutrient deficiencies the most common encountered are iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and folate deficiency 2 megaloblastic anemia. Of all anemia diagnosed during pregnancy, 75% are due to iron deficiency. Iron deficiency (ID) alone affects nearly 20% of the world’s population (Bick et al., 2006). The odds for developing anemia were 60% more likely in the iron-deficient and 40% more likely in the folic acid deficient. One in every three women had anemia and deficiency of folic acid while one in every two had iron deficiency, suggesting that deficiencies of both folic acid and iron constitute the major micronutrient deficiencies in Ethiopian women (Haidar, 2010). Apart from iron and folate deficiency cobalamin (Vit B12) deficiency has been shown to account for some cases of anemia (Morris et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2010). Studies show that iron intake in Ethiopia is adequate (Gibson et al., 2008), however anemia is still a health concern affecting 22% of pregnant women (WHO, 2008) leading to devastating outcomes of pregnancy and delivery necessitating studies to be conducted on other micronutrients which could play an important role on the occurrence of anemia. In the present study the socio-demographic and obstetric characters and plasma levels of iron, folate and cobalamin, was evaluated in anaemic (case) and non-anaemic (control) pregnant women to ascertain the impact these factors have on maternal anemia and the possible interactions among them.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of problem</strong></p> <p>Anemia is a major public health problem all around the world and even more in developing countries like Ethiopia with a prevalence of 22% (CSA, 2011). Anemia could be the consequence of many factors such as: infections, micronutrient deficiency, blood loss or genetic disorders (Bhuta et al., 2012; Ugwuja, et al., 2011; Haidar, 2010). Of all the micronutrients that are presumed to be predisposing factors ID has been extensively assessed but others like folate and cobalamin, should also be assessed as they have been shown to have great impact on development of anemia on researches done on other countries (Gibson et al., 2008; Khan et al., 2010; Knovich et al., 2008).</p> <p><strong>1.3 Research objectives</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this study was</p> <ol><li>To assess the prevalence of anemia among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Anantigha Calabr south LGA, Cross River.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Specific objectives</strong></p> <ol><li>To indicate the prevalence of anemia among patients who attend in Anantigha Calabr south LGA, Cross River.</li> <li>To measure the Hb level of the participants</li> <li>To identify factors related to anemia in the study population.</li> </ol>\n\nLEVEL OF AWARENESS AND PREVENTION OF ANAEMIA IN PREGNANCY AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LEVEL OF AWARENESS AND PREVENTION OF ANAEMIA IN PREGNANCY AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Maternal and child health has emerged as the most important issue that determined global and national wellbeing.  This is because every individual, family and community is at some point intimately involved in pregnancy and the success of childbirth (WHO, 2006).  Despite the honour bestowed on womanhood and the</p> <p>appreciation of the birth of a new born baby, pregnancy and childbirth is still considered a perilous journey. The situation of maternal and child health in Nigeria is among the worst in Africa and has not improved substantially and in some areas of the country, has worsened over the past decade (Ladipo, 2009).  The maternal mortality ratio ranges between 800-15000 per 100,000 live births (Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, 2003), with marked variation between geo-political zones – 165 in South West compared with 1,549 in the North-East and between urban and rural areas (Ladipo,</p> <p>2009).  Total fertility rate is 5.7 births per woman and it is estimated that approximately 59,000 of maternal deaths take place annually in Nigeria as a result of pregnancy, delivery and post-delivery complications (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, 2007).</p> <p>Research (Ladipo, 2009) indicated close link between the health of the new born with the health of their mothers.  About 30-40% of neonatal and infant deaths result from poor maternal health and inadequate care during pregnancy, delivery and the critical immediate postpartum period (Ladipo, 2009).  In Nigeria 340,000 infants die every year during delivery and shortly afterwards especially if the mother dies in childbirth (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, 2007). The under-five mortality ratio is 200 per 1000 live births (WHO, 2006).  These deaths are not unconnected with the poor maternal health services in the country and could be avoided through provision of quality and effective maternal and child health services.</p> <p>Nigeria is one of the African countries with a rapidly growing population.  As a nation with a growing economy, one of the major health challenges facing the country today is the capacity to sustain the increasing infant and maternal health.  The most common recorded cause of perinatal deaths are similar to those of other less developed countries, and the common denominators are early childbearing poor maternal health and above all, the lack of appropriate and quality services (Okereke, Kanu, Nwachukwu, Anyanwu, Ehiri &amp; Merick, 2005).  Although life-saving practices for most infants have been known for decades, currently one third of the mothers still have no access to health care services during pregnancy and almost half do not have access to health care services during childbirth (Okereke, et al., 2005). In the light of rapid population growth and increased risks of adverse environmental health exposures, maternal and child health prospects could be a serious national public health problem due to factors such as ignorance, apathy, poverty, lack of commitment, illiteracy and corruption (Opara &amp; Ellah, 2007).</p> <p>The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 and 5 require improvement of maternal and child health. Target 6 of MDG5 specified that between 1990 and 2015, maternal mortality ratio be reduced by three quarters. The chances of attaining this target depend on how policy, plans and int erventions address the comprehensive set of social, economic, cultural as well as medical causes of maternal mortality in Nigeria</p> <p>(Ladipo, 2009).</p> <p>The 2006 census estimated that there were about 65 million females in Nigeria, out of which 30 million were of reproductive age (15-49 years).  Each year about 6 million women become pregnant, 5 million of these pregnancies resulted in child birth (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, 2007). Yearly, about 1,080,000-1,620,000 Nigerian women and girls suffer disabilities caused by complications during pregnancy and child birth (HILL, Abouzahr &amp; Wardlaw, 2001).  For every one that dies, 20-30 more suffer long term and short term disabilities such as chronic anaemia, maternal exhaustion or physical weakness, vesico-vaginal or recto-vaginal fistulae, stress incontinence, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and emotional depression (Ladipo, 2009).  Child survival is equally affected too as the chances of survival of a child in the absence of his or her mother is greatly reduced.</p> <p>Maternal heath and the health of new born children are critical topics in global development. When women are able to access needed quality health care services and protect themselves from the many health risks they face,l ong-term social and economic progress can be achieved.  The health and well-being of mother, infants, and young children are of critical importance, both as reflections of the current health status of individuals, local communities and the nation as a whole and as predictors of the health of the next generation (Okereke, et al, 2005).  In several key areas of health care, mothers and young children of several communities of developing countries are not receiving the health care services they need, and the result is premature illness and preventable death (Okereke, et al, 2005).  The foregoing, prompted the researcher to undertake research study on the provision and utilization of maternal and child health care services among women of child bearing age in Benue State.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Every minute in a day, somewhere in the world, a woman dies due to complications arising from pregnancy and childbirth (Ladipo, 2009).  In Nigeria, 150 of such women die daily; it is the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age.  The tragedy is that these women do not die from diseases, but during a normal, life-enhancing process of procreation.  Even more tragic, is the fact that these deaths are avoidable if preventive measures are taken and adequate care is available (Ladipo, 2009).</p> <p>Nigeria has had a very poor record regarding maternal and child health outcomes.  Statistics depicting maternal and child health status in Nigeria call for a public health action (Adebayo, 2001). An estimated 53,000 women and 250,000 new born die annually mostly as a result of preventable causes (National Primary Health Care Development Agency, 2006).  Over the years, several initiative programmes have been introduced to reduce the rate of mortality among mothers and children in Nigeria. Despite these efforts, poor maternal and child health indices have continued to be one of the most serious development challenges facing the country (NPHCDA, 2006).  In the year 2000, Nigeria and other members of the United Nations agreed on a number of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to improve the welfare of the people in their countries in the 21st century. Two of the health related goals concern reducing death among children under 5 years old by two-third (MDG 4, that is, reduction from 230 to 77 per 100,000 live births) and reducing maternal deaths by three-quarter (MDG 5) by the year 2015, when compared with the 1990 figures – from 1000/100,000 live births to 250 (NPHCDA, 2006).  One year to 2015, Nigeria still records a rather appalling maternal, neonatal, and infant mortality rates compared with developed countries. Although many of these deaths are preventable, the coverage and quality of health care services in Nigeria continue to fail women and children. Every single day, Nigeria loses about 2,300 under five year olds and 145 women of child bearing age, which marked the country the second largest contributor to the under-five and maternal mortality rate in the world (Okereke, et al, 2004).  Underneath the statistics lies the pain of human tragedy, for thousand of families who have lost their children. Even more devastating is the knowledge that essential interventions reaching women and babies on time would have averted most of these deaths. Although, analysis of recentt rends shows that the country is making progress in cutting down infants and under-five mortality rates, the pace still remains too slow to achieve the millennium development goals of reducing child mortality by a third by 2015.  Presently, less than 20 percent of health facilities in Nigeria offer emergency obstetric care and only 34 percent of deliveries are attended by skilled birth attendants (Okereke, et al, 2005).  The state of health of Nigerians, and especially of our women, is to say the least, obnoxious and scandalous.  Health services in Nigeria have been unable to satisfy the needs, desires, aspirations of the consumers who seek health assistance, counselling and diagnosis.  This holds that the consumers of health care services in Nigeria are largely unsatisfied as a result of the poor quality and quantity of health services and their providers as well as financial constraints (Ladipo, 2009).</p> <p>Despite the efforts in raising MCH services, some women still do not avail themselves of the opportunity even when provided free of charge.  It is not uncommon to hear that some women reject modern medical and health care services on the ground that they are not in consonance with the system the people are already used to.  Therefore, this study is designed to assess the provision and utilization of maternal and child health care services among women of child bearing age in Benue State.  The study attempted to find answers to the following specific research questions.</p> <p><strong>1.3    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p>

class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  Background to the study</strong></p> <p>Family planning is widely acknowledged as an important intervention towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) three (3) as it has proven to reduce maternal and child mortality. Family planning can prevent unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions. Some family planning methods such as condom usage can protect individuals from Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) including HIV/AIDS. Family planning has also been found to promote gender equality as well as promote educational and economic empowerment for women. Despite the enormous benefits of family planning services, the uptake of the service still remains low in Sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria (Eliason, et al., 2013).</p> <p>Furthermore, Eliason said that although most people are aware of the benefits of family planning services, they complained that it was difficult to access family planning services as such services were provided by health facilities that were far from their homes. In addition, religious inclination has been noted to be a major constrain to the uptake of family planning services in Africa. Also, some individuals perceived that family planning services were meant for only married couples whilst others fear that they will become sexually promiscuous if they go for family planning services once they cannot become pregnant (Cates, et al., 2010). It has been observed that a large number of women have an unmet need for family planning as the acceptor rate for family planning services remains low. It is on this note thatscholars like Haffner, etal., (2010) argue that the lives of mothers and children will be improved and maternal mortality reduced if family planning acceptor rate is improved.</p> <p>However, according to World Health Organization, (2016) family planning is the practice that allows individuals and couples to anticipate and attain their desired number of children and the spacing and timing of their births. It is achieved through use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of involuntary infertility. A woman’s ability to space and limit her pregnancies has a direct impact on her health and well-being as well as on the outcome of each pregnancy (WHO, 2016). Therefore, family planning services are defined as educational, comprehensive medical or social activities which enable individuals, including minors, to determine freely the number and spacing of their children and to select the means by which this may be achieved (Burke, 2010).</p> <p>Family planning is a wide-reachingoccurrence. The promotion of development and improvement of quality of life require co-ordination of action in all major socio-economic fields including that of population, which happens to be the inexhaustible source of creativity and a determining factor of progress. At the international level a number of strategies and programmes whose explicit aim is to affect variables in fields other than population have already been formulated. In many developing countries, attempts to improve the socio-economic conditions of the population are seriously hindered by the rate of population growth. This is true of both urban and rural areas where population growth is simply above the ordinary (WHO, 2015).</p> <p>However, making the rural issues concerning family planning more understanding, Etukudo, (2014) opined that in rural areas of AkwaIbom State where there is a high desire for large family size by couples and lack of communication activities and behavior inventions to increase knowledge and use of family planning, lack of access to family planning services can be a barrier to women’s use of family planning services. Besides that, Etukudo further said that, large number of Nigerian women including some of those in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State do not see the need of family planning. And that a good number of them see family planning as a taboo which is against their culture and many refer to religion to support their argument and disapproval of family planning (Etukudo, 2014). Similarly, Akpan, et al., (2011) in addition said that, a critical look at the issue reveals that ignorant peasant women living in NsitIbom and other communities in Nigeria want to have large families. Hence, there is evidence that women are prepared to have fewer children and adopt family planning if they are provided with adequate information, service and supplies (Akpan et al, 2011). Etukudo, (2014) concluded that urban women are more than twice as likely as rural women to use a method of contraception (20 percent versus 9 percent). Majority of the women hardly gave birth in hospitals and depended on their husbands to decide what ever method will be used to space or limit the number of children they will have. This notwithstanding, there still exist a great challenge of unmet needs regarding family planning especially in the rural part of AkwaIbom State like NisitIbom as the desired attitudinal and behavioral changes towards family planning is yet to be achieved (Etukudo, 2014).</p> <p>    Theoretical framework</p> <p>For the purpose of this study, one theory has been selected as guide.</p> <p>1.2.2  Health Belief Model (Theory)</p> <p>Health Belief Model is a theory that was proposed by social psychologists Hochbaum, Rosenstock and Kegels in the 1950. The theory uses constructs that represent perceived threats and net benefits such as perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action and self-efficacy. The model asserts that these constructs account for a person’s “readiness to act” (Rosenstock, et al., 1988). According to the Rosenstock and colleagues explanations, the health belief model (HBM) is a cognitive, interpersonal framework that views humans as rational beings who use a multidimensional approach to decision-making regarding whether to perform a health behavior. However, the model is appropriate for complex preventive and sick-role health behaviors such as contraceptive behavior and other family planning methods as barriers against unwanted pregnancy. Its dimensions are derived from an established body of social psychology theory that relies heavily on cognitive factors oriented towards goal attainment (i.e. motivation to prevent pregnancy). Its constructs emphasize modifiable factors, rather than fixed variables, which enable feasible interventions to reduce public health problems (i.e. unintended pregnancy, spacing and limiting the number of children).</p> <p>Rosenstock and other scholars further brought to light that with the application of health belief model,factors affecting family planning services would be wisely fought against. They also put it clear that the reason for the combatis that family planning is a dynamic and complex set of services, programs and behaviors towards regulating the number and spacing of children within a family. For that reason, they maintained that contraceptive behavior is one form of family planning which refers to activities involved in the process of identifying and using a contraceptive method to prevent pregnancy and can include specific actions such as contraceptive initiation (to begin using a contraceptive method), continuation or discontinuation (to maintain or stop use of a contraceptive method), misuse (interrupted, omitted or mistimed use of a contraceptive method), nonuse, and more broadly compliance and adherence (general terms often used to denote any or all of the former contraceptive behavior terms).</p> <p>In a more sense, these scholars depicted that contraceptive behavior, viewed through the HBM, is motivated by an individual’s: desire to avoid pregnancy and value placed on not becoming pregnant; nonspecific, stable differences in pregnancy motivations and childbearing desires; and perceived ability to control fertility and reduce the threat of pregnancy by using contraception amongst other safe methods.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Previous and recent study findings (Etukudo, 2014) have consistently revealed that fertility level is uncontrollably high in the rural areas of AkwaIbom State because women continue to give birth to many children as their spouses demand, under conditions of unabated poverty, poor feeding and nutrition, and some other complications. The reasons for the demand for large number of children in these areas are not different from those in other societies and include the need for ‘lineage elongation, security at old age, social obligation, among others’ (Akpan, et. al., 2011). Worst still, past family planning programs in Nigeria have been mainly directed toward women (Etukudo, 2014). However, actions to change the perception and attitude of people regarding family planning in AkwaIbom State have been media based and concentrated much in the urban areas. The rural people have little or no time under their conditions of severe poverty to listen to news or watch television, talk less of reading newspapers. In many of the Health Centers, Health Posts, and Dispensaries located in the rural communities there is insufficient health workers (the community health workers) whose specialized duty include to counsel mothers, child mothers, and would-be mothers on family planning, management of pregnancy, and other motherhood issues. On the other hand, the nurses working in these communities are constrained in three areas: their lackadaisical attitude to work and to some cases reported especially by the child mothers, the refusal of some women to attain family planning training and counseling at centers nearby to their homes, and the refusal of most women to accept and use contraceptives as are prescribed. Besides, most people still believe large number of children is equivalent to large economic power.</p> <p><strong>  1.3  Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>The general purpose of the study is to find out the factors affecting family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>Specifically, the objectives of this study were to:</p> <p>    examine how educational background affects family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>    examine how culture affects family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>    determinehow religion affects family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>    determine how economic status affects family planning among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>    How does educational background affect family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbomState?</p> <p>    To what extent does culture affects family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State?</p> <p>    How does religion affect family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbomState?</p> <p>    How does economic status affect family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbomState?</p> <p>        Statement of hypotheses</p> <p>The following null hypotheses were formulated to guide the study.</p> <p>    Educational background of rural women does not have any significant effect on family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>    Culture of rural women does not have any significant effect on family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State</p> <p>    Religion of rural women does not have any significant effect on family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State</p> <p>    Economic status of rural women does not have any significant effect on family planning services among rural women in NsitIbom Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State</p> <p><br/><br/></p> <p><strong> 1.5 Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>Although many scholars have written on the effect of family planning practices in Nigeria, it is significant to notes however that family planning can prevent unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions and family planning does not mean abortion. Therefore this study is basically for rural women. Hence the study hopefully is significant to the extent that the above specify persons should be able; to know what family planning is all about, to understand the important, benefits of family planning practices, to know some factors that could affect the practice of family planning, such as religion and cultural belief and also to understand that some family planning methods such as condom usage can protect individuals from Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) including HIV/AIDS at the end of the study.</p> <p>Health workers may also find this study useful because they will be prepared to attend to people who will need their assistance of family planning.

Anemia is the most common nutritional problem among women and is on the wholerampant among pregnant women (Admad, Saeid, &amp; Leila, 2008).However, anaemia is defined as a shortened amount of haemoglobin (Hb) in the blood. It is a shortage in the size or number of red blood cells (RBCs) or the quantity of Hb they contain (Mahan, Escott-Stump &amp; Raymond 2012). Haemoglobin is a substance in the blood that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. The most common type of anaemia, iron deficiency anaemia, is more often than not caused by low iron intake or absorption and/or excessive iron loss (Thomas &amp; Bishop, 2007).</p> <p>Iron forms an indispensableconstituent of the Hb molecule and nutritional anaemiafallout fromnot enough intake of iron, protein, vitamin B12, folic acid, pyridoxine, ascorbic acid, and copper(Mahan, Escott-Stump &amp; Raymond, 2012).Anaemia is classified based on Hb content as hypochromic (pale colour from deficiency of Hb) and normochromic (normal colour),depicted according to cell size as macrocytic (larger than normal), normocytic (normal), and microcytic (small).Haemoglobin levels differ with age, sex, pregnancy, and lifestyle. Different levels of Hb are considered typically for different categories of people, under which an individual can be classified as anaemic. For example, the normal Hb level of pregnant women at sea level is 11g/dl or 110g/L. A pregnant woman that hasHb level below 11g/dl or 110g/L is said to be anaemic (WHO, 2008).</p> <p>According to Ghana Health Service (2004), pregnant woman with anaemia will present with any of the following: angular stomatitis, pallor, glossitis spoon shaped nails, dizziness, fatigue and shortness of breath.Reducing this anaemia burden in pregnant women has improved minimally, especially in African countries and Nigeria is no exemption.The episode of anemia as a major public health problem all over the world isextensively recognized. In developing countries, the occurrence of anemia among pregnant women the averages is 56%, ranging between 35-100% among different regions of the world (GHS Annual Report 2004).</p> <p>World Health Organization in 2008 estimation, approximately 500 million women in the world are iron deficient and in addition anemia affects so many women in the developing world, including two thirds of pregnant women (WHO, 2008).Anaemia is asignificant public health problem worldwide and the most susceptible group, are pregnant women and children.The causes of anaemiaconsist of genetic factors, nutritional deficiencies, and infectious agents. Of the nutritional causes of anaemia, iron deficiency is perhaps the most common and important because the physiological changes associated with pregnancy put fortha demand for additional iron needed for transfer to the foetus(Webster-Gandy, Madden&amp;Holdsworth, 2012). Infections, together with malaria, worm infestations are as well involved in the pathogenesis of anaemia in pregnancy.</p> <p>Pregnant women are on the wholevulnerable to malaria in endemic populations and often have higher prevalence as well as severity including anaemia (Amenger-Glover, Owusu&amp;Akanmori, 2005). The changes in the immune system linkedwith pregnancy have been postulated as the reason mentioned above. Worm infestations however impair micronutrient absorption;consequently increasing the susceptibility of pregnant women to anaemia. The materialization of HIV is an additional risk factor for anaemia among pregnant women. A good number of studies aimed at identifying the causes ofanaemia in pregnancy have concentrated on specific categories of factors such as excessive blood loss and excessive breakdown of erythrocytes (Amenger-Glover, Owusu&amp;Akanmori, 2005).Globally, anemia contributes to 20% of all maternal deaths. Although not always shown to have a causal link, severe anemia contributes to maternal morbidity and mortality. Anemia in pregnancy may moreover lead to premature births, low birth weight, fetal impairment and infant deaths. Besides, maternity-related complications, anemia has major consequences on human health and social and economic development. It adversely affects physical and cognitive development in children and is associated with increased frailty risk in community-dwelling older adults (WHO, 2008).</p> <p>In recent times, increased risk of psychiatric disorders among children and adolescents with iron deficiency anemia has also been documented. Anaemiaarrays from mild, moderate to severe and WHOhangers the haemoglobin level for each of these types of anaemia in pregnancy at 10.0 – 10.9g/d1 (mild anaemia) 7 – 9.9g/dl (moderate anemia) and &lt; 7g/dl (severe anaemia).Commonness of anaemia can be as high as 61% in developing countries; 14 with a high incidence and severity occurring among primigravidaeliving in malaria endemic areas. In pregnancy, anaemia has animportant impact on the health of the foetus as well as that of the mother. Twenty percent (20%) of maternal deaths in Africa have been attributed to anaemiaand over half of all women in the world experience anemia during their pregnancies.Foetuses are susceptible of preterm deliveries, low birth weights, morbidity and perinatal mortality due to the impairment of oxygen delivery to placenta and foetus(Amenger-Glover et al, 2005).</p> <p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, the causes of anemia during pregnancy are multifactorial. These consist of an iron and folate deficient diet and infections such as malaria, hookworms, and increasingly human immunodeficiency virus. Most of these conditions can be prevented by creating awareness and providing affordable interventions.Determination of the magnitude of anemia among pregnant women helps to monitor health of the pregnant women, contributing to reduction in maternal morbidity and mortality. Also, assessment of factors predisposing to anemia in a local area enables to take targeted intervention activities. The management and control of anaemia in pregnancy is improved by the availability of local prevalence statistics, which is conversely not adequately provided in Nigeria. For that reason, this study aims at providing occurrence statistics of anaemia in pregnancy and to evaluate the effectiveness of antenatal care and awareness level in preventing anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan. Knowledge of the relative importance of the diverse etiological factors forms the basis for intervention strategies to control anemia. Therefore, this study also aimed at determining anemia and assessing associated risk factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) at Primary Health Center NungUdoe.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Theoretical framework</strong></p> <p>In effect social cognitive models propose that determinants that shape human behavior are imparted through socialization and may be disposed, vulnerable and susceptible to change. While appraising the literature, two theories were found to offer a strong theoretical framework for this research namely: the social cognitive theory (SCT) and the Health Belief Model (HBM).</p> <p>1.2.1    Social cognitive theory</p> <p>The Social Cognitive Theory stems from the Social Learning Theory and was suggested by Alfred Bandura in 1986. The pregnant women knowledge, attitude, beliefs, care and control, role model, willingness to change, were identified as malleable factors in order to influence the dietary habits, and adherence to Iron Folic-Acid (IFA) supplements. The design of the intervention is guided by the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). According to the SCT, at least two principal sources of self-efficacy; verbal persuasion and performance accomplishment are intended to mediate the effect of this intervention. The education of pregnant women about anemia, nutrition, and Iron Folic-Acid (IFA) supplementationcould foster the perception that their actions can control anemia in them (Bandura, 1989).</p> <p>1.2.2    Health Belief Model</p> <p>Health Belief Model was first developed in the 1950s by social psychologists Hochbaum, Rosenstock and Kegels. The model uses constructs that represent perceived threats and net benefits such as perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action and self-efficacy. The model asserts that these constructs account for aperson’s “readiness to act” (Rosenstock, 1988). The most important role is figured in teaching and providing pregnant women with information needed based on social and psychological behavioral changes to maintain health during pregnancy mainly those related to nutritional aspects.  Using health belief model during health education session nurses emphasize on behavioral changes to assist pregnant women to change their eating habits and practices that contribute to nutritional deficit(Bandura, 1989).</p> <p><strong>1.3       Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>This study was to determine awareness level on knowledge regarding anaemiaand its prevention among pregnant women attending Antenatal Clinic at Primary Health Center NungUdoe inIbesikpoAsutan.However, anaemia is the foremost cause of maternal mortality since it is very common among pregnant women.It is well thought-out to be high in countries with prevalence greater than 40% (WHO, 2008).In lots of African countries including Nigeria, chronic protein energy malnutrition,and poor weight gain during pregnancy, anaemia, and other hidden hunger deficiencies are common among women (Huffman, Harvey, Martin, Piwoz, Ndure, Combest, Mwadime&amp; Quinn, 2001). Despite this, few studies have assessed the possible causes of anaemia among pregnant women in Nigeria. In order to reduce this trend, it is necessary to determine possible causes of anaemia, especially due to nutrition, inIbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.Iron deficiency is the most frequent nutritional disorder in the world. It occurs when the amount of iron absorbed in the body is inadequate to meet its necessities, and if lingering, results in iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). It is anticipated that about1.3 billion people suffer from anaemia, of which most is due to iron deficiency. Iron deficiency anaemia is amajor cause of morbidity and mortality. This situation persists although the interventions necessary for prevention and treatment are available, effective and inexpensive (Bhanushali, Shirode, Joshi, and Kadam, 2011)</p> <p><strong>1.4       Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>The general purpose of the study is to determine the level of awareness on the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>Specifically, the study will:</p> <p>    Establish the influence of educational qualification of pregnant women on prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>    Determine the influence of age of pregnant women on the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan</p> <p>    Find out the influence of nutritional status of pregnant women on the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in ibesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>    Identify the influence of the attitude of pregnant women on the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>    Determine the influence of economic status of pregnant women on the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p><strong>1.5       Research questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>    To what extent does the educational qualification of pregnant women influence the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State?</p> <p>    Would age of pregnant women influence the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State?</p> <p>    To what extent does the nutritional status of pregnant women influence the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State?</p> <p>    Would attitude of pregnant women influence the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State?</p> <p>    To what extent does the economic status of pregnant women influence the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State?</p> <p><strong>1.6       Statement of hypotheses</strong></p> <p>To guide the researcher, the following research hypotheses were formulated:</p> <p>    Educational qualification of pregnant women would not have any significant influence on the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>    Nutritional status of pregnant women would not have any significant influence on the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p>    Attitude of pregnant women would not have any significant influence on the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State.</p> <p><strong>1.7  Significance of study</strong></p> <p>Although many scholars have written on the prevalence of anaemia in Nigeria, it is significant to note however that micronutrient deficiencies lead to anaemia in pregnancy. Therefore this study is basically for pregnant women, expectant mothers and women who are ready for marriage. Hence the study hopefully is significant to the extent that the above specify persons should be able; to know what causes anaemia, to understand the important, benefits of enough nutrients and enhanced their nutrition, to understand the efficacy of micronutrients,to know some other factors that could lead to anaemia in pregnancy, such as poor weight gain and to understand the double jeopardy of anaemic condition at the end of the study.</p> <p>The health workers will make use of this study in updating their knowledge about anaemia in pregnancy, so as to be able to make proper assessment, diagnosis, planning and implementation of modalities geared towards competent management of cases in order to reduce the incidence of anaemia among pregnant women.Findings from this study will hopefully be useful in providing appropriate preventive measures to reduce the maternal mortality of which anaemia is one of the leading causes.It is believed that the proposition from this study will help the pregnant women have more knowledge on what anaemia is all about.As a final point, it possibly would serve as a work of reference to future researchers in that area.</p> <p><strong>1.8       Assumptions of the study</strong></p> <p>The study assumes that:</p> <p>    The pregnant women have some knowledge regarding Anaemia and its prevention.</p> <p>    The result of the study will help to prevent the Anaemia among the pregnant women.</p> <p><strong>  1.9       Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>The study is delimited to the pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State. The major concentration of our consideration is the question of what causes anaemia in pregnancy. To do this effectively, a critical appraisal of the various variables supporting the research work will be done pointing out their contributions to the cause of anaemia in pregnancy. Since this research is aimed at determining the level of awareness on the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women in IbesikpoAsutan Local Government Area of AkwaIbom State, thoughtfulness will be paid to the several preventive measures against the occurrence of anaemia in pregnancy.</p> <p><strong>    1.10  Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p>            The challenges that posed a threat to this study include the following; fund to be able to assess materials even online and equally type the work, collections and retrieval of documents from health centers archives, and even those of hospitals and attitudes turned to be huge obstacles and time constraints due to other academic pressure.

The primary source of data used for the purpose of this research was the questionnaires for the primary data. Which the secondary data was obtained from journals and other related articles. The method of chi-square was used for the purpose of analysis. The hypothesis to be tested was the effect of crises in carrying out humanitarian aid in Nigeria. At the end of the analysis we found that the p-value was 0.00 which is less than the level of significance so we reject the hypothesis and conclude that crises have significant effect in carrying out humanitarian aid in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong> CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Crises in so many regions of Nigeria have really caused so many set back in recent times. There are some states in Nigeria that even the indigenes find it difficult to settle down; most of them move out of their own state to another state just to find peace.</p> <p>By this time early last year, in Benue state of Nigeria, there was a dispute between the Tiv tribes and the Fulani in gboko local government area.</p> <p>This fiasco was on for a very long period of time. Indigenes of gboko; running out of their own village to another local government area just to find peace.</p> <p>Questions were ask as regard the ongoing crises, so many responses were given by the people in gboko area.</p> <p>It was heard from a reliable source that the Fulani herd’s men were fighting over a land; claim was that the land was given to them to graze on for at least 7 years.</p> <p>The elders of gboko local government area claimed that there was no record of any agreement what so ever given to them neither by the state government nor the local government as regard the purpose. The fulami herd’s men reacted to being cheated by Benue state.</p> <p>They ask the elders to return their money, but all to no avail. The killings continued; when the state government came to settle the crises, it became war on the government.</p> <p>Nigeria has really suffered so many crises in recent years; is it terrorist attack by book haram? Or is it just crises? All these happening will definitely affect some of the organizations in carrying out humanitarian aids especially in most of these areas of crises; some might end up being killed or kidnapped.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS CONFRONTING INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION IN CARRYING OUT HUMANITARIAN AID<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS CONFRONTING INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION IN CARRYING OUT HUMANITARIAN AID", "id": 60}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/> Using the 2002/03 Uganda National Household Survey data we empirically examine the nature and determinants of individuals’ decision to seek care on condition of illness reporting. The major findings include: cost of care is regressive and sustainability reduces the health care utilization for any formal provider by the poorer individuals afters controlling for other factors. In other words, even among public facilities cost of care remains a barrier to utilization of these services. Second, there is no doubt that putting in place strategies aimed at increasing the income of the poor will increase their utilization of the health facilities, though the impact will be higher for private care. Third, besides income and cost and cost of care, other factors in particular qualify of services, education and physical access  proxied by distance to the facilities are important determinants of health care utilization. Four, as much as it is important for the government to improve provision of services in the public facilities, incentives should be put in place to encourage and strengthen the role of the private sector. At the same time there is need, to put in place a regulatory system, set standards and a monitoring framework to ensure quality of services and control prices in the private sector especially in the private for profit sub-sector. Clearly there is an increasing preference for the sector’s services even after the abolition of cost sharing.</p>\n\nDEMAND FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN NIGERIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR POVERTY REDUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DEMAND FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN NIGERIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR POVERTY REDUCTION", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/></p> <p>People in poor countries tend to have less access to health services than those in better-off countries, and within countries, the poor have less access to health services. This article documents disparities in access to health services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), using a framework incorporating quality, geographic accessibility, availability, financial accessibility, and acceptability of services. Whereas the poor in LMICs are consistently at a disadvantage in each of the dimensions of access and their determinants, this need not be the case. Many different approaches are shown to improve access to the poor, using targeted or universal approaches, engaging government, nongovernmental, or commercial organizations, and pursuing a wide variety of strategies to finance and organize services. Key ingredients of success include concerted efforts to reach the poor, engaging communities and disadvantaged people, encouraging local adaptation and careful monitoring of effects on the poor. Yet governments in LMICs rarely focus on the poor in their policies or the implementation or monitoring of health service strategies. There are also new innovations in financing, delivery, and regulation of health services that hold promise for improving access to the poor, such as the use of health equity funds, conditional cash transfers, and coproduction and regulation of health services. The challenge remains to find ways to ensure that vulnerable populations have a say in how strategies are developed, implemented, and accounted for in ways that demonstrate improvements in access by the poor.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF POVERTY AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF POVERTY AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> ABSTRACT </p> <p> Pregnancy duration and choice of care for maternal health are crucial primary health issues that the World Health Organization (WHO) keeps constant in the campaign for all round healthcare delivery for mother and child. To be sure, there is consensus on the need for optimal care for the mother and baby; this is believed to enhance the mother and child social development and biological growth and to reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity which are prevalent in Nigeria and other Sub-Saharan Africa countries. The study thus, investigates challenges being faced by the mothers, which are sometime inconsistent to their socio-economic pursuits, growth and maternal well being. Other objectives include understanding of inhibitions and determinants to pregnant healthcare consumptions contribution in terms of culture, income, occupation etc. Methodologically, sample size of 152 respondents was selected for interview through purposeful random sampling among the pregnant and nursing mothers between the age of 15 to 49 years in Ijebu- Yoruba south western Nigeria involving mixed urban (i.e. informal and informal sectors) and the rural societies. The methods of data collection were survey method and in-depth (IDI) interviews. 10 in-depth interviews for mothers, fathers, health givers and opinions leaders were conducted. The data were analyzed through simple statistical method and content analysis for IDI. Data revealed strong significant but inverse relationship between the socio-cultural factors and choice of health care also incongruous relationship between the pregnant woman and nursing mother‘s residence and healthcare consumption. The results amongst other things saw culture of patriarch , income ,occupation and where one reside acting as determinants for when commences care and the choice of healthcare centre. The ethnographic result also confirmed this much that men are the key to their wives choice of care during pregnancy this is because majority of them still pay the medical bill. It is therefore suggested that government, international agencies and concerned nongovernmental organization (NGOs) should intensify effort to open up rural and mixed urban settlements to Human Development Amenities (HDA) and bring about a strong intervention to bring about adequate maternal healthcare delivery.</p>\n\nPREGNANCY DURATION AND CHOICE OF ANTE-NATAL AND DELIVERY CARE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREGNANCY DURATION AND CHOICE OF ANTE-NATAL AND DELIVERY CARE", "id": 63}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </p> <p>Approximately 1000 women die each day worldwide from pregnancy related causes, 99% of them in developing countries and more than 50% in sub-Saharan Africa  with most deaths concentrated around the time of delivery. An estimated 2.65 million stillbirths occurred in 2008 worldwide  while 3 million new-borns do not survive the first month of life worldwide annually . Skilled assistance during childbirth, readily accessible appropriate care in case of complications and effective postnatal care within the first 24 hours of delivery are strategies that can improve perinatal outcomes for mothers and babies. A key strategy to reducing maternal and neonatal deaths is the ‘health-centre intrapartum care strategy’, where qualified skilled workers manage labour, effectively manage complications and are supported with effective referral systems for specialised care when needed, and an effective postnatal care package.</p> <p>A significant proportion of mothers in developing countries still deliver at home unattended by skilled health workers. In diverse contexts, individual factors including maternal age, parity, education and marital status, household factors including family size, household wealth, and community factors including socioeconomic status, community health infrastructure, region, rural/urban residence, available health facilities, and distance to health facilities determine place of delivery and these factors interact in diverse ways in each context to determine place of delivery]. Eijk et al. looked at antenatal care and delivery care among women in Western Kenya and demonstrated that older women, high parity, lower socioeconomic status, low education levels and more than an hour walking distance were associated with delivery outside health facilities. Studying poor urban dwellers in Nairobi, Fosto et al. found from bivariate analyses that wealth, education, parity, place of residence were associated with place of delivery. Ochako has previously demonstrated that these factors together with marital status and age at birth of last child determined use and timing of first Antenatal Care (ANC) visit and type of delivery. There are also wide variations in the reasons women give for delivering at home between and within countries . For Kenya, recent studies looking at the degree of effect of such factors are lacking.</p> <p>In Kenya, maternal mortality rate has not reduced over recent years, and may even have increased from an estimated 380/100000 live births in 1990 to 530/100000 live births in 2008 . Although a number of factors may have contributed to this, including improved identification of maternal deaths, health facility delivery remained low at 44% and 42.6% in the early 1990s and in 2008 respectively [18, 19]. Recent evidence on determinants of place of delivery in Kenyan utilising a nationally representative data and controlling for all factors is lacking, yet understanding the influences on place of delivery in Kenya is crucial to identifying key priority areas for policy and practise to increase the prevalence of skilled assisted deliveries.</p> <p>We have used data from the 2008/2009 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) and linked them with a 2008 Kenyan Health Facility Database, that provides Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates for distance analysis, to describe the factors that influence where women deliver in Kenya, and the reasons that women give for delivering at home.</p>\n\nFACTORS INFLUENCING WOMEN’S CHOICE OF PLACE OF DELIVERY IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS INFLUENCING WOMEN’S CHOICE OF PLACE OF DELIVERY IN NIGERIA", "id": 64}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><br/> The goal of primary health care (PHC) was to provide accessible health for all by the year 2000 and beyond. Unfortunately, this is yet to be achieved in Nigeria and seems to be unrealistic in the next decade. The PHC<br/> aims at providing people of the world with the basic health services. Though PHC centers were established in both rural and urban areas in Nigeria with the intention of equity and easy access, regrettably, the rural populations<br/> in Nigeria are seriously underserved when compared with their urban counterparts. About two-thirds of Nigerians<br/> reside in rural (http.//www.fao.org/countryprofiles/index.asp) areas therefore they deserve to be served with<br/> all the components of PHC.</p> <p>Quality health is a fundamental right of all Nigerian citizens. While primary health care (PHC) centers are relatively uniformly distributed throughout local government areas (LGAs) in Nigeria, the rural people tend to underuse the basic health services. This article examines some  cross cutting issues in PHC and outlines strategies to enhance the utilization of health services by rural people. The responsibility for perpetuating the existing low use of PHC services should be held by PHC policy makers and LGA. Responsible health personnel can build a new  social order, based on greater equity and human dignity, in which health for all by the year 2015, including that of rural populations, will no<br/> more be a dream but a reality. Capacity building and empowerment of communities through orientation,<br/> mobilization and community organization as regards training, information sharing and continuous dialogue, could further enhance the utilization of PHC services by rural populations.</p>\n\nPRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN NIGERIA: CRITICAL ISSUES AND STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCING THE USE BY THE RURAL COMMUNITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN NIGERIA: CRITICAL ISSUES AND STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCING THE USE BY THE RURAL COMMUNITIES", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/></strong></p> <p>Landfills create a clear and obvious threat to human health as well as a threat to our environment from the hazardous contaminated air emissions emitted from the landfill biodegradation. There are over ten toxic gases released from landfills, of the most serious of which is methane. Methane gas is naturally produced during the process of decay of organic matter. As methane gas is formed, it builds up pressure and then begins to move through the soil. In a recent study of 288 landfills, off-site migration of gases, including methane, has been detected at 83% of these landfill sites. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.</p> <p> Studies have shown significantly reduced height among children who live near Love Canal, the chemical waste dump near Niagara Falls, NY. It has also been shown that people living close to landfills suffer from lung and heart diseases from the toxic gasses that are released from the landfill degradation.</p> <p> The key environmental problem we face as a result of landfills is groundwater pollution from leachates (the liquid that drains or ‘leaches’ from a landfill). Although they intended to protect human beings from toxins, due to natural deterioration the protective barriers only delay the inevitable. When a new municipal landfill is proposed, advocates of the project always emphasize that “no hazardous wastes will enter the landfill”. However several studies have shown that even though municipal landfills may not legally receive “hazardous” wastes, the leachate they produce is as dangerous as leachate from hazardous waste landfills.</p> <p> The major issue caused with landfill leachates is the leakage of a large number of toxins into fresh water waterways, which ultimately end up in our homes as drinking water or water for everyday use. Since landfills are most often located in and around large bodies of fresh water or in swamps, the pollution often goes undetected. The compounds submerge to the ground, to the ground water, and inevitably to our dinner tables. The pollution is also severely harmful to animal and plant life.</p> <p> Groundwater contamination may result from leakage of very small amounts of leachate. TCE is a carcinogen typically found in landfill leachate. It would take less than 4 drops of TCE mixed with the water in an average swimming pool (20,000 gallons) to render the water undrinkable. Some surveys conducted have shown that 82% of the landfills have leaks and up to 41% of the landfills had a leak area of more than one square foot. EPA sponsored research shows that burying household garbage in the ground poisoned the ground water. The EPA has stressed that, even with the double liner landfills, the probability of leaking is very high.</p> <p> As the number of landfills increase the likelihood of leaks increases five-fold. The increase in trash is due to population growth and consumerism. United States population growth is equivalent or marginally lower than most middle to low-middle income developing countries but the American rate of consumption is far greater than any other developed or developing country today. The amount of waste collected in an average American house hold is far greater than that of any developed or developing country in the world today.</p>\n\nMETHANE EMISSIONS FROM LANDFILLS: PROBLEMS AND SOLUTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " METHANE EMISSIONS FROM LANDFILLS: PROBLEMS AND SOLUTION", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER </strong><strong>ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The impact of smoking and tobacco use on health cannot be over emphasized. Cigarette smoking remains a gigantic public health problem and is still regarded as one of the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide (Can, Topbas, Ozuna, Ozgun, Can &amp; Yavuzyilmaz, 2009; Mpabulungi &amp; Muula, 2004; Salawu, Danburam, Desalu, Olokoba, Agbo &amp; Midala, 2009; World health Organisation, 2015). It is well-known that many smokers start before the age of 18 years, however, it is of great interest to know that the increasing trend in smoking prevalence amongst youths and the likelihood that many of these young people who begin to smoke at an early age, will continue to do so throughout adulthood (Adebiyi, Faseru, Sangowawa &amp; Owoaje, 2010).</p> <p>Although tobacco use has declined in many high income countries such as the United States and United Kingdom, it is increasing in many low and middle income countries (Boutayeb &amp; Boutayeb, 2005; Warren, Jones, Eriksen &amp; Asma, 2006) and in current situation, tobacco smoking is by far the most popular form of smoking and is practiced by over one billion people in the majority of all human societies (Akinpelu, 2015). Tobacco is the most common hazardous substance and this is aided by its legally availability, heavy promotion and wide consumption and has been revealed to be problematic including other forms of use other than cigarettes, which is on the rise among adolescents in many countries, and is likely to jeopardize progress in reducing chronic diseases and tobacco-related mortality (CDC, 2010; Warren <em>et al., </em>2006).  </p> <p>The constant increase in the consumption of tobacco among adolescents is emerging as a complex and multidimensional problem (Soni &amp; Raut, 2012). Melgosa (2006) rightly considers tobacco as a drug with the lowest risk, in the short term but one which takes away health and life from the greatest number of people in the long term.</p> <p>Cigarette smoking is said to be responsible for over 25 diseases in humans some of which include: ischemic heart disease, chronic bronchitis and cancers of the lung, oral cavity, urinary bladder, pancreas, and larynx (Desalu, Olokoba, Danburam, Salawu &amp; Issa, 2008). Over the past four decades, tobacco use has caused an estimated 12 million deaths in the world, including 4.1 million deaths from cancer, 5.5 million deaths from cardiovascular diseases, 2.1 million deaths from respiratory diseases and 94,000 infant deaths related to mothers smoking during pregnancy (WHO, 2009; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002; Ekrakene &amp; Igeleke, 2010) and on average cigarette smokers lose about 15 years of their life (The global tobacco survey collaborative group, 2002; Raji, Abubakar, Oche &amp; Kaoje, 2013).</p> <p>It is estimated that number of deaths due to tobacco will increase from 3 million per year worldwide to 70 million per year by 2025 (Reddy &amp; Arora, 2005; US Department of Health and Human Services, 2012). It has been said that adolescents are especially vulnerable to these effects and may be more likely than adults to develop an addiction to tobacco (Chakraborty, 2009). In addition, it has been predicted that if the pattern currently seen among youth continues, a lifetime of tobacco use would result in the deaths of 250 million children and young people alive today, most of them in developing countries (WHO, 2012).</p> <p>Like other developing countries, the most susceptible age for initiating tobacco has been found between the ages of 15-24 years as evident in the study by Gboyega, Adesegun and Chikezie (2013) identifying youths as a major group involved in smoking over the last two decades, an age group where most are expected to be in school. Educational attainment is widely regarded as an important health risk factor because of how strongly it has been associated with health outcomes, health-related behaviors, and other risk factors (National Center for Health Statistics, 1999). For the past 30 years, smoking prevention programmes have been focused almost exclusively upon youth, mainly within the school setting (Backinger, 2003; Ekanem, 2008; Salawu, Danburam &amp; Isa, 2010; Fawibe &amp; Shittu, 2011; Hammond, 2005; Nwafor, Ibe &amp; Aguwa, 2012; Odukoya, Odeyemi &amp; Oyeyemi, 2013; Okagua, Opara &amp; Alex-Hart, 2015) despite School dropouts being more likely to smoke heavily than students (Aloise-Young, Cruickshank &amp; Chavez, 2002). In Nigeria, the prevalence of tobacco use among youth tends to be higher than among adults (Odukoya, Odeyemi, Oyeyemi &amp; Updhyay, 2013).</p> <p><strong>1.2  </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem </strong></p> <p>Smoking among youths has been on an increase worldwide (Pomara, Cassano, D’Errico, Bello, Romano &amp; Riezzo et <em>al</em>, 2012) with values ranging from 721 million in 1980 to 967 million in 2012 (Marie, 2013). Studies have revealed that there has been a high increase in the prevalence rate of smoking among youth in sub-Saharan Africa <strong>(Shafey, Dolwick &amp; Guindon, 2012)</strong> and Nigeria precisely (Drope, 2011; Yahya, Hammangabdo &amp; Omotara, 2010), with statistics showing that youths form over 40% of the Nigerian population and 18% of the youths smoke, identifying youths as a major group involved in smoking over the last two decades (Gboyega, Adesegun &amp; Chikezie, 2013).</p> <p>Smokers’ low perception of the negative effects of their smoking behavior on their health also results in many of them being unwilling to quit smoking with most of them  expressing a sense of invincibility to the hazards of smoking (Fawibe &amp; Shittu, 2011). Studies have shown that individuals who perceive fewer risks and greater benefits of smoking are more susceptible to initiation (Song, Morrell, Cornell, Ramos, Biehl, Kropp &amp; Halpern-Felsher, 2009). Literatures have shown that perceptions about health risks influence cigarette smoking among youths (Aryal, Petzold &amp; Krettek, 2013; Mantler, 2013). Further studies have also shown that each day, more than 3,200 people under 18 smoke their first cigarette, and approximately 2,100 youth and young adults become daily smokers.</p> <p>Furthermore, studies have indicated that as at 2012 it was noted that death as a result of non-communicable diseases (respiratory tract infection inclusive), accounted for 2.7 million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa with the inclusion of Nigeria as a result of smoking (WHO, 2000-2012). Also literature has shown that nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancers are caused by smoking and smokers today are much more likely to develop lung cancer than smokers were in 1964 (Siegel, Miller, Jemal, 2016). In Nigeria and worldwide smoking causes many types of cancer, including cancers of the throat, mouth, nasal cavity, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and cervix, as well as acute myeloid leukemia (Jha, Ramasundarahettige &amp; Landsman, 2013). Also studies still shows that 8 out of 10 COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) deaths are a result of smoking and currently, there is no cure for COPD (Madu, Matla, 2014).</p> <p>In spite of the passage of the National Tobacco Control Bill by the National Assembly in Nigeria, a bill aimed at domesticating WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) to avert the unimaginable disaster associated with smoking many youth are still caught in the web of the act, thereby endangering their lives. It will therefore be of immense benefit to investigate patterns of smoking and health risk perception of out-of-school youths in selected motor parks in Oshodi local government area of Lagos state, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The general objective for this study is to assess the pattern of smoking among out-of-school youth and their health risk perception.</p> <p>The specific objectives are to:</p> <p>1.      measure the level of smoking prevalence among respondents;</p> <p>2.      assess the pattern of smoking among respondents and</p> <p>3.      determine if respondents have a good health risk perception of smoking.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.      At what level is the prevalence of smoking among respondents?</p> <p>2.      What is the pattern of smoking among respondents?</p> <p>3.      Do respondents have a good health risk perception of smoking?</p> <p><strong>1.5  </strong><strong>    Justification for the Study</strong></p> <p>Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body and gradually reduces quality of life (Abdulahi, 2014).  Studies revealed the Nigerian population to be more inclined to smoking with majority of smokers being youths (Ogunmola, Adegboyega, Oluwafemi, 2015) indicating that Nigerian smokers are more likely to be predisposed to its health risks. Over <strong>4.5 million adult Nigerians are tobacco addicts </strong>and about 5.4 million deaths occur yearly due to smoking compared to 3 million and 1 million deaths caused by AIDS and malaria respectively (Global Health Sector Strategy, 2011). The unavailability of the tar contents of the recent cigarette produced in Nigeria may also be another area of concern (Egbe, Petrerson &amp; Mayer-Weitz, 2016). According to an Independent Tobacco Control Activist, Olusegun Owotomo, available statistics show that about 93 million sticks of cigarette are produced and consumed yearly in Nigeria which has led to respiratory infections among 150,000-300,000 children under the age of 18 months as a result of passive smoking.</p> <p>With the trend of tobacco use seen among youth in Nigeria and studies indicating about half of all lifelong smokers will die prematurely, losing on average about 10 years of life (Gholamreza, Mostafa, Mahmoud, Hadi, Masoud &amp; Atena, 2015). It is anticipated that a huge epidemic of tobacco-related diseases might occur and with the long term consequences of smoking on health (Melgosa, 2006). It is of great importance that its reduction should be upmost interest in public health promotion and education as not only the smokers but also non-smokers are predisposed to these hazardous effects. As there is neither a safe tobacco product, nor a safe level of tobacco use, the best way to prevent tobacco-related deaths is to avoid using it.</p>                                                         \n\nPATTERNS OF SMOKING AND HEALTH RISK PERCEPTION OF OUT-OF-SCHOOL YOUTHS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PATTERNS OF SMOKING AND HEALTH RISK PERCEPTION OF OUT-OF-SCHOOL YOUTHS", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Maternal and child health has emerged as the most important issue that determined global and national wellbeing.  This is because every individual, family and community is at some point intimately involved in pregnancy and the success of childbirth (WHO, 2006).  Despite the honour bestowed on womanhood and the appreciation of the birth of a new born baby, pregnancy and childbirth is still considered a perilous journey. The situation of maternal and child health in Nigeria is among the worst in Africa and has not improved substantially and in some areas of the country, has worsened over the past decade (Ladipo, 2009).  The maternal mortality ratio ranges between 800-15000 per 100,000 live births (Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, 2003), with marked variation between geo-political zones – 165 in South West compared with 1,549 in the North-East and between urban and rural areas (Ladipo,2009).  Total fertility rate is 5.7 births per woman and it is estimated that approximately 59,000 of maternal deaths take place annually in Nigeria as a result of pregnancy, delivery and post-delivery complications (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, 2007).</p> <p>Research (Ladipo, 2009) indicated close link between the health of the new born with the health of their mothers.  About 30-40% of neonatal and infant deaths result from poor maternal health and inadequate care during pregnancy, delivery and the critical immediate postpartum period (Ladipo, 2009).  In Nigeria 340,000 infants die every year during delivery and shortly afterwards especially if the mother dies in childbirth (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, 2007). The under-five mortality ratio is 200 per 1000 live births (WHO, 2006).  These deaths are not unconnected with the poor maternal health services in the country and could be avoided through provision of quality and effective maternal and child health services.</p> <p>Nigeria is one of the African countries with a rapidly growing population.  As a nation with a growing economy, one of the major health challenges facing the country today is the capacity to sustain the increasing infant and maternal health.  The most common recorded cause of perinatal deaths are similar to those of other less developed countries, and the common denominators are early childbearing poor maternal health and above all, the lack of appropriate and quality services (Okereke, Kanu, Nwachukwu, Anyanwu, Ehiri &amp; Merick, 2005).  Although life-saving practices for most infants have been known for decades, currently one third of the mothers still have no access to health care services during pregnancy and almost half do not have access to health care services during childbirth (Okereke, et al., 2005). In the light of rapid population growth and increased risks of adverse environmental health exposures, maternal and child health prospects could be a serious national public health problem due to factors such as ignorance, apathy, poverty, lack of commitment, illiteracy and corruption (Opara &amp; Ellah, 2007).</p>                                                         \n\nUTILIZATION OF ANTENATAL AND MATERNITY SERVICES BY MOTHERS SEEKING CHILD WELFARE SERVICES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " UTILIZATION OF ANTENATAL AND MATERNITY SERVICES BY MOTHERS SEEKING CHILD WELFARE SERVICES IN NIGERIA", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Biological treatment of wastewater from Wupa Wastewater Treatment Plant, Abuja was investigated. Wastewater samples were collected from the inlet and effluent point (before and after the ultra violet radiation unit) of the treatment plant. The physicochemical parameters; temperature, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured. The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) were obtained from samples collected from the influent and effluent points using Standard methods specified by the American Public Health Association (APHA). The water samples were also analysed for the presence of bacterial organisms via Total Coliform Count (TCC), Total Bacteriological Count (TBC) and Faecal Count (FC). At the end of the analysis, the percentage removal efficiency of the ultra violet radiation for TCC, TBC and FC were calculated. Results showed that the mean removal efficiency for TCC, TBC and FC were 99.6% , 89.9% and 98.9% respectively; all within the permissible limit of World Health Organization and Federal Ministry of Environment. There was a reduction of 81.5% in COD, 98.9% in BOD which met the required effluent standards. There was significant differences between the pH, TSS, DO, COD and BOD of the influent and effluent (P&lt;0.05). These results showed that there is an urgent need for appropriate steps to be taken for proper management and sanitation of the wastewater before discharging it to the stream, to ensure total conformity with the approved standards.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong> <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong> <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Water is a universal liquid that sustains being and all other lives. In fact that body is known to contain a lot of water and covers about 60% of the total land surface. The first form of life was believed to have started from water millions of year ago and up till now no living things can exist without it. Water is one of the most common solvents and exists in gaseous, liquid and solid state (Ababio 1990).</p> <p>Hence, there are so many ways in which water is useful to human being. It can be used for drinking purpose, which is the most important use of water, it may be used for domestic purpose such as bathing, washing, cleaning etc. in manufacturing industries and in Agriculture etc. Therefore, the important of water cannot be overemphasized in the community (Encyclopedia Britain 1970).</p> <p>Different type of natural water exist on earth’s surface which include; rain water, spring water, river, lake water and sea water etc. rain water is considered as the purest from all natural water because it is formal as a result of the condensation of water vapour in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Spring water on the other hand emerges at the base of sloppy ground where the surface elevation is below the water table, in an aquifer from where the water can escape (Fawole 1980).</p> <p>;However, water that contains few microbes may be considered good as longs as pathogen and inquiries chemicals are absent. Nevertheless the quality of water is determined by the types and quality of microbes present in it. Some natural water could contain some microbes and still be good for use. Generally contaminants that can be found in water include, microorganisms such as bacterial, algae, protozoams, fungi, etc.</p> <p>Some water are used in household, factories etc which are considered as waste water. Biologically these waste water can be treated and be used again. Biological waste water treatment is the common method used to treat water before it is discharge to the communities.</p> <p>Biological waste water treatment system consist of series of reaction vessels which are designed with the optimum mixing energy, retention time, and nutrient addition to provide an optimum environment for biological avidity resulting in removal of nitrates heavy metals, ammonia, and biochemically oxidizable organic mixture as the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).</p> <p>More so, Thomas E, Schultz (us filter) explain that the use of bacteria and other microorganism to remove contaminants by assimilating them has long been a mainstay of waste in the chemical process industries (CPI) because they are effective and widely used. When considering biological waste water treatment for a particular application. Thomas says, it is important to understand the source of the waste water generated, typical waste water composition discharge requirement events and practices withing a facility that can affect the quality and quantity of the waste water and pretreatment ramification consideration of these factor will allow you to maximize the benefit of your plant gains from effective biological treatment.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong> <strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>This main aim if this study it to carry out research on how biological waste water will be treated in order to meet standard for reused by final consumer and with a view of acquiring and developing better understand of biological waste water treatment. This study embarks on the following:</p> <p>1. How biological waste water can be treated for reused.</p> <p>2. To determined the appropriate practical and method that can be used in treatment of biological waste water</p> <p>3. To save large amount of water</p> <p>4. To enumerate different methods that are appropriate in treating of water.</p> <p>5. To use appropriate equipment to get clean water for consumers.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong> <strong>PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Generally, this study aims at all waste water found in Nigeria and prefering remedies by which it can be treated biologically. Actually this will deliver home what is really meant by waste water treatment.</p> <p>The study is also embark water that contains a few microbes which may be injurious chemicals are absent. It also expanciate how waste water is being generated i.e water from household, factories e t c which are considered as waste water and proffering a method in which can be treated. The aim of these study is to treat waste water which is biological waste water treatment</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong> <strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>With full details gotten from various test, it shows that water is needed to be treated before used and these treatment is traceable to be combination of factors which are: fund, self interest, seasons, conditions etc</p> <p>Thus, this study covers a precise story of improving the rate at which water is treated to full cleanness before usage.</p>\n\nBIOLOGICAL WASTE WATER TREATMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BIOLOGICAL WASTE WATER TREATMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 69}]
