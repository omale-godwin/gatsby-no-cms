The work intends to carryout evaluation on the toilet and bathroom, parking space and landscaping of the governor’s lodge surrounding. In the process it was found out that the lodge was not in good condition. Hence the need to put the evaluated places in good shape was possible. Areas evaluated were the toilet and bathroom, the parking space and the landscape of the lodge. Conclusion was drawn that continuous evaluate will put the governor’s in good condition all times. Therefore, it was recommended that the state government should always carryout evaluation on the lodge and its facilities in period of interval so as to give the lodge new look always.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong> <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>       Lodge is originally a term for a relatively small building, often associated with a larger one. A lodge could be seen as a guesthouse where guests or visitors could be given accommodation. Lodge is a type of hotel-like were lodging activities are done. It may include bar, restaurant, recreational facilities and so on. In every nation or state the president or governor and some of his subordinates do performs their official duties in the government house. Government house may be seen as a place where the governor and some of the subordinate have their offices.  It serves as the venue for the Governor's official business, as well as the many receptions and functions hosted by the occupant. One of the infrastructures in government house is the governor’s lodge (Robert, 2013). A lodge may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Also, it may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), conference and event facilities, tennis and/or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants and social function services.  Governor’s lodge facility offers luxury amenities, service accommodations, on-site restaurant (s) and the highest level of personalized service, such as a concierge, room service and clothes pressing staff (Jack, 2013).</p> <p>Governor’s lodge is a kind of guesthouse usually located in the Government House. The lodge is used for hosting visitors such as foreign counter part from other countries that came for business purposes or other social-economic activities, fellow state governors, and others that came for official purposes. When there are official meetings that will extend for days are being held in government house, the governor would host his visitors in the lodge. Therefore, it becomes necessary for the facilities in the lodge to be in good condition because the people that are the guests of the governor are usually people of political hierarchy and personnel. However, in a situation where the facilities in the lodge are not properly working or they are not properly designed to standard it will not be convenient for these people (William, 2013).</p> <p>Therefore, it becomes necessary to know that all facilities are in good condition and are properly designed. In view of the above the researcher has keen interest in carrying out an evaluation of governor’s lodge in Enugu state, Nigeria with reference to facilities like the toilet and bathroom, parking space and the landscaping.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong>                     <br/>Governor’s lodge is subjected to renovation or maintenance at particular interval, sometime innovation. The condition of the toilet and bathroom, car park and landscaping in the Governor’s lodge in Enugu state is not encouraging. Agent attention must be taken to correct the lapses at the lodge. Especially the facilities mentioned above.</p> <p>       This project intends to solve the problems of inconvenience toilet and bathroom, inadequate space for car park and improper landscaping.</p> <p><strong>1.3  AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/></strong></p> <p>       The aim of this project is to present an evaluation of governor’s lodge in Enugu state, Nigeria.</p> <p>Therefore, the specific objectives are to evaluate the follow;</p> <p>1. The toilet and bathroom in governor’s lodge in Enugu state</p> <p>2. The parking space in governor’s lodge in Enugu state</p> <p>3. Landscaping of the surrounding in governor’s lodge in Enugu state</p> <p>4. To improve the present design in governor’s lodge in Enugu state</p> <p><strong>1.4  RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong>                                </p> <p>1. How would the toilet and bathroom in governor’s lodge in Enugu state be evaluated?</p> <p>2. How would the parking space in governor’s lodge in Enugu state be evaluated?</p> <p>3. How is the Landscaping of the surrounding in governor’s lodge in Enugu state?</p> <p>4. How would the present design in governor’s lodge in Enugu state be improved?</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong>                      </p> <p>       The importance of this project cannot be overemphasized. This is because the evaluation process in Governor’s lodge of Enugu state will help to correct several facilities such as the toilet and bathroom, car park and landscaping.   </p> <p><strong>1.6</strong> <strong>SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong>   <br/> The project is focused on the evaluation of Governor’s lodge in Enugu state. The scope of the evaluation process will be limited to toilet and bathroom facilities, car park and landscaping.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong>                          </p> <p>       During the period of the project the researcher encountered some difficulties which serve as limitation to the study. These include time frame, lack of cooperation from respondents to be interviewed concerning the subject matter and finance.</p>\n\nEVALUATION OF GOVERNOR’S LODGE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "<h1 class=\"myh1\"><strong> EVALUATION OF GOVERNOR’S LODGE </strong></h1>", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <strong>DISASTER MANAGEMENT CENTRE</strong> <strong>(A CASE STUDY PORT-HARCOURT)</strong> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p> 1.1 Background to the Study</p> <p>1.2 Statement Of Architectural Problems</p> <p>1.3 Motivation</p> <p>1.4 Aims</p> <p>1.5  Objectives</p> </div> <div> <p>1.6  Scope Of Project</p> <p>1.6.1   The Site</p> <p>1.6.2   The Main Building</p> <p>1.6.3   The Clinic</p> <p>1.6.4   The Staff Accommodation</p> <p>1.7       Project Justification</p> <p>1.8       Definition Of Terms  </p> <p>1.9        Research Methodology  </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p> <strong>2.0.

Disaster management deals with situations that occur prior to, during, and after the disaster. Globally, there has been lots of disaster on land, air and sea, though these disasters may be natural or man-made, it has however led to the destruction of lives and properties worth billions of Naira.</p> <p>In Nigeria, there have been instance of earth tremors in Ogun state in 1994, several cases of flood has occurred in Nigeria, in July 2012, 363 people killed, over 2,100,000 displaced, Areas affected include, Adamawa, Taraba, Plateau, and Benue state. On 2nd July 2012, many Nigerian coastal and inland cities experienced heavy rains, and residents of Lagos state were \"gasping for breath\" due to the flooding. In addition, there was a gridlock on major roads, causing people to cancel or postpone appointments they may have had. Thousands of stranded commuters had to pay increased fares for the few bus drivers who were willing to risk travelling on the roads, and construction of work by the Nigerian government on the inner Oke-Afa Road took a \"heavy toll.\" In mid-July 2012, flooding in the Ibadan metropolis caused some residents at Challenge, Oke-Ayo, and Eleyele to flee from their residences and save their lives. The flooding also prevented some Christians from attending churches in the morning, while a few bridges caved in. The Nigerian government said that certain structures on waterways had to be demolished as a result of the flooding, while Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Bosun Oladele, announced that there weren't any casualties from the flooding. Although, most of the disasters that Nigerians face are generally preventable, such as aircraft crash, boat mishap, floods, landslides, fire out breaks, oil spillage etc, can actually be prevented.</p> <p>  </p> <p><strong>Disaster </strong>is an event, natural or man-made, sudden or progressive, which impacts with such severity that the affected community or individual has to respond by taking exceptional measures.</p> <p><strong>Disaster Management </strong>is the systematic observation and analysis of disasters to improve measures relating to prevention, mitigation, preparedness, emergency response and recovery. It is also the range of activities designed to maintain control over disaster and emergency situations and to provide a framework for helping at-risk persons to avoid or recover from the impact of the disaster and deals with situations that occur prior to, during, and after the disaster.</p> <p>The term \"<strong>Disaster Management\"</strong> encompasses the complete realm of disaster-related activities. Traditionally people tend to think of disaster management only in terms of the post-disaster actions taken by relief and reconstruction officials; yet disaster management covers a much broader scope, and many modern disaster managers may find themselves far more involved in pre-disaster activities than in post-disaster response. This is because many persons who work in the development field, or who plan routine economic, urban, regional or agricultural development projects, have disaster management responsibilities. Disaster management also encompasses the field of emergency assistance and long-term maintenance for refugees and displaced persons. The refugee field of disaster management is highly specialized and requires not only many development skills but also a broader awareness of political, legal, and humanitarian issues.</p> <p>The project is to design a <strong>Disaster Management Centre</strong> which will serve as a centre for the operational squad and aid for investigation, assistance and relief of people affected with disasters. The aim of this project is to provide disaster management knowledge and skills to enhance the understanding of good (and bad) disaster preparedness and response and their reasons for them. This project introduces the main principles of Disaster Management, with a focus on disaster response in the developing world.</p> </div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <div>   <p>1.1 <strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> THE NEED FOR A DISASTER MANAGEMENT CENTRE</p> <p>Disaster means a progressive or sudden, widespread or localised, natural or human caused occurrence which causes or threatens to cause; Death, injury or disease, Damage to property, infrastructure or the environment, Disruption of the life of a community; and is of the magnitude that exceeds the ability of those affected by the disaster to cope with its effect using only their own resources. A disaster management centre is needed to:</p> <p>·         To implement an integrated and coordinate disaster management policy that focuses on preventing or reducing the risk disasters, mitigating the severity of disasters, emergency preparedness, rapid and effective response to disasters and post disaster recovery.</p> <p>·         To prepare the document that will identify risks, assess risks, risk response development and risk response control.</p> <p>·         The purpose of centre is to outline policy and procedures for both proactive disaster prevention and the re-active disaster response and mitigation phases.</p> <p>The disaster management centre functions are as follows:</p> <p>·         Must specialise in issues concerning disasters within Rivers State.</p> <p>·         Act as a repository and conduit for information concerning disasters.</p> <p>·         Must perform it functions and exercise powers as stipulated section 44 of the Disaster Management Act, 57 of 2002.</p> <p>·         Must liaise and co-ordinate its activities with those of National, State Management centres.</p> <p>1.2 <strong>STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Architecture is an abstraction from nature and intuition with possibilities of aesthetic accompaniments for overall ambient satisfaction (Fashuyi, 2004). Nevertheless, this ideological perception must graft with sensitive issues bordering on culture, economy before Architecture can become acceptable in its right values. However, Architectural Education in Nigeria as presently structured is not responsive to her socio-economic environment. In fact, it is more suited to problems of urban environment of prosperous economies having nothing in common with the cultural and economic features of the country (Adesina, 1987). Architectural Education in Nigeria was inherited from the Beaux-Art concept of Western educational philosophy through the colonial mentors. This tendency is to provide aesthetically satisfying buildings, irrespective of function.</p> <p>The design of the Disaster Management Centre will take into cognisance proper functional relationship between each section of the building to another; the site is located at an area that can be easily accessible from various parts of the state, helicopters are also available to ease rescue in parts of the states that cannot be easily assessable by land, the structure is responsive to the socio-economic environment in the state, the structure is aesthetically satisfying, the structure conforms to the building codes and zoning.</p> <p>Therefore architectural problems of the Disaster Management Centre Are as follows:</p> <p>·         The integration of architectural purpose, site, suitable spaces, technical systems and materials.</p> <p>·         Inadequate ventilation and natural lightening</p> <p>·         Primary and secondary circulation in and around the site.</p> </div> <p>1.3 <strong>MOTIVATION</strong></p> <div>   <p>Disaster Management is an enormous task. Disasters are not confined to any particular location; neither do they disappear as quickly as they appear. Therefore, it is imperative that there is proper management to optimize efficiency of planning and response. Due to limited resources, collaborative efforts at the governmental, private and community levels are necessary. This level of collaboration requires a coordinated and organized effort to mitigate against, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies and their effects in the shortest possible time.</p> <p>The motivation of this project steams from:</p> <p>·         The absolute necessity for such a project: Over the years, lives have been lost in natural and man-made disaster primarily due to absence of a disaster management centre or slow response of rescue team.</p> <p>·         The wealth of knowledge, which the project adds to existing information on architectural building types.</p> <p>·         The sense of comfort and security inspired by the project, being from the riverine area in the Niger Delta region where the terrain is difficult and inter-city transport is mostly done by boat, the potential for boat mishaps is rather high.</p> <p>·         To reduce subsequent insurance claims and compensation on government and insurance companies.</p> <p>·         The passion to create an avenue that will aid for relief to all disaster victims.</p> <p>·         To create awareness for the need of disaster management.</p> <p> 1.4 <strong>AIMS</strong></p> <p>·         To provide a facility that will improve response to disasters for an initial period after which other sources would assist.</p> <p>·         To reduce confusion on the part of all personnel concern in disasters.</p> <p>·         To enhance the role of rapid deployment of its personnel in response to emergency</p> <p>·         Preventing or reducing the risk of disasters and mitigating the severity or consequences of disasters</p> <p>·         A rapid and effective response to disasters and post- disaster recovery and rehabilitation.</p> <p>·         To ensure the survival of the maximum possible number of victims, keeping them in the best possible health in the circumstances.</p> <p>·         To re-establish self-sufficiency and essential services as quickly as possible for all population groups, with special attention to those whose needs are greatest: the most vulnerable and underprivileged.</p> <p>·         To repair or replace damaged infrastructure and regenerate viable economic activities. To do this in a manner that contributes to long-term development goals and reduces vulnerability to any future recurrence of potentially damaging hazards.</p> <p>·         In cases involving population displacements (due to any type of disaster) the aim is to find durable solutions as quickly as possible, while ensuring protection and assistance as necessary in the meantime.</p> <p> 1.5 <strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>·         To create a building for imparting training in disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness, relief and rehabilitation and also to undertake research studies, documentation and development of database.</p> <p>·         Organize state and regional level conferences/workshops in disaster management and related subjects.</p> <p>·           To develop and encourage NGO's network in the state to manage disasters in the state.</p> <p>·         to reduce or avoid the human, physical, and economic losses suffered by individuals, by the society, and by the country at large</p> <p>·         To reduce personal suffering and to speed recovery.</p> <p> 1.10    <strong>SCOPE OF PROJECT:</strong></p> <p>This project provides, to a satisfactory level, all the facilities that are needed in the disaster management centre for optimum performance</p> <p>to manage disaster. There are provisions for effective control, relief and rescue of disasters by mitigating, preparedness, response and recovery.</p> <p>The scope of the project is limited to the following;</p> <p>·         The design of the Administrative building</p> <p>·         The clinic</p> <p>·         A staff residential building</p> <p>·         Hanger for helicopter</p> <p>1.10.1  <strong>THE SITE:</strong></p> <p> This project involves the design of a Centre that aids for Disaster Management, thus, due to the amphibiotic nature of its function, the facility would require a site that enhances the marine and land base operation, and hence, it is located within the southern section of Port Harcourt. It can also be accessible through various pedestrian routes emanating from the neighbouring residential zones. This will be dutifully respected in the cause of designing.</p> <p>The site is in close proximity to the State secretariat, the Nigerian marine base, Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, Orobum Vimmage (now called Obunabali).

The credibility of this statement has been proven over the centuries, that if one decides to take a critical look at earlier civilizations, from the time of early Egyptian civilization to the current civilized world, one will discover that many of the great feats achieved during these civilizations would have been impossible without one form of transportation or the other.</p> <p>By way of definition; transportation (or transport) is the movement of people, animals and goods from one location to another. Modes of transport include air, rail, road, water, cable, pipeline and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and operations. Transportation is important since it enables trade between people, which in turn establishes civilizations.</p> <p>Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for transport, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refuelling depots (including fuelling docks and fuel stations) and seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.</p> <p>Vehicles travelling on these networks may include automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, people, helicopters and aircraft. Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including financing, legalities and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.</p> <p>Transportation can be broadly classified under three broad groups thus:</p> <p>Land transportation;</p> <p>Water transportation; and Air transportation.</p> <p>Land transportation is the most common and dates back to the beginning of civilization. Land transportation can take various forms, which are dependent on the sophistication, stage of civilization and development, and on the technical stratum of the society in question. It can be by the use of animals (camels, mules, horses, dogs, etc.) or by use of machines such as wheelbarrows, carts, cars etc.</p> <p>Similarly, water transportation dates back a long time as humanity can recall. Water transportation, as land transportation, has also been developed in complexity, technical superiority, and usage.</p> <p>Air transportation has its origin in the 20th century. The superiority of air transport over the rest can be attributed the reason behind its progressive growth and preference as the safest modern mode of transportation.</p> <p><strong>1.1.0 BACKGROUND TO THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>The airpot terminal is a building at an airport where passengers transfer between ground transportation and the facilities that allow them to board and disembark from the aircraft. Within the terminal, passengers purchase tickets, transfer their luggage, and go through security. The buildings that provide access to the airplanes (via gates) are typically called concoures. However, the terms terminals and concourses are used interchangably, depending on the configuration of the airport.</p> <p>Smaller airports have one terminal while larger airports have several terminals and/or concourses. At small airports, the single terminal building typically serves all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse. Some larger airports have one terminal that is connected to multiple concourses via walkways, sky-bridges, or underground tunnels (such as <em>Denver International Airport</em>). Some larger airports have more than one terminal, each with one or more concourses (such as New York‟s <em>John F. Kennedy Airport</em>). Still other larger airports have multiple terminals each of which incorporate the functions of a concourse (such as <em>Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport).</em></p> <p>According to Frommers, most airport terminals are built in a plain style, with the concrete boxes of the 1960s and ‟70s generally gave way to glass boxes in the ‟90s and ‟00s, with the best terminals making a vague stab at incorporating ideas of light and air. However, some, such as</p> <p><em>Baghdad International Airport</em>, are monumental in stature, while others are considered architectural masterpieces, such as Terminal 1 at<em> Charles de Gaulle Airport </em>near Paris or Terminal 5 at<em> New York‟s John F. Kennedy Airport</em>. A few are designed to reflect the culture of a particular area, some examples being the terminal at <em>Albuquerque International Sunport</em> in New Mexico, which is designed in the Pueblo Revival Style popularized by architect John Gaw Meem, as well as the one at <em>Bahiasde Huatulco International Airport</em> in Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, which features some palapas that are interconnected to form the airport terminal building.</p>\n\n MAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "<h1 class=\"myh1\"><strong>  MAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING</strong></h1>", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EFFECT OF REINFORCED CONCRETE ON SAFETY OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Residential Building:</strong>  This is defined as the building which sleeping accommodation is provided for normal residential purposes. It is provided with or without cooking or dining or both facilities. Residential building includes one or two story or multi-family dwelling, lodging or rooming houses, dormitories, and apartment houses.</p> <p>The residential building can be owned by an individual or co-operative association. Each resident or resident household has membership in the co-operative association. In non-equality co-operative members have occupancy right to a specific suite within the housing co-operative as outlined in their “occupancy agreement” or “proprietary lease” which is essentially a lease. In ownership co-operatives occupancy rights are transferred to the purchaser by way of the title transfer.</p> <p>The major function of the residential building is for the accommodation, both for private and the public users.</p> <p>Due to th aforementioned reasons, there is need for well construction of the residential structure, with the materials that will be capable of resisting both direct and indirect forces and the weathering effects, not just for a moment but for the long lasting time, hence the use of concrete is being adapted. </p> <p>Concrete can be defined as a hard, strong construction materials consisting of sand, conglomerate gravel, pebbles, broken stones, or slag in a motor or cement mixture. It is also known as the mass formed by the coalescence or particles.</p> <p>Concrete could also be defined as the mixture of gravel, pebbles or broken stone with cement or with tar, etc, used for sidewalks, roadways, foundations, etc and especially for submarine structure.</p> <p>Some many issues has lead to the construction of different types of building like bungalow and high rise building in order to save money.</p> <p>According to an economist that says human wants is unlimited and that there are limited resources with which wants can be satisfied. And this has lead to the absolute maximization and utilization of the said available resources to man which include fixed and liquid assets. This is one of the reasons why the conservation of land to safe place was adapted, which led to the construction of high rise building in town and mostly in well developed countries, for the fact that human being resides in, and other valuables are kept in these buildings; safely of the structure under all forces that may be applied must be guaranteed.</p> <p>Recently, reinforced concrete has proven to be the cheapest retail that can effectively resist these forces like (wind force, direct force and indirect force) and other force that may be applied within the building, which can be found into various shape.</p> <p>The need for the forces stability of this structure under these factors has brought a challenge to the engineer; hence the reinforced concrete design is concern.</p> <p><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>The reinforced concrete uses extra materials like steel bars, wooden beams or fibers, along with a wire frame to help mold the concrete and ensure the safe construction under the worst condition of the force that may be applied within and outside the building.</p> <p>The reinforcement interacts with the concrete, strengthening it and providing support houses and other structures. The concrete provide shielding for the steel so it doesn’t corrode as quickly and together they are a common component in the modern construction.</p> <p>Therefore, this project is aimed in ensuring the safety of life and property based on the use of limit state design code (BS 8110) in understanding the problem that is involved in design and resolving same appropriately. It also aimed in knowing the members of the structure and its weight and the steps taken in achieving the internal and external forces and proper way of applying the reinforcement for the proper structural stability.</p> <p>Its objective includes knowing that concrete tends to be brittle, breaking easily under sudden stress and crumbling under the influence time and weather. This makes it difficult to use traditional concrete structures intended to hold a large amount of weight or last a long time. Reinforced concrete on the other hand can hold much more weight and does not wear as easily. Hence most structure built today use reinforced concrete.</p> <p><strong>Uses</strong></p> <p>The reinforced concrete is used in large scale construction such as bridges and skyscrapers. It was first created for building construction in the mid 1800s, and soon spread across both Europe and America. Most major building built by the beginning of the 1900s was created with reinforced concrete.</p> <p>Consideration: Reinforced concrete   is subjected to the same principles as normal concrete, and the quality depends on the mixture of the cement and how well it is set. The extra material used will also cost more, especially if steel bars are used instead of wood or recycled fiber alternatives. However, the glass and fiber alternatives can present difficulties on their own by becoming weaker in a fire.</p> <p><strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Reinforced concrete is concrete in which the reinforcement bars (rebels) reinforcement girders, plates or fibers have been incorporate to strengthen the concrete in tension. It was the concrete that is reinforced with steel or iron is called a reinforced concrete only. Other materials used to reinforced concrete can be organic and inorganic fibers as well as composite in different forms. Prior to the invention of reinforcement, concrete was strong in compression, but weak in tension. Adding reinforcement crucially increases the strength in tension. The failure strain of concrete in tension is so low that the reinforcement has to hold the concrete sections together.</p> <p>For a strong ductile and durable construction, the reinforcement needs to have the following properties.</p> <p>High strength</p> <p>High tensile strain</p> <p>Good bond to the concrete</p> <p>Thermal compatibility</p> <p>Durability in the concrete environment.</p> <p>In most cases, reinforced concrete uses steel rebels that have been inserted to add strength. Concrete is reinforced to give it extra tensile strength; without reinforcement, many concrete building would not have been possible.</p> <p>Reinforced concrete can compasses many members or types of structures and components which includes:</p> <p>Slabs</p> <p>Walls</p> <p>Beams</p> <p>Columns</p> <p>Foundations</p> <p>Frames and more</p> <p>Reinforced concrete can be classified as (1) pre-cast and (2) in-situ concrete.</p> <p>Reinforced concrete is focused mainly on the floor system. Designing   and implementing the most efficient floor system is key to creating optimal building structures, small changes in the design of a floor can have a significant impact on material cost; construction schedule, ultimate strength, operating costs, occupancy levels and end use of building.</p> <p><strong>REINFORCEMENT AND TERMINOLOGY OF MEMBERS</strong></p> <p>It is found that the architectural drawing has been thoroughly examined and right systems of design have been chosen. In this modern computer age, the easiest way to carry out design is by computer method, but the system of manual method is still use to arrive at the same point going through all the worst critical members of the structure by using the factors like</p> <p>          Ly/Lx  ≤  2.0 for two-way slab</p> <p>          Ly/Lx  ≥  2.0 for one-way spacing</p> <p>The load on this slab is being estimated using the appropriate moments data, shears, torsion, the reinforcement are calculated using the appropriate method of provided by design code.</p> <p>          The moment coefficients given in the code and moment distribution method were employed in the determination of slabs and beam moments while the analyses of the substitute frame were used for columns.</p> <p>Beams bending in small curvature at the outer face (tensile face) of the curvature the concrete experiences tensile stresses while at the inner face, (compressive face) it experiences the compressive stress.</p> <p>The slab and beam and also the roof structure causes axial load on the column.</p> <p>Reinforcement are been provided to each of the members after deign using the appropriate chart from design codes.</p> <p>The column transfers loads from slab and beam down to the foundation and distribute same to the soil.</p> <p>The shear reinforcement where also calculated providing the reinforcement with the appropriate table approved by design code in respects of the value gotten. The shear reinforcement is in form of links, stirrup where also provided where necessary.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>On the process to ensure that a structure is safe and of the standard required, this project have been designed accordingly based on the rules stipulated in limit state design  as provided by the code of practice  BS 8110. Therefore, some instances are referenced to other codes of practice.</p> <p>In this project, the total members of beams which were analyzed representing typical cases of the whole structure and designed.</p> <p>Three footing wear design together with stairs and its value were provided in details drawing and theory.</p> <p>Artificial engineering materials made form a mixture of Portland cement, water, fine and coarse aggregate and small amount of air. It is the most widely used construction materials in the world and must be properly treated.</p> <p>Concrete is the only major building material that can be delivered to the site and care must be taken to avoid fake materials. The unique quality of concrete makes concrete desirable as a building material can be molded virtually to any forms of shape. Concrete provide a wide latitude in the surface texture and colours and can be used to construct a wide variety of structures such as highway  and streets, bridges, large buildings, airports runways, irrigation structures, breakwater, pier and docks, sidewalks silos and farm building, homes and even barges and ships.</p> <p>The two major component of concrete are cement paste and inert materials. Under normal conditions, concrete grows stronger as it grow older. The chemical reactions between cement and water that cause the paste to harden and bind the aggregates together requires time. Therefore proper materials have to be chosen at the time of construction in order to achieve a stable structure.</p> <p><strong>LIMIT STATE DESIGN BS 8110</strong></p> <p>BS 8110 is a British standard for the design and construction of reinforced and pre - stressed concrete structure.</p> <p>This theory came into existence as a result of the discrepancies between the behaviour of materials by elastic analysis and that which occur in practice.</p> <p>Although BS 8110 is used for most civil engineering and building structures, bridges and water-retaining structures, this are covered by separate standards of (BS 5400 and BS 8007).</p> <p>Limit sate design requires the structure to satisfies two principal criteria, that is the Ultimate Limit State (ULS)  and the serviceability Limit State (SLS). A limit state is a set of performance criteria (eg. vibration level, deflection, strength, stability, buckling, twisting, collapse) that must be met when the structure is subjected to loads. This later leads to checks for the protection for instance deflection and cracks checks.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF REINFORCED CONCRETE ON SAFETY OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "<h1 class=\"myh1\"><strong> THE EFFECT OF REINFORCED CONCRETE ON SAFETY OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN NIGERIA</strong></h1>", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INFRASTRUCTURE RENEWAL PROGRAMS: A REMEDY TO LAGOS MEGACITY CHALLENGES</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong><br/>The population of Lagos is at present in excess of 18 million. A megacity status is conferred by the United Nations on cities with a population of 10 million and above. Building and preserving a model mega city comes with great challenges. Providing a sufficient amount of infrastructure and other necessities that would accommodate the needs of over 18 million people could be daunting (Ayeni, 2008).</p> <p>By 2025, officials and population analysts agreed that the number of people in the city and in the surrounding communities, especially, in Ogun State axis, would leap to 30 million. Prominent among the challenges are housing, infrastructure and transportation, particularly in more than 10 local government areas (LGAs) that made up of the state, excluding local council development areas (LCDAs). Besides, the notorious traffic jams, choking pollution, inadequate supply of potable water, insecurity and absence or inadequate social and economic needs of the people pose more challenges. Apart from series of efforts put in place by government through several urban renewal programs, the uncontrolled influx of people from virtually every states of Nigeria, including neighboring countries, such as Benin Republic, Togo, Ghana and others, is heightening the fear that the next few years would provoke a daunting task for the authority (Tim, 2003).<br/>It has been observed that in some houses in Lagos metropolis, septics are channeled directly into the drain. The government is, therefore, challenged to invest heavily in the protection of the environment through urban renewal programs in order to avert environmental abuse and its consequences. People migrate from villages to the city-centre, without adequate understanding of reality on ground. Here, culture comes into play, such as open defecation as being done in the village, spreading of clothes publicly and cooking exercise in any open place, among others which is frustrating the efforts of the state government at transforming the city through urban renewal programs. Official admitted that planned urban renewal is a major challenge in an emerging model city like Lagos (Batley, 2003). Prior to the current urban regeneration efforts by the government, Lagos used to be referred to as a jungle of various emerging slums. However, a systematic urban development and slum renewal programme, in partnership with several development agencies, has since been put in place to reverse the trend being a major remedy to combat the menace characterized by urbanization. Consequently, various model city plans that included Ikeja Model Plan, Victoria Island/Ikoyi Model City Plan, Lekki Comprehensive Land Use and Infrastructure Master Plan have been completed while Mainland Central Model City Plan Badagry Draft Master Plan and Alimosho Master Plan have been concluded, while others are at various stages of execution. However, in order to give the urban renewal programme a legal backing, the Lagos State Model City Development Law was enacted in 2009 while the State Urban and Regional Planning Law were signed on July 7, 2010.</p> <p>According to Lindan (1993), certainly, a megacity requires a stronger financial base. The sheer size of funding required in sustaining a megacity is beyond what a government could provide on its own. To this end, Kadiri was of the view that both federal and Ogun state governments should support Lagos in her efforts to sustain the challenges involved as a result of its mega status through the urban renewal programmes. According to Ogunleye, for the fact that many of the old slum areas are not in hidden locations make it easier for government to incorporate them in its urban renewal programmes. The formation of new slums is prevented but people’s influx is however not controllable in Lagos State, knowing full well that no legislation that frown against migration to the city. But government will do well if it opens up new settlement with the necessary infrastructure put in place. Although, government has embarked on infrastructure renewal projects that include the execution of on-going projects such as the light rail scheme from Orile to Mile 2, the redevelopment of the Lagos-Badagry expressway into ten lanes incorporating BRT lanes and light rails, on-going reconstruction of the Mile 12-Ikorodu road incorporating BRT lanes, the recently commissioned Ejigbo- Ajao Estate link bridge, recovery and redevelopment of loops hitherto used by criminals as hide-outs among others could only become feasible with a sustained system of funding. Notwithstanding the profoundness of these projects, it appears that much still need to be done to meet the need of millions of commuters on daily basis.</p> <p>The condition of the environment also constitutes a major challenge to the Lagos megacity city. Lagos, for instance, generates 10,000 tonnes of waste daily, almost three times higher than what the whole of Ghana generates daily. Also, the kind of industrial pollution experienced in Lagos is second to none in the country. Maintenance of law and order is another major challenge of the Lagos mega city. Though a mega city status is conferred on a city as a result of population growth, building and sustaining a model mega city is not a tea party as reflected in the Lagos experience. In the case of Lagos, a major challenge, however, is how to cope with the ever-increasing population of Lagos with its attendant consequences on infrastructure</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>This study considers the solution to the challenges of Lagos mega-cities characterized by urbanization as an effective urban renewal programme. This approach is aimed at providing housing, environmental policies and planning strategies appropriate for facing the challenges of the urban growth and development. A megacity is usually defined according to the United Nation as a metropolitan area with a total population in excess of 10 million people. Some definitions also set a minimum level for population density (at least 2,000 persons/square km). A megacity can be a single metropolitan area or more metropolitan, depending on the definitions and boundaries being used. However, the researcher will provide an overview about urban renewal programme as a remedy to Lagos Mega city challenges.<br/><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <ol><li>To examine the challenges of the Lagos mega city.</li> <li>To identify the urban renewal programmes put in place by government of Lagos State in addressing Mega city challenges.</li> <li>To determine the effectiveness of urban renewal programmes in Lagos State.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What are the challenges of the Lagos mega city?</li> <li>What are the urban renewal programmes put in place by government of Lagos State in addressing Mega city challenges?</li> <li>What is the effectiveness of urban renewal programmes in Lagos State?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <ol><li>The outcome of this study will educate the general public on how an effective urban renewal programmes can curb mega city challenges.

Housing is seen as one of the best indicators of a person’s standard of living and of his or her place in society (UNCHS, 1993). Housing and building conditions also reflect the living standards of a society (Venkatarama, 2004). Thus, the importance of access to adequate and affordable housing took the front burner in the mid 20th century. Most Nigerian don’t have access to decent housing units due to the cost occasioned by the cost of building materials. This has led to various researches into development of the new and innovative dry construction techniques to enhance access to housing for all.<br/>The new construction technology which is based on dry construction system which are manufactured from cement, quartz sand, cellulose, natural calcium and water, are processed by autoclave (drying process under high pressure and temperature) for durability and dimensional stability. They are manufactured into boards. The boards which come in various sizes and thicknesses between 6mm and 20mm, are manufactured under strict quality control and international standards.<br/>Describing the dry construction system as a modern building system which tends to translate the building process into an industrial process, Le (2014) said the system is more versatile and faster construction method that allows up to 70 per cent construction time saving possible when compared with the traditional wet construction using bricks and blocks. He added that whatever the design idea the Architect can conceive, the dry construction system can achieve, pointing out that various reference building projects using the boards now abound in Nigeria.<br/>This system, unlike the traditional brick and block method requires minimum use of water. The system generates minimum construction waste and dry construction buildings have much better preserve room temperature and they are energy efficient. The use of timber associated with the traditional construction is avoided with dry construction, and the system impacts positively on reducing deforestation.<br/>Lower dry construction load impacts on minimum excavation, less soil disturbance. The system compliments better the green building idea for modern construction world over. In additional, the system is a lightweight construction. It is about 10 times less in weight compared to equivalent blocks and mortar construction, resulting to savings in foundation and structural costs.<br/>Dry construction for eave solution has also proved to be a much viable solution with lower self-weight, faster and better technical finishes. Dry construction building boards have a high fire resistance rating and good acoustic and thermal properties. It is also a moisture and pest resistance solution. Explaining that skill-gap is a major challenge for dry construction, Le (2014) noted that some companies in Nigeria who are in partnership with other stakeholders with skills in dry construction technology to put in motion machinery for skill acquisition with regular trainings to ensure the technology is domicile with the Nigerian populace, adding that customers’ perception is another challenge to address, while efforts are in top gear towards continuous education about the modern system of building.<br/><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Various researchers are of the opinion that with the demand for housing in Nigeria growing at a geometric rate while housing provision is at arithmetic rate, there is obvious need to evolve a more practical method of achieving mass housing development in the country. Dry construction presents an excellent opportunity to government at all levels and the primary mortgage institutions to guarantee speedy provision of mass and affordable housing in Nigeria. The researcher is of the view that dry construction technology will provide for building professionals and contractors a viable alternative to the traditional wet construction method with blocks and bricks and concrete. However, this study will examine the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable housing in Nigeria.<br/><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <ol><li>To examine the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable houses in Nigeria.</li> <li>To examine the process involved in dry construction system.</li> <li>To determine the factor limiting the use of dry construction system for building development in Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable houses in Nigeria?</li> <li>What is the process involved in dry construction system?</li> <li>What are the factors limiting the use of dry construction system for building development in Nigeria?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>HO: Dry construction system cannot be use as a means for the provision of affordable houses for Nigerian.<br/>HA: Dry construction system can be used as a means for the provision of affordable houses for Nigerian.<br/><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <ol><li>The outcome of this study will educate professionals in building technology and other stakeholders in the building industry on the need for active innovative development with the use of dry construction system with the view of ensuring the provision of affordable houses for Nigerians.</li> <li>This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study on the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable houses in Nigeria will cover all the process involved in the use of dry construction system with a view of determining approaches that can be adopted in the delivery of sustainable mass housing for Nigerians.<br/><strong>LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong><br/><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<br/><strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Transportation has remained one of the most vital factors that influence the development of a nation. The credibility of this statement has been proven over the centuries, that if one decides to take a critical look at earlier civilizations, from the time of early Egyptian civilization to the current civilized world, one will discover that many of the great feats achieved during these civilizations would have been impossible without one form of transportation or the other. By way of definition; transportation (or transport) is the movement of people, animals and goods from one location to another. Modes of transport include air, rail, road, water, cable, pipeline and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and operations. Transportation is important since it enables trade between people, which in turn establishes civilizations. Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for transport, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refuelling depots (including fuelling docks and fuel stations) and seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance. Vehicles travelling on these networks may include automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, people, helicopters and aircraft. Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including financing, legalities and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode. Transportation can be broadly classified under three broad groups thus: Land transportation; Water transportation; and Air transportation. Land transportation is the most common and dates back to the beginning of civilization. Land transportation can take various forms, which are dependent on the sophistication, stage of civilization and development, and on the technical stratum of the society in question. It can be by the use of animals (camels, mules, horses, dogs, etc.) or by use of machines such as wheelbarrows, carts, cars etc. Similarly, water transportation dates back a long time as humanity can recall. Water transportation, as land transportation, has also been developed in complexity, technical superiority, and usage. Air transportation has its origin in the 20th century. The superiority of air transport over the rest can be attributed the reason behind its progressive growth and preference as the safest modern mode of transportation. 1.1.0 BACKGROUND TO THE PROJECT The airpot terminal is a building at an airport where passengers transfer between ground transportation and the facilities that allow them to board and disembark from the aircraft. Within the terminal, passengers purchase tickets, transfer their luggage, and go through security. The buildings that provide access to the airplanes (via gates) are typically called concoures. However, the terms terminals and concourses are used interchangably, depending on the configuration of the airport. Smaller airports have one terminal while larger airports have several terminals and/or concourses. At small airports, the single terminal building typically serves all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse. Some larger airports have one terminal that is connected to multiple concourses via walkways, sky-bridges, or underground tunnels (such as Denver International Airport). Some larger airports have more than one terminal, each with one or more concourses (such as New York‟s John F. Kennedy Airport). Still other larger airports have multiple terminals each of which incorporate the functions of a concourse (such as Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport). According to Frommers, most airport terminals are built in a plain style, with the concrete boxes of the 1960s and ‟70s generally gave way to glass boxes in the ‟90s and ‟00s, with the best terminals making a vague stab at incorporating ideas of light and air. However, some, such as Baghdad International Airport, are monumental in stature, while others are considered architectural masterpieces, such as Terminal 1 at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris or Terminal 5 at New York‟s John F. Kennedy Airport. A few are designed to reflect the culture of a particular area, some examples being the terminal at Albuquerque International Sunport in New Mexico, which is designed in the Pueblo Revival Style popularized by architect John Gaw Meem, as well as the one at Bahiasde Huatulco International Airport in Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, which features some palapas that are interconnected to form the airport terminal building.</p>\n\nMAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING, MARKURDI, BENUE STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "<h1 class=\"myh1\"><strong> MAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING, MARKURDI, BENUE STATE</strong></h1>", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The project envisages the establishment of a plant for the production of poultry feed with a capacity of 2500 tons per annum. Poultry feed it’s a balanced feed which aids proper development of chicks and pullet. Poultry feed mill processing factory provided opportunity of employment to the unemployed people of the proposed area. The state requirement of poultry feed is met through local production. The principal raw materials required are maize, rice polish, rice bran, groundnut cake, soya beans, fish meal, vitamin and salt. All the raw materials are locally available except vitamin which is to be imported. The project will create backward linkage with the agricultural and Agro-processing Sectors and forward linkage with poultry sector and also generated income for the government term of tax revenue and pay-roll tax. This enable the growth poultry industry to utilize the weed of the economic development of the area and the state.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The proposed poultry feed mill processing factory is to be sited at autabalefi in karu local government area of Nasarawa State.</p> <p>This project will enhance the use of local indigenous available raw materials in Nasarawa state and its environment, thus boosting the working ability of farmer and providing employed people and also generating revenues for local communities. Poultry feed mill are mixture of various ingredients such as maize, rice bran, grandaunt cakes molasses, soya beans cake, fish meals, corn etc. the composition of poultry feed can be varied depending on the availability of various raw materials such as carbohydrate, protein, vitamins and minerals.</p> <p>Balanced feed it very essential for proper growth of divides and pullets and hence use for feeding others domesticated birds such as chickens, turkey, ducks, geese etc at which also increase the output of broiler/eggs. Feed for poultry mostly consist of grain, a portion of commercial feed, typical around quarter, is known as bulk and it indigestible. The amount of bulk is referred to as bulk density.</p> <p>The quantity of feed and the nutritional requirements of the feed depend on the weight and the age of the poultry as well as the season. Healthy poultry required a sufficient amount of protein and carbon-hydrate along with the necessary vitamins, dietary minerals and an adequate supply of water certain diets also required the use of grit, tiny rocks as process of granite in the feed. Grit aids in digestion by grinding ford as it passes through the gizzard. Grit is not needed if commercial feed is used. The poultry feed must remain clean and dry; contaminated feed can infect poultry. Damp feed en-courage fungal growth disease can be avoided with proper maintenance of the feed and feeders. The use of poultry feed can be supplemented with food find through foraging in industrial agricultural. Machinery is used to automate the feeding process, reducing the cost and increasing the scale of farming for commercial poultry farming. Feed serve as the largest cost of operation in agriculture.

Marketing performs the role of bridging special geographical gap by making sure that goods and services are moved from the point of production to the point of consumption. Agricultural marketing is an essential tool for development yet, farmers suffer from a number of difficulties that reduces their bargaining power, as they are deprived of getting the right price for their products. Data was sourced from a total of six cases, including three local and three Foreign. Architectural Data collected was analysed and used in the production of the Architectural design of a Farmer’s Market in Onitsha, Anambra State. Findings revealed that marketing involves several intermediary stages within the process. This often results in the consumer paying an exorbitant price and the producer receiving a lower price for his production. The marketing activity is obstructed by lack of sufficient fund, high cost of transportation, lacking market infrastructures, with little or no aid from government. Efficiency of marketing the crops was determined and problems identified through the movement of produce from producers, through the chain of actors in the markets. With the availability of a Place just for Agricultural produce marketing, there would be a reasonable encouragement to the farmers to display their produce, though they wouldn’t sell as vendors but they will be massive distributors to the market. Therefore, increasing the availability of home-grown foodstuff in Onitsha and the Nation at large. This design answers to the issues experienced in our regular markets, it offers a solution to Congestion of people, vehicular traffic, fire outbreaks, and security. It offers a properly zoned market area.</em></p>\n\nARCHITECTURAL DESIGN OF A FARMERS’ MARKET<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "<h1 class=\"myh1\"><strong> ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN OF A FARMERS’ MARKET</strong></h1>", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Tooth decay was low in pre-agricultural societies, the growth in farming society about 10,000 years ago correlated with an increase with the rate of cavities.  An infected tooth from Italy partially cleaned with flint tools, aged between 13,820 and 14,160 years old, represents the oldest known dentistry.

Ogun State Government in Southwest  Nigeria is not left out in this drive, and thus initiated an integrated public housing programme in 2003 with the assumption that the use of  different strategies  by  different organizations  will result in  the provision of adequate housing and  improved quality of life  for different categories of people in  the State.  In view of the fact that the validity of this assumption has not been formally examined, this research therefore aimed at evaluating public housing in Ogun State, Nigeria, with a view to examining the extent to which  the different housing delivery strategies have provided adequate and satisfactory housing and influenced the quality of life of residents of public housing in the State. <br/>Survey  and qualitative research strategies as well as  proportionate and purposive  sampling <br/>techniques were used  in selecting respondents.  Primary data  was obtained  through the <br/>administration of questionnaire  to 90 purposely selected staff members, and oral  interviews with four senior management staff in  four key public housing agencies. In addition, questionnaire and observation schedule were used in obtaining data from 517  housing units  selected from four different housing delivery strategies based on the proportion  of their occurrence in nine  newly constructed  public  housing  estates. The  quantitative  data was  analysed using frequencies, percentages, cross tabulations,  discriminant, principal component  and categorical regression analyses; while the qualitative data was analysed using content analysis. Findings  show  that  the  four public  housing agencies sampled  were rated as having adequate organizational capacity in public housing provision. However, housing provided by the agencies was  rated affordable,  inadequate and not satisfactory by the residents. Although, public housing estates  sampled  lacked  basic  socio-economic  infrastructure, majority of the respondents felt satisfied with life in their current residences. The  study found significant differences  in  socio-economic characteristics of residents and  levels of housing adequacy and satisfaction across the four strategies. Whereas the Core housing strategy  provided housing for low-income earners and  was rated as having provided the most adequate and satisfactory housing, the Turnkey and Public-Private Partnership (PPP)  strategies provided  the least adequate  and  satisfactory  housing respectively  for middle-income earners.  The  Shell strategy which provided housing for high-income class had the  highest proportion of those who felt  satisfied with  life.  Satisfaction with management of housing estates and housing unit attributes among other attributes discriminated between the residents who were satisfied with life and those who were not.    Housing  unit attributes were rated the most adequate and satisfactory while  socio-economic infrastructure and neighbourhood facilities were rated the least adequate and least satisfactory housing attributes.   <br/>Findings also show that housing delivery strategies, additional space requirement in the housing <br/>units,  organizational capacity as well as age,  income and  tenure  status  of respondents  among others were  significant predicators of  housing adequacy and residential satisfaction  in the study area.  Residential satisfaction, tenure status, housing adequacy, housing delivery strategies, length of residency, income and age of respondents were factors that influenced satisfaction with life in the  housing  estates.  Although  findings of the study  are  consistent with the findings of prior research; the categorical regression analysis (R2<br/> = 1.000, F=718909256; P=0.000) however shows that adequate housing  (Beta=1.000, F=528886811; P=0.000) was  the strongest predictor of, and closely related to,  residential satisfaction; and that housing adequacy and residential satisfaction have significant influence on satisfaction with life. The  findings  imply  that  the different housing delivery strategies used in public housing perform differently in terms of residents' perceived adequacy and satisfaction; the levels of housing adequacy and satisfaction  as well as quality of life in public housing   can be enhanced through adequate  provision and maintenance of basic housing infrastructure and neighbourhood facilities;   housing  adequacy  and satisfaction  can be used as    synonymous concept in the evaluation of housings; and  the underlying assumption in public housing in Ogun State is valid. </div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS </strong><br/>Title Page ------------------ - i <br/>Dedication --------------------------   ii <br/>Certification ------------------------   iii <br/>Dedication --------------------------   iv <br/>Acknowledgement --------------------v <br/>Abstract ---------------------- vi  <br/><br/><strong>Chapter 1     INTRODUCTION </strong><br/>1.0     Background of Study----------------1 <br/> 1.1    Statement of the Problem --------------------3 <br/> 1.2    Aim of Study-----------------6 <br/> 1.3    Objectives of Study-------------------6 <br/>  1.4   Justification-------------------6 <br/>  1.5    Scope of Study--------------8  <br/>  1.6    Summary---------------------8 <br/><br/><strong>Chapter 2     THE CONTEXT OF STUDY---------------10 </strong><br/> 2.0.0 Introduction------------------10 <br/>2.1.0 Basic Information on the study area----------10 <br/>2.1.1 Location and Size of Ogun State--------------10 <br/>  2.1.2 Administrative Setting----------------12 <br/> 2.1.3 Demographics and Socio-economic Characteristics of Ogun State----------12 <br/>2.2.0 Public Housing in Ogun State ----------------14 <br/>    2.2.1 Public Housing in Ogun State: Historical Perspective ---------14 <br/>    2.2.2 The 2003 Ogun State Housing Policy----------16 <br/>    2.2.3 The Public Housing Programme in Ogun State and its Objectives----18 <br/>     2.2.4 Housing Delivery Strategies in the Public Housing Programme------18 <br/>(i) Government Aided Core Housing Strategy --------19 <br/>(ii) Turnkey Housing Delivery Strategy----------------21 <br/>(iii)Public-Private Partnership Housing Delivery Strategy----24 <br/>(iv)  Shell Stage Housing Delivery Strategy-----------26 <br/> 2.3.0 Public Housing Agencies in Ogun State------------28<br/>       2.3.1 Ogun State Housing Corporation--------------29 <br/>2.3.2 Ogun State Property and Investment Corporation------------30<br/>2.3.3 Gateway City Development Company Limited------32 <br/> 2.3.4 Ogun State Ministry of Housing -------------33 <br/>  2.4 Summary-----------------------35 <br/><br/><strong>Chapter 3    REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE---------------36 </strong><br/>  3.0.

{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT </strong></div> Architectural practice has been in existence in Nigeria for more than fifty years and the <br/>earliest introduction of computers by firms  for  operations began in the early 1980s. <br/>Information and communication technology (ICT)  usage is inevitable in all fields  of <br/>endeavours and for professionals in the present era. The study of ICT usage and deployment <br/>therefore becomes imperative. This study aims at providing an understanding of the deployment of  ICT in architectural firms in Nigeria. It specifically examines organizational <br/>and ICT characteristics of the firms; the measure of fit between ICT tools deployed and tasks <br/>engaged; the effect of training programmes on  the availability of  ICT proficient personnel; and  the level of acceptance of Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) in <br/>architectural firms in Nigeria. The Task-Technology Fit model (TTF) and an Extended <br/>Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were  employed to test deployment of four design <br/>technologies (AutoCAD, ArchiCAD, Revit Architecture and SketchUp) and the acceptance <br/>of CSCW. The multistage sampling technique was used to derive the sample drawn from six <br/>cities: Abuja, Kaduna, Maiduguri, Enugu, Lagos and Portharcourt were selected  based on <br/>documented evidence of having the largest number of firms in their zones. A  total of 118 <br/>questionnaires were returned from a total of 159 distributed. This represents a 74.21% return <br/>rate. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, crosstabulations, Chi-<br/>Square tests, exploratory factor analysis,  Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)  and multiple <br/>regression analysis. The study revealed  improvements in the quality and availability of ICT <br/>systems in architectural firms in Nigeria as from 2001.  Internet connectivity and Website <br/>ownership is on the increase in architectural firms. Annual turnover of the architectural firms <br/>has is positively correlated to  the quality of installed systems. The study also found a <br/>relationship between ownership of websites and the date of ICT introduction. The integrated <br/>TTF/TAM test showed levels of fit between tasks engaged in architectural firms and the <br/>design technologies deployed. The model tests explain between  41.4%  -  52.1% of the <br/>residual variation in the production of detailed system product. The  coefficients of <br/>determination  and beta  coefficients  are significant to predict  model  fit  of  deployment. <br/>Reasonable proficiency levels of the staff in the deployment of the available software and <br/>technologies were confirmed. Furthermore firms are getting increasingly involved in <br/>outsourcing as a service delivery strategy. The study revealed that few firms fund training <br/>programmes within their organizations. Most of those that fund training programs commit <br/>lower than a million naira to it annually. The study revealed that there is no  significant <br/>relationship  between the availability of CAD/BIM proficient staff and the existence of <br/>training programmes within the firms. It was also confirmed that there was no  significant <br/>relationship between the availability of CAD/BIM proficient staff  and the training methods <br/>employed by the firms. It was found that there was a  significant  relationship  between the <br/>availability of CAD/BIM proficient staff and the CAD/BIM proficient staff needed.  The <br/>interview responses suggest that the schools of architecture have done much towards <br/>achieving  the availability of CAD/BIM proficient staff. CSCW has been adopted by only <br/>37.3% of the firms and the study revealed that perceived ease-of-use, security and the quality <br/>of installed systems were predictors of the extended TAM model.  In conclusion, the study <br/>recommends  that concerted efforts towards developing network infrastructure especially <br/>broadband access can  improve the practice of outsourcing and also have impact on CSCW. <br/>Quality investment and commitment by technology companies and vendors, firms, the <br/>government and other stakeholders in the area of ICT acquisitions, network security and the <br/>development of user-friendly technologies will surely improve adoption and deployment of <br/>ICT in architectural firms in Nigeria.</div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS </strong><br/>Title

space in their domestic <br/>architecture. Subsequent modifications of the  idea have focused on more precise  revelations <br/>of how the spatial  arrangements of material culture are culturally patterned.  Through a <br/>topological analysis of house plans and patterns, collected from the City of Benin, this study <br/>detects a  transformation  in the house-type  aspired and developed by people  during the last <br/>five centuries.  A group of 1054 houses, located  in four residential zones  in Benin City, Nigeria, has been analysed by means of  frequency distribution,  Space Syntax categories  and factor analysis. <br/>The research is determined  to find out how the use, organization and meaning of space in <br/>Benin have changed and whether or not there are continuities over the years across the entire <br/>City.   The Space Syntax approach is used to measure the varying degree of change at each <br/>stage of the evolution. Here, the \"žspace-activity\"Ÿ interaction is the main idea that enables us to <br/>see what underlies the process. As the old  spaces  take different names and functions in the <br/>new  design, they bring about the recombination of their activities, and when this occurs <br/>repeatedly at each stage, it leaves behind \"žtopological paths\"Ÿ from which the direction of the <br/>evolution can be measured.  Further examinations reveal that the  space-activity interaction <br/>arises both at each partitioned  space and at the collective  space that is closely  related. The <br/>analysis of the attitudes and responses of the residents using factor analysis revealed that both <br/>socio-economic and socio-cultural factors are responsible for the change and continuity in the <br/>domestic space. <br/><br/></div> <div><strong> TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong><br/>Title Page

"<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <blockquote> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> </blockquote> Very little is known about the architectural firms in Nigeria. The  study  thus  explored  the<br/>characteristics of architectural firms  in  Nigeria  empirically  using  the  systems  approach  to  the study of organizations. The study investigated the organizational profiles, cultures,  strategies  and structures of the architectural firms. The tasks and information  technology  characteristics  of  the architectural  firms  as  well  as  the  external  influences  on  the  firms   were   also   investigated, culminating in the investigation of the types of architectural firms that existed in Nigeria.This study thus took an approach which was  exploratory  and  descriptive.  Therefore,  the research  was  mainly  inductive.   The   architectural   practice   was   studied   as   a   professional organization and the architectural firms were  studied  holistically,  taking  the  systems  approach. The  sample  size  was  derived  from  the  list  of  architectural   firms   registered   by   Architects Registration Council of Nigeria (ARCON, 2006). The purposive  and  random  sampling  methods were employed. The survey  and  qualitative  methods  were  used,  with  the  firm  as  the  unit  of analysis. The survey instrument was the structured questionnaire, while the qualitative  instrument was the interview schedule. The  ninety-two  (92)  questionnaires  collected  were  analyzed  using frequencies, cross tabulations, the chi-square test, principal component analysis, the coefficient  of correlation (Pearson's product-moment correlation  coefficient),  Multiple  Analysis  of  Variance, (MANOVA), discriminant analysis, regression analysis and cluster  analysis.   The  data  from  the interview were analyzed using content analysis.<br/>The five types of firms identified by the study included male-dominated firms,  amorphous<br/>firms, conventional firms, stable/ traditional firms and versatile firms.  The most important  causes of differences between the types of architectural firms in Nigeria  were  level  of  specialization  of activities, and varieties of services offered, which accounted for more than half of  the  differences between the firms.<br/>Most of the architectural firms sampled in Nigeria were found  to  be  more  than  ten  (10)<br/>years old, small sized, and owned by a sole principal. They had the culture of innovation,  but  not the culture of aggression in the pursuit of business opportunities or concern for  profit.  The  study found that most of the clients of the architectural firms  were  private  individuals  in  Nigeria  and most of their projects were residential projects. Most of the clients of the architectural  firms  were sourced through personal contact and the projects most of the  firms  carried  out  were  those  that they were able to obtain commissions for. Most of the firms were engaged in projects  which  used the design and build method and these firms were found to  have  more  residential  projects.  Also participation in design and build method appeared to be a survival strategy as  the  firms  that  had existed for more than 15 years did not participate in projects which used  this  method.  The  firms mostly used competence in design, followed by AUTOCAD and information  technology  literacy as criteria for the selection of staff. Findings of the  study  indicated  that  information  technology facilities were highly available in most of the firms, and the internet was mostly used for  sourcing information. The results also suggest that the internet was used as a tool for centralization. <br/>The study further found that the external influences on most of the architectural firms were<br/>not so strong and the greatest influences were those exerted  by  clients,  advances  in  information technology and the national economy.  The  characteristics  of  the  firms  most  affected  by  these external influences were the staff management culture of the firms, the strategic goals of the  firms and the qualification and experience of the principal.<br/>The study concluded that architectural firms need to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunities<br/>provided by information technology to operate on a global level. There is a need  for  architectural schools in Nigeria to fully   integrate  internship  into  the  study  of  architecture  as  well  as  train students extensively in construction  methods  to  meet  the  demands  of  architectural  firms.  The study further concluded that there is a need for the business  training  of  architects  as  this  was  a factor responsible for the success of architectural  firms.  The  systems  approach  to  the  study  of architectural firms had been useful and practical.  More  studies  are  required,  using  the  systems approach, on peculiarities of architectural firms and their management strategies.</div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT </strong>     <br/>  ---------------------------i<br/>Declaration

ARCHITECTURAL FIRMS IN NIGERIA</strong></h1>", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p> INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>Paint Factory or plant is an industrial site, usually consisting of buildings and machinery, or more commonly a complex having several buildings, where workers process raw materials into paint. Factories arose with the introduction of machinery during the industrial revolution when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industry and workshops.</p> <p> Paint is a subdivision of surface coating. It is a relatively opaque solid coating applied as thin layer whose films are usually formed by polymerization of polyunsaturated oil. However, other subdivisions of surface coating include: varnishes (clear coating), enamels (pigmented varnishes), lacquers (film formed by evaporation only), printing inks and polishes. Paints generally have very low thermal conductivity, electrically inert and can be washed and cleaned. The various raw materials for making paints include pigments, vehicle, alkyd resins, surfactants, solvents (thinners) and colouring matters.</p> <p>Paints are classified into two principal types:</p> <p>Resin based paints (Gloss finishes) and Latex based paints (Emulsion paints). The major difference between the two is only in the types of vehicle used and cost.</p> <p> ·         Resin based paints are used for exterior and interior surfaces and are dry to a lustrous or shinny finish.</p> <p> ·         Emulsion (Latex) paint involves the emulsion of 2-phases one of which is water and any other phase.</p> <p>Classically, emulsion is a suspension of one phase in another. Latex paints have as their major film forming constituent synthetic resin latex with or without other film forming constituents added in an oil-water emulsion type system. The continuous phase consists of an alkali – dispersed hydropholic colloid in water and contains two more different types of particles in suspension, styrene –butadeux (SBR) copolymer which was the original quality film former in emulsion paint. Polyvinyl acetate (PVA), acrylic and PVA acrylics copolymers have largely replaced SBR as film former.</p> <p>From these, resins and latex are made objects with a wide range of colours and texture found in household wares, building materials, electrical and electronic appliances, automobile and aeronautics, clothing, building structures etc. in short it s difficult to imagine contemporary society without painting (colours).</p> <p>Paints are the material employed as finishing for other materials. They are used to protect metals, timber and plastered surface from the effect of weather, heat, moisture, gases etc., thereby improving their appearance. Paints are classified into oil, water and cement and bituminom paints. There are also special paints used for special purpose e.g. heat resisting, fire proofing, chlorinated rubber paint etc.</p> <p>Paint factory is regarded as an important or essential industry in many country because of it effect and function in the environment. Finally, this project (paint factory) will help in improving on the face lift of Makurdi as the capital of Benue State as well as the job opportunities which our teeming youths desire.</p> <p> 1.2 STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM</p> <p>In an industrial building of this nature, it is impossible to solve all architectural problems involved. However, every building has a general architectural problem that has to be solved towards the realization of the design. But, there are some specific problems that are unique to individual projects, for example a paint factory.</p> <p> Subsequently, the core problem this project seek to solve is centered on its purpose; a compromise between man and machine.

This is since you have to make sure that your structure preserves its excellent condition so that you can enjoy your investment for a long time. There are many industrial methods that you can do to keep your home or your workspace in good condition, but one of the most effective steps that you should take is to have your walls re-applied with the right paint.</p> <p>For decades now, net and sprays have been the only effective methods for controlling the mosquitoes that causes malaria and dengue. I think by introducing the factory, it will lay more emphasize on protection by inventing a way of embedding pesticide in microcapsule stirred into house paints. And this insecticide will be realized slowly from the paint and will remain effective for two to four years, while spray will be typically re-applied at least every 6 months. The paint will act like a vaccine for houses and buildings.</p> <p> The     minute   amount   of   pesticides   releasedvastatingfromtoinsectthe.   paint   won’t   be</p> <p>  The introduction or provision of paint factory in Makurdi will help to increase the effectiveness of other producing industries around e.g.</p> <p> ·         Most industries producing steel and aluminum building cladding.</p> <p>·         For yatch, small boats and craft, fishing fleets manufacturers.</p> <p>·         For all furniture and plywood industries</p> <p> ·         For most petrochemical plants-protective coating</p> <p>·         For all kinds of vessels that visit Nigeria port.</p> <p>·         For manufacturers of refrigeration, bicycles, other household articles, drums and industrial components –powder paints.</p> <p>·         For building industries etc</p> <p> Therefore, one should realize that this material is utilized in many industries and that such service industry should be established for the propagation of other.</p> <p> Finally, I intend to increase the awareness of this service industry in Nigeria, and s that’whatprompted my motivation towards proposing this project.</p> <p> 1.5 AIMS</p> <p> The ultimate aim of this project is to create, functional, simple, pleasing, economical, orderly, flexible, safe and convenient industrial building –paint factory.</p> <p> And to satisfy the key words of the aims, the following are inevitable:</p> <p>§   To achieve an effective and efficient design for a factory with a serious view to flexibility, adaptability and versatility of the building structures.

Stakeholders and industry operatives in building technology are unanimous in their opinion that the process of housing delivery in Nigeria needs a change of strategy. In this study, the researcher is examining modern ways that could be explored to meet the nation’s housing deficit which stands around 17million units (Akeju, 2012). Although Nigeria with a population of over 160 million people has been identified as the largest market in Africa for everything, including real estate, growing demand for decent shelter has continued to meet leaner supply of housing units.Over the years, successive governments in the country had tinkered with policies in a bid to achieve its mass housing objective but due to lack of reasonable commitment to it, achieving the goal has remained elusive (FRN, 2007). Experts who gave analytical insight into the problem of housing delivery in Nigeria called for a declaration of a state of emergency in the housing sector, saying innovative thinking and modern strategies could bring about better outcomes that will enhance housing delivery process in the country. It is a known fact that financing of housing projects remained one of the biggest problems in the sector that is militating against housing delivery. Akeju (2012) is of the opinion that the major issue in housing delivery is funding, getting appropriate funding. There is money flowing everywhere but the right type of money needed for long term project like housing is not available. Something that can really work for affordable housing can be akin to what the Federal Mortgage Bank offers which cannot go round. Modern strategy in housing delivery in Nigeria will reiterates the government’s priority to tackle overcrowding and the ambitious target to reduce severe overcrowding in rented housing apartments (Bush, 2004). Alongside making funding available for larger homes, with at least higher number of bedrooms, and a long-term commitment to deliver the familysized affordable homes should be identified in a strategic plan for housing delivery (Easton, 2006). There are many strategies needed to facilitate massive housing deliveryin Nigeria but modern and technologically-inspired large scale housing schemes – schemes and sites with thousands of housing units could play a significant role in the delivery of the large number of houses the Nigerians needs.Theexperience of the last 20 years suggests that the level of demand for new homes over the next decade will not be met by piecemeal incremental developments. In Nigeria today, there is a shortage of housing for low-income earners and constantly growing housing demands (due to increase in population) that are not met. Unfortunately, banks are reluctant to provide mortgage facilities to low-income earners. In order to solve the housing/mortgage challenges faced by the Nigeria populace, the Nigerian Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC) was established to promote home ownership and increase the availability and affordability of mortgage loans to Nigerians.In spite of the incorporation of NMRC in June 24, 2013, not much has changed. The apathy of banks towards mortgage transactions still lingers, understandably, because of the risk of default. To buttress this, 66,402 Nigerians applied for mortgages during the recent Nigerian Housing Finance Programme. Only 10,000 Nigerians were selected. However, the interest rates by primary mortgage institutions that participated in the programme were alarming (14.5% -19%).It is suggested that a cue be taken from other countries where the cost of mortgage for first time home buyers are low, with small down payments and easy terms especially, a single digit interest rate. <br/>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The problem of housing delivery is of great concern in many countries. This problem is especially prominent in Nigeria. The challenge as been magnified as a result of a myriad of issues, not least, a high population growth rate, shortage of necessary skills and disintegrated supply chain. There is need for Nigerian government and stakeholders in the building industry to rise up to housing needs of Nigerians in quality and quantity. Some researchers has advocated other modern methods of construction like dry construction has strategy to mass housing delivery. However, the researcher is examining how modern strategies can be used to ensure that the housing need of Nigerians are met.<br/>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The following are the objectives of this study: <br/>1.  To examine the modern strategies that can be used for effective housing delivery. <br/>2.  To determine the effect of modern strategies on housing delivery in Nigeria.<br/>3.  To analyze the factors hindering the use of modern strategies in housing delivery in Nigeria. <br/>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.  What are the modern strategies that can be used for effective housing delivery? <br/>2.  What is the effect of modern strategies on housing delivery in Nigeria? <br/>3.  What are the factors hindering the use of modern strategies in housing delivery in Nigeria? <br/>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The following are the significance of this study: <br/>1.  Outcome of this study will educate stakeholders in the building industry, government and policy makers on the modern strategies that can be used to solve the problems of housing deficit in Nigeria. <br/>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic <br/>1.6   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY <br/>This study on appraisal of modern strategies for housing delivery in Nigeria will cover all the effort and approaches of past and present government of Nigeria at tackling the problem of housing deficit in Nigeria. It will also cover the new approaches and strategies that can be used for mass housing development.<br/>LIMITATION OF STUDY <br/>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview). <br/>Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

It adopted the secondary data sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria covering the period 1985 to 2010. The study employed the modern Time Series of the Ordinary Least Square to test for the relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Nigeria. The results derived infer that there exists a significant relationship between agriculture spending and economic growth. The null hypothesis stated for this study does not hold. What this implies is that agriculture revolution is a determinant to economic growth. Thus, it is important that thegovernment placed greater emphases on this sector by increasing budgetary allocation to agriculture in Nigeria in other meet the recommendations of both Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and African Union (AU). It is recommended that  more funding be provided  for agricultural universities in the country to carry out more research on all aspect of agricultural output, such as livestock, crops, fishing and forestry, crop preservation and also establishment of more research institutes to improve seedling production, encourage the use of irrigation farming system and provision of storage facilities for seasonal products as means of improving the country’s agricultural output.  Further recommendations include the need for the Central Bank of Nigeria to come out with stable policy guideline to enable the commercial banks disburse loans to farmers at a very lower interest rate, in order to help them expand their production capacity. More so, the need for government to encourage more exportation of agricultural output as this in turn will enhance external foreign exchange earnings and improve the competitiveness of Nigerian agricultural produce in the international markets.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The term Agriculture is derived from the Latin words, “ager,” meaning field, and “Cultura”, meaning cultivation. This suggests that the earliest form of production agriculture was crop production (Are, Igbokwe, Asadu, Bawa, 2010; Erebor, 2003). It may be noted that Agriculture is more than crop production. It also includes animal production, processing of primary products (or value addition) and marketing of produce and products. Erebor (2003) defines agriculture as the art and science of cultivating the soil, processing crops and livestock products for man, and the process of selling excess crop and livestock.</p> <p>Meanwhile, (Kricher,1997) defines agriculture in a more advanced way by saying that, agriculture or farming is the simplification of nature’s  food webs and the rechanneling of energy for human planting and animal consumption. To simplify, agriculture involves redirecting nature’s natural flow of the food web. The natural flow of the food web is the sun provides light to plants convert sunlight into sugars which provide food for the plants (this process is called photosynthesis). Plants provide food for herbivores (plant-eating animals) and the herbivores provides food for carnivores (meat-eating animals).  This simple illustration of food web provides the basis for analyzing the impact of agriculture on economic growth.</p> <p>In literature, economic history provides us with ample evidence that agricultural revolution is a fundamental pre-condition for economic growth, especially in developing countries. Development economists have focused on how agriculture can best contribute to overall economic growth and modernization. Todaro and Smith (2003) look at Lewis theory of development, and reported that the underdeveloped economy consisted of two sectors. These sectors are the traditional agricultural sector characterized by zero marginal labour productivity and the modern industrial sector. In Rostow’s linear stages of economic growth, agricultural revolutions is a pre-condition for take-off and take-off stages</p> <p>The importance of a vibrant and robust agriculture is reminiscent on its role in providing employment opportunities for the teeming population, eradicates poverty and contributing to the growth of the economy. The linkage between agriculture and economic growth is well documented in literature (Ogen, 2007; Okongwu, 1986; Atte and Muhammed- Lawal, 2006 to maintain few). According to Izuchukwu (2011), agriculture has been the backbone of the economy in Nigeria providing employment and source of livelihood for the increasing population,it accounts for over half of the GDP of the Nigerian economy as at independence in 1960.</p> <p> However, the role it plays in the regional and economic development of the country has diminished over the years due to the dominant role of the crude oil sector in the economy. With the increasing food demand in Nigeria, the country has available natural resources and potential for increasing the volume of crop production towards meeting the food and nutritional requirement of the rapidly increasing population and guarantee food security in the country. Therefore, the source of national wealth is essentially agriculture.</p> <p>Unquestionably, the neglect of agriculture in Nigeria owing to the discovery of oil has retarded the growth of the economy for the past decades.  The effect of this neglect could be felt in the poor quality of life of people as  average Nigerian was quoted as living in US$ 1 per day; if translated to Naira, this amount to N165 day at present. It may not be wrong to say that such a remark is a political cover. The faces we see daily on our streets and those we may not be able to see because of their inability to muster enough strength to walk up to the street as a result of several days of hunger and starvation, or even food associated ill-health and avoidable deaths of tens of people everyday, a better, more sincere and realistic assessment of the situation would be put an average income at US $0-0.5 per day. Studies in literature reveal that seven out of every 10 Nigerians live in abject poverty; hardly able to feed, cloth or house themselves. It is an indisputable fact that Nigeria and her sub-Saharan African neighbors have been dubiously christened by the world political and economic powers as citadels of hunger, poverty, ignorance, diseases, misery, debts, filths and crises. This unquestionable imagery will for long remain indelible in the world's archives unless a reasonable step is taken by people and Government of this doomed sector of the global village. It is against this backdrop that the study seeks to assess the impact of agriculture on economic growth.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Besides oil, the major strength of the Nigerian economy is its rich agricultural resource base, its human resource and its huge markets. However, these resources have to be effectively mobilized so as to diversify the economic base and reduce dependence on oil and import. The economy remains vulnerable to external shocks emanating from fluctuation in the world prices of crude oil and the rising prices of imports. The resulting external and internal in balances are manifested in the adverse balance of payment position, unemployment and low capacity utilization in virtually all sectors as well as the deteriorating purchasing power of the populace (Atte and Muhammed- Lawal, 2006).</p> <p>The contribution of agriculture to the Nigerian economic growth is very low compared to what it used to be in the past 14 years. Nigerian agriculture to a large extent still possesses the characteristics of a peasant economy that was prominent in the pre-independence period. Given the information above, this study seeks to assess the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Nigeria from 1985-2010</p> <p><strong>1.3     Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Nigeria.</p> <p>However, the study will:</p> <p>1.     Examine the effect of agricultural practice in Nigeria on agricultural productivity.</p> <p>2.     Assess the impact of budgetary allocation and agricultural policies on agricultural productivity.</p> <p>3.     Estimate the trend of growth of agricultural sector in Nigeria since 1985 up to 2010.</p> <p>4.     Determine the relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following questions will guide the study.</p> <p>1.     What is the growth of Agricultural sector between 1985-2010?</p> <p>2.     To what extent has budgetary allocation and agricultural policies affected agricultural productivity in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.     Is there any significant relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.5     Hypothesis of the study</strong></p> <p>The hypothesis of no significant difference will be used to estimate the relationship between agriculture and economic growth.</p> <p><strong>1.6     Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study is relevant in a true sense that it will help to promote agriculture in Nigeria. The study will help bring radical transformation for national growth, especially through its effect on rural incomes and provision of resources for transformation into an industrialized economy. This present study will help policy makers and government to address the challenges of climatic change, global recession and dwindling revenue which threatens food security. The Nigerian populace will benefit from this study because agricultural revolution will be able to provide the quality and quantity of food.</p> <p>Industrial and Manufacturing firms will also benefit from steady supply of raw materials and provide large markets for industrial products. Government will benefit because the study will help it to put political will in promoting agriculture in order to achieve full economic growth in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>1.7     Brief Methodology</strong></p> <p>The study relied on secondary data sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) from 1985 to 2010 reported in their statistical bulletin. It adopted the descriptive and analytical statistics to analyse the data employing different econometric methods such as unit root test, co integration and Error Correction Model among others with the support of E-view statistical package.  The Ordinary Least Square was utilized to test the relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.8     Plan of Study</strong></p> <p>This study was divided into five chapters. Chapter one covers the introduction of the study, the statement of the problem, the objectives of the study, research questions and hypothesis among others. The review of relevant and related studies covering the theories that explain the relationship between agriculture and economic growth are in Chapter two, while Chapter three discusses and explains the analytical framework and methodology adopted for the study. Chapter four concentrated on the empirical result and discussion of the study and Chapter five focuses on the summary, conclusion and recommendations on the basis of the study’s findings.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "<h1 class=\"myh1\"><strong> THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA</strong></h1>", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PAINT FACTORY MAKURDI<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/> INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Paint Factory or plant is an industrial site, usually consisting of buildings and machinery, or more commonly a complex having several buildings, where workers process raw materials into paint. Factories arose with the introduction of machinery during the industrial revolution when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industry and workshops.<br/> Paint is a subdivision of surface coating. It is a relatively opaque solid coating applied as thin layer whose films are usually formed by polymerization of polyunsaturated oil. However, other subdivisions of surface coating include: varnishes (clear coating), enamels (pigmented varnishes), lacquers (film formed by evaporation only), printing inks and polishes. Paints generally have very low thermal conductivity, electrically inert and can be washed and cleaned. The various raw materials for making paints include pigments, vehicle, alkyd resins, surfactants, solvents (thinners) and colouring matters.<br/>Paints are classified into two principal types:<br/>Resin based paints (Gloss finishes) and Latex based paints (Emulsion paints). The major difference between the two is only in the types of vehicle used and cost.<br/> •         Resin based paints are used for exterior and interior surfaces and are dry to a lustrous or shinny finish.<br/> •         Emulsion (Latex) paint involves the emulsion of 2-phases one of which is water and any other phase.<br/> Classically, emulsion is a suspension of one phase in another. Latex paints have as their major film forming constituent synthetic resin latex with or without other film forming constituents added in an oil-water emulsion type system. The continuous phase consists of an alkali – dispersed hydropholic colloid in water and contains two more different types of particles in suspension, styrene –butadeux (SBR) copolymer which was the original quality film former in emulsion paint. Polyvinyl acetate (PVA), acrylic and PVA acrylics copolymers have largely replaced SBR as film former.<br/> From these, resins and latex are made objects with a wide range of colours and texture found in household wares, building materials, electrical and electronic appliances, automobile and aeronautics, clothing, building structures etc. in short it s difficult to imagine contemporary society without painting (colours).<br/>Paints are the material employed as finishing for other materials. They are used to protect metals, timber and plastered surface from the effect of weather, heat, moisture, gases etc., thereby improving their appearance. Paints are classified into oil, water and cement and bituminom paints. There are also special paints used for special purpose e.g. heat resisting, fire proofing, chlorinated rubber paint etc.<br/>Paint factory is regarded as an important or essential industry in many country because of it effect and function in the environment. Finally, this project (paint factory) will help in improving on the face lift of Makurdi as the capital of Benue State as well as the job opportunities which our teeming youths desire.<br/> 1.2 STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM<br/> In an industrial building of this nature, it is impossible to solve all architectural problems involved. However, every building has a general architectural problem that has to be solved towards the realization of the design. But, there are some specific problems that are unique to individual projects, for example a paint factory.<br/> Subsequently, the core problem this project seek to solve is centered on its purpose; a compromise between man and machine. And this involves a careful flow in the synthesis of:<br/> o  Efficient work flow<br/>o Making a statement to the society reflecting the mass production nature of the paint factory. o Advertising the paint products to the society as well as creating a welcome impact.<br/>o  Expressing orderliness and aesthetic appeal.<br/> o   Creating openness in plant to give an impression of attractive working conditions, efficient production and painstaking devotion to the excellence of paint products.<br/> 1.3     OBJECTIVES <br/>The principal objective of this project is to provide an environment capable of meeting the needs of the people of Makurdi and Nigeria as a whole by providing them with a well defined paint factory which is ultra-modern and which will meet their several needs in terms of seeking a solution for good appearance and packaging of good products.<br/> Other objectives include:<br/> §   To create versatile, adaptable and flexible form for easy expansion with minimum damage.<br/> §    To provide a good production layout with no conflict between raw and finished goods and personnel in circulation.<br/>§    To create an ideal factory architecture and to introduce a level of automation in the proposed paint factory in Nigeria.<br/>§   Finally, to help in the state and Federal Government Programme in rural development and this could be achieved through industrial development.<br/>1.4 MOTIVATION<br/>  Establishing a house or a commercial space does not stop at having the edifice erected on a piece of land.

It will also consist of four major paints of an industrial building;<br/>§   Research<br/> §    Manufacturing<br/>  §   Administration and<br/> §    Welfare.<br/> The research includes laboratory and library to investigate and recommend possible way of producing better products and raw materials.<br/> The manufacturing section, according to the manufacturing process, include: dispersion, mixing, sieving and canning.<br/> The administration comprises of offices, personnel and sales while<br/> The welfare section includes the factory cline and staff canteen.<br/> Other components include the maintenance block, staffproducts,anddeliveryvisito bays and yards etc.<br/>  1.7 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>  To really collect important information towards the realization of this project and to make an important contribution to Architecture, some research activities had been carried out and data collected through;<br/>  §   Visits to existing paint factories site of the projects to determine their production processes, organizational chart and determine the requirement and conditions to be fulfilled in the setting up of such factory.<br/> §   Use of libraries, research institute, books, journals and unpublished manuscript of thesis reports.<br/> §   Visits to relevant Government establishment like the ministry of commerce and industry, for collection of data, byelaws, history and other important information.<br/> §   Personal interview of some people.<br/> §    Internet.<br/>  1.8     LIMITATION OF RESEARCH <br/> Due to the limitation of standard paint factories in Nigeria, one is limited to researching with only the small scale private paint factories.<br/>  In researching with the private factories it was discovered that the factories were over protective of their setting. They feared that their competitors might get hold of information given out for the research and have a hold over them. Some of them that co-operated discourage photographs.<br/> Also the fact that the country is not in peace due to the Boko Haram and other threats, the factories are conscious and at the same time trying to protect their life and properties.<br/> Materials on paint factories are not much available in libraries, research institutes, records and documents on paint factories in Nigeria.<br/>  1.9 IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT<br/>  The importance or the breaks through this project hope to achieve are:<br/>  •         To provide a comprehensive setting for paint industry in Nigeria in order to help improve the economy attains technology and industrial independence.<br/> •         To create job opportunities for the increasing labour forces.<br/> •         It will help in saving foreign exchange by providing goods which would have been purchased abroad.<br/>1.10     HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF FACTORY <br/> The factory began with the shop-connected residence as in Ancient Egypt, then the open air workshops and the home the home industry as in Greece. Then, some specialized craft and trades like metal smiting, carpentry, pottery, shoe making were home industry; therefore, operation were in dwelling houses.<br/><br/>\n\nPAINT FACTORY MAKURDI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "<h1 class=\"myh1\"><strong> PAINT FACTORY MAKURDI</strong></h1>", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DOMESTIC AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING: CASE STUDY<br/>MAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING, MARKURDI, BENUE STATE<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>  The subject of airport passenger terminal building must involve a discussion of transportation.<br/> Transportation has remained one of the most vital factors that influence the development of a nation. The credibility of this statement has been proven over the centuries, that if one decides to take a critical look at earlier civilizations, from the time of early Egyptian civilization to the current civilized world, one will discover that many of the great feats achieved during these civilizations would have been impossible without one form of transportation or the other.<br/> By way of definition; transportation (or transport) is the movement of people, animals and  goods from one location to another.  Modes of  transport include  air, rail, road, water, cable, pipeline and  space. The field can be divided into  infrastructure, vehicles and  operations. Transportation is important since it enables trade between people, which in turn establishes civilizations.<br/> Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for transport, including  roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and  pipelines and terminals such as  airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refuelling depots (including fuelling docks and  fuel stations) and  seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.<br/>        Vehicles travelling on these networks may include  automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, people, helicopters and  aircraft. Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including financing, legalities and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.<br/> Transportation can be broadly classified under three broad groups thus:<br/>  Land transportation;<br/> Water transportation; and<br/> Air transportation.<br/>  Land transportation is the most common and dates back to the beginning of civilization. Land transportation can take various forms, which are dependent on the sophistication, stage of civilization and development, and on the technical stratum of the society in question. It can be by the use of animals (camels, mules, horses, dogs, etc.) or by use of machines such as wheelbarrows, carts, cars etc.<br/> Similarly, water transportation dates back a long time as humanity can recall. Water transportation, as land transportation, has also been developed in complexity, technical superiority, and usage.<br/> Air transportation has its origin in the 20th century. The superiority of air transport over the rest can be attributed the reason behind its progressive growth and preference as the safest modern mode of transportation.<br/> 1.1.0 BACKGROUND TO THE PROJECT<br/> The airpot terminal is a building at an airport where passengers transfer between ground transportation and the facilities that allow them to board and disembark from the aircraft. Within the terminal, passengers purchase tickets, transfer their luggage, and go through security. The buildings that provide access to the airplanes (via gates) are typically called concoures. However, the terms terminals and concourses are used interchangably, depending on the configuration of the airport.<br/> Smaller airports have one terminal while larger airports have several terminals and/or concourses. At small airports, the single terminal building typically serves all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse. Some larger airports have one terminal that is connected to multiple concourses via walkways, sky-bridges, or underground tunnels (such as Denver International Airport). Some larger airports have more than one<br/> terminal, each with one or JohnmoreF.KennedyconcoursesAirport).Stillother larger(suchairports haveasmultipleNewterminalsYork��s each of which incorporate the functions of a concourse (such as Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport).<br/> According to Frommers, most airport terminals are built in a plain style, with the concrete boxes of the 1960s and ��70s glass boxes in the ��90s and ��00s, with the best terminalsr,some,suchas makin<br/> Baghdad International Airport, are monumental in stature, while others are considered architectural masterpieces, such as Terminal 1 at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris or Terminal 5 at New York��s John. AFfew. areKennedydesignedtoreflectAirportthecultureofaparticular area, some examples being the terminal at Albuquerque International Sunport in New Mexico, which is designed in the Pueblo Revival Style popularized by architect John Gaw Meem, as well as the one at Bahiasde Huatulco International Airport in Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, which features some palapas that are interconnected to form the airport terminal building.<br/>  Due to the rapid rise in popularity of passenger flight, many early terminals were built in the 1930s–1940s and reflected the popular  art deco style architecture of the time. One such surviving example from 1940 is the  Houston Municipal Airport Terminal. Early airport terminals opened directly onto the  tarmac: passengers would walk or take a bus to their aircraft. This design is still common among smaller airports, and even many larger airports have \"bus gates\" to accommodate aircraft beyond the main terminal building.<br/>   1.2.0 STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM<br/> A functional airport passenger terminal is meant to ease the stress encountered by airpassengers during the process of air travel. Therefore the architectural problem of the project is how best to provide an aesthetically pleasant, efficient, economical, bigger and more modern domestic airport passenger terminal, with good flexibility and expansion capabilities, to replace the outdated and small existing airprot terminal at Makurdi for Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).<br/> 1.3.0  AIMS<br/> The primary aims/goals of the design are as follows:<br/> to provide/design a suitable passenger terminal building in the Makurdi Airport which would potray a good image of Benue State<br/> to provde a passenger terminal building as well as other auxilliary facilities with the necessary tools requisite for air transportation activities as well as upgrade the economic facet of Makurdi city.<br/> to ensure these facilities will streamline the productivity in the airport without interruption or interference from each other or any source; and<br/> to provide a design that will adequately contain all the kinds of functions and activities associated with air travel to be carried out in the airport which will be expanded for this purpose.<br/>       1.4.0 OBJECTIVES<br/>  The principal objective of this project is to provide Makurdi Airport with a ultra-modern, befitting and function passenger airport terminal building which has been badly absent since the construction of that airport and also to upgrade the landscape around it and prescribe other salient facilities which have been omitted.<br/> In appreciation of the particular demands of the project, I opt;<br/> To situate the structure in an ideal location that easily catches eye sight from around the environment and can be easily accessible to staff, air travellers, as well as visitors;<br/> To ensure good road network that create easy flow of vehicular and human traffic;<br/> To consider the environmental consequences as far as they are not a detriment to the proposed development.<br/>  To minimise costs by putting construction techniques, and employing materials within the level of technology that is commensurate with our national aspiration.<br/> To ensure flexibility and adaptability for future changes in use of facilities or space;<br/> To ensure efficient security within and around the facility premises;<br/> To ensure the terminal building, the parking lots and other auxilliary facilities are strategically placed for easy accessibilty from one to the others;<br/> 1.5.0 RESEARCH METHODOLGY<br/>  The required information for proper planning and design of a domestic passenger terminal that will raise the quality and standard of the Makurdi Airport will be obtained through primary data; direct interviews with personnel or representatives of existing airports in Nigeria which basically are FAAN officials, porters on the airport grounds and locals residing around the airport vicinity, case studies, library research, and internet surfing. The emerging ideas and opinions or results are manually organized. On site physical survey will reveal the statistical data inherent of the site venue and will be gainfully utilized.<br/>  1.6.0  PROJECT MOTIVATION<br/>  The Federal Government of Nigeria has, in recent times, moved a motion for the rebranding of the Aviation Industry to upgrade the facilities within airports owned by the Federal Government as well as check the activities of private parastatals within the Aviation Industry. Previously, the airports in the Federation have been either dilapidated or grounded that no aviation activities take place in such airports. It is to this end that the Federal Government has moved to build or renovate existing terminal facilities in the airports within the federation listed below:<br/> Enugu Airport (re-christened Akanu Ibiam International Airport), Enugu, Enugu State;<br/> Gen. Yakubu Gowon Airport, Jos, Plateau State;<br/> Nnamdi 999Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Federal Capital Territory;<br/> Sam Mbakwe Airport, Owerri, Imo State;<br/> Makurdi Airport, Makurdi, Benue State<br/>  1.7.0  SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE PROJECT<br/>  This scope of this thesis is restricted to the passenger terminal building within the airport and NOT the entire airport as a whole. This is to say that the work involves the only the landside of the airport (and not the airside) which includes the terminal building and auxiliary (supporting) facilities within the landside premises. These are briefly listed below:<br/>      v Exterior elements: <br/>    Terminal building;<br/>    Well-defined road network;<br/>    Parking lots;<br/>    Signs;<br/>    Fire station;<br/>    Motel;<br/>v Terminal building: <br/> Entrance hall;<br/> Departure lounge;<br/> Arrivals lounge;<br/> Baggage reclaim hall;<br/> Outbound baggage hall;<br/> Shops and snack bars;<br/> Conveniences;<br/> Supporting office spaces.<br/>   1.8.0  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION<br/>  The passenger terminal building is chosen and located in the Makurdi Airport premises, which is a domestic airport in Makurdi, Benue State, for the following reasons:<br/> The existing terminal building on the site is small and outdated;<br/> Aviation prospects in the state of project location is terribly poor;<br/> The existing facility has no provision for future expansion.<br/>  1.9.0  RELEVANCE OF PROJECT<br/> This rearch will help to contribute and extend the frontiers of knowledge in the academic development of aviation architecture. It also exposes all aspects of professional details and necessary techniques of scientific investigation in this field.<br/> In other words, this guide provides the basic criteria to organize, evaluate, plan, programme and design airport terminal facilities. The information presented is intended to make researchers aware of important design considerations and to aid them in project development.<br/><br/>\n\nDOMESTIC AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING: CASE STUDY MAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING, MARKURDI, BENUE STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "<h1 class=\"myh1\"><strong> DOMESTIC AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING: CASE STUDY MAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING, MARKURDI, BENUE STATE</strong></h1>", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DESIGN OF A GUEST HOUSE <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>For the fact that there are human activities and social functions that always take place within Enugu capital, there is need to establish a hospitality institutions, for instance Guest House.  This project aims at proffering solution to the establishment of Guest House.

In still others, it is a private home which has been converted for the exclusive use of guest accommodation.  The owners usually lives in an entirely separated area within the property and the guest house may serve as a form of lodging business.<br/>        In some areas of the world, guest houses are the only kind of accommodation available for visitors who have no local relatives to say with.  Among the features which distinguish a guest house from a hotel, bed and breakfast, or inn is the lack of a full-time staff.  Bed and breakfasts are usually family owned, with the family living on the premises. Hotels maintain a staff presence 24hours a day and 7days a week, whereas a guest house has a more limited staff presence.  Because of limited staff presence, check in at a guest is often by appointment.  An inn also usually has restaurant attached.<br/>In Japan, tenants in a guest house have to pay a substantial damage deposit, and have to pay a cleaning fee when they leave.<br/>1.2    SIGNIFICANCE OF GUEST HOUSE <br/>As a result of the activities that normally take place in Enugu capital, there is the need to provided hospitality facilities for travelers coming into the state.<br/>It is the intention of this researcher to create awareness on the importance for developing a guest house in an area.<br/>1.    Provision of the facilities for transaction of business, for meeting and conference, for recreation and entertainment.<br/>2.    As an important employer of labour<br/>3.    Development  of local economy of the area it is located due to being an attraction for visitors<br/>1.3    STATEMENT OF THE ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEMS The research intends to proffer solution to the following problems:<br/>Lack of venues for the masses to hold their social functions.<br/>Lack of accommodations that have the qualities of a home<br/>The unavailability of standard facilities in Guest house found in Enugu.<br/>Irregularity in the classification of Guest house by average Nigeria.<br/>1.4    AIMS AND OBJECTIVE <br/>The aim of this project is to create a comfortable and appealing accommodation for guests.  This is done through the provision of:-<br/>Basic standard facilities needed in Guest house.<br/>Environment that is conducive for the occupants.<br/>Individual requirement such as entertainment, exercise and relaxation.<br/>1.5    SCOPE AND DEFINITION  <br/>The scope of this thesis is to focus on the main problematic aspects Guest House design.  These are:<br/>The relationship between spaces.<br/>Circulation system.
