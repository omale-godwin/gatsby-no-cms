The work intends to carryout evaluation on the toilet and bathroom, parking space and landscaping of the governor’s lodge surrounding. In the process it was found out that the lodge was not in good condition. Hence the need to put the evaluated places in good shape was possible. Areas evaluated were the toilet and bathroom, the parking space and the landscape of the lodge. Conclusion was drawn that continuous evaluate will put the governor’s in good condition all times. Therefore, it was recommended that the state government should always carryout evaluation on the lodge and its facilities in period of interval so as to give the lodge new look always.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\n       Lodge is originally a term for a relatively small building, often associated with a larger one. A lodge could be seen as a guesthouse where guests or visitors could be given accommodation. Lodge is a type of hotel-like were lodging activities are done. It may include bar, restaurant, recreational facilities and so on. In every nation or state the president or governor and some of his subordinates do performs their official duties in the government house. Government house may be seen as a place where the governor and some of the subordinate have their offices.  It serves as the venue for the Governor's official business, as well as the many receptions and functions hosted by the occupant. One of the infrastructures in government house is the governor’s lodge (Robert, 2013). A lodge may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Also, it may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), conference and event facilities, tennis and/or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants and social function services.  Governor’s lodge facility offers luxury amenities, service accommodations, on-site restaurant (s) and the highest level of personalized service, such as a concierge, room service and clothes pressing staff (Jack, 2013).\n\nGovernor’s lodge is a kind of guesthouse usually located in the Government House. The lodge is used for hosting visitors such as foreign counter part from other countries that came for business purposes or other social-economic activities, fellow state governors, and others that came for official purposes. When there are official meetings that will extend for days are being held in government house, the governor would host his visitors in the lodge. Therefore, it becomes necessary for the facilities in the lodge to be in good condition because the people that are the guests of the governor are usually people of political hierarchy and personnel. However, in a situation where the facilities in the lodge are not properly working or they are not properly designed to standard it will not be convenient for these people (William, 2013).\n\nTherefore, it becomes necessary to know that all facilities are in good condition and are properly designed. In view of the above the researcher has keen interest in carrying out an evaluation of governor’s lodge in Enugu state, Nigeria with reference to facilities like the toilet and bathroom, parking space and the landscaping.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM                     \nGovernor’s lodge is subjected to renovation or maintenance at particular interval, sometime innovation. The condition of the toilet and bathroom, car park and landscaping in the Governor’s lodge in Enugu state is not encouraging. Agent attention must be taken to correct the lapses at the lodge. Especially the facilities mentioned above.\n\n       This project intends to solve the problems of inconvenience toilet and bathroom, inadequate space for car park and improper landscaping.\n\n1.3  AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n       The aim of this project is to present an evaluation of governor’s lodge in Enugu state, Nigeria.\n\nTherefore, the specific objectives are to evaluate the follow;\n\n1. The toilet and bathroom in governor’s lodge in Enugu state\n\n2. The parking space in governor’s lodge in Enugu state\n\n3. Landscaping of the surrounding in governor’s lodge in Enugu state\n\n4. To improve the present design in governor’s lodge in Enugu state\n\n1.4  RESEARCH QUESTIONS                                \n\n1. How would the toilet and bathroom in governor’s lodge in Enugu state be evaluated?\n\n2. How would the parking space in governor’s lodge in Enugu state be evaluated?\n\n3. How is the Landscaping of the surrounding in governor’s lodge in Enugu state?\n\n4. How would the present design in governor’s lodge in Enugu state be improved?\n\n1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY                      \n\n       The importance of this project cannot be overemphasized. This is because the evaluation process in Governor’s lodge of Enugu state will help to correct several facilities such as the toilet and bathroom, car park and landscaping.   \n\n1.6 SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY   \n The project is focused on the evaluation of Governor’s lodge in Enugu state. The scope of the evaluation process will be limited to toilet and bathroom facilities, car park and landscaping.\n\n1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY                          \n\n       During the period of the project the researcher encountered some difficulties which serve as limitation to the study. These include time frame, lack of cooperation from respondents to be interviewed concerning the subject matter and finance.\nEVALUATION OF GOVERNOR’S LODGE ",

Disaster management deals with situations that occur prior to, during, and after the disaster. Globally, there has been lots of disaster on land, air and sea, though these disasters may be natural or man-made, it has however led to the destruction of lives and properties worth billions of Naira.\n\nIn Nigeria, there have been instance of earth tremors in Ogun state in 1994, several cases of flood has occurred in Nigeria, in July 2012, 363 people killed, over 2,100,000 displaced, Areas affected include, Adamawa, Taraba, Plateau, and Benue state. On 2nd July 2012, many Nigerian coastal and inland cities experienced heavy rains, and residents of Lagos state were \"gasping for breath\" due to the flooding. In addition, there was a gridlock on major roads, causing people to cancel or postpone appointments they may have had. Thousands of stranded commuters had to pay increased fares for the few bus drivers who were willing to risk travelling on the roads, and construction of work by the Nigerian government on the inner Oke-Afa Road took a \"heavy toll.\" In mid-July 2012, flooding in the Ibadan metropolis caused some residents at Challenge, Oke-Ayo, and Eleyele to flee from their residences and save their lives. The flooding also prevented some Christians from attending churches in the morning, while a few bridges caved in. The Nigerian government said that certain structures on waterways had to be demolished as a result of the flooding, while Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Bosun Oladele, announced that there weren't any casualties from the flooding. Although, most of the disasters that Nigerians face are generally preventable, such as aircraft crash, boat mishap, floods, landslides, fire out breaks, oil spillage etc, can actually be prevented.\n\n  \n\nDisaster is an event, natural or man-made, sudden or progressive, which impacts with such severity that the affected community or individual has to respond by taking exceptional measures.\n\nDisaster Management is the systematic observation and analysis of disasters to improve measures relating to prevention, mitigation, preparedness, emergency response and recovery. It is also the range of activities designed to maintain control over disaster and emergency situations and to provide a framework for helping at-risk persons to avoid or recover from the impact of the disaster and deals with situations that occur prior to, during, and after the disaster.\n\nThe term \"Disaster Management\" encompasses the complete realm of disaster-related activities. Traditionally people tend to think of disaster management only in terms of the post-disaster actions taken by relief and reconstruction officials; yet disaster management covers a much broader scope, and many modern disaster managers may find themselves far more involved in pre-disaster activities than in post-disaster response. This is because many persons who work in the development field, or who plan routine economic, urban, regional or agricultural development projects, have disaster management responsibilities. Disaster management also encompasses the field of emergency assistance and long-term maintenance for refugees and displaced persons. The refugee field of disaster management is highly specialized and requires not only many development skills but also a broader awareness of political, legal, and humanitarian issues.\n\nThe project is to design a Disaster Management Centre which will serve as a centre for the operational squad and aid for investigation, assistance and relief of people affected with disasters. The aim of this project is to provide disaster management knowledge and skills to enhance the understanding of good (and bad) disaster preparedness and response and their reasons for them. This project introduces the main principles of Disaster Management, with a focus on disaster response in the developing world.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n \n\n1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n\n THE NEED FOR A DISASTER MANAGEMENT CENTRE\n\nDisaster means a progressive or sudden, widespread or localised, natural or human caused occurrence which causes or threatens to cause; Death, injury or disease, Damage to property, infrastructure or the environment, Disruption of the life of a community; and is of the magnitude that exceeds the ability of those affected by the disaster to cope with its effect using only their own resources. A disaster management centre is needed to:\n\n·         To implement an integrated and coordinate disaster management policy that focuses on preventing or reducing the risk disasters, mitigating the severity of disasters, emergency preparedness, rapid and effective response to disasters and post disaster recovery.\n\n·         To prepare the document that will identify risks, assess risks, risk response development and risk response control.\n\n·         The purpose of centre is to outline policy and procedures for both proactive disaster prevention and the re-active disaster response and mitigation phases.\n\nThe disaster management centre functions are as follows:\n\n·         Must specialise in issues concerning disasters within Rivers State.\n\n·         Act as a repository and conduit for information concerning disasters.\n\n·         Must perform it functions and exercise powers as stipulated section 44 of the Disaster Management Act, 57 of 2002.\n\n·         Must liaise and co-ordinate its activities with those of National, State Management centres.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEMS\n\nArchitecture is an abstraction from nature and intuition with possibilities of aesthetic accompaniments for overall ambient satisfaction (Fashuyi, 2004). Nevertheless, this ideological perception must graft with sensitive issues bordering on culture, economy before Architecture can become acceptable in its right values. However, Architectural Education in Nigeria as presently structured is not responsive to her socio-economic environment. In fact, it is more suited to problems of urban environment of prosperous economies having nothing in common with the cultural and economic features of the country (Adesina, 1987). Architectural Education in Nigeria was inherited from the Beaux-Art concept of Western educational philosophy through the colonial mentors. This tendency is to provide aesthetically satisfying buildings, irrespective of function.\n\nThe design of the Disaster Management Centre will take into cognisance proper functional relationship between each section of the building to another; the site is located at an area that can be easily accessible from various parts of the state, helicopters are also available to ease rescue in parts of the states that cannot be easily assessable by land, the structure is responsive to the socio-economic environment in the state, the structure is aesthetically satisfying, the structure conforms to the building codes and zoning.\n\nTherefore architectural problems of the Disaster Management Centre Are as follows:\n\n·         The integration of architectural purpose, site, suitable spaces, technical systems and materials.\n\n·         Inadequate ventilation and natural lightening\n\n·         Primary and secondary circulation in and around the site.\n\n1.3 MOTIVATION\n \n\nDisaster Management is an enormous task. Disasters are not confined to any particular location; neither do they disappear as quickly as they appear. Therefore, it is imperative that there is proper management to optimize efficiency of planning and response. Due to limited resources, collaborative efforts at the governmental, private and community levels are necessary. This level of collaboration requires a coordinated and organized effort to mitigate against, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies and their effects in the shortest possible time.\n\nThe motivation of this project steams from:\n\n·         The absolute necessity for such a project: Over the years, lives have been lost in natural and man-made disaster primarily due to absence of a disaster management centre or slow response of rescue team.\n\n·         The wealth of knowledge, which the project adds to existing information on architectural building types.\n\n·         The sense of comfort and security inspired by the project, being from the riverine area in the Niger Delta region where the terrain is difficult and inter-city transport is mostly done by boat, the potential for boat mishaps is rather high.\n\n·         To reduce subsequent insurance claims and compensation on government and insurance companies.\n\n·         The passion to create an avenue that will aid for relief to all disaster victims.\n\n·         To create awareness for the need of disaster management.\n\n 1.4 AIMS\n\n·         To provide a facility that will improve response to disasters for an initial period after which other sources would assist.\n\n·         To reduce confusion on the part of all personnel concern in disasters.\n\n·         To enhance the role of rapid deployment of its personnel in response to emergency\n\n·         Preventing or reducing the risk of disasters and mitigating the severity or consequences of disasters\n\n·         A rapid and effective response to disasters and post- disaster recovery and rehabilitation.\n\n·         To ensure the survival of the maximum possible number of victims, keeping them in the best possible health in the circumstances.\n\n·         To re-establish self-sufficiency and essential services as quickly as possible for all population groups, with special attention to those whose needs are greatest: the most vulnerable and underprivileged.\n\n·         To repair or replace damaged infrastructure and regenerate viable economic activities. To do this in a manner that contributes to long-term development goals and reduces vulnerability to any future recurrence of potentially damaging hazards.\n\n·         In cases involving population displacements (due to any type of disaster) the aim is to find durable solutions as quickly as possible, while ensuring protection and assistance as necessary in the meantime.\n\n 1.5 OBJECTIVES\n\n·         To create a building for imparting training in disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness, relief and rehabilitation and also to undertake research studies, documentation and development of database.\n\n·         Organize state and regional level conferences/workshops in disaster management and related subjects.\n\n·           To develop and encourage NGO's network in the state to manage disasters in the state.\n\n·         to reduce or avoid the human, physical, and economic losses suffered by individuals, by the society, and by the country at large\n\n·         To reduce personal suffering and to speed recovery.\n\n 1.10    SCOPE OF PROJECT:\n\nThis project provides, to a satisfactory level, all the facilities that are needed in the disaster management centre for optimum performance\n\nto manage disaster. There are provisions for effective control, relief and rescue of disasters by mitigating, preparedness, response and recovery.\n\nThe scope of the project is limited to the following;\n\n·         The design of the Administrative building\n\n·         The clinic\n\n·         A staff residential building\n\n·         Hanger for helicopter\n\n1.10.1  THE SITE:\n\n This project involves the design of a Centre that aids for Disaster Management, thus, due to the amphibiotic nature of its function, the facility would require a site that enhances the marine and land base operation, and hence, it is located within the southern section of Port Harcourt. It can also be accessible through various pedestrian routes emanating from the neighbouring residential zones. This will be dutifully respected in the cause of designing.\n\nThe site is in close proximity to the State secretariat, the Nigerian marine base, Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, Orobum Vimmage (now called Obunabali). Ogbunabali bound the site on the East, the far North by Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, to the West by the Amadi flat and old GRA Residential Quarters and the South by Marine Base.\n\nThe exterior element in the site include\n\n·         Parking lots\n\n·      Sign post\nDISASTER MANAGEMENT CENTRE",

        "content": " MAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING\n(Architecture Project Topics & Materials)\n\n\nMAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING, MARKURDI, BENUE STATE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe subject of airport passenger terminal building must involve a discussion of transportation.\n\nTransportation has remained one of the most vital factors that influence the development of a nation. The credibility of this statement has been proven over the centuries, that if one decides to take a critical look at earlier civilizations, from the time of early Egyptian civilization to the current civilized world, one will discover that many of the great feats achieved during these civilizations would have been impossible without one form of transportation or the other.\n\nBy way of definition; transportation (or transport) is the movement of people, animals and goods from one location to another. Modes of transport include air, rail, road, water, cable, pipeline and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and operations. Transportation is important since it enables trade between people, which in turn establishes civilizations.\n\nTransport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for transport, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refuelling depots (including fuelling docks and fuel stations) and seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.\n\nVehicles travelling on these networks may include automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, people, helicopters and aircraft. Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including financing, legalities and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.\n\nTransportation can be broadly classified under three broad groups thus:\n\nLand transportation;\n\nWater transportation; and Air transportation.\n\nLand transportation is the most common and dates back to the beginning of civilization. Land transportation can take various forms, which are dependent on the sophistication, stage of civilization and development, and on the technical stratum of the society in question. It can be by the use of animals (camels, mules, horses, dogs, etc.) or by use of machines such as wheelbarrows, carts, cars etc.\n\nSimilarly, water transportation dates back a long time as humanity can recall. Water transportation, as land transportation, has also been developed in complexity, technical superiority, and usage.\n\nAir transportation has its origin in the 20th century. The superiority of air transport over the rest can be attributed the reason behind its progressive growth and preference as the safest modern mode of transportation.\n\n1.1.0 BACKGROUND TO THE PROJECT\n\nThe airpot terminal is a building at an airport where passengers transfer between ground transportation and the facilities that allow them to board and disembark from the aircraft. Within the terminal, passengers purchase tickets, transfer their luggage, and go through security. The buildings that provide access to the airplanes (via gates) are typically called concoures. However, the terms terminals and concourses are used interchangably, depending on the configuration of the airport.\n\nSmaller airports have one terminal while larger airports have several terminals and/or concourses. At small airports, the single terminal building typically serves all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse. Some larger airports have one terminal that is connected to multiple concourses via walkways, sky-bridges, or underground tunnels (such as Denver International Airport). Some larger airports have more than one terminal, each with one or more concourses (such as New York‟s John F. Kennedy Airport). Still other larger airports have multiple terminals each of which incorporate the functions of a concourse (such as Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport).\n\nAccording to Frommers, most airport terminals are built in a plain style, with the concrete boxes of the 1960s and ‟70s generally gave way to glass boxes in the ‟90s and ‟00s, with the best terminals making a vague stab at incorporating ideas of light and air. However, some, such as\n\nBaghdad International Airport, are monumental in stature, while others are considered architectural masterpieces, such as Terminal 1 at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris or Terminal 5 at New York‟s John F. Kennedy Airport. A few are designed to reflect the culture of a particular area, some examples being the terminal at Albuquerque International Sunport in New Mexico, which is designed in the Pueblo Revival Style popularized by architect John Gaw Meem, as well as the one at Bahiasde Huatulco International Airport in Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, which features some palapas that are interconnected to form the airport terminal building.\nMAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING",

It is provided with or without cooking or dining or both facilities. Residential building includes one or two story or multi-family dwelling, lodging or rooming houses, dormitories, and apartment houses.\n\nThe residential building can be owned by an individual or co-operative association. Each resident or resident household has membership in the co-operative association. In non-equality co-operative members have occupancy right to a specific suite within the housing co-operative as outlined in their “occupancy agreement” or “proprietary lease” which is essentially a lease. In ownership co-operatives occupancy rights are transferred to the purchaser by way of the title transfer.\n\nThe major function of the residential building is for the accommodation, both for private and the public users.\n\nDue to th aforementioned reasons, there is need for well construction of the residential structure, with the materials that will be capable of resisting both direct and indirect forces and the weathering effects, not just for a moment but for the long lasting time, hence the use of concrete is being adapted. \n\nConcrete can be defined as a hard, strong construction materials consisting of sand, conglomerate gravel, pebbles, broken stones, or slag in a motor or cement mixture. It is also known as the mass formed by the coalescence or particles.\n\nConcrete could also be defined as the mixture of gravel, pebbles or broken stone with cement or with tar, etc, used for sidewalks, roadways, foundations, etc and especially for submarine structure.\n\nSome many issues has lead to the construction of different types of building like bungalow and high rise building in order to save money.\n\nAccording to an economist that says human wants is unlimited and that there are limited resources with which wants can be satisfied. And this has lead to the absolute maximization and utilization of the said available resources to man which include fixed and liquid assets. This is one of the reasons why the conservation of land to safe place was adapted, which led to the construction of high rise building in town and mostly in well developed countries, for the fact that human being resides in, and other valuables are kept in these buildings; safely of the structure under all forces that may be applied must be guaranteed.\n\nRecently, reinforced concrete has proven to be the cheapest retail that can effectively resist these forces like (wind force, direct force and indirect force) and other force that may be applied within the building, which can be found into various shape.\n\nThe need for the forces stability of this structure under these factors has brought a challenge to the engineer; hence the reinforced concrete design is concern.\n\nAIM AND OBJECTIVE\n\nThe reinforced concrete uses extra materials like steel bars, wooden beams or fibers, along with a wire frame to help mold the concrete and ensure the safe construction under the worst condition of the force that may be applied within and outside the building.\n\nThe reinforcement interacts with the concrete, strengthening it and providing support houses and other structures. The concrete provide shielding for the steel so it doesn’t corrode as quickly and together they are a common component in the modern construction.\n\nTherefore, this project is aimed in ensuring the safety of life and property based on the use of limit state design code (BS 8110) in understanding the problem that is involved in design and resolving same appropriately. It also aimed in knowing the members of the structure and its weight and the steps taken in achieving the internal and external forces and proper way of applying the reinforcement for the proper structural stability.\n\nIts objective includes knowing that concrete tends to be brittle, breaking easily under sudden stress and crumbling under the influence time and weather. This makes it difficult to use traditional concrete structures intended to hold a large amount of weight or last a long time. Reinforced concrete on the other hand can hold much more weight and does not wear as easily. Hence most structure built today use reinforced concrete.\n\nUses\n\nThe reinforced concrete is used in large scale construction such as bridges and skyscrapers. It was first created for building construction in the mid 1800s, and soon spread across both Europe and America. Most major building built by the beginning of the 1900s was created with reinforced concrete.\n\nConsideration: Reinforced concrete   is subjected to the same principles as normal concrete, and the quality depends on the mixture of the cement and how well it is set. The extra material used will also cost more, especially if steel bars are used instead of wood or recycled fiber alternatives. However, the glass and fiber alternatives can present difficulties on their own by becoming weaker in a fire.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nReinforced concrete is concrete in which the reinforcement bars (rebels) reinforcement girders, plates or fibers have been incorporate to strengthen the concrete in tension. It was the concrete that is reinforced with steel or iron is called a reinforced concrete only. Other materials used to reinforced concrete can be organic and inorganic fibers as well as composite in different forms. Prior to the invention of reinforcement, concrete was strong in compression, but weak in tension. Adding reinforcement crucially increases the strength in tension. The failure strain of concrete in tension is so low that the reinforcement has to hold the concrete sections together.\n\nFor a strong ductile and durable construction, the reinforcement needs to have the following properties.\n\nHigh strength\n\nHigh tensile strain\n\nGood bond to the concrete\n\nThermal compatibility\n\nDurability in the concrete environment.\n\nIn most cases, reinforced concrete uses steel rebels that have been inserted to add strength. Concrete is reinforced to give it extra tensile strength; without reinforcement, many concrete building would not have been possible.\n\nReinforced concrete can compasses many members or types of structures and components which includes:\n\nSlabs\n\nWalls\n\nBeams\n\nColumns\n\nFoundations\n\nFrames and more\n\nReinforced concrete can be classified as (1) pre-cast and (2) in-situ concrete.\n\nReinforced concrete is focused mainly on the floor system. Designing   and implementing the most efficient floor system is key to creating optimal building structures, small changes in the design of a floor can have a significant impact on material cost; construction schedule, ultimate strength, operating costs, occupancy levels and end use of building.\n\nREINFORCEMENT AND TERMINOLOGY OF MEMBERS\n\nIt is found that the architectural drawing has been thoroughly examined and right systems of design have been chosen. In this modern computer age, the easiest way to carry out design is by computer method, but the system of manual method is still use to arrive at the same point going through all the worst critical members of the structure by using the factors like\n\n          Ly/Lx  ≤  2.0 for two-way slab\n\n          Ly/Lx  ≥  2.0 for one-way spacing\n\nThe load on this slab is being estimated using the appropriate moments data, shears, torsion, the reinforcement are calculated using the appropriate method of provided by design code.\n\n          The moment coefficients given in the code and moment distribution method were employed in the determination of slabs and beam moments while the analyses of the substitute frame were used for columns.\n\nBeams bending in small curvature at the outer face (tensile face) of the curvature the concrete experiences tensile stresses while at the inner face, (compressive face) it experiences the compressive stress.\n\nThe slab and beam and also the roof structure causes axial load on the column.\n\nReinforcement are been provided to each of the members after deign using the appropriate chart from design codes.\n\nThe column transfers loads from slab and beam down to the foundation and distribute same to the soil.\n\nThe shear reinforcement where also calculated providing the reinforcement with the appropriate table approved by design code in respects of the value gotten. The shear reinforcement is in form of links, stirrup where also provided where necessary.\n\nSCOPE AND LIMITATION\n\nOn the process to ensure that a structure is safe and of the standard required, this project have been designed accordingly based on the rules stipulated in limit state design  as provided by the code of practice  BS 8110. Therefore, some instances are referenced to other codes of practice.\n\nIn this project, the total members of beams which were analyzed representing typical cases of the whole structure and designed.\n\nThree footing wear design together with stairs and its value were provided in details drawing and theory.\n\nArtificial engineering materials made form a mixture of Portland cement, water, fine and coarse aggregate and small amount of air. It is the most widely used construction materials in the world and must be properly treated.\n\nConcrete is the only major building material that can be delivered to the site and care must be taken to avoid fake materials. The unique quality of concrete makes concrete desirable as a building material can be molded virtually to any forms of shape. Concrete provide a wide latitude in the surface texture and colours and can be used to construct a wide variety of structures such as highway  and streets, bridges, large buildings, airports runways, irrigation structures, breakwater, pier and docks, sidewalks silos and farm building, homes and even barges and ships.\n\nThe two major component of concrete are cement paste and inert materials. Under normal conditions, concrete grows stronger as it grow older. The chemical reactions between cement and water that cause the paste to harden and bind the aggregates together requires time. Therefore proper materials have to be chosen at the time of construction in order to achieve a stable structure.\n\nLIMIT STATE DESIGN BS 8110\n\nBS 8110 is a British standard for the design and construction of reinforced and pre - stressed concrete structure.\n\nThis theory came into existence as a result of the discrepancies between the behaviour of materials by elastic analysis and that which occur in practice.\n\nAlthough BS 8110 is used for most civil engineering and building structures, bridges and water-retaining structures, this are covered by separate standards of (BS 5400 and BS 8007).\n\nLimit sate design requires the structure to satisfies two principal criteria, that is the Ultimate Limit State (ULS)  and the serviceability Limit State (SLS). A limit state is a set of performance criteria (eg. vibration level, deflection, strength, stability, buckling, twisting, collapse) that must be met when the structure is subjected to loads. This later leads to checks for the protection for instance deflection and cracks checks.\nTHE EFFECT OF REINFORCED CONCRETE ON SAFETY OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN NIGERIA",

A megacity status is conferred by the United Nations on cities with a population of 10 million and above. Building and preserving a model mega city comes with great challenges. Providing a sufficient amount of infrastructure and other necessities that would accommodate the needs of over 18 million people could be daunting (Ayeni, 2008).\n\nBy 2025, officials and population analysts agreed that the number of people in the city and in the surrounding communities, especially, in Ogun State axis, would leap to 30 million. Prominent among the challenges are housing, infrastructure and transportation, particularly in more than 10 local government areas (LGAs) that made up of the state, excluding local council development areas (LCDAs). Besides, the notorious traffic jams, choking pollution, inadequate supply of potable water, insecurity and absence or inadequate social and economic needs of the people pose more challenges. Apart from series of efforts put in place by government through several urban renewal programs, the uncontrolled influx of people from virtually every states of Nigeria, including neighboring countries, such as Benin Republic, Togo, Ghana and others, is heightening the fear that the next few years would provoke a daunting task for the authority (Tim, 2003).\nIt has been observed that in some houses in Lagos metropolis, septics are channeled directly into the drain. The government is, therefore, challenged to invest heavily in the protection of the environment through urban renewal programs in order to avert environmental abuse and its consequences. People migrate from villages to the city-centre, without adequate understanding of reality on ground. Here, culture comes into play, such as open defecation as being done in the village, spreading of clothes publicly and cooking exercise in any open place, among others which is frustrating the efforts of the state government at transforming the city through urban renewal programs. Official admitted that planned urban renewal is a major challenge in an emerging model city like Lagos (Batley, 2003). Prior to the current urban regeneration efforts by the government, Lagos used to be referred to as a jungle of various emerging slums. However, a systematic urban development and slum renewal programme, in partnership with several development agencies, has since been put in place to reverse the trend being a major remedy to combat the menace characterized by urbanization. Consequently, various model city plans that included Ikeja Model Plan, Victoria Island/Ikoyi Model City Plan, Lekki Comprehensive Land Use and Infrastructure Master Plan have been completed while Mainland Central Model City Plan Badagry Draft Master Plan and Alimosho Master Plan have been concluded, while others are at various stages of execution. However, in order to give the urban renewal programme a legal backing, the Lagos State Model City Development Law was enacted in 2009 while the State Urban and Regional Planning Law were signed on July 7, 2010.\n\nAccording to Lindan (1993), certainly, a megacity requires a stronger financial base. The sheer size of funding required in sustaining a megacity is beyond what a government could provide on its own. To this end, Kadiri was of the view that both federal and Ogun state governments should support Lagos in her efforts to sustain the challenges involved as a result of its mega status through the urban renewal programmes. According to Ogunleye, for the fact that many of the old slum areas are not in hidden locations make it easier for government to incorporate them in its urban renewal programmes. The formation of new slums is prevented but people’s influx is however not controllable in Lagos State, knowing full well that no legislation that frown against migration to the city. But government will do well if it opens up new settlement with the necessary infrastructure put in place. Although, government has embarked on infrastructure renewal projects that include the execution of on-going projects such as the light rail scheme from Orile to Mile 2, the redevelopment of the Lagos-Badagry expressway into ten lanes incorporating BRT lanes and light rails, on-going reconstruction of the Mile 12-Ikorodu road incorporating BRT lanes, the recently commissioned Ejigbo- Ajao Estate link bridge, recovery and redevelopment of loops hitherto used by criminals as hide-outs among others could only become feasible with a sustained system of funding. Notwithstanding the profoundness of these projects, it appears that much still need to be done to meet the need of millions of commuters on daily basis.\n\nThe condition of the environment also constitutes a major challenge to the Lagos megacity city. Lagos, for instance, generates 10,000 tonnes of waste daily, almost three times higher than what the whole of Ghana generates daily. Also, the kind of industrial pollution experienced in Lagos is second to none in the country. Maintenance of law and order is another major challenge of the Lagos mega city. Though a mega city status is conferred on a city as a result of population growth, building and sustaining a model mega city is not a tea party as reflected in the Lagos experience. In the case of Lagos, a major challenge, however, is how to cope with the ever-increasing population of Lagos with its attendant consequences on infrastructure\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nThis study considers the solution to the challenges of Lagos mega-cities characterized by urbanization as an effective urban renewal programme. This approach is aimed at providing housing, environmental policies and planning strategies appropriate for facing the challenges of the urban growth and development. A megacity is usually defined according to the United Nation as a metropolitan area with a total population in excess of 10 million people. Some definitions also set a minimum level for population density (at least 2,000 persons/square km). A megacity can be a single metropolitan area or more metropolitan, depending on the definitions and boundaries being used. However, the researcher will provide an overview about urban renewal programme as a remedy to Lagos Mega city challenges.\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n    To examine the challenges of the Lagos mega city.\n    To identify the urban renewal programmes put in place by government of Lagos State in addressing Mega city challenges.\n    To determine the effectiveness of urban renewal programmes in Lagos State.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n    What are the challenges of the Lagos mega city?\n    What are the urban renewal programmes put in place by government of Lagos State in addressing Mega city challenges?\n    What is the effectiveness of urban renewal programmes in Lagos State?\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n    The outcome of this study will educate the general public on how an effective urban renewal programmes can curb mega city challenges. This will also sensitize the policy makers on the need to introduce an urban renewal programme in controlling issue related to megacity problems in their territory.\n    This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\nThis study on infrastructure renewal programmes as a remedy to Lagos mega city challenges will cover all the programmes set up by the Lagos State government at tackling infrastructural challenges created as a result of the mega city. This study will also cover the issues leading to infrastructural decay in the State.\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\nTime constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

        "content": " THE ROLE OF DRY CONSTRUCTION IN ENSURING AFFORADABLE HOUSES IN NIGERIA\n(Architecture Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nTHE ROLE OF DRY CONSTRUCTION IN ENSURING AFFORADABLE HOUSES IN NIGERIA\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\nWith Nigeria’s capital expenditure profile put at 24 per cent of recurrent expenditure in 20 14, falling price of crude oil and a high cost of funds for execution of capital projects, the construction industry in Nigeria is obviously under pressure to evolve more time and cost efficient system of construction to ensure affordable housing in Nigeria.\nThe importance of housing in human history cannot be overemphasized. Housing is seen as one of the best indicators of a person’s standard of living and of his or her place in society (UNCHS, 1993). Housing and building conditions also reflect the living standards of a society (Venkatarama, 2004). Thus, the importance of access to adequate and affordable housing took the front burner in the mid 20th century. Most Nigerian don’t have access to decent housing units due to the cost occasioned by the cost of building materials. This has led to various researches into development of the new and innovative dry construction techniques to enhance access to housing for all.\nThe new construction technology which is based on dry construction system which are manufactured from cement, quartz sand, cellulose, natural calcium and water, are processed by autoclave (drying process under high pressure and temperature) for durability and dimensional stability. They are manufactured into boards. The boards which come in various sizes and thicknesses between 6mm and 20mm, are manufactured under strict quality control and international standards.\nDescribing the dry construction system as a modern building system which tends to translate the building process into an industrial process, Le (2014) said the system is more versatile and faster construction method that allows up to 70 per cent construction time saving possible when compared with the traditional wet construction using bricks and blocks. He added that whatever the design idea the Architect can conceive, the dry construction system can achieve, pointing out that various reference building projects using the boards now abound in Nigeria.\nThis system, unlike the traditional brick and block method requires minimum use of water. The system generates minimum construction waste and dry construction buildings have much better preserve room temperature and they are energy efficient. The use of timber associated with the traditional construction is avoided with dry construction, and the system impacts positively on reducing deforestation.\nLower dry construction load impacts on minimum excavation, less soil disturbance. The system compliments better the green building idea for modern construction world over. In additional, the system is a lightweight construction. It is about 10 times less in weight compared to equivalent blocks and mortar construction, resulting to savings in foundation and structural costs.\nDry construction for eave solution has also proved to be a much viable solution with lower self-weight, faster and better technical finishes. Dry construction building boards have a high fire resistance rating and good acoustic and thermal properties. It is also a moisture and pest resistance solution. Explaining that skill-gap is a major challenge for dry construction, Le (2014) noted that some companies in Nigeria who are in partnership with other stakeholders with skills in dry construction technology to put in motion machinery for skill acquisition with regular trainings to ensure the technology is domicile with the Nigerian populace, adding that customers’ perception is another challenge to address, while efforts are in top gear towards continuous education about the modern system of building.\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nVarious researchers are of the opinion that with the demand for housing in Nigeria growing at a geometric rate while housing provision is at arithmetic rate, there is obvious need to evolve a more practical method of achieving mass housing development in the country. Dry construction presents an excellent opportunity to government at all levels and the primary mortgage institutions to guarantee speedy provision of mass and affordable housing in Nigeria. The researcher is of the view that dry construction technology will provide for building professionals and contractors a viable alternative to the traditional wet construction method with blocks and bricks and concrete. However, this study will examine the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable housing in Nigeria.\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n    To examine the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable houses in Nigeria.\n    To examine the process involved in dry construction system.\n    To determine the factor limiting the use of dry construction system for building development in Nigeria.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n    What is the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable houses in Nigeria?\n    What is the process involved in dry construction system?\n    What are the factors limiting the use of dry construction system for building development in Nigeria?\n\n1.5   HYPOTHESIS\nHO: Dry construction system cannot be use as a means for the provision of affordable houses for Nigerian.\nHA: Dry construction system can be used as a means for the provision of affordable houses for Nigerian.\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n    The outcome of this study will educate professionals in building technology and other stakeholders in the building industry on the need for active innovative development with the use of dry construction system with the view of ensuring the provision of affordable houses for Nigerians.\n    This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\nThis study on the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable houses in Nigeria will cover all the process involved in the use of dry construction system with a view of determining approaches that can be adopted in the delivery of sustainable mass housing for Nigerians.\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\nTime constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

        "content": " MAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING, MARKURDI, BENUE STATE\n(Architecture Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nMAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING, MARKURDI, BENUE STATE\n\nINTRODUCTION The subject of airport passenger terminal building must involve a discussion of transportation. Transportation has remained one of the most vital factors that influence the development of a nation. The credibility of this statement has been proven over the centuries, that if one decides to take a critical look at earlier civilizations, from the time of early Egyptian civilization to the current civilized world, one will discover that many of the great feats achieved during these civilizations would have been impossible without one form of transportation or the other. By way of definition; transportation (or transport) is the movement of people, animals and goods from one location to another. Modes of transport include air, rail, road, water, cable, pipeline and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and operations. Transportation is important since it enables trade between people, which in turn establishes civilizations. Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for transport, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refuelling depots (including fuelling docks and fuel stations) and seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance. Vehicles travelling on these networks may include automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, people, helicopters and aircraft. Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including financing, legalities and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode. Transportation can be broadly classified under three broad groups thus: Land transportation; Water transportation; and Air transportation. Land transportation is the most common and dates back to the beginning of civilization. Land transportation can take various forms, which are dependent on the sophistication, stage of civilization and development, and on the technical stratum of the society in question. It can be by the use of animals (camels, mules, horses, dogs, etc.) or by use of machines such as wheelbarrows, carts, cars etc. Similarly, water transportation dates back a long time as humanity can recall. Water transportation, as land transportation, has also been developed in complexity, technical superiority, and usage. Air transportation has its origin in the 20th century. The superiority of air transport over the rest can be attributed the reason behind its progressive growth and preference as the safest modern mode of transportation. 1.1.0 BACKGROUND TO THE PROJECT The airpot terminal is a building at an airport where passengers transfer between ground transportation and the facilities that allow them to board and disembark from the aircraft. Within the terminal, passengers purchase tickets, transfer their luggage, and go through security. The buildings that provide access to the airplanes (via gates) are typically called concoures. However, the terms terminals and concourses are used interchangably, depending on the configuration of the airport. Smaller airports have one terminal while larger airports have several terminals and/or concourses. At small airports, the single terminal building typically serves all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse. Some larger airports have one terminal that is connected to multiple concourses via walkways, sky-bridges, or underground tunnels (such as Denver International Airport). Some larger airports have more than one terminal, each with one or more concourses (such as New York‟s John F. Kennedy Airport). Still other larger airports have multiple terminals each of which incorporate the functions of a concourse (such as Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport). According to Frommers, most airport terminals are built in a plain style, with the concrete boxes of the 1960s and ‟70s generally gave way to glass boxes in the ‟90s and ‟00s, with the best terminals making a vague stab at incorporating ideas of light and air. However, some, such as Baghdad International Airport, are monumental in stature, while others are considered architectural masterpieces, such as Terminal 1 at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris or Terminal 5 at New York‟s John F. Kennedy Airport. A few are designed to reflect the culture of a particular area, some examples being the terminal at Albuquerque International Sunport in New Mexico, which is designed in the Pueblo Revival Style popularized by architect John Gaw Meem, as well as the one at Bahiasde Huatulco International Airport in Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, which features some palapas that are interconnected to form the airport terminal building.\nMAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING, MARKURDI, BENUE STATE",

        "content": " PROPOSED POULTRY FEED MILL PROCESSING FACTORY\n(Architecture Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\n \n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe project envisages the establishment of a plant for the production of poultry feed with a capacity of 2500 tons per annum. Poultry feed it’s a balanced feed which aids proper development of chicks and pullet. Poultry feed mill processing factory provided opportunity of employment to the unemployed people of the proposed area. The state requirement of poultry feed is met through local production. The principal raw materials required are maize, rice polish, rice bran, groundnut cake, soya beans, fish meal, vitamin and salt. All the raw materials are locally available except vitamin which is to be imported. The project will create backward linkage with the agricultural and Agro-processing Sectors and forward linkage with poultry sector and also generated income for the government term of tax revenue and pay-roll tax. This enable the growth poultry industry to utilize the weed of the economic development of the area and the state.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.0       BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nThe proposed poultry feed mill processing factory is to be sited at autabalefi in karu local government area of Nasarawa State.\n\nThis project will enhance the use of local indigenous available raw materials in Nasarawa state and its environment, thus boosting the working ability of farmer and providing employed people and also generating revenues for local communities. Poultry feed mill are mixture of various ingredients such as maize, rice bran, grandaunt cakes molasses, soya beans cake, fish meals, corn etc. the composition of poultry feed can be varied depending on the availability of various raw materials such as carbohydrate, protein, vitamins and minerals.\n\nBalanced feed it very essential for proper growth of divides and pullets and hence use for feeding others domesticated birds such as chickens, turkey, ducks, geese etc at which also increase the output of broiler/eggs. Feed for poultry mostly consist of grain, a portion of commercial feed, typical around quarter, is known as bulk and it indigestible. The amount of bulk is referred to as bulk density.\n\nThe quantity of feed and the nutritional requirements of the feed depend on the weight and the age of the poultry as well as the season. Healthy poultry required a sufficient amount of protein and carbon-hydrate along with the necessary vitamins, dietary minerals and an adequate supply of water certain diets also required the use of grit, tiny rocks as process of granite in the feed. Grit aids in digestion by grinding ford as it passes through the gizzard. Grit is not needed if commercial feed is used. The poultry feed must remain clean and dry; contaminated feed can infect poultry. Damp feed en-courage fungal growth disease can be avoided with proper maintenance of the feed and feeders. The use of poultry feed can be supplemented with food find through foraging in industrial agricultural. Machinery is used to automate the feeding process, reducing the cost and increasing the scale of farming for commercial poultry farming. Feed serve as the largest cost of operation in agriculture.

        "content": " ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN OF A FARMERS’ MARKET\n(Architecture Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\n“Market” is an area or setting in which price making forces (demand and supply) operates. Marketing performs the role of bridging special geographical gap by making sure that goods and services are moved from the point of production to the point of consumption. Agricultural marketing is an essential tool for development yet, farmers suffer from a number of difficulties that reduces their bargaining power, as they are deprived of getting the right price for their products. Data was sourced from a total of six cases, including three local and three Foreign. Architectural Data collected was analysed and used in the production of the Architectural design of a Farmer’s Market in Onitsha, Anambra State. Findings revealed that marketing involves several intermediary stages within the process. This often results in the consumer paying an exorbitant price and the producer receiving a lower price for his production. The marketing activity is obstructed by lack of sufficient fund, high cost of transportation, lacking market infrastructures, with little or no aid from government. Efficiency of marketing the crops was determined and problems identified through the movement of produce from producers, through the chain of actors in the markets. With the availability of a Place just for Agricultural produce marketing, there would be a reasonable encouragement to the farmers to display their produce, though they wouldn’t sell as vendors but they will be massive distributors to the market. Therefore, increasing the availability of home-grown foodstuff in Onitsha and the Nation at large. This design answers to the issues experienced in our regular markets, it offers a solution to Congestion of people, vehicular traffic, fire outbreaks, and security. It offers a properly zoned market area.\nARCHITECTURAL DESIGN OF A FARMERS’ MARKET",

An infected tooth from Italy partially cleaned with flint tools, aged between 13,820 and 14,160 years old, represents the oldest known dentistry. The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 BC. An IVC site in Mehrgarh indicates that this form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead crafters. The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective. The earliest dental filling, made of beeswax, was discovered in Slovenia and dates from 6500 years ago…\n\n AIM OF THE STUDY\n\nThe aim is to design a functional and befitting modern dental clinic that will meet up with acceptable architectural and structural standards which can receive national acclaim.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nThe objectives of this project include;\n\n    To design a facility that will functionally and aesthetically fulfill the need for a standard modern dental clinic in Enugu State.\n    To design a modern dental clinic that naturally meets up with both architectural and structural standards.\n    To provide spaces that are large enough to accommodate the workers and equipments/machinery and encourage a seamless overlap between the two.\n    To contribute to the architectural beauty of the area and the appreciation of the built environment.\n    Provision of adequate spaces for various dental treatments.\n\nDESIGN OF A DENTAL CLINIC",

        "content": " EVALUATION OF PUBLIC HOUSING\n(Architecture Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n  ABSTRACT \n\nGovernments all over the world are taking steps to address the problem of providing adequate and affordable housing to their people. Ogun State Government in Southwest  Nigeria is not left out in this drive, and thus initiated an integrated public housing programme in 2003 with the assumption that the use of  different strategies  by  different organizations  will result in  the provision of adequate housing and  improved quality of life  for different categories of people in  the State.  In view of the fact that the validity of this assumption has not been formally examined, this research therefore aimed at evaluating public housing in Ogun State, Nigeria, with a view to examining the extent to which  the different housing delivery strategies have provided adequate and satisfactory housing and influenced the quality of life of residents of public housing in the State. \nSurvey  and qualitative research strategies as well as  proportionate and purposive  sampling \ntechniques were used  in selecting respondents.  Primary data  was obtained  through the \nadministration of questionnaire  to 90 purposely selected staff members, and oral  interviews with four senior management staff in  four key public housing agencies. In addition, questionnaire and observation schedule were used in obtaining data from 517  housing units  selected from four different housing delivery strategies based on the proportion  of their occurrence in nine  newly constructed  public  housing  estates. The  quantitative  data was  analysed using frequencies, percentages, cross tabulations,  discriminant, principal component  and categorical regression analyses; while the qualitative data was analysed using content analysis. Findings  show  that  the  four public  housing agencies sampled  were rated as having adequate organizational capacity in public housing provision. However, housing provided by the agencies was  rated affordable,  inadequate and not satisfactory by the residents. Although, public housing estates  sampled  lacked  basic  socio-economic  infrastructure, majority of the respondents felt satisfied with life in their current residences. The  study found significant differences  in  socio-economic characteristics of residents and  levels of housing adequacy and satisfaction across the four strategies. Whereas the Core housing strategy  provided housing for low-income earners and  was rated as having provided the most adequate and satisfactory housing, the Turnkey and Public-Private Partnership (PPP)  strategies provided  the least adequate  and  satisfactory  housing respectively  for middle-income earners.  The  Shell strategy which provided housing for high-income class had the  highest proportion of those who felt  satisfied with  life.  Satisfaction with management of housing estates and housing unit attributes among other attributes discriminated between the residents who were satisfied with life and those who were not.    Housing  unit attributes were rated the most adequate and satisfactory while  socio-economic infrastructure and neighbourhood facilities were rated the least adequate and least satisfactory housing attributes.   \nFindings also show that housing delivery strategies, additional space requirement in the housing \nunits,  organizational capacity as well as age,  income and  tenure  status  of respondents  among others were  significant predicators of  housing adequacy and residential satisfaction  in the study area.  Residential satisfaction, tenure status, housing adequacy, housing delivery strategies, length of residency, income and age of respondents were factors that influenced satisfaction with life in the  housing  estates.  Although  findings of the study  are  consistent with the findings of prior research; the categorical regression analysis (R2\n = 1.000, F=718909256; P=0.000) however shows that adequate housing  (Beta=1.000, F=528886811; P=0.000) was  the strongest predictor of, and closely related to,  residential satisfaction; and that housing adequacy and residential satisfaction have significant influence on satisfaction with life. The  findings  imply  that  the different housing delivery strategies used in public housing perform differently in terms of residents' perceived adequacy and satisfaction; the levels of housing adequacy and satisfaction  as well as quality of life in public housing   can be enhanced through adequate  provision and maintenance of basic housing infrastructure and neighbourhood facilities;   housing  adequacy  and satisfaction  can be used as    synonymous concept in the evaluation of housings; and  the underlying assumption in public housing in Ogun State is valid. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nTitle Page ------------------ - i \nDedication --------------------------   ii \nCertification ------------------------   iii \nDedication --------------------------   iv \nAcknowledgement --------------------v \nAbstract ---------------------- vi  \n\nChapter 1     INTRODUCTION \n1.0     Background of Study----------------1 \n 1.1    Statement of the Problem --------------------3 \n 1.2    Aim of Study-----------------6 \n 1.3    Objectives of Study-------------------6 \n  1.4   Justification-------------------6 \n  1.5    Scope of Study--------------8  \n  1.6    Summary---------------------8 \n\nChapter 2     THE CONTEXT OF STUDY---------------10 \n 2.0.0 Introduction------------------10 \n2.1.0 Basic Information on the study area----------10 \n2.1.1 Location and Size of Ogun State--------------10 \n  2.1.2 Administrative Setting----------------12 \n 2.1.3 Demographics and Socio-economic Characteristics of Ogun State----------12 \n2.2.0 Public Housing in Ogun State ----------------14 \n    2.2.1 Public Housing in Ogun State: Historical Perspective ---------14 \n    2.2.2 The 2003 Ogun State Housing Policy----------16 \n    2.2.3 The Public Housing Programme in Ogun State and its Objectives----18 \n     2.2.4 Housing Delivery Strategies in the Public Housing Programme------18 \n(i) Government Aided Core Housing Strategy --------19 \n(ii) Turnkey Housing Delivery Strategy----------------21 \n(iii)Public-Private Partnership Housing Delivery Strategy----24 \n(iv)  Shell Stage Housing Delivery Strategy-----------26 \n 2.3.0 Public Housing Agencies in Ogun State------------28\n       2.3.1 Ogun State Housing Corporation--------------29 \n2.3.2 Ogun State Property and Investment Corporation------------30\n2.3.3 Gateway City Development Company Limited------32 \n 2.3.4 Ogun State Ministry of Housing -------------33 \n  2.4 Summary-----------------------35 \n\nChapter 3    REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE---------------36 \n  3.0.

        "content": " INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) DEPLOYMENT IN ARCHITECTURAL FIRMS IN NIGERIA\n(Architecture Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\nABSTRACT \nArchitectural practice has been in existence in Nigeria for more than fifty years and the \nearliest introduction of computers by firms  for  operations began in the early 1980s. \nInformation and communication technology (ICT)  usage is inevitable in all fields  of \nendeavours and for professionals in the present era. The study of ICT usage and deployment \ntherefore becomes imperative. This study aims at providing an understanding of the deployment of  ICT in architectural firms in Nigeria. It specifically examines organizational \nand ICT characteristics of the firms; the measure of fit between ICT tools deployed and tasks \nengaged; the effect of training programmes on  the availability of  ICT proficient personnel; and  the level of acceptance of Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) in \narchitectural firms in Nigeria. The Task-Technology Fit model (TTF) and an Extended \nTechnology Acceptance Model (TAM) were  employed to test deployment of four design \ntechnologies (AutoCAD, ArchiCAD, Revit Architecture and SketchUp) and the acceptance \nof CSCW. The multistage sampling technique was used to derive the sample drawn from six \ncities: Abuja, Kaduna, Maiduguri, Enugu, Lagos and Portharcourt were selected  based on \ndocumented evidence of having the largest number of firms in their zones. A  total of 118 \nquestionnaires were returned from a total of 159 distributed. This represents a 74.21% return \nrate. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, crosstabulations, Chi-\nSquare tests, exploratory factor analysis,  Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)  and multiple \nregression analysis. The study revealed  improvements in the quality and availability of ICT \nsystems in architectural firms in Nigeria as from 2001.  Internet connectivity and Website \nownership is on the increase in architectural firms. Annual turnover of the architectural firms \nhas is positively correlated to  the quality of installed systems. The study also found a \nrelationship between ownership of websites and the date of ICT introduction. The integrated \nTTF/TAM test showed levels of fit between tasks engaged in architectural firms and the \ndesign technologies deployed. The model tests explain between  41.4%  -  52.1% of the \nresidual variation in the production of detailed system product. The  coefficients of \ndetermination  and beta  coefficients  are significant to predict  model  fit  of  deployment. \nReasonable proficiency levels of the staff in the deployment of the available software and \ntechnologies were confirmed. Furthermore firms are getting increasingly involved in \noutsourcing as a service delivery strategy. The study revealed that few firms fund training \nprogrammes within their organizations. Most of those that fund training programs commit \nlower than a million naira to it annually. The study revealed that there is no  significant \nrelationship  between the availability of CAD/BIM proficient staff and the existence of \ntraining programmes within the firms. It was also confirmed that there was no  significant \nrelationship between the availability of CAD/BIM proficient staff  and the training methods \nemployed by the firms. It was found that there was a  significant  relationship  between the \navailability of CAD/BIM proficient staff and the CAD/BIM proficient staff needed.  The \ninterview responses suggest that the schools of architecture have done much towards \nachieving  the availability of CAD/BIM proficient staff. CSCW has been adopted by only \n37.3% of the firms and the study revealed that perceived ease-of-use, security and the quality \nof installed systems were predictors of the extended TAM model.  In conclusion, the study \nrecommends  that concerted efforts towards developing network infrastructure especially \nbroadband access can  improve the practice of outsourcing and also have impact on CSCW. \nQuality investment and commitment by technology companies and vendors, firms, the \ngovernment and other stakeholders in the area of ICT acquisitions, network security and the \ndevelopment of user-friendly technologies will surely improve adoption and deployment of \nICT in architectural firms in Nigeria.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nTitle Page

Subsequent modifications of the  idea have focused on more precise  revelations \nof how the spatial  arrangements of material culture are culturally patterned.  Through a \ntopological analysis of house plans and patterns, collected from the City of Benin, this study \ndetects a  transformation  in the house-type  aspired and developed by people  during the last \nfive centuries.  A group of 1054 houses, located  in four residential zones  in Benin City, Nigeria, has been analysed by means of  frequency distribution,  Space Syntax categories  and factor analysis. \nThe research is determined  to find out how the use, organization and meaning of space in \nBenin have changed and whether or not there are continuities over the years across the entire \nCity.   The Space Syntax approach is used to measure the varying degree of change at each \nstage of the evolution. Here, the \"žspace-activity\"Ÿ interaction is the main idea that enables us to \nsee what underlies the process. As the old  spaces  take different names and functions in the \nnew  design, they bring about the recombination of their activities, and when this occurs \nrepeatedly at each stage, it leaves behind \"žtopological paths\"Ÿ from which the direction of the \nevolution can be measured.  Further examinations reveal that the  space-activity interaction \narises both at each partitioned  space and at the collective  space that is closely  related. The \nanalysis of the attitudes and responses of the residents using factor analysis revealed that both \nsocio-economic and socio-cultural factors are responsible for the change and continuity in the \ndomestic space. \n\n TABLE OF CONTENTS\nTitle Page ----------.------------------------------------------------------. \nDeclaration----------------------------------------------------------------.i

        "content": " A CRITICAL STUDY OF THE PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS OF ARCHITECTURAL FIRMS IN NIGERIA\n(Architecture Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\n    ABSTRACT\n\nVery little is known about the architectural firms in Nigeria. The  study  thus  explored  the\ncharacteristics of architectural firms  in  Nigeria  empirically  using  the  systems  approach  to  the study of organizations. The study investigated the organizational profiles, cultures,  strategies  and structures of the architectural firms. The tasks and information  technology  characteristics  of  the architectural  firms  as  well  as  the  external  influences  on  the  firms   were   also   investigated, culminating in the investigation of the types of architectural firms that existed in Nigeria.This study thus took an approach which was  exploratory  and  descriptive.  Therefore,  the research  was  mainly  inductive.   The   architectural   practice   was   studied   as   a   professional organization and the architectural firms were  studied  holistically,  taking  the  systems  approach. The  sample  size  was  derived  from  the  list  of  architectural   firms   registered   by   Architects Registration Council of Nigeria (ARCON, 2006). The purposive  and  random  sampling  methods were employed. The survey  and  qualitative  methods  were  used,  with  the  firm  as  the  unit  of analysis. The survey instrument was the structured questionnaire, while the qualitative  instrument was the interview schedule. The  ninety-two  (92)  questionnaires  collected  were  analyzed  using frequencies, cross tabulations, the chi-square test, principal component analysis, the coefficient  of correlation (Pearson's product-moment correlation  coefficient),  Multiple  Analysis  of  Variance, (MANOVA), discriminant analysis, regression analysis and cluster  analysis.   The  data  from  the interview were analyzed using content analysis.\nThe five types of firms identified by the study included male-dominated firms,  amorphous\nfirms, conventional firms, stable/ traditional firms and versatile firms.  The most important  causes of differences between the types of architectural firms in Nigeria  were  level  of  specialization  of activities, and varieties of services offered, which accounted for more than half of  the  differences between the firms.\nMost of the architectural firms sampled in Nigeria were found  to  be  more  than  ten  (10)\nyears old, small sized, and owned by a sole principal. They had the culture of innovation,  but  not the culture of aggression in the pursuit of business opportunities or concern for  profit.  The  study found that most of the clients of the architectural firms  were  private  individuals  in  Nigeria  and most of their projects were residential projects. Most of the clients of the architectural  firms  were sourced through personal contact and the projects most of the  firms  carried  out  were  those  that they were able to obtain commissions for. Most of the firms were engaged in projects  which  used the design and build method and these firms were found to  have  more  residential  projects.  Also participation in design and build method appeared to be a survival strategy as  the  firms  that  had existed for more than 15 years did not participate in projects which used  this  method.  The  firms mostly used competence in design, followed by AUTOCAD and information  technology  literacy as criteria for the selection of staff. Findings of the  study  indicated  that  information  technology facilities were highly available in most of the firms, and the internet was mostly used for  sourcing information. The results also suggest that the internet was used as a tool for centralization. \nThe study further found that the external influences on most of the architectural firms were\nnot so strong and the greatest influences were those exerted  by  clients,  advances  in  information technology and the national economy.  The  characteristics  of  the  firms  most  affected  by  these external influences were the staff management culture of the firms, the strategic goals of the  firms and the qualification and experience of the principal.\nThe study concluded that architectural firms need to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunities\nprovided by information technology to operate on a global level. There is a need  for  architectural schools in Nigeria to fully   integrate  internship  into  the  study  of  architecture  as  well  as  train students extensively in construction  methods  to  meet  the  demands  of  architectural  firms.  The study further concluded that there is a need for the business  training  of  architects  as  this  was  a factor responsible for the success of architectural  firms.  The  systems  approach  to  the  study  of architectural firms had been useful and practical.  More  studies  are  required,  using  the  systems approach, on peculiarities of architectural firms and their management strategies.\nTABLE OF CONTENT      \n  ---------------------------i\nDeclaration  ---------------------------ii\nCertification--------------------------iii\nDedication   --------------------------iv\nAcknowledgement   ------------------------v\nAbstract --------------------------vi\nTable of Content---------------------viii\nList of Tables   ------------------------xiv\nList of Figure   ------------------------xvi\nList of Plates   ------------------------xx\nAppendices ------------------------xxi\nCHAPTER ONE         INTRODUCTION\n1.

        "content": " PAINT FACTORY\n(Architecture Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n\nPaint Factory or plant is an industrial site, usually consisting of buildings and machinery, or more commonly a complex having several buildings, where workers process raw materials into paint. Factories arose with the introduction of machinery during the industrial revolution when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industry and workshops.\n\n Paint is a subdivision of surface coating. It is a relatively opaque solid coating applied as thin layer whose films are usually formed by polymerization of polyunsaturated oil. However, other subdivisions of surface coating include: varnishes (clear coating), enamels (pigmented varnishes), lacquers (film formed by evaporation only), printing inks and polishes. Paints generally have very low thermal conductivity, electrically inert and can be washed and cleaned. The various raw materials for making paints include pigments, vehicle, alkyd resins, surfactants, solvents (thinners) and colouring matters.\n\nPaints are classified into two principal types:\n\nResin based paints (Gloss finishes) and Latex based paints (Emulsion paints). The major difference between the two is only in the types of vehicle used and cost.\n\n ·         Resin based paints are used for exterior and interior surfaces and are dry to a lustrous or shinny finish.\n\n ·         Emulsion (Latex) paint involves the emulsion of 2-phases one of which is water and any other phase.\n\nClassically, emulsion is a suspension of one phase in another. Latex paints have as their major film forming constituent synthetic resin latex with or without other film forming constituents added in an oil-water emulsion type system. The continuous phase consists of an alkali – dispersed hydropholic colloid in water and contains two more different types of particles in suspension, styrene –butadeux (SBR) copolymer which was the original quality film former in emulsion paint. Polyvinyl acetate (PVA), acrylic and PVA acrylics copolymers have largely replaced SBR as film former.\n\nFrom these, resins and latex are made objects with a wide range of colours and texture found in household wares, building materials, electrical and electronic appliances, automobile and aeronautics, clothing, building structures etc. in short it s difficult to imagine contemporary society without painting (colours).\n\nPaints are the material employed as finishing for other materials. They are used to protect metals, timber and plastered surface from the effect of weather, heat, moisture, gases etc., thereby improving their appearance. Paints are classified into oil, water and cement and bituminom paints. There are also special paints used for special purpose e.g. heat resisting, fire proofing, chlorinated rubber paint etc.\n\nPaint factory is regarded as an important or essential industry in many country because of it effect and function in the environment. Finally, this project (paint factory) will help in improving on the face lift of Makurdi as the capital of Benue State as well as the job opportunities which our teeming youths desire.\n\n 1.2 STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM\n\nIn an industrial building of this nature, it is impossible to solve all architectural problems involved. However, every building has a general architectural problem that has to be solved towards the realization of the design. But, there are some specific problems that are unique to individual projects, for example a paint factory.\n\n Subsequently, the core problem this project seek to solve is centered on its purpose; a compromise between man and machine. And this involves a careful flow in the synthesis of:\n\n o  Efficient work flow\n\no Making a statement to the society reflecting the mass production nature of the paint factory. o Advertising the paint products to the society as well as creating a welcome impact.\n\no  Expressing orderliness and aesthetic appeal.\n\no   Creating openness in plant to give an impression of attractive working conditions, efficient production and painstaking devotion to the excellence of paint products.\n\n 1.3     OBJECTIVES\n\nThe principal objective of this project is to provide an environment capable of meeting the needs of the people of Makurdi and Nigeria as a whole by providing them with a well defined paint factory which is ultra-modern and which will meet their several needs in terms of seeking a solution for good appearance and packaging of good products.\n\n Other objectives include:\n\n§   To create versatile, adaptable and flexible form for easy expansion with minimum damage.\n\n§    To provide a good production layout with no conflict between raw and finished goods and personnel in circulation.\n\n§    To create an ideal factory architecture and to introduce a level of automation in the proposed paint factory in Nigeria.\n\n§   Finally, to help in the state and Federal Government Programme in rural development and this could be achieved through industrial development.\n\n1.4 MOTIVATION\n\n  Establishing a house or a commercial space does not stop at having the edifice erected on a piece of land. This is since you have to make sure that your structure preserves its excellent condition so that you can enjoy your investment for a long time. There are many industrial methods that you can do to keep your home or your workspace in good condition, but one of the most effective steps that you should take is to have your walls re-applied with the right paint.\n\nFor decades now, net and sprays have been the only effective methods for controlling the mosquitoes that causes malaria and dengue. I think by introducing the factory, it will lay more emphasize on protection by inventing a way of embedding pesticide in microcapsule stirred into house paints. And this insecticide will be realized slowly from the paint and will remain effective for two to four years, while spray will be typically re-applied at least every 6 months. The paint will act like a vaccine for houses and buildings.\n\n The     minute   amount   of   pesticides   releasedvastatingfromtoinsectthe.   paint   won’t   be\n\n  The introduction or provision of paint factory in Makurdi will help to increase the effectiveness of other producing industries around e.g.\n\n ·         Most industries producing steel and aluminum building cladding.\n\n·         For yatch, small boats and craft, fishing fleets manufacturers.\n\n·         For all furniture and plywood industries\n\n ·         For most petrochemical plants-protective coating\n\n·         For all kinds of vessels that visit Nigeria port.\n\n·         For manufacturers of refrigeration, bicycles, other household articles, drums and industrial components –powder paints.\n\n·         For building industries etc\n\n Therefore, one should realize that this material is utilized in many industries and that such service industry should be established for the propagation of other.\n\n Finally, I intend to increase the awareness of this service industry in Nigeria, and s that’whatprompted my motivation towards proposing this project.\n\n 1.5 AIMS\n\n The ultimate aim of this project is to create, functional, simple, pleasing, economical, orderly, flexible, safe and convenient industrial building –paint factory.\n\n And to satisfy the key words of the aims, the following are inevitable:\n\n§   To achieve an effective and efficient design for a factory with a serious view to flexibility, adaptability and versatility of the building structures. Therefore, the aim is to realize a purely functional planning with a specific purpose of smooth and maximum efficient working\n\n of the different machineries, the administration of the complex and the overall production.\n\n§   To create a system that will allow personnel; operational and administrative to enjoy efficient and pleasant working environment.\n\n §   To provide efficient circulation system between the individual units of the factory and within the layout as a whole thereby facilitating easy movement and assemblage of raw materials and distribution of finished products.\n\n§   To enhance the psychology of workers towards efficiency by creating an aesthetical industrial architecture.\n\n §    To reflect the use to which the factory is to be put into which will be in form of an advertisement for the products.\n\n §   There will be a deviation from the old idea which emphasizes much on mass to a modern approach which gives emphasis on lines and planes (volume).\n\n1.6     SCOPE OF WORK\n\n The factory will undertake on mass production basis, the manufacture of paints and other paint products. It will also consist of four major paints of an industrial building;\n\n§   Research\n\n §    Manufacturing\n\n §   Administration and\n\n §    Welfare.\n\nThe research includes laboratory and library to investigate and recommend possible way of producing better products and raw materials.\n\n The manufacturing section, according to the manufacturing process, include: dispersion, mixing, sieving and canning.\n\n The administration comprises of offices, personnel and sales while\n\n The welfare section includes the factory cline and staff canteen.\n\n Other components include the maintenance block, staffproducts,anddeliveryvisito bays and yards etc.\n\n  1.7 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\n  To really collect important information towards the realization of this project and to make an important contribution to Architecture, some research activities had been carried out and data collected through;\n\n§   Visits to existing paint factories site of the projects to determine their production processes, organizational chart and determine the requirement and conditions to be fulfilled in the setting up of such factory.\n\n§   Use of libraries, research institute, books, journals and unpublished manuscript of thesis reports.\n\n§   Visits to relevant Government establishment like the ministry of commerce and industry, for collection of data, byelaws, history and other important information.\n\n§   Personal interview of some people.\n\n§    Internet.\n\n  1.8     LIMITATION OF RESEARCH\n\nDue to the limitation of standard paint factories in Nigeria, one is limited to researching with only the small scale private paint factories.\n\n  In researching with the private factories it was discovered that the factories were over protective of their setting. They feared that their competitors might get hold of information given out for the research and have a hold over them. Some of them that co-operated discourage photographs.\n\n Also the fact that the country is not in peace due to the Boko Haram and other threats, the factories are conscious and at the same time trying to protect their life and properties.\n\n Materials on paint factories are not much available in libraries, research institutes, records and documents on paint factories in Nigeria.\n\n 1.9 IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT\n\n The importance or the breaks through this project hope to achieve are:\n\n  ·         To provide a comprehensive setting for paint industry in Nigeria in order to help improve the economy attains technology and industrial independence.\n\n·         To create job opportunities for the increasing labour forces.\n\n·         It will help in saving foreign exchange by providing goods which would have been purchased abroad.\n\n1.10     HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF FACTORY\n\nThe factory began with the shop-connected residence as in Ancient Egypt, then the open air workshops and the home the home industry as in Greece. Then, some specialized craft and trades like metal smiting, carpentry, pottery, shoe making were home industry; therefore, operation were in dwelling houses.\nPAINT FACTORY",

Stakeholders and industry operatives in building technology are unanimous in their opinion that the process of housing delivery in Nigeria needs a change of strategy. In this study, the researcher is examining modern ways that could be explored to meet the nation’s housing deficit which stands around 17million units (Akeju, 2012). Although Nigeria with a population of over 160 million people has been identified as the largest market in Africa for everything, including real estate, growing demand for decent shelter has continued to meet leaner supply of housing units.Over the years, successive governments in the country had tinkered with policies in a bid to achieve its mass housing objective but due to lack of reasonable commitment to it, achieving the goal has remained elusive (FRN, 2007). Experts who gave analytical insight into the problem of housing delivery in Nigeria called for a declaration of a state of emergency in the housing sector, saying innovative thinking and modern strategies could bring about better outcomes that will enhance housing delivery process in the country. It is a known fact that financing of housing projects remained one of the biggest problems in the sector that is militating against housing delivery. Akeju (2012) is of the opinion that the major issue in housing delivery is funding, getting appropriate funding. There is money flowing everywhere but the right type of money needed for long term project like housing is not available. Something that can really work for affordable housing can be akin to what the Federal Mortgage Bank offers which cannot go round. Modern strategy in housing delivery in Nigeria will reiterates the government’s priority to tackle overcrowding and the ambitious target to reduce severe overcrowding in rented housing apartments (Bush, 2004). Alongside making funding available for larger homes, with at least higher number of bedrooms, and a long-term commitment to deliver the familysized affordable homes should be identified in a strategic plan for housing delivery (Easton, 2006). There are many strategies needed to facilitate massive housing deliveryin Nigeria but modern and technologically-inspired large scale housing schemes – schemes and sites with thousands of housing units could play a significant role in the delivery of the large number of houses the Nigerians needs.Theexperience of the last 20 years suggests that the level of demand for new homes over the next decade will not be met by piecemeal incremental developments. In Nigeria today, there is a shortage of housing for low-income earners and constantly growing housing demands (due to increase in population) that are not met. Unfortunately, banks are reluctant to provide mortgage facilities to low-income earners. In order to solve the housing/mortgage challenges faced by the Nigeria populace, the Nigerian Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC) was established to promote home ownership and increase the availability and affordability of mortgage loans to Nigerians.In spite of the incorporation of NMRC in June 24, 2013, not much has changed. The apathy of banks towards mortgage transactions still lingers, understandably, because of the risk of default. To buttress this, 66,402 Nigerians applied for mortgages during the recent Nigerian Housing Finance Programme. Only 10,000 Nigerians were selected. However, the interest rates by primary mortgage institutions that participated in the programme were alarming (14.5% -19%).It is suggested that a cue be taken from other countries where the cost of mortgage for first time home buyers are low, with small down payments and easy terms especially, a single digit interest rate. \n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM \nThe problem of housing delivery is of great concern in many countries. This problem is especially prominent in Nigeria. The challenge as been magnified as a result of a myriad of issues, not least, a high population growth rate, shortage of necessary skills and disintegrated supply chain. There is need for Nigerian government and stakeholders in the building industry to rise up to housing needs of Nigerians in quality and quantity. Some researchers has advocated other modern methods of construction like dry construction has strategy to mass housing delivery. However, the researcher is examining how modern strategies can be used to ensure that the housing need of Nigerians are met.\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY \nThe following are the objectives of this study: \n1.  To examine the modern strategies that can be used for effective housing delivery. \n2.  To determine the effect of modern strategies on housing delivery in Nigeria.\n3.  To analyze the factors hindering the use of modern strategies in housing delivery in Nigeria. \n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS \n1.  What are the modern strategies that can be used for effective housing delivery? \n2.  What is the effect of modern strategies on housing delivery in Nigeria? \n3.  What are the factors hindering the use of modern strategies in housing delivery in Nigeria? \n1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY \nThe following are the significance of this study: \n1.  Outcome of this study will educate stakeholders in the building industry, government and policy makers on the modern strategies that can be used to solve the problems of housing deficit in Nigeria. \n2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic \n1.6   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY \nThis study on appraisal of modern strategies for housing delivery in Nigeria will cover all the effort and approaches of past and present government of Nigeria at tackling the problem of housing deficit in Nigeria. It will also cover the new approaches and strategies that can be used for mass housing development.\nLIMITATION OF STUDY \nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview). \nTime constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.\nAPPRAISAL OF MODERN STRATEGIES FOR HOUSING DELIVERY",

        "content": " THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA\n(Architecture Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis study examined and analysed the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Nigeria. It adopted the secondary data sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria covering the period 1985 to 2010. The study employed the modern Time Series of the Ordinary Least Square to test for the relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Nigeria. The results derived infer that there exists a significant relationship between agriculture spending and economic growth. The null hypothesis stated for this study does not hold. What this implies is that agriculture revolution is a determinant to economic growth. Thus, it is important that thegovernment placed greater emphases on this sector by increasing budgetary allocation to agriculture in Nigeria in other meet the recommendations of both Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and African Union (AU). It is recommended that  more funding be provided  for agricultural universities in the country to carry out more research on all aspect of agricultural output, such as livestock, crops, fishing and forestry, crop preservation and also establishment of more research institutes to improve seedling production, encourage the use of irrigation farming system and provision of storage facilities for seasonal products as means of improving the country’s agricultural output.  Further recommendations include the need for the Central Bank of Nigeria to come out with stable policy guideline to enable the commercial banks disburse loans to farmers at a very lower interest rate, in order to help them expand their production capacity. More so, the need for government to encourage more exportation of agricultural output as this in turn will enhance external foreign exchange earnings and improve the competitiveness of Nigerian agricultural produce in the international markets.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1     Background to the Study\n\nThe term Agriculture is derived from the Latin words, “ager,” meaning field, and “Cultura”, meaning cultivation. This suggests that the earliest form of production agriculture was crop production (Are, Igbokwe, Asadu, Bawa, 2010; Erebor, 2003). It may be noted that Agriculture is more than crop production. It also includes animal production, processing of primary products (or value addition) and marketing of produce and products. Erebor (2003) defines agriculture as the art and science of cultivating the soil, processing crops and livestock products for man, and the process of selling excess crop and livestock.\n\nMeanwhile, (Kricher,1997) defines agriculture in a more advanced way by saying that, agriculture or farming is the simplification of nature’s  food webs and the rechanneling of energy for human planting and animal consumption. To simplify, agriculture involves redirecting nature’s natural flow of the food web. The natural flow of the food web is the sun provides light to plants convert sunlight into sugars which provide food for the plants (this process is called photosynthesis). Plants provide food for herbivores (plant-eating animals) and the herbivores provides food for carnivores (meat-eating animals).  This simple illustration of food web provides the basis for analyzing the impact of agriculture on economic growth.\n\nIn literature, economic history provides us with ample evidence that agricultural revolution is a fundamental pre-condition for economic growth, especially in developing countries. Development economists have focused on how agriculture can best contribute to overall economic growth and modernization. Todaro and Smith (2003) look at Lewis theory of development, and reported that the underdeveloped economy consisted of two sectors. These sectors are the traditional agricultural sector characterized by zero marginal labour productivity and the modern industrial sector. In Rostow’s linear stages of economic growth, agricultural revolutions is a pre-condition for take-off and take-off stages\n\nThe importance of a vibrant and robust agriculture is reminiscent on its role in providing employment opportunities for the teeming population, eradicates poverty and contributing to the growth of the economy. The linkage between agriculture and economic growth is well documented in literature (Ogen, 2007; Okongwu, 1986; Atte and Muhammed- Lawal, 2006 to maintain few). According to Izuchukwu (2011), agriculture has been the backbone of the economy in Nigeria providing employment and source of livelihood for the increasing population,it accounts for over half of the GDP of the Nigerian economy as at independence in 1960.\n\n However, the role it plays in the regional and economic development of the country has diminished over the years due to the dominant role of the crude oil sector in the economy. With the increasing food demand in Nigeria, the country has available natural resources and potential for increasing the volume of crop production towards meeting the food and nutritional requirement of the rapidly increasing population and guarantee food security in the country. Therefore, the source of national wealth is essentially agriculture.\n\nUnquestionably, the neglect of agriculture in Nigeria owing to the discovery of oil has retarded the growth of the economy for the past decades.  The effect of this neglect could be felt in the poor quality of life of people as  average Nigerian was quoted as living in US$ 1 per day; if translated to Naira, this amount to N165 day at present. It may not be wrong to say that such a remark is a political cover. The faces we see daily on our streets and those we may not be able to see because of their inability to muster enough strength to walk up to the street as a result of several days of hunger and starvation, or even food associated ill-health and avoidable deaths of tens of people everyday, a better, more sincere and realistic assessment of the situation would be put an average income at US $0-0.5 per day. Studies in literature reveal that seven out of every 10 Nigerians live in abject poverty; hardly able to feed, cloth or house themselves. It is an indisputable fact that Nigeria and her sub-Saharan African neighbors have been dubiously christened by the world political and economic powers as citadels of hunger, poverty, ignorance, diseases, misery, debts, filths and crises. This unquestionable imagery will for long remain indelible in the world's archives unless a reasonable step is taken by people and Government of this doomed sector of the global village. It is against this backdrop that the study seeks to assess the impact of agriculture on economic growth.\n\n1.2     Statement of the problem\n\nBesides oil, the major strength of the Nigerian economy is its rich agricultural resource base, its human resource and its huge markets. However, these resources have to be effectively mobilized so as to diversify the economic base and reduce dependence on oil and import. The economy remains vulnerable to external shocks emanating from fluctuation in the world prices of crude oil and the rising prices of imports. The resulting external and internal in balances are manifested in the adverse balance of payment position, unemployment and low capacity utilization in virtually all sectors as well as the deteriorating purchasing power of the populace (Atte and Muhammed- Lawal, 2006).\n\nThe contribution of agriculture to the Nigerian economic growth is very low compared to what it used to be in the past 14 years. Nigerian agriculture to a large extent still possesses the characteristics of a peasant economy that was prominent in the pre-independence period. Given the information above, this study seeks to assess the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Nigeria from 1985-2010\n\n1.3     Objectives of the Study\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, the study will:\n\n1.     Examine the effect of agricultural practice in Nigeria on agricultural productivity.\n\n2.     Assess the impact of budgetary allocation and agricultural policies on agricultural productivity.\n\n3.     Estimate the trend of growth of agricultural sector in Nigeria since 1985 up to 2010.\n\n4.     Determine the relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Nigeria.\n\n1.4     Research Questions\n\nThe following questions will guide the study.\n\n1.     What is the growth of Agricultural sector between 1985-2010?\n\n2.     To what extent has budgetary allocation and agricultural policies affected agricultural productivity in Nigeria?\n\n3.     Is there any significant relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Nigeria?\n\n1.5     Hypothesis of the study\n\nThe hypothesis of no significant difference will be used to estimate the relationship between agriculture and economic growth.\n\n1.6     Significance of the Study\n\nThe study is relevant in a true sense that it will help to promote agriculture in Nigeria. The study will help bring radical transformation for national growth, especially through its effect on rural incomes and provision of resources for transformation into an industrialized economy. This present study will help policy makers and government to address the challenges of climatic change, global recession and dwindling revenue which threatens food security. The Nigerian populace will benefit from this study because agricultural revolution will be able to provide the quality and quantity of food.\n\nIndustrial and Manufacturing firms will also benefit from steady supply of raw materials and provide large markets for industrial products. Government will benefit because the study will help it to put political will in promoting agriculture in order to achieve full economic growth in Nigeria. \n\n1.7     Brief Methodology\n\nThe study relied on secondary data sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) from 1985 to 2010 reported in their statistical bulletin. It adopted the descriptive and analytical statistics to analyse the data employing different econometric methods such as unit root test, co integration and Error Correction Model among others with the support of E-view statistical package.  The Ordinary Least Square was utilized to test the relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Nigeria.\n\n1.8     Plan of Study\n\nThis study was divided into five chapters. Chapter one covers the introduction of the study, the statement of the problem, the objectives of the study, research questions and hypothesis among others. The review of relevant and related studies covering the theories that explain the relationship between agriculture and economic growth are in Chapter two, while Chapter three discusses and explains the analytical framework and methodology adopted for the study. Chapter four concentrated on the empirical result and discussion of the study and Chapter five focuses on the summary, conclusion and recommendations on the basis of the study’s findings.\nTHE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA",

Factories arose with the introduction of machinery during the industrial revolution when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industry and workshops.\n Paint is a subdivision of surface coating. It is a relatively opaque solid coating applied as thin layer whose films are usually formed by polymerization of polyunsaturated oil. However, other subdivisions of surface coating include: varnishes (clear coating), enamels (pigmented varnishes), lacquers (film formed by evaporation only), printing inks and polishes. Paints generally have very low thermal conductivity, electrically inert and can be washed and cleaned. The various raw materials for making paints include pigments, vehicle, alkyd resins, surfactants, solvents (thinners) and colouring matters.\nPaints are classified into two principal types:\nResin based paints (Gloss finishes) and Latex based paints (Emulsion paints). The major difference between the two is only in the types of vehicle used and cost.\n •         Resin based paints are used for exterior and interior surfaces and are dry to a lustrous or shinny finish.\n •         Emulsion (Latex) paint involves the emulsion of 2-phases one of which is water and any other phase.\n Classically, emulsion is a suspension of one phase in another. Latex paints have as their major film forming constituent synthetic resin latex with or without other film forming constituents added in an oil-water emulsion type system. The continuous phase consists of an alkali – dispersed hydropholic colloid in water and contains two more different types of particles in suspension, styrene –butadeux (SBR) copolymer which was the original quality film former in emulsion paint. Polyvinyl acetate (PVA), acrylic and PVA acrylics copolymers have largely replaced SBR as film former.\n From these, resins and latex are made objects with a wide range of colours and texture found in household wares, building materials, electrical and electronic appliances, automobile and aeronautics, clothing, building structures etc. in short it s difficult to imagine contemporary society without painting (colours).\nPaints are the material employed as finishing for other materials. They are used to protect metals, timber and plastered surface from the effect of weather, heat, moisture, gases etc., thereby improving their appearance. Paints are classified into oil, water and cement and bituminom paints. There are also special paints used for special purpose e.g. heat resisting, fire proofing, chlorinated rubber paint etc.\nPaint factory is regarded as an important or essential industry in many country because of it effect and function in the environment. Finally, this project (paint factory) will help in improving on the face lift of Makurdi as the capital of Benue State as well as the job opportunities which our teeming youths desire.\n 1.2 STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM\n In an industrial building of this nature, it is impossible to solve all architectural problems involved. However, every building has a general architectural problem that has to be solved towards the realization of the design. But, there are some specific problems that are unique to individual projects, for example a paint factory.\n Subsequently, the core problem this project seek to solve is centered on its purpose; a compromise between man and machine. And this involves a careful flow in the synthesis of:\n o  Efficient work flow\no Making a statement to the society reflecting the mass production nature of the paint factory. o Advertising the paint products to the society as well as creating a welcome impact.\no  Expressing orderliness and aesthetic appeal.\n o   Creating openness in plant to give an impression of attractive working conditions, efficient production and painstaking devotion to the excellence of paint products.\n 1.3     OBJECTIVES\nThe principal objective of this project is to provide an environment capable of meeting the needs of the people of Makurdi and Nigeria as a whole by providing them with a well defined paint factory which is ultra-modern and which will meet their several needs in terms of seeking a solution for good appearance and packaging of good products.\n Other objectives include:\n §   To create versatile, adaptable and flexible form for easy expansion with minimum damage.\n §    To provide a good production layout with no conflict between raw and finished goods and personnel in circulation.\n§    To create an ideal factory architecture and to introduce a level of automation in the proposed paint factory in Nigeria.\n§   Finally, to help in the state and Federal Government Programme in rural development and this could be achieved through industrial development.\n1.4 MOTIVATION\n  Establishing a house or a commercial space does not stop at having the edifice erected on a piece of land. This is since you have to make sure that your structure preserves its excellent condition so that you can enjoy your investment for a long time. There are many industrial methods that you can do to keep your home or your workspace in good condition, but one of the most effective steps that you should take is to have your walls re-applied with the right paint.\n For decades now, net and sprays have been the only effective methods for controlling the mosquitoes that causes malaria and dengue. I think by introducing the factory, it will lay more emphasize on protection by inventing a way of embedding pesticide in microcapsule stirred into house paints. And this insecticide will be realized slowly from the paint and will remain effective for two to four years, while spray will be typically re-applied at least every 6 months. The paint will act like a vaccine for houses and buildings.\n The     minute   amount   of   pesticides   releasedvastatingfromtoinsectthe.   paint   won’t   be\n  The introduction or provision of paint factory in Makurdi will help to increase the effectiveness of other producing industries around e.g.\n  •         Most industries producing steel and aluminum building cladding.\n•         For yatch, small boats and craft, fishing fleets manufacturers.\n•         For all furniture and plywood industries\n •         For most petrochemical plants-protective coating\n •         For all kinds of vessels that visit Nigeria port.\n •         For manufacturers of refrigeration, bicycles, other household articles, drums and industrial components –powder paints.\n•         For building industries etc\n Therefore, one should realize that this material is utilized in many industries and that such service industry should be established for the propagation of other.\n Finally, I intend to increase the awareness of this service industry in Nigeria, and s that’whatprompted my motivation towards proposing this project.\n 1.5 AIMS\n The ultimate aim of this project is to create, functional, simple, pleasing, economical, orderly, flexible, safe and convenient industrial building –paint factory.\n And to satisfy the key words of the aims, the following are inevitable:\n §   To achieve an effective and efficient design for a factory with a serious view to flexibility, adaptability and versatility of the building structures. Therefore, the aim is to realize a purely functional planning with a specific purpose of smooth and maximum efficient working\n of the different machineries, the administration of the complex and the overall production.\n §   To create a system that will allow personnel; operational and administrative to enjoy efficient and pleasant working environment.\n §   To provide efficient circulation system between the individual units of the factory and within the layout as a whole thereby facilitating easy movement and assemblage of raw materials and distribution of finished products.\n §   To enhance the psychology of workers towards efficiency by creating an aesthetical industrial architecture.\n §    To reflect the use to which the factory is to be put into which will be in form of an advertisement for the products.\n §   There will be a deviation from the old idea which emphasizes much on mass to a modern approach which gives emphasis on lines and planes (volume).\n  1.6     SCOPE OF WORK\n The factory will undertake on mass production basis, the manufacture of paints and other paint products.

The credibility of this statement has been proven over the centuries, that if one decides to take a critical look at earlier civilizations, from the time of early Egyptian civilization to the current civilized world, one will discover that many of the great feats achieved during these civilizations would have been impossible without one form of transportation or the other.\n By way of definition; transportation (or transport) is the movement of people, animals and  goods from one location to another.  Modes of  transport include  air, rail, road, water, cable, pipeline and  space. The field can be divided into  infrastructure, vehicles and  operations. Transportation is important since it enables trade between people, which in turn establishes civilizations.\n Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for transport, including  roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and  pipelines and terminals such as  airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refuelling depots (including fuelling docks and  fuel stations) and  seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.\n        Vehicles travelling on these networks may include  automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, people, helicopters and  aircraft. Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including financing, legalities and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.\n Transportation can be broadly classified under three broad groups thus:\n  Land transportation;\n Water transportation; and\n Air transportation.\n  Land transportation is the most common and dates back to the beginning of civilization. Land transportation can take various forms, which are dependent on the sophistication, stage of civilization and development, and on the technical stratum of the society in question. It can be by the use of animals (camels, mules, horses, dogs, etc.) or by use of machines such as wheelbarrows, carts, cars etc.\n Similarly, water transportation dates back a long time as humanity can recall. Water transportation, as land transportation, has also been developed in complexity, technical superiority, and usage.\n Air transportation has its origin in the 20th century. The superiority of air transport over the rest can be attributed the reason behind its progressive growth and preference as the safest modern mode of transportation.\n 1.1.0 BACKGROUND TO THE PROJECT\n The airpot terminal is a building at an airport where passengers transfer between ground transportation and the facilities that allow them to board and disembark from the aircraft. Within the terminal, passengers purchase tickets, transfer their luggage, and go through security. The buildings that provide access to the airplanes (via gates) are typically called concoures. However, the terms terminals and concourses are used interchangably, depending on the configuration of the airport.\n Smaller airports have one terminal while larger airports have several terminals and/or concourses. At small airports, the single terminal building typically serves all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse. Some larger airports have one terminal that is connected to multiple concourses via walkways, sky-bridges, or underground tunnels (such as Denver International Airport). Some larger airports have more than one\n terminal, each with one or JohnmoreF.KennedyconcoursesAirport).Stillother larger(suchairports haveasmultipleNewterminalsYork��s each of which incorporate the functions of a concourse (such as Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport).\n According to Frommers, most airport terminals are built in a plain style, with the concrete boxes of the 1960s and ��70s glass boxes in the ��90s and ��00s, with the best terminalsr,some,suchas makin\n Baghdad International Airport, are monumental in stature, while others are considered architectural masterpieces, such as Terminal 1 at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris or Terminal 5 at New York��s John. AFfew. areKennedydesignedtoreflectAirportthecultureofaparticular area, some examples being the terminal at Albuquerque International Sunport in New Mexico, which is designed in the Pueblo Revival Style popularized by architect John Gaw Meem, as well as the one at Bahiasde Huatulco International Airport in Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, which features some palapas that are interconnected to form the airport terminal building.\n  Due to the rapid rise in popularity of passenger flight, many early terminals were built in the 1930s–1940s and reflected the popular  art deco style architecture of the time. One such surviving example from 1940 is the  Houston Municipal Airport Terminal. Early airport terminals opened directly onto the  tarmac: passengers would walk or take a bus to their aircraft. This design is still common among smaller airports, and even many larger airports have \"bus gates\" to accommodate aircraft beyond the main terminal building.\n   1.2.0 STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM\n A functional airport passenger terminal is meant to ease the stress encountered by airpassengers during the process of air travel. Therefore the architectural problem of the project is how best to provide an aesthetically pleasant, efficient, economical, bigger and more modern domestic airport passenger terminal, with good flexibility and expansion capabilities, to replace the outdated and small existing airprot terminal at Makurdi for Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).\n 1.3.0  AIMS\n The primary aims/goals of the design are as follows:\n to provide/design a suitable passenger terminal building in the Makurdi Airport which would potray a good image of Benue State\n to provde a passenger terminal building as well as other auxilliary facilities with the necessary tools requisite for air transportation activities as well as upgrade the economic facet of Makurdi city.\n to ensure these facilities will streamline the productivity in the airport without interruption or interference from each other or any source; and\n to provide a design that will adequately contain all the kinds of functions and activities associated with air travel to be carried out in the airport which will be expanded for this purpose.\n       1.4.0 OBJECTIVES\n  The principal objective of this project is to provide Makurdi Airport with a ultra-modern, befitting and function passenger airport terminal building which has been badly absent since the construction of that airport and also to upgrade the landscape around it and prescribe other salient facilities which have been omitted.\n In appreciation of the particular demands of the project, I opt;\n To situate the structure in an ideal location that easily catches eye sight from around the environment and can be easily accessible to staff, air travellers, as well as visitors;\n To ensure good road network that create easy flow of vehicular and human traffic;\n To consider the environmental consequences as far as they are not a detriment to the proposed development.\n  To minimise costs by putting construction techniques, and employing materials within the level of technology that is commensurate with our national aspiration.\n To ensure flexibility and adaptability for future changes in use of facilities or space;\n To ensure efficient security within and around the facility premises;\n To ensure the terminal building, the parking lots and other auxilliary facilities are strategically placed for easy accessibilty from one to the others;\n 1.5.0 RESEARCH METHODOLGY\n  The required information for proper planning and design of a domestic passenger terminal that will raise the quality and standard of the Makurdi Airport will be obtained through primary data; direct interviews with personnel or representatives of existing airports in Nigeria which basically are FAAN officials, porters on the airport grounds and locals residing around the airport vicinity, case studies, library research, and internet surfing. The emerging ideas and opinions or results are manually organized. On site physical survey will reveal the statistical data inherent of the site venue and will be gainfully utilized.\n  1.6.0  PROJECT MOTIVATION\n  The Federal Government of Nigeria has, in recent times, moved a motion for the rebranding of the Aviation Industry to upgrade the facilities within airports owned by the Federal Government as well as check the activities of private parastatals within the Aviation Industry. Previously, the airports in the Federation have been either dilapidated or grounded that no aviation activities take place in such airports. It is to this end that the Federal Government has moved to build or renovate existing terminal facilities in the airports within the federation listed below:\n Enugu Airport (re-christened Akanu Ibiam International Airport), Enugu, Enugu State;\n Gen. Yakubu Gowon Airport, Jos, Plateau State;\n Nnamdi 999Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Federal Capital Territory;\n Sam Mbakwe Airport, Owerri, Imo State;\n Makurdi Airport, Makurdi, Benue State\n  1.7.0  SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE PROJECT\n  This scope of this thesis is restricted to the passenger terminal building within the airport and NOT the entire airport as a whole. This is to say that the work involves the only the landside of the airport (and not the airside) which includes the terminal building and auxiliary (supporting) facilities within the landside premises. These are briefly listed below:\n      v Exterior elements:\n    Terminal building;\n    Well-defined road network;\n    Parking lots;\n    Signs;\n    Fire station;\n    Motel;\nv Terminal building:\n Entrance hall;\n Departure lounge;\n Arrivals lounge;\n Baggage reclaim hall;\n Outbound baggage hall;\n Shops and snack bars;\n Conveniences;\n Supporting office spaces.\n   1.8.0  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n  The passenger terminal building is chosen and located in the Makurdi Airport premises, which is a domestic airport in Makurdi, Benue State, for the following reasons:\n The existing terminal building on the site is small and outdated;\n Aviation prospects in the state of project location is terribly poor;\n The existing facility has no provision for future expansion.\n  1.9.0  RELEVANCE OF PROJECT\n This rearch will help to contribute and extend the frontiers of knowledge in the academic development of aviation architecture. It also exposes all aspects of professional details and necessary techniques of scientific investigation in this field.\n In other words, this guide provides the basic criteria to organize, evaluate, plan, programme and design airport terminal facilities. The information presented is intended to make researchers aware of important design considerations and to aid them in project development.\n\nDOMESTIC AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING: CASE STUDY MAKURDI AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING, MARKURDI, BENUE STATE",

In some parts of the word a guest house is similar to a hostel, bed and breakfast, or inn whereas in other parts of the world (such as for example the Caribbean), guest houses are a type of inexpensive hotel like lodging. In still others, it is a private home which has been converted for the exclusive use of guest accommodation.  The owners usually lives in an entirely separated area within the property and the guest house may serve as a form of lodging business.\n        In some areas of the world, guest houses are the only kind of accommodation available for visitors who have no local relatives to say with.  Among the features which distinguish a guest house from a hotel, bed and breakfast, or inn is the lack of a full-time staff.  Bed and breakfasts are usually family owned, with the family living on the premises. Hotels maintain a staff presence 24hours a day and 7days a week, whereas a guest house has a more limited staff presence.  Because of limited staff presence, check in at a guest is often by appointment.  An inn also usually has restaurant attached.\nIn Japan, tenants in a guest house have to pay a substantial damage deposit, and have to pay a cleaning fee when they leave.\n1.2    SIGNIFICANCE OF GUEST HOUSE\nAs a result of the activities that normally take place in Enugu capital, there is the need to provided hospitality facilities for travelers coming into the state.\nIt is the intention of this researcher to create awareness on the importance for developing a guest house in an area.\n1.    Provision of the facilities for transaction of business, for meeting and conference, for recreation and entertainment.\n2.    As an important employer of labour\n3.

Aside from\nthe death penalty a sentence to prison is the harvest punishment imposed on\ncriminals.\nPrisons are designed to house people who have broken the law and to move\nthem from free society. In mates are locked away for a set period of time and\nhave very limited freedom during their incarceration.\nConfinement in prison, also known as a correctional facility, is the\npunishment that courts most commonly impose for serious crimes, such as\nfelonies for lesser crimes, courts usually Impose short-term incarceration in a\njail, detention center, or similar facility.\nConfining criminals for long period of time as the primary form of\npunishment is a relatively new concept. Throughout history, various countries\nhave imprisoned criminal offenders, but imprisonment was usually reserved for\npre detention or punishment of petty criminals with a short term of confinement.\nUsing long-term imprisonment as the primary punishment for convicted\ncriminals began in the United States. In the late eighteenth century, the\nnonviolent quarters in Pennsylvania proposed long term confinement as an\nalternative to capital punishment. The Quakers stressed solitude, silence,\nrehabilitation, hard work, and religious faith. was originally intended not only as\na punishment but an opportunity for renewal through religion.\nModern prisons often hold hundreds or thousands of inmates, and must\nhave facilities onsite to meet most of their needs, including dietary.\nTYPES OF PRISONS\n1. Juvenile prison\n2. Minimum, medium and high security prison\n3. psychiatric prison\n4. military prison\n\nTHE CASE TYPES AND OFFENCES IN RESPECT TO PRISON TYPES.\n1. JUVENILE PRISON: an individual under the age of 18 is considered a\njuvenile. Any one who is not of a legal age is never locked up in a general\nprison with adults. They are instead placed in a facility that is designed\nexclusively for juveniles.\n2. MINIMUM SECURITY PRISON: minimum security prisons are\nusually reserved for white collar criminals who have committed acts such as\nembezzlement or fraud. Although these are serious crimes, they are non-violent\nin nature and therefore the perpetrators are not considered to be a risk for\nviolence. These perpetrators are sent to facilitate that offer a dormitory type\nliving environment, fewer guards and personal freedom.\n3. MEDIUM SECURITY PRISON: medium security prisons are the\nstandard facilities used to house most criminals guards and a much more\nregimented daily routine than minimum security.\n4. HIGH SECURITY PRISON: high security prisons are reserved for the\nmost violent and dangerous offenders. These prisons include far more guards\nboth minimum and medium securities have very little freedom. Each person\nconfined to such a prison is considered to be a high-risk individual.\n5. PSYCHIATRIC PRISON: law-breakers who are deemed to be mentally\nunfit are sent to psychiatric prisons that are designed with resemblances to\nhospitals. Once there, the inmates, or patients receive psychiatric help for their\nmental disorders. As with any prison that pursues methods of rehabilitation,\npsychiatric prisons are intended to try and help people as opposed to just\nconfining them as a means of punishment.\n6. MILITARY PRISON: every branch of military has their own prison\nfacilities that are used specifically for military personnel who have broken laws\nthat affect national security, or to house prisoners of war. The treatment of\nthese prisoners has been a subject of much debate in recent times, and the\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: https://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: https://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\ndefinition of torture for enemy combatants has becomes a controversial and\noften discussed topic.\nCAPACITY OF SOME NIGERIAN PRISONS\n1.

Significant controls over\ninmate activities and privileges are in place. The most common use of prisons is\nas part of a criminal justice system, in which individuals officially charged with\nor convicted of crimes are confined to a jail or prison until they either brought\nto trial to determine their guilt or complete the period of incarceration they trial,\noutside of their use for punishing civil crimes, authoritarian regimes also\n\nfrequently use prisons and jails as tools of political repression to punish political\ncrimes, often without trial or other legal due process; this use is illegal under\nmost forms of international law governing fair administration of justice. In\ntimes of war or conflict, prisoners of war may also be detained in military\nprisons or prisoner of war camps, and large groups of civilians might be\nimprisoned in internment camps.\nThe medium security prisons are the standard facilities used to house\nmost criminals. They feature cage-style housing, armed guards, and a much\nmore regimented daily routine than minimum security.\n1. 2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF NIGERIA PRISON\nThe origin of modern prisons service in Nigeria is 1861. That was the\nyear when conceptually, western- type prison was established in Nigeria. The\ndeclaration of Lagos as a colony in 1861 marked the beginning of the institution\nof formal machinery of governance. At this stage the preoccupation of the\ncolonial government was to preoccupation of the colonial government was to\nprotect legitimate trade, guarantee the profit of British merchants as well as\nguarantee the activities of the missionaries. To this end by 1861 the acting\ngovernor of the Lagos colony and who was then a prominent British merchant\nin Lagos, formed a police force of about 25 constables. This was followed in\n1863 by the establishment in Lagos of four courts, a police court to resolve\npetty disputes, a criminal court to try the more serious cases, a slave court to try\ncases arising from the efforts to abolish the trade in slaves and a commercial\ncourt to resolve disputes among merchants and traders. The functioning of these\ncourts and the police in that colonial setting necessarily means that prisons was\nneeded to complete the system. And it was not long in coming for in 1872. The\nBroad street prison was established with an initial inmate capacity of 300. In the\nNiger Delta the relationship between the local people and the British merchants\nhad before than bee moderated by special courts of merchants backed by the\nBritish Navy especially with the appointment of John Beecroft as a consul in\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: https://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: https://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\n1849. The need for a merchant court was underscored by the fact that most\nconflicts between the merchants and the local people were in the main\ncommercial. Although there was evidence of prison in Bonny at this time, not\nmuch is known about its size and content. But these who were later to oppose\nBritish rule were usually reported as happened in the case of Jaja of Opobo and\nKing Dappa of Bonny.\nHowever, the progressive incursion of the British into the hinterland and\nthe establishment of British protectorate towards the end of the 19 th century\nnecessitated the establishment of prison as the last link in the criminal justice\nsystem. Thus by 1910, there already were prisons in Degema, Calabar, Onisha,\nBenin, Ibadan, sapele, Jebba and Lokoja. The declaration of protectorates over\nthe East, west and North by 1906 effectively brought the entire Nigeria area\nunder British rule. However, that did not mark the beginning of a unified\nNigeria. Prisons. Had that been so, it would have negated official colonial\npolicy for that would have required funds which the colonial power was not\nprepared to expand.\nEven so, the colonial prison at this stage was not designed to reform anyone.\nThere was no systematic penal policy from which direction could be sought for\npenal administration. Instead prisoners were in the main used for public works\nand other jobs for the colonial administration. For that reason there was no need\nfor recruitment of trained officers of the prisons. Hence, colonial prisons had no\ntrained and developed staff of their own and instead the police also performed\nprisons duties. As time went on ex-servicemen were recruited to do the job.\nThey were also very poorly run and the local prison conditions varied\nfrom one place to another in their disorganization, callousness and exploitation.\nBut so long as they served the colonial interest of ensuring law and order\ncollecting taxes, and providing labour for public works, they were generally left\nalone. The result was that the prisons served the purpose of punishing those who\n\nhad the guts to oppose colonial administration in one form or the other while at\nthe same time cowing those who might want to stir up trouble for the colonial\nset up.\nThe person regulation was published in 1917 to prescribe admission,\ncustody, treatment and classification procedures as well as staffing, dieting and\nclothing regimes for the prisons. These processes were limited in one very\nsense. They were not geared towards any particular type of treatment of\ninmates. Instead they represent just policies of containment of those who were\nalready in prison. Besides, they were limited in application to those who were\nconvicted or remanded in custody by criminal courts of the British-inspired\nsupreme or provincial types. Those remanded or convicted by the native courts\nwere sent to Native authority prisons. The prison regulation also distinguished\nbetween Awaiting Trail and Convicted Inmates application of this general rule\nto the national prison while the native authority prison went their own way\neffectively stultified the appearance of a national prison goal- orientation in\nterms of inmate treatment.\nIt was not until 1934 that any meaningful attempt was made to introduce\nrelative modernization into the prison service. It was at this time that Colonel\nV.L. Mabb was appointed Director of prisons by the then Governor Sir Donald\nCameron. Although a military officers, Mabb had an understanding of what\nprisons should be. And he went on to do his best. What he seemed to have\nfocused his attention on was the formation of a unified prison structure for the\nwhole country but he failed. Yet he succeeded in extending the substantive\nDirector of prisons Supervisory and inspectoral power over the Native\nAuthority Prisons by this time dominant in the North. It was also during his\ntenure that the prisons warders’ welfare Board was formed.\nHis efforts were to be continued by his successor R.H. Dolan (1946-\n1955). Mr. Dolan was a trained prisons officer and when he assumes duties in\nNigeria he already had a wealth of experience ion prison administration in both\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: https://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: https://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nBritain and the colonies. Although a scheme for the introduction of vocational\ntraining in the National prisons had been introduced in 1917 and it failed except\nin Kaduna and Lokoja prisons where it was functioning in 1926, Mr. Dolan\nreintroduced it in 1949 as a cardinal part of a penal treatment in Nigeria. He also\nmade classification of prisoners mandatory in all prisons and went on to\nintroduce visits by relations to inmates. He also introduced progressive earning\nschemes for long term first offenders. He also transferred the prisons Head\nquarters formerly in Enugu to Lagos to facilitate close cooperation with other\ndepartment of state. He also introduced moral and adult education classes to be\nhandled by competent ministers and teachers for both Christian and Islamic\neducation programmes for recreation and relaxation of prisons were introduces\nduring his tenure as well as the formation of an association for the care and\nrehabilitation of discharged prisoners. But above all. He initiated a programme\nfor the construction and expansion of even bigger convict prisons to enhance the\nproper classification and accommodation of prisoners.\nOn manpower developments he was instrumental to the prison training\nschool, Enugu in 1947. He also saw to the appointment of educated wardresses\nto take charge of the female wings of the service conditions of the prison staff.\nIn addition, he took classification a step further when in 1948 he opened four\nreformatories in Lagos and converted part of the Port-Harcourt prisons for the\nhousing and treatment of juveniles, five years later he was to build an open\nprison in Kakuri-Kaduna to take care of first offenders who had committed such\ncrimes as murder and manslaughters, and who are serving term of 15years or\nmore. The idea was to train them with minimum supervision in agriculture so\nthat on discharge they could employ themselves gainfully. In fact, Dolan’s\ntenure represented a very high point in the evolution of Nigeria prisons service.\n1.3 GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF LAFIAGI TOWN\n\nLafiagi town is bi=bounded in the north by Niger state in the south, is\nbounded by Shonga and Gbugbu while Patagi Local government on the east –\nside of the town.\nThe Lafiagi town covers a land mass of about 1849 sq kilometers, the\nlargest populace of this town concentrated on agriculture as a result of abundant\nfertile farm land. The town has some satellites town like Isaragi, Shonga,\nPatigi and a number of villages surrounding it, also historical lafiagi main\nmarket is at the center of the town, lafiagi is now the headquarters of the Edu\nlocal government council most of the traditional emirates inhabitants are\nMuslim Nupe people.\nA market centre for rice, yams, sorghum, millet, corn (maize), sugarcane,\nkolanuts, peanuts (groundnuts), palm produce, fish, cattle, and cotton, the town\nis also a collecting point for the rice grown on the fasamas (flood plains0 of the\nNiger and for dried fish. Cotton weaving is traditionally important. Lafiagi has a\ngovernment maternity clinic dispensing general hospital. Population (2008)\n30,976.\nMOTIVATION/JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT TOPIC\n1.4 MOTIVATION\nToday Nigeria is facing the problem of insecurity and also the problem of\nunemployment in the country which increases the rate of crimes committed in\nthis country such as rapping, robbery, and smoking e.t.c\nSo it is my desire to embark on this project and design a well functional\nmedium security prison at Lafiagi.\n\n1.5 JUSTIFICATION\nNowadays, due to unemployment in the country, there are many criminal\nactivities such as robbery, raping, smoking, murder e.t.c. the alarming rate of\nthese crimes requires the provision of medium security prisons at strategic areas\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: https://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: https://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nacross the country. The capacity of Lafiagi is 34 and presently occupied over\n100 prisoners.\nFor the above stated reasons, it is my desire to design a well functional\nand modern prison to house convict, C.C, ATM, ATF criminals.\n\n1.6 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\nAIM\nTo design a well functional and aesthetically balance building that will\nsuit the taste of time and easy to maintain.\nOBJECTIVES\n1) To promote enough security.\n2) To create prison vocational centre, where prisoners will be reformed and\nrehabilitated\n3) To design a functioning and aesthetically balanced building.\n4) To design more cells for the comfort of the prisoners.\n5) To design modern medium security prison.\n\n1.7 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\n1) Male and female cell\n2) Security room\n3) Armed forces post\n4) Kitchen\n5) Canteen\n6) Holding cell (temporary cell)\n7) Storage\n8) Exhibition space.\n9) Library\n10) Shower\n\n11) Infirmary\n12) Morgue\n13) Yard\n14) Execution room\n15) Visitation room\n16) Prisoner’s reception\n17) Administrative block\n18) Laundry\n19) Chaplain/mosque\n20) Vocational center\n21) Conveniences\n22) Garage.\n\n1.8 RESEARCH MTHODOLOGY\nThis project is undertaken by way of careful selection of some methods.\nThe methods involved are:\n1) Cases studies\n2) Oral interview\n3) Literature review\n4) Photograph\n CASE STUDIES: it’s a review of some existing formal prisons, which\nreveals notable merits and demerits.\n ORAL INTERVIEW: was carried out with the officers to enhance the\ntechnical details and utility.\n LITERATURE REVIEW: references were made to some Architecture\nbooks in the library and on-line research.\n PHOTOGRAPH: some photos were taking during the case studies.\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: https://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: https://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\n1.9 CONCLUSSION\nThis assessment does appear to have implications both for prison\nauthorities and prison inmates as well for the Nigeria prison Authorities, the\ninternational standards states that each prisoner must have enough space,\nalthough definitions of adequacy vary from country to country and depend\namong other factors on how much time prisoner spend in their cells. It is one\nthing to sleep in a confided space and another to spend 23 hours a day. The\nprison standard minimum rules do say that all cells and perimeter walls and\ndormitories must have adequate heating, lighting and ventilation and that every\ndetained or inmate should have his/her own bed or mattress with clean bedding\nto enhance the psychological well being of the inmates fall short of these basic\nneeds.\nMoreover, the prisons studied for this research work will hold more\nprisoners than the official capacity.

        "content": "A proposed information and communication technology training centre for Ilorin, Kwara state\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn the world today, it is obvious that Information technology (IT), within a very short\ntime, has become one of the basic building blocks of modern society and the engine of all\nother developments. The understanding and mastery of the basic skills and concept of\nInformation Technology as part of the core education, alongside reading, writing, and\nnumeracy have been embraced and regarded by many advanced countries leaving most of\nthe Third World countries behind, of which Nigeria is not an exception. The\ntransformation of all facets of the world by ICT can no longer be neglected as its impact\nin the social, cultural, economic, religious, industrial and technological developments are\nvery enormous. With the general unemployment problems in Nigeria, IT as part of\nEntrepreneurship Training is the surest way of having a sustainable means of livelihood\nby our teeming youths both graduates and non-graduates.\nSometime in 2006, the then Minister of Education, Dr Oby Ezekwesili raised alarm that\nmany of Nigerian graduates are unemployed, underemployed or unemployable (Tribune,\n2008). Ones a Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo\n(Tribune, 2008), also submitted that a large proportion of Nigerian graduates who apply\nfor jobs these days are simply unemployable. The population of Nigeria, according to the\nNational Population Commission (NPC) figures stands at over 140, 000000 and about\n60% of this number is made up of youths and many of them just idle away their time with\nnothing to do. With the institutions of learning in Nigeria churning out graduates of\nvarious levels and degrees on a yearly basis, a rising trend has seen these graduates\ncoming out of the nation&#39;s universities and polytechnics to join those who graduated\nahead of them but without any means of livelihood for years.\nInformation Communication Technology (ICT) can be a veritable tool to tackle this rising\nunemployment rate in Nigeria (Nkanga, 2008). Hence, the dire need for a standard\nInformation technology Training Centre in Ilorin, which will incorporate a Computer\nTraining, a Sales and Business Center, is very timely when one considers the\nunemployment situation in Nigeria which has become a big dilemma. However, many\nobservers believe that the government is not providing the necessary proactive measures\nto confront this challenge of unemployment. It is quite evident that Nigeria at present\nlacks innovation, capacities and capabilities in information technology (IT) management\nand hardware maintenance. This notwithstanding, the country has been and will continue\nto import and use a wide range of durable consumer electronics, computers and\ntelecommunication equipments. It must therefore begin to accumulate the capabilities to\nrepair and maintain these vintages. Indeed, if Africa and Nigeria in particular will not be\nleft behind in global trade and development, it must be able to master certain basic\nCapabilities in ICT (Kajogbola, 2004).\n\nHence, with the enormous contributions of Information technology today and the rising\nawareness of its effects, on everyday life, no one should be left behind or in doubt that it\nis the only way forward. The awareness of its impact in the nation today is at all-time\nhigh and the spread of mobile technology in the country today has aided its spread. The\nuse of Information technology cuts across all the segments of today&#39;s economy, be it\nbanking, oil and gas, media, law, insurance, shipping, education, Architecture, etc. Today\nin Nigeria, terminologies like e-learning, e-payment, epassport, e-ticket, e-banking etc are\npart of today&#39;s vocabulary and anyone who does not come onboard will be left by the way\nside.\nExpectedly, many corporate concerns particularly on the ICT sector have taken up this\nchallenge even though the outcome still looks as if nothing is happening, owing to the\nhuge population of the country and the hopelessness of government to fashion out an\nencompassing way to tackle the problem of the power sector which fuels the IT sector.\nBesides, the current prices of personal computer and its accessories is an area the centre\nwill look into to ensure that World Class computers are made available to the people of\nKwara State at an affordable rate. This will go a long way to assist young people to have\naccess to computer to set up their own Small Scale Business with little or no assistance.\nInformation Technology (IT) can be defined as the study, design, development,\nimplementation, support or management of computer-based information systems,\nparticularly software applications and computer hardware. IT deals with the use of\nelectronic computers and computer software to convert, store, protect, process, transmit,\nand securely retrieve information (Wikipedia, 2017). Today, the term information\ntechnology has come to involve many aspects of computing and technology.\nThe Information Technology Training Centre proposed by this research will provide\nfacilities that will be convenient for learning and exchange of ideas in a functional and\nsafe environment. The training facilities must be flexible and technologically advanced\nlearning environments that is safe, healthy, comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, and\naccessible. It must be able to accommodate the specific space and equipment needs of the\ntraining program. Support spaces geared toward adult needs, such as a business station\nthat allows students to carry out some business functions during their training sessions,\nmust be seamlessly integrated into the facility as well.\nKwara State with its highest number of student’s enrolment in the tertiary institutions\ninvariable has the highest number of graduates that are unemployed. This Centre will\nequip them with the necessary skills to be self-reliant and the knowledge to succeed\nwhatever they want to do after the training very sustainable.\n\n1.2 PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION\nExisting ICT training centers’ make use of makeshift structures that accommodate their\nlearning/educative functions. Buildings such as halls, shops, residential houses, ware-\nhouses are converted to ICT training centre’s.\n( www.unn.edu.ng/.../files/.../M.Sc%20THESIS%20BY%20ADOMOKEME%20.E.pdf)\n\nThis has given rise to ICT training centre’s were spaces are not well designed and well\narticulated for the purpose of learning. Poor architectural planning in some ICT centre’s\nhas led to technical problems such as poor acoustics, natural ventilation and day lighting.\nPoor natural ventilation and lighting results in increase in energy consumption, this\nincreases the running cost of most ICT training centres.\nThere is no proper analysis and understanding of the various processes which will take\nplace in the ICT centre, this result to the provision of inadequate spaces which lack\nfunctionality, this in turn causes congestion. Circulation routes within and between all the\nvarious interrelated activities and spaces lack efficiency, this jeopardizes productivity and\nsecurity.\nAn ICT training facility is expected to accommodate a high volume of human traffic,\noffice and learning equipment and as such should be designed to ensure strength, stability\nand safety.\nAs a result of the various activities to be accommodated within, the structure will be a\nlarge therefore utmost care ought to be taken so as to ensure balance and aesthetics of the\nform without compromising design efficiency.\n1.3 JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY\nThe Public/Private Sector partnership Policy defines the partnership framework. The\nPolicy proposes that government shall provide an enabling environment for investment in\ncollaboration with the private sector. Three of the key strategies of the Policy with\nrespect to public/private sector partnership are:\n Using favorable fiscal policies to make local ICT products and services globally\ncompetitive.\n Establishing joint government/private sector institutional framework for developing\nadvisory standards and quality control.\n Patronizing local ICT companies by providing guaranteed markets in specialized and\nstrategic ICT sectors.\nThese strategies embody the regime of incentives that are to be developed to encourage\nthe setting up of local ICT businesses as well as attract foreign companies to the state.\n1.4 AIM AND OBJECTIVES.\n1.4.1 AIM\nThe aim of the study is to provide an aesthetic, conducive, safe and proper environment\nand structure for both men and machines involved in various activities in order to achieve\nthe ultimate, corporate and training goals of the centre.\n1.4.2 OBJECTIVES\nThe objectives are:\na) To create a highly Information Technological infrastructure with environment that will\nmeet standards while maintaining its local significance.\n\nb) To provide employment for graduates and non-graduates\nc) To create a structure that will meet modern standard for IT learning\nd) To improve the productive capacity and market skills of our youths\ne) To make the youth self-employed\nf) To provide high-quality, affordable PCs and IT accessories.\ng) To increase the youth’s capacity to be leaders and entrepreneurs\nh) To encourage dignity of labor in the lives of every Nigerian\ni) To make Nigerian IT professionals to be compliant and make effective use of\ncomputers in their various disciplines within the shortest possible time.\n1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe Public/Private Sector partnership Policy defines the partnership framework. The\nPolicy proposes that government shall provide an enabling environment for investment in\ncollaboration with the private sector. Three of the key strategies of the Policy with\nrespect to public/private sector partnership are:\n Using favorable fiscal policies to make local ICT products and services globally\ncompetitive.\n Establishing joint government/private sector institutional framework for\ndeveloping advisory standards and quality control.\n Patronizing local ICT companies by providing guaranteed markets in specialized\nand strategic ICT sectors.\nThese strategies embody the regime of incentives that are to be developed to encourage\nthe setting up of local ICT businesses as well as attract foreign companies to the state.\n\n1.5.1 VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROJECT\nAs a result of the rapid changing global environment in computer technology, it becomes\nimperative to anchor the evolution of this project of a well thought out design philosophy.\nThis philosophy must be one that revolves around creativity and innovativeness. It was\nJohn Portman, who said that the essence of design is that people should get excitement\nand surprises.\nThus, despite the fact that this project must exude creativity and innovativeness, it must\nbe aimed at tackling the societal problem of unemployment which has bedeviled our\nsociety. This will catapult Kwara State to a level where safety, comfort, satisfaction and\neconomic prosperity will be the order of the day.\n1.6 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nFor comprehensive and best result data gathering, the following research methodology\nwas adopted.\na) Data collection through the use of oral interviews and written document\n\nb) Through the use of available case study which involves visitation existing IT\ntraining Centers\nc) Through references from books\nd) Through information from the Internet.\n\n1.7 SCOPE OF PROJECT.\nThe scope of the project is limited to realizing a structure which would accommodate an\nICT training centre expected to provide extensive training facility for personal computer\ncomponents and ICT skills acquisition.

The English word for theatre and drama has its root in ancient Greek, starting from the time of organized theatres first great emergence, then it used to be an elaborate structure in size or a vast space of land, mostly  a central area of the great geographical zone where it is located. The theatre is an empty space decorated and made functional, having its requirement as a place for performance, display and audience. Theatre then has its activities publicized through a local means (town criers) of communication and choice of drama can’t be made by audience rather by the organizers. Today, we use the word theatre in variety of ways as place for dramatic performance, a company of players with a vision that animate them, and as an occupation. Theatre may also be referring to a large group of artist, place, buildings and practices that constitutes it, for instance, the American theatre or the National theatre. The vast speed of development has coursed a turn down in performing arts theatre, retarding most of the creative minds in our young mind in Nigeria. It is one of the major setbacks in inculcating our cultures and origin among us. Nowadays, most people prefer to stay in their homes and watch home videos because of the almost or non-existence of the theatre. The theatre is a branch of performing art which is an aspect of fine art aimed at putting a practice or engaging professionals in bringing out the best branch of theatre art. In theatre art, artists use their body or voice to convey expressions as opposed to visual art in which artists use paint/canvas or various materials to create physical art objects. Performing art including dance, music opera, theatre, magic, spoken words, circus arts and musical theatre with artists who participates by performing in front of the audience, which includes actors, comedians, dancers, magicians, musicians and singers.\nFinally, theatre is an occupation and a vocation as such, it involves the work of people in multiple functions. It however holds historical and qualitative relationship to play games and sports that suggest its impulse origination in human nature. It is also an artistic work, and one that involves a  quality uniqueness in art, that of impersonating characters. \n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nPerforming arts theatre is faced with the challenge of having a facility with characteristics of the everyday communication undertone and indigenous character, which articulates the traditional codes of imolites, yet employing western (contemporary) technology and materials, which will be the destination of the display of the rich cultural heritage of the populace of Imo state and its environs. Living the state with no avenue for big festivals and ceremony that can take care of people that come for the show, while most talented people perform outside the state. Giving away encouragement to the mind of individuals that find themselves in the field of art, drama/music and letting some other to use multipurpose halls in the state which is of less capacity and do not possess enough function. On the other hand, foreigners find it difficult to come and perform in a state that has no defined place for performing arts theatre.\n1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n1.3.1 AIM :         \nThe aim of this project is to provide an indigenous, culturally symbolic facility which will be a destination for all kinds of performance, and of our various skills and our culture which will be a major social gateway and architectural landmark for  Igbo people and a pride to the nation, Nigeria.\n1.3.2 \tOBJECTIVES \nThe objectives of this project include; \n    • To sustain the Igbo cultural heritage by providing a culturally symbolic architecture. \n    •  To make provisions for spaces flexible enough to accommodate future changes or trends in performing arts (entertainment) industry and recreational activities. \n    • Provide a forum which encourages users to be creative, learn about their social past and various skills to enable them plan properly for the future. \n    • To design façades that  invoke an aura or one spot reflection on the Igbo core values and philosophies.\n1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY : \nThe beneficiaries of this research study include the government, the society, individuals and future researchers, which would not only foster human development, but promote cultural and sociopolitical values. It will add to the ostentatious vista of our city, as well as encourage economic growth and tourism. \n1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nOwerri, popularly known as the heartland, with its coordinates: 5°29'06''N 7°02'06''E/ 5.485°N 7.035°E; the capital of  Imo state and is currently referred to as the entertainment capital of Nigeria, set in the heart of  Igbo land,  and is also known as the home to an annual beauty pageant called “miss heartland”, consists of three local government areas including Owerri-Municipal, Owerri-North and Owerri-West, it has an estimated population of about 750,000 as of 2006, and is approximately 100 square kilometers ( 40 sq m) in area. Owerri is bordered by the Otamiri  River to the East and the Nworie River to the South. Let us recall from the concept and definition of theatre which is a structure that embodies all art requirement for the production of a dramatic or imitative action. It is very clear that this form of art is an embracing type involving the development of man’s intelligence and artistic ability, both in the aspect of performers and the audience, performing arts theatre would influence both because development of human intelligence is a continuous process, the theatre concentrates greater attention on cultivating aspect of the productive performance in terms of individuals. The theatre  is the main feature of the performing arts theatre and it will be designed with multiplicity of users in mind. In other words, the performing arts theatre will be multi-purpose in character, which offers diverse venues, facilities and innovations of all kinds of programs and activities, the performing arts theatre is going to be a relying point for all artist in Imo state  , neighboring states in Nigeria and even for international artists wishing to share their experience with their Nigerian counterparts. Since the performing arts theatre is a complex design that incorporates all form of arts, the space therefore must be designed to accommodate comfortably the following functions in the design. \nThe facilities that would exist include:\na.\tMain Auditorium For Theatrical Performance;\nThe main auditorium is going to have a seating capacity of about 4500-5000 persons. The auditorium can equally hold international activities. Nevertheless, more empirical bases will be adopted latter on for determination of optimum seating capacity. The activities that are going to be held in the auditorium are musical concerts, dramas film shows and even indoor sports like tennis, wrestling, boxing etc.\nb.\tAdministrative Unit; \nThe administrative unit will cater for the day to day management o the centre and May have rentable office accommodation.\nc.\tConference Hall;\nThe conference hall will be used for lectures, for wedding reception, seminars/workshop etc., with a seating capacity of 1000-1500 persons; the hall will have a stage and other facilities required for its proper functioning. The hall can also be let out to generate revenue for the complex.\nd.\tExhibition Space;\nThe exhibition space to be provided will exhibit as well as contemporary art. Art work to be exhibited will be chosen so as to reflect as many cultural groups as possible within the country. In the same vein, works from outside the country will be accommodated here. The idea is to facilitate crossbreeding of ideas between the countries. Planning implications will concern among other things, bulk of materials, colour of exhibition background, design of exhibition receptacles etc. \n\n\ne.\tCatering  Unit;\nThe catering unit in this kind of project is a contemporary  features, which is meant to serve patrons, staff, and the public. This include snack bars and restaurants, which will also cater for 250 persons at a time.\nf.\tWorkshop;\nA number of workshop will be very useful to the theatre for ease of provision of property, scenery etc. which includes:\ng.\tStudio; workplace for the teaching or practice of an art consisting of a room o building where movies or television shows or radio  programs are produces and recorded.\n    i. Art studio;  this  takes care of  production of painting, sculpture, etc. and its maintenance.\n    ii. Photograph studio; this is for all kinds of photo related works. \n    iii. Music recording studio; which will cater for recording of  most musical performers held in the theatre and can also be left to be used by people who want to use the studio.\n    iv. Radio/TV studio; this will vitiate the need for outside broadcasting unit for purpose o covering events of the center; it will help to generate revenue when subsequent marketers are made. \n\nh.\tAmphitheater; \nIn general context, the provision of an amphitheater for open door activities is inevitable. Although climatic problems especially rainfall will be a design consideration. Provision for close vicinity to the main theatre or other space that can accommodate performers and patrons will be provided in cases of unforeseen climatic nuisance. \ni.\tParking; \nVisitors and staff parking are two broad groups for parking and are planned depending on the view of the project location. Security o patrons cars is also a critical design point.\n 1.6 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY \nThe researcher was faced with the problem of doing a detailed study, as information were not been released, vital documents were proved to be difficult in accessing, lack of cooperation from study sites on the basis of principle. \nLimitation of the study (data collection)\nIn research making, information was a great challenge in carrying out this project due to lack of good architectural books and exact information on the internet. Also, as information were not been released, some vital documents were proved to be difficult in accessing. Likewise, lack of cooperation from study sites; on the basis of principles.\nLimitation in designing the performing art theatre;\nPresentation genre, usually involving some degree of improvisation, in which an artist draws upon dance, music, drama and some motion pictures, customarily mixing this form of expression. The term performance, mixed-means theatre, action art or simply performance  are sometimes used to describe this art form. All performance art share two elements: first, the various part of the performance function disharmoniously, in the tradition of visual-art collage, which is based upon assembling elements normally found apart; second, a piece of performance art must be live, because a recorded piece, whether on film or audio tape, has no spontaneity. Performance art may also incorporate elements of shock, social criticism or protest, and audience involvement.\nTime management.\nThe use of time was a great challenge in the study of this project due to amount of other school works/assignment to do.\n1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS\nAcoustics; acoustic is the behavior of sound and its study.

The definition of each of\nthe categories depends largely on the country where the\nbusiness thrives.\n\nIn Nigeria, micro scale industries are defined as those\nwhose total investment cost does not exceed one million, five\nhundred thousand Naira (#1,500,000) including working capital\nbut exclusive of land. The workforce is not more than 10.\n\nLarge scale industries are defined as those with total\ninvestment of over two hundred million Naira (#200,000 000)\nexcluding land, but including working capital, and workforce of\nover 300 workers. It could be a national or state enterprise\nwhich may have branches within or outside the area of locality.\nPrivate millionaire’s businessmen can also embark on such\nventures.\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nSmall scale industries are defined as those with total\ninvestment of between one million, hundred thousand Naira\n(#1,500,000) and fifty million Naira 50,000,000) and two\nhundred million Naira (#200,000,000) excluding land, but\nincluding working capital, and a workforce of 11 to 100\nworkers.\n\nMedium scale industries are defined as those with total\ninvestment of between fifty million (#50,000,000) and two\nhundred million Naira (#200,000,000) excluding land, but\nincluding working capital and a workforce of between 101 and\n300 workers. For the purposes of this project, concentration\nwill be located at Aba, Abia State.\n\nSmall and medium scale industrial cluster is an estate which\nhouses various forms of small and medium enterprise (SME)\nthat provide the services and needs of the people. As\nindustries, each has its own production process which may be\ndifferent from others. As a cluster, the whole area is planned in\n\nsuch a way as to enhance good co-ordination of activities and\nrelations of one industry to another.\n\nAba is very good commercial centre and its choice as the\nlocation of this project is quite obvious various industries and\ncommercial activities are going on everyday. Presently, the\neruption of various industries and their indiscriminate locations\nseem to take the commercial city out of shape.\n\nThe industrial cluster is, therefore, meant to articulate all the\nvarious forms of small and medium scale industries together to\nfind solution both to industrial inefficiency and environmental\nproblems.\n\nThis cluster is made to house such small and medium firms\nlike, shoe-making, furniture making, welders and etc. The\nstage is ripe for it and the purpose is welcome. It is hoped that\nthis project would open a new chapter in the industrial and\ncommercial lives of the people of Aba and beyond.\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nIn dealing directly with this project, some economic and\ntechnical analysis has been made in order to understand the\nsubject clearly. By so doing expositions have been made on its\neconomic implications and prerogatives which is in essence,\nreporting on the general business of small and medium scale\nindustries especially as it relates to the commercial city of Aba.\nThe technical quality of the report is enhanced by the way all\nthe factors affecting the design of industrial clusters are treated\nexplicitly.\n\n1.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF INDUSTRIAL\nLOCATION AT ABA\nCOLONIAL PERIOD\nIn the eighteenth century, the constructed of railway line from\nPort Harcourt to Enugu through Aba enhanced the towns’\nlocations importance. In a bid to link the hinder leads to urban\ncentres, feeder roads were constructed mainly to convey\nagricultural goods for sales in the town and manufactured\ngoods from towns’ to rural areas. Thus, the construction of\n\nroad networks engendered as series of socio-economic linkages\nin the area.\n\nThe colonial administrations made efforts to develop industries\nalready existing before 1946. For example, the wearing and\nspinning centres had been in existence before this period.\nThese types of industries were encouraged through the\napplication of modern technique use and assistance to Nigeria\nindustrialists to acquire, manage and staff their ventures. Such\nefforts gave rise to the growth of factories which started\nmanufacturing for local market and eventually replaced the\nformerly imported goods\nThe establishment of foreign trading (the United African\nCompany -21AC and Paterson Zokonis-PZ) and the presence of\na large population which provided the market and labour\npotentials were factors which among other things gave rise to\nindustrial growth at Aba. Other factors also affected Aba in its\nindustrial growth. The completeion of Aba-Port Harcourt road\nand Aba water works in 1925 generated further industrial\nconcentration. By the year 1982 the town was almost a large\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nsettlement with four roads from Owerri, Ikot Ekpene, Ort\nHarcourt and Opobo Other factors also.\n\nPOST-COLONIAL PERIOD\nBefore the Nigeria Civil war (1960-1967) the growth of Aba\nattracted more people and industries into the town. For\nexample, within this period a cosmetic/soap factory was\nestablished at Abayi while a life stock feed mill, a textile mill\nand some garment factors were established in the town. The\nintensive and market oriented industries at this period resulted\nto a road population growth of Aba. Consequently, the Aba\ntown planning Authority mapped out an area of 2,453sq km as\nthe planning areas for their growing municipality.\n\nThe civil war (1967-70) disrupted all industrial activities in the\ntown. However, after the war, all industrial activities in the\ntown were revived; This resulted in industrial expansion,\nincreased production and creation of more job opportunities.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\nAba is city endowed with so many talented people with respect\nto designing and production so many products. It is a common\npractice at Aba that various industries and buildings sprout\nanyhow at any location. People cannot clearly define the\nresidential areas different from commercial or industrial area.\nEven though they should be related, they should not be\njuxtaposed to each other bearing in mind the consequences\nand implications. To solve this problem, therefore, I decided to\ndesign on industrial cluster where small and medium scale\nindustries will be conveniently located without necessarily\naffecting other aspects of human life.\n\nBusiness and industrial activities should be organised to have a\ngood co-ordination. Some industries depend solely on others in\nthe production of their raw materials while others put finishing\ntouches to the products of other companies and industries. For\nthese activities to be relatively effective, they need to be\nplaned in a rhythmical form.\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nIn a bid to achieve this, it has been motivated to carry out a\nproject bordering on planning of these business ventures to\nenhance a good business life. Life in itself is supposed to have\na form and so does the characteristic of people should be\ndesigned to reflect the essence of living in all its ramifications.’\n\n1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\nIndustries play a very important role in the human life. Almost\nall business and commercial activities in the human society\nhave their root in industries starting from a small scale\nproduction of cakes, bread, and making of other\nconfectionaries to a large scale production of machines and\nheavy equipments. All are finally disposed of in a ready\nmarket, which goes to serve various human needs.\n\nOn the other hand, taking into commercial nature of Aba and\nrelatively quick turnover required by consideration the\nbusinessmen operating in the area; the idea of designing for\nsmall and medium scale industries is not out of place. The\naverage Aba businessman does not have the patience to wait\n\nor a long term profit through large scale industries. Again,\npeople tend to pay attention to these business activities that\nsolve their daily needs.\nTo this effect, more small and medium scale industries are\nbound to be advantaged.\n\n1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nSmall and medium scales industrials enterprises are numerous\nthat it may be cumbersome designing and providing for each\nod them in a particular project.\nTherefore, much consideration was given to the manufacturing\nunits that some the needs of many people especial in Aba.\n\nHowever, the spaces are mainly divided according to the scale\nof industries, which are;\n\nThe small scale sizes -15.2m x 30.4m.\nThe medium scale is between 30.4m x 45.

It is a relatively\nopaque solid coating applied as thin layer whose films are\nusually formed by polymerization of polyunsaturated oil.\nHowever, other subdivisions of surface coating include:\nvarnishes (clear coating), enamels (pigmented varnishes),\nlacquers (film formed by evaporation only), printing inks and\npolishes. Paints generally have very low thermal conductivity,\nelectrically inert and can be washed and cleaned. The various\nraw materials for making paints include pigments, vehicle,\nalkyd resins, surfactants, solvents (thinners) and colouring\nmatters.\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\nPaints are classified into two principal types:\nResin based paints (Gloss finishes) and Latex based paints\n(Emulsion paints). The major difference between the two is\nonly in the types of vehicle used and cost.\n Resin based paints are used for exterior and interior\nsurfaces and are dry to a lustrous or shinny finish.\n\n Emulsion (Latex) paint involves the emulsion of 2-phases\none of which is water and any other phase.\n\nClassically, emulsion is a suspension of one phase in another.\nLatex paints have as their major film forming constituent\nsynthetic resin latex with or without other film forming\nconstituents added in an oil-water emulsion type system. The\ncontinuous phase consists of an alkali – dispersed hydropholic\ncolloid in water and contains two more different types of\nparticles in suspension, styrene – butadeux (SBR) copolymer\nwhich was the original quality film former in emulsion paint.\nPolyvinyl acetate (PVA), acrylic and PVA acrylics copolymers\nhave largely replaced SBR as film former.\n\nFrom these, resins and latex are made objects with a wide\nrange of colours and texture found in household wares,\nbuilding materials, electrical and electronic appliances,\nautomobile and aeronautics, clothing, building structures etc. in\nshort it s difficult to imagine contemporary society without\npainting (colours).\nPaints are the material employed as finishing for other\nmaterials. They are used to protect metals, timber and\nplastered surface from the effect of weather, heat, moisture,\ngases etc., thereby improving their appearance. Paints are\nclassified into oil, water and cement and bituminom paints.\nThere are also special paints used for special purpose e.g. heat\nresisting, fire proofing, chlorinated rubber paint etc.\nPaint factory is regarded as an important or essential industry\nin many country because of it effect and function in the\nenvironment. Finally, this project (paint factory) will help in\nimproving on the face lift of Makurdi as the capital of Benue\nState as well as the job opportunities which our teeming youths\ndesire.\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n1.2 STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM\nIn an industrial building of this nature, it is impossible to solve\nall architectural problems involved. However, every building\nhas a general architectural problem that has to be solved\ntowards the realization of the design. But, there are some\nspecific problems that are unique to individual projects, for\nexample a paint factory.\nSubsequently, the core problem this project seeks to solve is\ncentered on its purpose; a compromise between man and\nmachine. And this involves a careful flow in the synthesis of:\n Efficient work flow\n\n Making a statement to the society reflecting the mass\nproduction nature of the paint factory.\n\n Advertising the paint products to the society as well as\ncreating a welcome impact.\n\n Expressing orderliness and aesthetic appeal.\n\n Creating openness in plant to give an impression of\nattractive working conditions, efficient production and\npainstaking devotion to the excellence of paint products.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES\nThe principal objective of this project is to provide an\nenvironment capable of meeting the needs of the people of\nMakurdi and Nigeria as a whole by providing them with a well\ndefined paint factory which is ultra-modern and which will meet\ntheir several needs in terms of seeking a solution for good\nappearance and packaging of good products.\nOther objectives include:\n To create versatile, adaptable and flexible form for easy\nexpansion with minimum damage.\n\n To provide a good production layout with no conflict\nbetween raw and finished goods and personnel in\ncirculation.\n\n To create an ideal factory architecture and to introduce a\nlevel of automation in the proposed paint factory in\nNigeria.\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\n Finally, to help in the state and Federal Government\nProgramme in rural development and this could be\nachieved through industrial development.\n\n1.4 MOTIVATION\nEstablishing a house or a commercial space does not stop at\nhaving the edifice erected on a piece of land. This is since you\nhave to make sure that your structure preserves its excellent\ncondition so that you can enjoy your investment for a long\ntime. There are many industrial methods that you can do to\nkeep your home or your workspace in good condition, but one\nof the most effective steps that you should take is to have your\nwalls re-applied with the right paint.\nFor decades now, net and sprays have been the only effective\nmethods for controlling the mosquitoes that causes malaria and\ndengue. I think by introducing the factory, it will lay more\nemphasize on protection by inventing a way of embedding\npesticide in microcapsule stirred into house paints. And this\ninsecticide will be realized slowly from the paint and will remain\neffective for two to four years, while spray will be typically re-\n\napplied at least every 6 months. The paint will act like a\nvaccine for houses and buildings.\nThe minute amount of pesticides released from the paint won’t\nbe harmful to people but will be devastating to insect.\nThe introduction or provision of paint factory in Makurdi will\nhelp to increase the effectiveness of other producing industries\naround e.g.\n Most industries producing steel and aluminum building\ncladding.\n\n For yatch, small boats and craft, fishing fleets\nmanufacturers.\n\n For all furniture and plywood industries\n\n For most petrochemical plants-protective coating\n\n For all kinds of vessels that visit Nigeria port.\n\n For manufacturers of refrigeration, bicycles, other\nhousehold articles, drums and industrial components –\npowder paints.\n\n For building industries etc\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nTherefore, one should realize that this material is utilized in\nmany industries and that such service industry should be\nestablished for the propagation of other.\nFinally, I intend to increase the awareness of this service\nindustry in Nigeria, and that’s what prompted my motivation\ntowards proposing this project.\n\n1.5 AIMS\nThe ultimate aim of this project is to create, functional, simple,\npleasing, economical, orderly, flexible, safe and convenient\nindustrial building – paint factory.\nAnd to satisfy the key words of the aims, the following are\ninevitable:\n\n To achieve an effective and efficient design for a factory\nwith a serious view to flexibility, adaptability and\nversatility of the building structures. Therefore, the aim is\nto realize a purely functional planning with a specific\npurpose of smooth and maximum efficient working of the\n\ndifferent machineries, the administration of the complex\nand the overall production.\n\n To create a system that will allow personnel; operational\nand administrative to enjoy efficient and pleasant working\nenvironment.\n\n To provide efficient circulation system between the\nindividual units of the factory and within the layout as a\nwhole thereby facilitating easy movement and assemblage\nof raw materials and distribution of finished products.\n\n To enhance the psychology of workers towards efficiency\nby creating an aesthetical industrial architecture.\n\n To reflect the use to which the factory is to be put into\nwhich will be in form of an advertisement for the products.\n\n There will be a deviation from the old idea which\nemphasizes much on mass to a modern approach which\ngives emphasis on lines and planes (volume).\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\n1.6 SCOPE OF WORK\nThe factory will undertake on a mass production basis, the\nmanufacture of paints and other paint products. It will also\nconsist of four major paints of an industrial building;\n Research\n\n Manufacturing\n\n Administration and\n\n Welfare.\n\nThe research includes laboratory and library to investigate and\nrecommend possible ways of producing better products and\nraw materials.\nThe manufacturing section, according to the manufacturing\nprocess, include: dispersion, mixing, sieving and canning.\nThe administration comprises of offices, personnel and sales\nwhile\nThe welfare section includes the factory cline and staff canteen.\nOther components include the maintenance block, staff and\nvisitor’s parking spaces, warehouse for raw materials and\nfinished products, delivery bays and yards etc.\n\n1.7 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nTo really collect important information towards the realization\nof this project and to make an important contribution to\nArchitecture, some research activities had been carried out and\ndata collected through;\n\n Visits to existing paint factories site of the projects to\ndetermine their production processes, organizational chart\nand determine the requirement and conditions to be\nfulfilled in the setting up of such factory.\n\n Use of libraries, research institute, books, journals and\nunpublished manuscript of thesis reports.\n\n Visits to relevant Government establishment like the\nministry of commerce and industry, for collection of data,\nbyelaws, history and other important information.\n\n Personal interview of some people.\n\n Internet.\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\n1.8 LIMITATION OF RESEARCH\nDue to the limitation of standard paint factories in Nigeria, one\nis limited to researching with only the small scale private paint\nfactories.\nIn researching with the private factories it was discovered that\nthe factories were over protective of their setting. They feared\nthat their competitors might get hold of information given out\nfor the research and have a hold over them. Some of them that\nco-operated discourage photographs.\nAlso the fact that the country is not in peace due to the Boko\nHaram and other threats, the factories are conscious and at the\nsame time trying to protect their life and properties.\nMaterials on paint factories are not much available in libraries,\nresearch institutes, records and documents on paint factories in\nNigeria.\n\n1.9 IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT\nThe importance or the breaks through this project hope to\nachieve are:\n\n To provide a comprehensive setting for paint industry in\nNigeria in order to help improve the economy attains\ntechnology and industrial independence.\n\n To create job opportunities for the increasing labour\nforces.\n\n It will help in saving foreign exchange by providing goods\nwhich would have been purchased abroad.\n\n1.10 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF FACTORY\nThe factory began with the shop-connected residence as in\nAncient Egypt, then the open air workshops and the home the\nhome industry as in Greece. Then, some specialized craft and\ntrades like metal smiting, carpentry, pottery, shoe making\nwere home industry; therefore, operation were in dwelling\nhouses.\nWhen the need for expansion began, separate work shed from\nhomes was realized. However, this did not survive for too long,\nfor with the collapse of the Roman Empire, the industry\nreverted to its original dwelling-house status – the gradual\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\ndetachment from home only started again with the emergence\nof the guild system between the 12th and 15th centuries.\nBy this period, the trades men were engaged in producing\nstained glass, pottery, tapestries and metal work in great\nquantities – all operations being carried out in small shops.\nThis stage was followed by the beginning of the 15th century,\nby the emergence of large city workshop; derived from the\nstrong influence of the monasteries, and the basomial manors.\nThen came the modern factory system during the 2nd half of\nthe 18th century. This stage in the factory evolution was made\npossible by certain technological inventions like the Spinning\nJenny, Samuel Cromptoris mule in 1779, Edmund Cartwrights\npower loom in 1785 and James Watts steam engine, also in\n1785. Manufacturing at this stage developed to much a high\nlevel that the whole of Europe was ploughed into the great\nindustrial Revolution.\nThe industrial Revolution with the use of capitation ushered in\nsuch keen completion among early industrialists that some old\nbuildings and other available large spaces were acquired for\nloom shops and other industries. This was the period for birth\n\nof industrial architecture from the period of birth to the present\nday, Industrial Building Types or Industrial Designs has passed\nthrough three main stages;\n\n Period of construction in wood and stone with water\npower.\n\n Period of construction in bricks and metal (cast and\nwrought iron at first, steel later) with steam power.\n\n And period of modern construction in reinforced concrete\nwith electricity as a source of power.\n\nBy 1925, this last phase experienced a new architecture\ncreation – INTERNATIONAL STYLE – which was first noticed in\nthe industrial designs of Peter Behrens in Germany and\nAuguste Perret in France between 1911 and 1924.\nThese works and most other modern examples revealed the\ndesign philosophy of almost all today’s meritorious industrial\nbuilding as an emphasis on lines and planes instead of mass.\nStandard design became:\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\n A long rectangular multi-window structure with a central\ncupolar or furnace itself.\n\n Large monitors for interior day lighting.\n\n A possible massing of all units of an industrial building into\none imposing single structure depending, however on the\nsizes of the individual units of the complex\n\n1.11 HISTORY OF PAINT MANUFACTURE\nPaint is a thin protective or decorative coat or a subdivision of\nsurface coating. Painting, the art of laying colour on a surface,\ntherefore necessitated the development of paint.\nPaint was first developed in the prehistoric times when the\nearly men recorded most of their activities in colours on the\nwalls of their caves. These crude paints consisted of coloured\nearth or clays suspended in water. However, the use of paint\ndated as far back as 1500 B.C. when the earliest paint works\ndiscovered in caves of Lascaux, France, Attemira and Spain\nwere believed to have been done.\n\nThe Egyptians artist, during the early civilization was a paint\nformulator. He devised his paint mostly from natural pigments\nfrom resins, chalk, tale, clay etc. this could be regarded as\nmixture. However, by 1500 B.C. they imported such dies as\nindigo and madder to make blue and red pigments. By 1000\nB.C. they had developed a varnish from the gum of Arcacis tree\n(gum Arabic) which contributed to the performance of their\narts.\nColoured crayon pigments and clay binder were used in Asia,\nwhile before 600 B.C. calcined mixtures and organic pigments\nwere developed.\nVehicles were prepared from gum Arabic, eggulute, gelatin and\nbees max. In our local traditional architecture, ‘Uri’, ‘Nzu’,\ncowdung etc. were used to prepare paints.\nDuring the medieval and classical period more specialized form\nof paint was developed. This is known as oil paint. The\nsubstrate is generally canvas although other surfaces may be\nused. The colour consists of concentrated pure pigments\nground to a thixotropic paste in refined or bleached vegetable\noil, generally linseed. The pigments have an influence on the\ndrying rate uniform. This is done by making the vehicle of a\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nfast-drying colour more saturated oil such as popyseed, and\nadding a small fraction or cobalt soap to the blacks and other\nslow drivers.\nThe discovery of oil paints brought a great improvement in the\nart of painting. The 15th Century brought with it the knowledge\nof perspective in which objects could be represented in three\ndimensions. In this period, however, and to a more partial\nextent even is the earlier classical epoch, efforts were being\nmade to widen the horizon of painting and to embrace with it\nthe scope of its representations not only solid objects in\nthemselves, but much objects as a whole in space, in due\nrelation to each other and to the universe at large.\nIt was reserved, however, for the masters of 17th century\nperfectly to realize this ideal art, and in their hands painting as\nan art of representation is widened out of its fullest possible\nlimits and the whole of nature in all its aspects becomes for the\nfirst time the subject of the picture. The development of\npainting since the 17th century gave rise to the modern and\nmore specialized method of paint production.",

Day care is typically an ongoing service during specific periods, such as the parent’s time at work. \nThe service is known as child care in the United Kingdom and Australia, crèche in Ireland and New Zealand, and child cam or day care in North America (although child care also has a broader meaning). \nChild care is provided in nurseries or crèches or by a nanny or family child care provider caring for children in their own homes. It can also take on a more formal structure, with education, child development, discipline and even preschool education fatling into the fold of Services. \nSome child minders care for children from several families at the same time, either in their own home (commonly known as “family clay care’ in Australia) or in a specialized child care facility. Some employers provide nursery provisions for their employees at Or near the place of employment. \nChild care in the child’s own home is traditionally provided by a nanny or au pair, or by extended family members Including grandparents, aunts and uncles. Day care appeared in France about 1840, and the Societies des Crèches was recognized by the French government in 1869.\n Originating in Europe in the late 18th and early 19th century, day  cares were established in the United States by private charities in the 1850s, the first being the New York Day Nursery in 1854. \n1.2BUSINESS \nThe day care industry is a continuum from personal parental care to large, regulated institutions. The vast majority of childcare is still performed by the parents, in- house nanny or through informal arrangements with relatives, neighbors or friends, For example, in Canada, among two parent families with at least one working parent, 62% of parents handle the childcare themselves, 32% have other in-home care (nannies, relatives, neighbors or friends) and only 6.5% use a formal day care center. \nHowever, for-profit day care corporations often exist where the market is sufficiently large or there are government subsidies.

Disaster management deals with situations that occur prior to, during, and after the disaster. Globally, there has been lots of disaster on land, air and sea, though these disasters may be natural or man-made, it has however led to the destruction of lives and properties worth billions of Naira. \nIn Nigeria, there have been instance of earth tremors in Ogun state in 1994, several cases of flood has occurred in Nigeria, in July 2012, 363 people killed, over 2,100,000 displaced, Areas affected include, Adamawa, Taraba, Plateau, and Benue state. On 2nd July 2012, many Nigerian coastal and inland cities experienced heavy rains, and residents of Lagos state were \"gasping for breath\" due to the flooding. In addition, there was a gridlock on major roads, causing people to cancel or postpone appointments they may have had. Thousands of stranded commuters had to pay increased fares for the few bus drivers who were willing to risk travelling on the roads, and construction of work by the Nigerian government on the inner Oke-Afa Road took a \"heavy toll.\" In mid-July 2012, flooding in the Ibadan metropolis caused some residents at Challenge, Oke-Ayo, and Eleyele to flee from their residences and save their lives. The flooding also prevented some Christians from attending churches in the morning, while a few bridges caved in. The Nigerian government said that certain structures on waterways had to be demolished as a result of the flooding, while Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Bosun Oladele, announced that there weren't any casualties from the flooding. Although, most of the disasters that Nigerians face are generally preventable, such as aircraft crash, boat mishap, floods, landslides, fire out breaks, oil spillage etc, can actually be prevented.\nDisaster is an event, natural or man-made, sudden or progressive, which impacts with such severity that the affected community or individual has to respond by taking exceptional measures. \nDisaster Management is the systematic observation and analysis of disasters to improve measures relating to prevention, mitigation, preparedness, emergency response and recovery. It is also the range of activities designed to maintain control over disaster and emergency situations and to provide a framework for helping at-risk persons to avoid or recover from the impact of the disaster and deals with situations that occur prior to, during, and after the disaster. \nThe term \"Disaster Management\" encompasses the complete realm of disaster-related activities. Traditionally people tend to think of disaster management only in terms of the post-disaster actions taken by relief and reconstruction officials; yet disaster management covers a much broader scope, and many modern disaster managers may find themselves far more involved in pre-disaster activities than in post-disaster response. This is because many persons who work in the development field, or who plan routine economic, urban, regional or agricultural development projects, have disaster management responsibilities. Disaster management also encompasses the field of emergency assistance and long-term maintenance for refugees and displaced persons. The refugee field of disaster management is highly specialized and requires not only many development skills but also a broader awareness of political, legal, and humanitarian issues. \nThe project is to design a Disaster Management Centre which will serve as a centre for the operational squad and aid for investigation, assistance and relief of people affected with disasters. The aim of this project is to provide disaster management knowledge and skills to enhance the understanding of good (and bad) disaster preparedness and response and their reasons for them. This project introduces the main principles of Disaster Management, with a focus on disaster response in the developing world.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY \nTHE NEED FOR A DISASTER MANAGEMENT CENTRE \nDisaster means a progressive or sudden, widespread or localised, natural or human caused occurrence which causes or threatens to cause; Death, injury or disease, Damage to property, infrastructure or the environment, Disruption of the life of a community; and is of the magnitude that exceeds the ability of those affected by the disaster to cope with its effect using only their own resources. A disaster management centre is needed to: \n To implement an integrated and coordinate disaster management policy that focuses on preventing or reducing the risk disasters, mitigating the severity of disasters, emergency preparedness, rapid and effective response to disasters and post disaster recovery. \n To prepare the document that will identify risks, assess risks, risk response development and risk response control. \n The purpose of centre is to outline policy and procedures for both proactive disaster prevention and the re-active disaster response and mitigation phases. \n\nThe disaster management centre functions are as follows: \n Must specialise in issues concerning disasters within Rivers State. \n Act as a repository and conduit for information concerning disasters. \n Must perform it functions and exercise powers as stipulated section 44 of the Disaster Management Act, 57 of 2002. \n Must liaise and co-ordinate its activities with those of National, State Management centres. \n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEMS \nArchitecture is an abstraction from nature and intuition with possibilities of aesthetic accompaniments for overall ambient satisfaction (Fashuyi, 2004). Nevertheless, this ideological perception must graft with sensitive issues bordering on culture, economy before Architecture can become acceptable in its right values. However, Architectural Education in Nigeria as presently structured is not responsive to her socio-economic environment. In fact, it is more suited to problems of urban environment of prosperous economies having nothing in common with the cultural and economic features of the country (Adesina, 1987). Architectural Education in Nigeria was inherited from the Beaux-Art concept of Western educational philosophy through the colonial mentors. This tendency is to provide aesthetically satisfying buildings, irrespective of function. \nThe design of the Disaster Management Centre will take into cognisance proper functional relationship between each section of the building to another; the site is located at an area that can be easily accessible from various parts of the state, helicopters are also available to ease rescue in parts of the states that cannot be easily assessable by land, the structure is responsive to the socio-economic environment in the state, the structure is aesthetically satisfying, the structure conforms to the building codes and zoning. \nTherefore architectural problems of the Disaster Management Centre Are as follows: \n The integration of architectural purpose, site, suitable spaces, technical systems and materials. \n Inadequate ventilation and natural lightening \n Primary and secondary circulation in and around the site. \n\n1.3 MOTIVATION \nDisaster Management is an enormous task. Disasters are not confined to any particular location; neither do they disappear as quickly as they appear. Therefore, it is imperative that there is proper management to optimize efficiency of planning and response. Due to limited resources, collaborative efforts at the governmental, private and community levels are necessary. This level of collaboration requires a coordinated and organized effort to mitigate against, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies and their effects in the shortest possible time. \nThe motivation of this project steams from: \n The absolute necessity for such a project: Over the years, lives have been lost in natural and man-made disaster primarily due to absence of a disaster management centre or slow response of rescue team. \n The wealth of knowledge, which the project adds to existing information on architectural building types. \n The sense of comfort and security inspired by the project, being from the riverine area in the Niger Delta region where the terrain is difficult and inter-city transport is mostly done by boat, the potential for boat mishaps is rather high. \n To reduce subsequent insurance claims and compensation on government and insurance companies. \n The passion to create an avenue that will aid for relief to all disaster victims. \n To create awareness for the need of disaster management. \n\n1.4 AIMS \n To provide a facility that will improve response to disasters for an initial period after which other sources would assist. \n To reduce confusion on the part of all personnel concern in disasters. \n To enhance the role of rapid deployment of its personnel in response to emergency \n Preventing or reducing the risk of disasters and mitigating the severity or consequences of disasters \n A rapid and effective response to disasters and post- disaster recovery and rehabilitation. \n To ensure the survival of the maximum possible number of victims, keeping them in the best possible health in the circumstances. \n To re-establish self-sufficiency and essential services as quickly as possible for all population groups, with special attention to those whose needs are greatest: the most vulnerable and underprivileged. \n To repair or replace damaged infrastructure and regenerate viable economic activities. To do this in a manner that contributes to long-term development goals and reduces vulnerability to any future recurrence of potentially damaging hazards. \n In cases involving population displacements (due to any type of disaster) the aim is to find durable solutions as quickly as possible, while ensuring protection and assistance as necessary in the meantime. \n\n1.5 OBJECTIVES \n To create a building for imparting training in disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness, relief and rehabilitation and also to undertake research studies, documentation and development of database. \n Organize state and regional level conferences/workshops in disaster management and related subjects. \n To develop and encourage NGO's network in the state to manage disasters in the state. \n to reduce or avoid the human, physical, and economic losses suffered by individuals, by the society, and by the country at large \n To reduce personal suffering and to speed recovery. \n\n1.6 SCOPE OF PROJECT: \n\nThis project provides, to a satisfactory level, all the facilities that are needed in the disaster management centre for optimum performance to manage disaster. There are provisions for effective control, relief and rescue of disasters by mitigating, preparedness, response and recovery. \nThe scope of the project is limited to the following; \n The design of the Administrative building \n The clinic \n A staff residential building \n Hanger for helicopter \n\n\n1.6.1 THE SITE: \nThis project involves the design of a Centre that aids for Disaster Management, thus, due to the amphibiotic nature of its function, the facility would require a site that enhances the marine and land base operation, and hence, it is located within the southern section of Port Harcourt. It can also be accessible through various pedestrian routes emanating from the neighbouring residential zones. This will be dutifully respected in the cause of designing. \nThe site is in close proximity to the State secretariat, the Nigerian marine base, Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, Orobum Vimmage (now called Obunabali). Ogbunabali bound the site on the East, the far North by Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, to the West by the Amadi flat and old GRA Residential Quarters and the South by Marine Base. \nThe exterior element in the site include \n Parking lots \n Sign post \n Main building \n Clinic \n Heliport \n Staff Accommodation \n Power plant. \n\n\n1.6.2 THE MAIN BUILDING: The sections in the Disaster Management Centre include: \n Administrative unit \n Control unit \n Training unit \n Maintenance unit \n The Aviation operation \n The Marine operation \n The land operation \n Finance unit \n Relief and rehabilitation unit \n Ware house \n Conference hall \n Search and rescues unit. \n\n\n The Administrative unit: \nThis is the first point of call as one gets into the building, this department is responsible for all staff matters, appointments, records of service, welfare of officers, employment etc. This section is responsible for personnel functions and employee services, Personnel functions cover tracking staff and disaster deployments, obtaining local hires, arranging billeting, and processing payroll while Employee services include providing for personnel health and safety, overseeing access to medical services, and ensuring security of personnel, facilities, and assets. \n Control Unit: \n\nThis is one of the most important units in the centre, it takes care of all emergency calls and make sure they are transmitted as clearly and as fast as possible to the squad responsible for that particular disaster. The unit will have communication gadgets such as pager systems, walking talkie, phones, radars, satellites, reception systems global positioning system (G.P.S), to guide the development of a comprehensive information and communication system and establish integrated communication links with all disaster risk management role players. \nThis unit has two major tasks: the collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination of information about disaster operations to support planning and decision making in the field and at the headquarters’ levels; and the coordination of short- and long-term planning in the field.\n\n The Training unit: \nThis unit will be responsible for the training of the rescue squads and will feature necessary fitness facilities. It is also a unit that aids to promote a culture of risk avoidance among people by capacitating role players through integrated education, training and public awareness programmes informed by scientific research. \nThe department of training develops the curriculum and coordinate the human resources development of the agency in addition to catering for the training needs of the staff on modern skills which qualify them to be good disaster managers as obtain in other part of the world. \n The Maintenance Unit: \n\nThis unit takes care of all repairs and daily/weekly check of all the vehicles used for search and rescue operations. The automobile workshop, electrical workshop, vulcanizing workshop, tailor workshop, spare parts store etc. are all part of the maintenance department. \n The Aviation Operations: \n\nThis section takes care of disasters not easily assessable by land; it involves the use of helicopters necessary for rapid response to disasters that occurred in difficult or far terrain. \n The Marine Operations: \n\nThis unit takes care of offshore disasters such as boat mishap.\n\n The Land Operations: \nThis unit will take care of out-breaks and other land accidents where necessary. It will involve provision of parking lots for ambulances; fire fighting vehicles, motor bikes, personnel carries etc. \n The Finance Unit: \n\nThis section plans, organizes, and directs logistics operations that include control and accountability for supplies and equipment; resource ordering; delivery of supplies, equipment, resource tracking, facility location, setup, space management, building services, general facility operations, Transport coordination and fleet management services, and salary of staff. \n The Relief and Rehabilitation Unit: \n\nThis unit provides leadership to build, sustain, and improve the coordination and delivery of support and relief to citizens and State, local, tribal and territorial governments to save lives, reduce suffering, protect property and recover from all hazards. These units also receive the materials for relief and properly distribute it to affected people.\n1.6.3 THE CLINIC: \nTime is a crucial element in Disaster Management. In recognition of this, the agency will have a clinic that will aid in first aid treatment of victims, and also, there will be ambulances that will convey seriously injured people to bigger hospitals and also convey the dead to the mortuary. \n1.6.4 THE STAFF ACCOMMODATION: \nAccommodation will be provided for resident staff of the organization and also for resident doctors that will handle the clinic and all medical affairs. \n1.7 PROJECT JUSTIFICATION \nThe project is located within the southern section of Port Harcourt. The site is in close proximity to the State secretariat, the Nigerian marine base, Trans Amadi Industrial Layout; Orobum Vimmage (now called Obunabali). Ogbunabali bound the site on the East, the far North by Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, to the West by the Amadi flat and old GRA Residential Quarters and the South by Marine Base. \nThis site was chosen for the following reasons: \n It can be assessable through the Eastern bypass road and various pedestrian routes emanating from the neighbouring residential zones \n No existing facility defined for this purpose within the area. \n The area is very busy and prone to disasters like accidents. \n The site can be assessable from land and water. \n\n\n1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS \n Disaster: this is an event, natural or man-made, sudden or progressive, which impacts with such severity that the affected community or individual has to respond by taking exceptional measures. \n Disaster management: is the systematic observation and analysis of disasters to improve measures relating to prevention, mitigation, preparedness, emergency response and recovery. \n Disaster management centre: this will serve as a centre for the operational squad and aid for investigation, assistance and relief of people affected with disasters. \n Risk: is the relative degree of probability that a hazardous event will occur. An active fault zone, for example, would be an area of high risk. \n Mitigation: is action taken to reduce both human suffering and property loss resulting from extreme natural phenomena. Measures include land use planning, improved disaster-resistant building techniques, and better agricultural practices. \n Preparedness: encompasses those actions taken to limit the impact of natural phenomena by structuring response and establishing a mechanism for effecting a quick and orderly reaction. Preparedness activities could include pre-positioning supplies and equipment; developing emergency action plans, manuals, and procedures; developing warning, evacuation, and sheltering plans; strengthening or otherwise protecting critical facilities; etc \n\n\n Disaster Prevention: this is action taken to eliminate or avoid harmful natural phenomena and their effects. Examples of prevention include cloud seeding to control meteorological patterns, pest control to prevent locust swarms, erection of dams or levees to prevent flooding, etc. \n Intervention: this refers to an action taken in order to change the course of events. In disaster management the term's use is similar to the medical sense, i.e., disaster response initiated from outside the affected community is a form of intervention and, as such, must be handled with care because it does come from without. It therefore always runs the risk of being more disruptive than productive. \n Pre-disaster planning: this is the process of preparing, in advance, to meet a future disaster. Pre-disaster planning consists of disaster prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. \n Vulnerability: this is a condition wherein human settlements, buildings, agriculture, or human health are exposed to a disaster by virtue of their construction or proximity to hazardous terrain. \n Maintenance: refers to the services that are provided to refugees during the period after the emergency but before a permanent solution to their plight is developed. Maintenance operations may include tracing and family reunification, general care and food distribution, a variety of social services such as education and cultural activities, and efforts to help the people to become as self-sufficient as possible under the circumstances. \n Evaluation occurs as a refugee operation ends or as a new phase begins. Evaluation should be carried out by every manager and key members of the staff. The results and lessons learned should become the basis for further emergency preparedness activities. \n\n\n Durable (Permanent) Solution is the term used to describe collectively the three long-term solutions that resolve a refugee situation-voluntary repatriation, assimilation, and resettlement to a third country. In this phase, any number of activities can take place including transportation of the refugees, legal assistance, and provision of financial and material aid to the refugees to help them start their new lives. If the solution is repatriation or assimilation, the Patterns of assistance often resemble reconstruction and development assistance given to the victims of natural disasters. \n\n Essential goods and services: this means those products, items, expertise or manufacturers, which are considered of importance or are indispensable when responding to a disaster. \n Hazard: means threats to life, well-being, material goods or the environment. \n Head of centre means the person appointed in terms of either section 45 of the Act. \n Local disaster means a disaster classified as a local disaster in terms of section 23. \n Primary role means that function for which a specific identified role player is best equipped and qualified to perform. \n Recovery means decisions and actions taken after a disaster with a view to restoring or improving the pre-disaster living conditions of the stricken community, while encouraging and facilitating necessary adjustments to reduce disaster risk. \n Relief means the provision of assistance or intervention during or immediately after a disaster in order bring relief to people and communities affected by a disaster. \n Risk reduction means measures taken to reduce long-term risks associated with human activity or natural events. \n\n\n Role player means an individual or group in society that can contribute meaningfully to the implementation of disaster management. \n Secondary role means an additional function that is performed by an identified role player in support of a primary role player. \n Emergency: “Is a situation generated by the real or imminent occurrence of an event that requires immediate attention” (key words). Paying immediate attention to an event or situation as described above is important as the event/situation can generate negative consequences and escalate into an emergency. The purpose of planning is to minimize those consequences. \n Assistance: to help support affected persons with relief materials and make sure it is properly distributed amongst the people. \n1.9 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY \nThe research process for this project was tedious as it was interesting. The research methods used in this project is a descriptive research that employs survey or observational research method. Typically, the following methods where used for the research: \n The use of the library \n Site visits \n Books and foreign data review \n Case studies \n Interview and questionnaires \n Consultation with my supervisor.

It also tries to bring out the common characteristics of\nculture in various definitions which include being dynamic and\ntransmittable from generation to generation. Factors that can\ninfluence culture in a particular society and how people can\ncome into contact with the culture in a particular society and\nhow people can come into contact with the culture of another\nsociety are also highlighted. Some aspects of the Nigerian\ncultural heritage were discussed while the problems neglect of\nour culture, looking down in some aspects of our discussed,\nrecommendations on how to preserve our cultural heritage are\nmade to both individuals and Nigerian government.\n\nDEFINITION OF CULTURE\nThis name culture has different definitions. Many writers\nattach various meanings to it. Humanist, Sociologist and\nAnthropologists have different meanings to the concept of\nculture according to their orientation. Culture according to\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nEkeh (1989) is a construct with diverse application used in an\nattempt to analyze and interpret events and ideas in a broad\nspectrum of areas of society in its broadest sense. Culture\nembraces the total Repertoire of human actions which are\nsocially transmitted from generation to generation.\nCulture is a symbol of national identity of a particular\nindividual or community. This culture is a way of life of a\nparticular group of people. The way each particular groups\nmake a living, their modes of communication and\ntransportation, celebrations and festivals is an aspect of\nculture. Culture can also be viewed as the common ways of life\nshared by the members of a society, consisting of the totality\nof tools, techniques, social, institutions, attitudes, beliefs,\nmotivation and the system of value known to a group.\nCulture is manmade rather God given way of life,\nconsisting of design prescription and responses deliberately\ndeveloped or acquired by man for the purpose of guiding all\naspects of his life, in the quest to tame and subordinate his\ngiven physical environment. This embraces both man made,\nideas, feelings, artifacts, and activities.\n\nCulture should not be confused with society, while society\nis technically used to symbolize an organized group of people\ninteracting in a structural system and carrying out the activities\nnecessary to produce and sustain life, culture describes the\nbehavioural content of the society.\nCulture is essentially inseparable from society. Society is\nwhat culture make it and a culture is what society makes it.\n“Center” literary, stated is a point around which things resolve,\noften a focal point of attraction, concentration or activity, a\npoint area.\nBased on the above definition, a culture centre implies a\nplace or area of great activity involving the propagation,\npromotion, development and preservation of the various\nfeatures and pattern of the ways of life of a given people, with\nparticular reference in this case to the Owerri North people of\nOwerri, Imo State.\nThe Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary defines center\nas a place of great activities, especially one which people are\nattracted to, from the surrounding district. In line with the\nafore mentioned definitions, we go forward designing a\nbefitting complex modern cultural center for Owerri North\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\npeople was necessitated by the urgent need to reverse the\nspeed at which our culture values are being eroded. This is as\na result of sudden arrival of the whites with their system of\nworship, in the early part of the 19 th century.\n\n1.1 MOTIVATION\nWith this point mentioned above, the purpose of this\nproject is the architectural development of a suitable center\nthat will immensely enhance the effective propagation,\ndevelopment and preservation of the various culture of the\npeople of the area from the grass root and as well, provide a\nunifying enabling environment for the hosting and organization\nof all cultural activities during their annual and pre-annual\nfestivals.\nTo find these effectively, the proposed cultural center\nwould include:\n1. Provision of adequate facilities to enhance the promotion\nof the traditional recreational and entertainment activities\nof the people within the center.\n\n2. Create a befitting masterpiece of cultural center bearing in\nmind the people’s rich culture and cultural get together.\n3. Development of more suitable spaces for the propagation\nof traditional dances, wrestling activities, masquerades\nand other cultural display.\n4. Provision of facilities that will enhance the promotion and\npreservation of the various visual arts of the people of\nOwerri North.\n5. To create a good job opportunity and to develop the entire\narea, also for the promotion of the cultural activities of the\narea.\n\n1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\nAhia-gburu-ya-alawa-mgbam is the historical culture\ncenter of the nineteen (19) autonomous communities that\nmake up Owerri North namely Agbala, Akwakuma, Amakohia,\nAwaka, Azaraubo, Egbu, Emekuku, Ihiteohia, Ihitta mbaoma,\nNaze, Obibiezena, Obibi, Obube, Orji, Ulakwo and Umuakaliku.\nIt used to be the ancestral living place of the entity, called\nOwerri North, but the increasing population; they started\nspreading and expanded to where they are today. This is why\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\n“all” still come together at this spot Ahia-gburu-ya-alawa-\nmbam is the stage while in this Owerri North if the said that\nthis, it means that every community will go to their own\ncultural activities and perform their cultural festivals and\nceremonies.\nAhia-gburu-ya-alawa-mbam started being the pilgrimage\ncenter of the Owerri North people as t he said and it has being\nin an existence as far back as the year 14AD, when they were\nassumed to have first settled at this spot called Ahia-gburu-ya-\nalawa-mbam and instituted a “god” in different name by all the\nvillages in different autonomous community’s for themselves.\nYears have gone by; the center has not yet got a befitting\nedifice to show as a culture center bearing in mind that the\ncenter serves as a convergent point for all the people of Owerri\nNorth where they come together annually or any cultural\nactivities for their emume.\nThe center should therefore have an edifice that would\nshelter them under one roof. It will help bring people from\ndifferent autonomous community together by strengthening\nthe bond that had existed amongst them. The edifice should\n\nalso is the heritage of the people of Owerri North. With the\ntaking over of most cultural festival in the land by the church\nand the venue for such activities diversified, to rotate among\nthe entire autonomous communities, the remote relevance of\nsuch activities does not have strong impact on the people\nanymore.\nMy aim of this project comes through my people would\nlive to celebrate their ceremonies as of old. The will help to\nresusicate the spirit of oneness in them again in certain\nmanners.\n\n1.3 PROJECT SCOPE\nThis go for a long way by provision of a wide range of\ncultural activities such as performing arts, visual arts, research\nand publication, administration, outdoor and recreational\nactivities, carnivals etc. It is envisaged that this cultural center\nwill offer exceptional amenities to the local populace, tourists\nand scholars.\n1.4 THESIS COPE\nThe only aim of this project is in the architectural development\nof a suitable center that will largely enhance the effective\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\npropagation, development and preservation of the various\ncultures of the people. It shall be presented in the form of\nsketch drawings.\n\n1.5 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nAfter series of research and methods adopted for the successful\ncompletion of this project, I arrived on this:\n1. Establishment of good understanding and knowledge of\nthe topic chosen, the revision of appropriate literature and\ntexts on the culture and life of Owerri North people and\nother topics relatively necessary in creating the proposed\nmasterpiece.\n2. The study and evaluation of the proposed site for the\nproject and the development of the design program and\nschematic drawings.\n3. Study and appraisal of local cultural settings and\nactivities.\n4. Oral interview on the people’s way of life and their\ntraditional/cultural festivals and activities.\n\n5. Appraisal of existing cultural and foreign one as case\nstudies, coupled with the extraction of relevant\ninformation and materials from related agencies and\ninstitutions.\n\n1.6 LIMITATIONS\n1 Unavailability of aged people who can tell much culture\n\nstories much on the people and their tradition.\n\n2 Destruction of some materials, course of upgrading\n\nsuch centers.\n\n3 The inability to gather much literature materials as a\nresult of the scarcity of such cultural traditional write-\nups.\n\n4 The inaccessibility of cultural artifacts in the case\nstudies undertaken due to workers attitudes to\nresearchers. Nevertheless, every short comings\nnotwithstanding, every effort was made to make this\nproject report a perfect achievement.",

It had become abundantly dear to\ndiscerning observes of the Nigerian political science that to\nbuild enduring national unity. Nigerian youths from all ethnic\ngroups\n\n On got to be mobilized and put in the fore front of the task\nof nation building and integration and\n Patriots in, dedication to the Nigerian nation hood and\nmutual respect for and understanding of the different ethnic\ngroups that constitute the people of Nigerian ought to be\ndeliberately engineered.\nThe realization that the youths, particularly our educated\nyouths had a civilian role to play was brought vividly home to\npolicy makers during the civil war. University students at\nibadan, ife, Lagos and Anmedu Beto Craved to be conscripted\ninto armed forces during the war and thereafter, they yearned\nto play a positive role in the achievement of the objectives of\nthe three RS (Rehabilitation, Reconciliation and\nReconstruction).\nMost people accepted the imperative necessity for post\ncivil war of Nigeria to indelicate as a matter of deliberate\npolicy, the quality of leadership in her most educated and\nenlightened youths from among whose ranks leaders in all\nwalks of life are recruited most people accepted he right of the\nGovernment to promoted national unity by widening their\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nhorizon thought service in parts of the country other than those\nin which they were born, raised and educated.\nGiven the trend flat was rapidly emerging it was (and\nindeed still is) possible for a well educated Nigerian to spend all\nof his life in one state or in one part of the country without\nknowing the other part.\nThis was the trend which the NYSC scheme was set up in\nMay 1973 to arrest.\n\n1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\nA thorough study of the existing NYSC orientation camp\nor camps in the country has shown that home of them\noccupies any purpose made buildings this has constituted a lot\nof problem in the smooth- running of both the NYSC scheme\nand its administration.\nThe office spaces are too small for comfort, inadequate\nbuildings are not maintained, climatic conditions are not\nconsidered both in their orientation choice of materials etc.\nThis dissertation aims primarily at carrying out intensive\nstudy on these inadequacies in the camp and analyzing these\nsituation so as to enable me evolve a design functionally,\nstructurally and aesthetically suitable for the smooth running\nof the NYSC orientation camp, Owerri.\n\n1.3 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\nThe project is for Imo state “Imo state NYSC permanent\norientation camp.\nIt is to house the Nigeria corpers who are doing their one\nyear services in Imo state.\n\nFor more project topics and materials visit: http://www.classgist.com\nEnquiries: http://www.classgist.com/contactus.aspx\n\nIt is made up of many department and offices it will as\nwell give room for administrative works.\n\n1.4 LIMITATIONS\n\nMy limitation during this project research work was\n\nas follows;\n Uncooperative attitude of some NYSC orientation officials\nsometimes they made it in possible for me to get the needed\ninformation from them.\n The security nature of the existing ones made it impossible\nor me to take necessary pictures\n Financial constraint.",
